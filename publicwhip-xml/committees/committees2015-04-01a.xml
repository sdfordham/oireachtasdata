    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ronan Hession" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015040100002#C00200"><p>I thank the joint committee for the invitation to attend to discuss Setanta Insurance.  I am a principal officer in the financial services division of the Department of Finance and joined by Ms Antoine Mac Donncha, head of the Department's legal unit.  In my opening statement I would like to outline for the committee the role of the Department in the Setanta Insurance process thus far and explain the role of the Minister more generally in the statutory framework for insurance compensation. </p> <p>  The Minister's primary role relates to the statutory framework and funding arrangements for the insurance compensation fund which was established under the Insurance Act 1964.  The purposes of the Act are to establish the insurance compensation fund to meet certain liabilities of insolvent insurers; to provide for the making of loans to the fund by the Minister; and to provide for contributions to the fund by insurers.  The fund is maintained and administered under the control of the President of the High Court acting through the accountant for the courts of justice.  The Minister has no statutory role in the payments process or the administration of the fund.  Section 5 of the Act provides that the Minister may, on the recommendation of the Central Bank, advance from the Central Fund to the insurance compensation fund such sum as he thinks proper to enable payments from the fund to be made expeditiously.  The funds provided by the Minister are in the form of a repayable loan.  Having regard to the potential calls on the fund, the existing reserves and the expected insurance levy receipts, the Central Bank wrote to the Minister in January 2015 recommending that up to &euro;140 million would need to be advanced by him to the fund this year.  As potential calls related to Setanta Insurance could be met from existing reserves, this figure is required to cover calls by Quinn Insurance Limited related to the disposal of its UK book, as announced earlier this year.  The Minister has agreed to make a repayable loan to the fund for this amount. </p> <p>  The insurance compensation fund is, ultimately, funded by contributions from insurers.  The Insurance Act 1964, as amended, provides that the fund is funded by contributions from insurers who issue policies in respect of risks in the State, whether the insurers are based in Ireland or another member state.  Under the Act, the Central Bank has responsibility for determining whether the fund requires financial support and the level of contribution to be paid to the fund by insurers.  The contribution may not exceed 2% of the aggregate gross premiums paid to each insurer for policies issued in respect of risks in the State.  A levy in accordance with section 6 of the Act came into effect on 1 January 2012.  The Central Bank has set the levy at the maximum 2% of the aggregate gross premiums paid.  The levy is payable quarterly in arrears to the Revenue Commissioners which have responsibility for its collection and the transfer of the proceeds of the levy to the insurance compensation fund account. </p> <p>  Under section 2, the accountant for the courts of justice is required to submit an abstract on the fund&rsquo;s accounts and a report on the administration of the fund to the Minister which he must publish and lay before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The most recent published accounts relate to 2013.  They show a total owing to the Minister for Finance of some &euro;986.9 million, of which &euro;197.8 million was issued in 2013, and show insurance levies for that year of some &euro;64.7 million.  They also show outstanding amounts owed to the fund from companies placed in administration previously - Icarom, formerly the Insurance Corporation of Ireland, &euro;164 million; Primor, formerly PMPA, &euro;139 million; and Quinn Insurance, &euro;1.158 billion.  I am advised that the current balance in the fund is some &euro;96 million. </p> <p>  Having set out the Minister's role under the statutory framework, I will now explain the Department's role in the Setanta Insurance process thus far.  On 16 January 2014 the Central Bank first wrote to the Department alerting it to the concerns about the solvency margins of Setanta Insurance and advising that a potential call on the insurance compensation fund could arise.  On the same day the Maltese Financial Services Authority directed Setanta Insurance to cease writing new business.  On 16 April the Maltese regulator informed the Central Bank that Setanta Insurance had handed back its licence after the shareholders had resolved to wind up the company.  At that stage the Department's understanding was that claims not honoured by Setanta Insurance could be submitted to the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI.  On 30 April a liquidator was formally appointed to Setanta Insurance.  The Department met the liquidator's representative in Ireland and the liquidator within a week of their appointment.  At the time the Department also held meetings with senior officials in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland. </p> <p>  I should explain that the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland was established in 1955 for the purpose of compensating victims of road traffic accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  It operates under a written agreement dated 29 January 2009 between companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland and the Minister for Transport.  The Minister for Finance is not party to the agreement and has no responsibility in respect of the MIBI or the agreement.  </p> <p>  On 23 July 2014 the MIBI advised the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport that it had obtained legal advice from which it had concluded that the 2009 agreement with the Minister for Transport did not require the MIBI to satisfy awards against drivers covered by a policy of insurance where the insurer was unable to pay all or part of an award because of insolvency.  On 25 July the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Finance jointly sought the advice of the Attorney General on the question of MIBI liability.  On 1 September the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice was received, on foot of which the Minister for Finance decided to proceed on the basis that the MIBI would not be playing a role in compensating claimants due awards under Setanta Insurance policies.  On foot of this, the Department of Finance met the liquidator and the Courts Service regarding the arrangements for the processing of payments under the insurance compensation fund.  Based on the information available, the liquidator stated it was not likely that he would be in a position to meet more than 30% of the insurance claims from the assets in liquidation.  Therefore, on the basis that the insurance compensation fund might only pay out up to a maximum of 65% on an eligible individual claim, the possibility of advance payments of 65% on eligible claims to the fund was examined by the accountant.  The accountant obtained clarification on this question.  He informed the Department that, having considered legal advice on the operation of the legislation, he was satisfied that it was appropriate to make applications to the President of the High Court for approval to release moneys from the insurance compensation fund prior to completion of the liquidation of the company.  Any payment from the fund would be a once-off and final payment.  The State Claims Agency was engaged to provide support for the accountant in terms of (i) the necessary expertise required to ensure only valid claims would be paid from the insurance compensation fund and (ii) administrative support required to deal with the volume of work arising from the Setanta Insurance case.  </p> <p>  At the time the liquidator advised that he was aiming to make an application to the insurance compensation fund to meet outstanding claims early in 2015 in respect of the following categories of claims: claims where settlements had been agreed between Setanta Insurance and the claimant; claims where the Personal Injuries Assessment Board had issued orders to pay that had been accepted by Setanta Insurance and the claimant; and claims that had been the subject of court awards.  The accountant advised at that stage that he was aiming to make an application in respect of the first batch of 300 claims to the President of the High Court before end of March 2015.  On 26 March 2015 the Minister for Finance received a letter from solicitors acting for the accountant for the courts of justice.  The letter states that prior to making any application to the High Court for payment from the insurance compensation fund pursuant to the Insurance Act 1964, the accountant must be satisfied that it appears unlikely that the relevant claim can be met otherwise than from the fund.  On foot of legal advice, the accountant has decided to make an application by way of special summons to the High Court, pursuant to Order 3, Rule 22 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, for a trial of an issue of law to determine whether the MIBI is liable for claims made under policies issued by Setanta Insurance.  The letter emphasises that the accountant is anxious that this issue of law be determined without delay with a view to providing certainty for affected Setanta Insurance policy holders as soon as possible.  We have been further advised that the direction of the High Court is being sought on the appropriate parties to the trial of this issue which may include the Minister for Finance.  Obviously, this impending trial limits what I can say about any issue that may be relevant to the forthcoming judicial consideration of this matter.  However, I will endeavour to be as helpful as I can to the committee within that constraint.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.12" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Mercieca" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015040100002#C00400"><p>I thank the joint committee for inviting me.  I have gladly accepted the invitation because I hope my presence and that of my team will be of assistance to the committee.  I also hope my presence will help to facilitate an early resolution of the process in dealing with claims.</p><p>To give some background on the company, it was incorporated on 21 June 2007 in Malta and was regulated and supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority, MFSA.  The company was authorised to write the following classes of insurance business - accident, land vehicles, goods in transit, motor vehicle liability, miscellaneous financial loss and legal expenses.  The company was also authorised to sell private and commercial motor vehicle policies in Ireland in exercise of its European passport right as an insurance undertaking to provide services in terms of the relevant EU legislation and directives.  Accordingly, since 2007 the company carried out its business from its offices in Dublin.</p><p> On 23 January 2014 the board of directors resolved that, save in the case of receiving funds, the company would cease writing any new business, and offer renewals beyond the close of business on 24 January 2014.  As a consequence, at an extraordinary general meeting of Setanta held on 16 April 2014, it was resolved that the company surrender its insurance business licence to the MFSA and be immediately dissolved.  Furthermore, at a meeting of the creditors of the company held on 30 April 2014, I was appointed liquidator of the company.  The liquidation is a creditors voluntary liquidation under the provisions of the Maltese Companies Act 1995 and is, I am advised, similar to a creditors voluntary liquidation under the Irish Companies Act.</p><p> The situation I found on liquidation was that the statement of affairs drawn up by the company as at 16 April 2014 showed a deficiency, meaning net liabilities exceeding assets, slightly in excess of &euro;17 million.  The outstanding claims reserve included in the statement of affairs was &euro;28 million.  This reserve is the provision for claims that have not been paid and should include provisions both for claims which had been notified to the company and for claims which had occurred but which had not been notified to the company.  At the time of being placed in liquidation, the company had approximately 75,000 policyholders, approximately two thirds of which were commercial vehicle policies and approximately one third being private motor insurance policies.</p><p> Policyholders were immediately advised of the liquidation by means of the company website and notices in two national daily newspapers in Ireland.  They were advised that their policies would be cancelled in due course and advised to take out new policies with immediate effect.  All insurance policies were subsequently cancelled on 26 May 2014 with respect to private vehicles and 29 May 2014 with respect to commercial vehicles.  The cancellation was considered to be in the best interest of policyholders in order to avoid a situation where policyholders would continue to drive vehicles insured by the company in circumstances where their claims will not be paid in full.</p><p> I have appointed Deloitte Malta to perform a review of certain procedures and decisions on the transactions undertaken by the company in the six month period leading up to the liquidation of the company.  This review is to be carried out in connection with the requirements of the relevant provisos of the Maltese Companies Act 1995.  This review has been hampered due to the fact that details of the majority of the ultimate beneficial shareholders are not publicly available as the shareholdings are registered in the names of licensed trustees and-or nominees.  Accordingly, an application has now been made to the relevant Maltese courts to obtain the names of the ultimate beneficial shareholders from the trustees and-or nominees holding the shares and from the MFSA.  Furthermore, Deloitte Malta has been asked to perform a review of the business to assist me in obtaining an understanding of the circumstances that brought about the failure of the company.  On the basis of the draft report provided to me by Deloitte Malta, I have engaged a lawyer to review the company&rsquo;s records and relevant documentation to establish whether, in his opinion, there are grounds to suggest an action could be brought against the persons responsible for running the company.  This review is currently ongoing and I am due to have a preliminary meeting with the lawyers next week on this matter.</p><p> Upon my appointment as liquidator of the company, I proceeded with appointing the actuaries Towers Watson to review and assess the claims position and to report such assessment of the claims reserve.  Towers Watson presented its report on 3 September 2014 and subsequently issued the final report on 16 September 2014.  The report comprises an analysis of the unpaid reserves, estimates of the liability for outstanding claims at 31 May 2014 together with a valuation of the volatility of the estimate.  The report estimates the gross claim liability at &euro;67.7 million on the assumption that the claims run off is paid in line with normal circumstances.  The report further concludes that additional reserves of between &euro;20 million and &euro;27.5 million represent a reasonable estimate of the adverse development potential on future gross unpaid claims as a consequence of the company&rsquo;s liquidation.  Accordingly, the total provision for claims is estimated at between &euro;87.7 million and &euro;95.2 million.</p><p> I will provide some information on where we are today.  In active claims, on my appointment on 16 April 2014, there were 1,669 claims, which has increased by 79 to 1,748 last week.  There are 1,037 personal injury claims and 711 damage to property claims.  Of these claims, 1,265 are eligible for payment from the fund and 483 are not.  The claims estimate I referred to in the statement of affairs was &euro;28 million, which has increased to &euro;53 million as of 24 March.  This means it has almost doubled, increasing by &euro;25 million.  The basis of estimating liability for claims by the company is still based on the assumption that claims run-off is paid in line with normal circumstances and does not include any provision for adverse development potential arising as a consequence of both normal random variations in claim costs and from the impact of the company&rsquo;s liquidation.  It is pertinent to point out that, even on this basis, claims have already increased by &euro;25 million from the date of liquidation.  I have appointed Arthur Cox as my legal advisers in Ireland and the firm is co-ordinating all the court cases involving the company and liaising with other lawyers handling our cases.</p><p> There has been an increase of 201 active cases since the company's liquidation in April 2014, taking it to 619 cases.  I have prepared an estimated outcomes statement on the assumption that the liquidation process will take at least another three years to conclude.  I have also taken into account the actuarial report available to me in terms of the potential claims liability and the assets available.  Based on the above, I estimate that the amount available to creditors having insurance claims on the final liquidation of the company will not exceed 30% of the amounts due to them.  I must emphasise that this is a best estimate and the estimate could change materially as circumstances change.</p><p> On the insurance compensation fund, discussions have been ongoing with the Department of Finance and, in particular, the accountant of the courts of justice since I met his representatives on 3 September 2014 about accessing the insurance compensation fund in Ireland.  As it is the prerogative of the accountant of the courts of justice to apply to the court for access to the compensation fund, I have been working closely with him through my representative in Ireland to facilitate this process in every way possible.  Indeed, there has been a high level of co-operation between all concerned in dealing with what is a very complex issue.  I have submitted a preliminary list of claims to the accountant of the courts of justice who retained the Irish State Claims Agency to review those claims. I understand that the agency has confirmed that the claims are suitable for submission to the compensation fund.  While I have been informed that the accountant of the courts of justice had received advice that the MIBI had no role to play in compensating claimants, I understand that a contrary legal opinion has been received recently from his solicitors.  Until this matter is resolved the accountant of the courts of justice is reluctant to submit the relevant application to the Irish courts for access to the compensation fund.  While, as liquidator, I am entitled to seek access to the compensation fund, I am advised that I have no direct right of recourse to the MIBI.  Recent developments have unfortunately created a situation of uncertainty, which hopefully will be resolved speedily for the benefit of all concerned, and most especially the claimants.  I consider the positive resolution of this matter to be fundamental in unlocking the claims situation and therefore speeding up the liquidation process.</p><p>I am also advised that the equivalent compensation scheme in Malta is not available for claims against the company made by any of its policyholders and claimants.</p><p> I am obliged to hold a creditors meeting by July 2015 at which I shall present an account of my actions and dealings in winding up the company, together with a summary of receipts and payments.  It is my intention to hold this meeting in June this year.</p><p> It is not possible, unfortunately, to make an accurate prediction as to how long the liquidation proceedings will take as there are too many variables at this point, many of which are out of my control.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n Quigley" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015040100002#E00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the invitation to attend the meeting and brief the committee on the operation of the Insurance Compensation Fund, with particular reference to Setanta Insurance Company.  I am joined by Ms Denise Mullins from the accountant's office.  I am conscious of the time constraints so I will keep my opening statement as brief as possible.  However, I wish to take the opportunity to briefly outline the background to the fund, how it operates and some significant activity in managing the fund, particularly since 2011.  I will also update the committee on the current position regarding the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, relating to Setanta Insurance.<br/><br/>The Insurance Compensation Fund was established under the Insurance Act 1964 to make arrangements to meet certain liabilities of insolvent insurers.  The fund is maintained and administered under the control of the President of the High Court acting through myself, the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  Amounts are paid from the fund, with the approval of the High Court, to a person in relation to an insurer in liquidation or administration, in respect of claims under policies issued by the insolvent insurer in circumstances where it seems unlikely that the claims can be met otherwise.  In regard to claims for companies in liquidation, all payments are subject to a limit of 65% of the amount of the claim or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  The fund will also pay the full amount of legal and other costs necessarily and reasonably incurred by the person endeavouring to secure payment from the fund.<br/><br/>As was stated earlier, the Minister for Finance puts the Insurance Compensation Fund in funds where there are insufficient moneys to pay out.  From October 2011 to the end of December 2014, the State has advanced a net<b></b>&euro;833.3 million to the Insurance Compensation Fund.  The total interest charged by the Minister for Finance on amounts advanced during this period amounted to &euro;80,390,482.  The closing balance on the loan from the Minister for Finance to the fund at the end of December 2014 was &euro;913,690,482.  The current balance on the Insurance Compensation Fund is<b></b>&euro;96 million.<br/><br/>A levy was introduced in 2012 and &euro;190.3 million has been paid into the fund by the Revenue Commissioners in respect of that levy up to the end of December 2014.  I provide an annual statement on the fund to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank.<br/><br/>Furthermore, the Accountant of the Courts of Justice is, in respect of any amount paid out of the fund, a creditor of the insolvent insurer which has received the funds.  The total creditors of the fund at 31 December 2014 amounted to<b></b>&euro;1.361 billion.  The details of that have been provided to the committee.<br/><br/>To focus on some of the activity since 2011, since the introduction of the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011 there has been significant activity for the accountant&rsquo;s office in managing the fund.  I will give a brief summary of the main areas of activity.<br/><br/>In March 2010, by order of the High Court following an application by the Financial Regulator, joint administrators were appointed to Quinn Insurance Limited, QIL.  Between November 2011 and December 2014 the fund made nine payments amounting to &euro;1.158 billion to the Quinn Insurance administrators.  In 2014, the fund received &euro;100 million back, which was forwarded to the Department of Finance as part repayment of the loan.  The net payments to Quinn Insurance administrators have amounted to &euro;1.058 billion to date.  The last payment to Quinn Insurance was in November 2013, which was &euro;40 million, at which time the President of the High Court set a limit of &euro;1.158 billion<b></b>on the amount that would be paid to Quinn Insurance administrators.<br/><br/>Another claim on the fund arose in respect of Lemma Europe Insurance Company Limited, in liquidation.  Lemma Europe Insurance Company Limited is a Gibraltar registered company and the Supreme Court of Gibraltar ordered its winding-up on 24 January 2013.  In November 2013, a claimant against Lemma Europe Insurance Company wrote to my office making an application to the fund.  Our legal advisers reviewed this claim and were satisfied that it was valid.  I subsequently made an application to the High Court in July 2014 to pay out 65% of the total claim.  The amount that was paid was &euro;29,166.  The Lemma Europe Insurance Company liquidator has indicated that there are potentially 14 other claims.  However, these claims have not been settled and we are not in a position to give a value for these potential claims.  One distinction between Lemma Europe Insurance Company and Setanta Insurance is that the former did not issue motor insurance policies.<br/><br/>As the committee is aware, Setanta Insurance went into liquidation in April 2014.  It was a Maltese incorporated company.  While this company was based and regulated in Malta, all of its policies covered motor insurance risks in the Republic of Ireland.  Following Setanta Insurance going into liquidation in April 2014, the Office of the Accountant of the Courts of Justice has had significant engagement with the Department of Finance and the liquidator through his representatives in Dublin.  There were a number of legal and administrative issues to be resolved, which also required extensive engagement with our own legal advisers.  This was the first time we had to deal with an insurer in liquidation on this scale and the first time we had to deal with one that was registered in another EU state.  The processes are different compared with an insurer in liquidation registered in the State.  The essential differences are, first, it is the accountant and not the liquidator who makes application to the fund and, second, claims on the fund can only be made very six months.<br/><br/>The Setanta Insurance liquidator indicated at an early stage that there would be a significant shortfall between the funds available from the liquidation and the value of the claims.  The available funds after liquidation would not exceed 30%.  On this basis, given the cap on the payment that can be paid from the Insurance Compensation Fund of 65%, as the Accountant of the Courts of Justice, I decided to facilitate the processing of payments from the fund as soon as possible, and therefore it was agreed to make advance applications to the fund before the liquidation process was completed.  The liquidator had advised that settlements could only be paid out by him after all of the company's liabilities were quantified, including claims.<br/><br/>The legislation provides for the recovery of amounts that, in the aggregate, exceed a sum due to claimants from an insurer in liquidation in respect of a risk situate in the State.  These provisions and penalties give me, as the accountant, sufficient comfort should a situation arise where an overpayment is made.  I will only make an application to the President of the High Court where I am satisfied that claims qualify under the provisions of the applicable legislation.  To ensure this is the case, we have been working closely with the liquidator of Setanta Insurance to identify eligible claimants in accordance with the Insurance Act 1964, as amended.  I am also pleased to inform the committee that the State Claims Agency agreed to my request to provide expert advice and input that was not available within my office to validate claims before they are brought forward to the High Court. <br/><br/>The accountant's office had all of the necessary arrangements in place to deal with Setanta Insurance claims by the end of December 2014 and it was expected that the first tranche of claims would be submitted to the High Court in the first quarter of 2015.  The first tranche of claims reviewed by the State Claims Agency on my behalf included 189 claims with a value of some &euro;4 million, together with legal costs of approximately &euro;132,000.<br/><br/>There was one other matter we had to deal with in respect of the Insurance Compensation Fund in recent years.  This was a judicial review relating to an insurer, Independent Insurance Company Limited, a UK insurer that had gone into liquidation in 2001.  I refused an application for payment from the fund, as the liquidation occurred before the introduction of the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011 and, as such, the claimant was not deemed eligible under the provisions of the Act.  The claimant did not agree with this decision and initiated judicial review proceeding against the Accountant of the Courts of Justice.  This matter came to court in July 2014 and the position taken by the accountant was upheld. <br/><br/>Finally, I will address the issue of the Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, in relation to Setanta Insurance.  The issue of the possible liability of MIBI for claims from policy holders arising from the Setanta Insurance liquidation was raised with me at meetings in the Department of Finance in August and September 2014.  I was advised that MIBI was not liable.  This was confirmed in an e-mail dated 29 September 2014 from the Department of Finance.  I was informed that this position was based on the advice of the Attorney General.  While I did not receive a copy of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice, details of the key points considered by the Attorney General in arriving at the decision were provided to me by the Department.  At that stage, taking account of the Attorney General&rsquo;s advice, I had no reason to believe that MIBI was liable for Setanta Insurance claims.<br/><br/>I then proceeded, as a matter of priority, to address the legal and administrative issues that had to be resolved to enable claims to be made on the fund.</p><p>As I mentioned, we had all the necessary arrangements in place to deal with claims in December 2014.  In late January 2015 the President of the High Court received representations from the Law Society expressing serious concerns regarding the exclusion of the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, from the process of dealing with Setanta claims.  Having immediately reviewed the matter with the President of the High Court, we agreed that the matter needed to be resolved, in the interests of protecting taxpayers&rsquo; money, before we could proceed to make any payments from the fund.  As you will appreciate, the President, as the person who controls the fund, needed to be satisfied that any payments made from the fund complied with the legislation.  I immediately sought the opinion of senior counsel on the matter. That opinion was received on Thursday, 19 March 2015.  While I cannot disclose details of the opinion, I can give the committee an extract from it:<blockquote><br /><br />I believe there is an arguable case that the MIBI could have a liability in respect of Setanta claims.  It would be incumbent upon the Accountant, and ultimately the Court, to ensure that before payments can be made out of the fund, a view is formed as to whether it is unlikely that the relevant claims can be met by the MIBI before approving payments from the fund.  I do not believe that the Accountant or the Court can be satisfied of that without having the issue judicially determined.</blockquote>Arising out of that, since Thursday, 19 March 2015 I have been actively engaging with my legal advisers to progress the matter of having the issue judicially determined as soon as possible.  The President of the High Court has indicated to me that this matter will get priority in terms of scheduling of hearings.  It is hoped that it can be concluded by July 2015.  On Thursday, 26 March 2015, my legal advisers wrote to the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Minister for Finance, the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland, and the Attorney General regarding the matter.  The letter indicated that I, as the accountant of the Courts of Justice, would be making an application by way of a special summons to the High Court, pursuant to Order 3, Rule 22 of the Rules of the Superior Courts, for a trial of an issue of law to determine whether the Motor Insurers' Bureau of Ireland is liable for claims made under the Setanta policies.  My legal advisers are currently finalising this application to the High Court and I expect it will be filed during the first week of the next law term, which is the week beginning Monday, 13 April 2015.  As of this morning I have agreed the wording of the special summons, an affidavit with my legal advisers, and this will be filed very shortly with the central office in the High Court.  That is a very brief overview of what is a large and complex matter.  I am happy to take any questions from the members.</p></speech>

It certainly is a complex issue.  It is something of a mess at the moment and there is obviously quite a legal wrangle going on which is going to have an impact in terms of the liquidation and the way that claimants will be dealt with as part of this process.  First, I will go through some of the issues with the liquidator, Mr. Mercieca.  The statement of affairs which the company prepared initially in April of last year showed a deficiency of about &euro;17 million.  If we go forward to page three of his statement, the picture seems to have changed considerably, with the outstanding claims reserve at &euro;28 million.  Does Mr. Mercieca have an estimate now, in terms of liabilities versus assets, of what the deficiency is likely to be compared to the estimate of &euro;17 million almost a year ago?</p></speech>

That is based on the actuarial report from Towers Watson which took the claims reserve up to the figures I mentioned earlier.  In terms of the actual claims we have today, I also mention the projection of a &euro;25 million increase in claims estimate, based on the latest information available to me.</p></speech>

Does that &euro;35 million now equate to the gross claim liability of &euro;67.7 million?</p></speech>

I am not sure what that figure mentioned by the Deputy is, but the current claims estimate is at &euro;53 million.  That is what the company is reserving today.</p></speech>

Towers Watson reported to me in May 2014 that it projected it could go all the way up to &euro;67.7 million, with a further &euro;20 million or so in terms of further deterioration.  However, we have not got to that figure; that is the projected figure.</p></speech>

Having read the extract from the senior counsel's opinion that the Courts Service received and given the mandate within which Mr. Quigley must work, I accept that the service must exhaust the issue and get a final determination on the liability of the MIBI before it can make a payment.  What are the consequences for the fund or its role if the MIBI is found in law to have a liability?  How would it relate to liability of the ICF, which is as much as 65%?</p></speech>

The net issue is who is behind that.  This is the basis for the liquidator's application or legal work to get the courts to release those names.</p> <p>  On the second part of the Chairman's question, relating to who was responsible for supervising, the regulatory authority involved was the MFSA.  The way that the regulatory system across Europe works is that firms can get authorised in one country by their home regulator and sell business on a passporting basis into other jurisdictions.  Setanta Insurance was authorised in Malta.  Therefore, the MFSA was its home regulator.  The Central Bank was what is called a host regulator - that is, it dealt with conduct-of-business issues, the consumer interface, etc.  As to the financial position, the lead supervisor was the MFSA.</p></speech>

The questions so far have kept coming back to that.  I have two questions.  I welcome our witnesses and thank them for attending, particularly the two gentlemen who have travelled.  The directors who prepared the statement of means in April arising from the &euro;28 million have all left.  Were any of them shareholders?</p></speech>

To be technical, I have one shareholder.  It is a holding company called Setanta Holdings Limited, but I am talking about knowing the shareholders in that.  As to whether the directors are gone, their powers ceased upon the company being placed in liquidation.  It is not a question of whether they are gone.  Their involvement ceased on that date.</p></speech>

The last thing they wanted to see was this to end up in the courts which will delay payment further.  I appreciate all involved are doing everything they can to resolve this, however.</p> <p>  Given their experience in this case, what do the delegations believe needs to be done to ensure a mess of this nature is not created again?  I know it is a unique situation where an Irish company registered in Malta sold into the Irish market but went belly up.  Are there any proposals to ensure we are not in the situation again?</p></speech>

How does one ensure firms are run right in the first place?  How does one ensure regulators make sure they are run correctly?  If there is a problem, how does one ensure they are acted early so only 30% of the assets are left for the liquidation process?  If things go wrong, how does one ensure the safety nets work and do what they are supposed to do?</p> <p>  Change will kick in from January next year's with the solvency II directive, a major new directive in the insurance field.  There will be a new basis for capital requirements which will be more consistent across Europe.  These will be more risk-based and will be more robust, as everyone agrees.  There will also be an emphasis on qualitative aspects such as governance, a key issue which has been addressed upfront in other parts of the financial sector and has now been given more emphasis in the insurance sector.  There will be a greater emphasis on closer supervision across borders as there are many firms in the European market which sell insurance products across the continent or are based in one country but selling them in another.  Group supervision will be much tighter and the level of overall co-operation between supervisors will be better.</p> <p>  I have been in this committee room several times over the past several years with the Minister for Finance discussing various regulatory reforms to enhance our own Central Bank&rsquo;s powers.  We have had several historical cases in Ireland of insurance companies failing.  Up to &euro;6.5 billion of state aid has been put into European insurers over the past six years according to the European Commission.  Ireland has the ICF and we have yet to find out what its role would be if any in this case.  The payments have only gone through the initial assessment phase before actually going through any pay-out phase from the ICF.</p> <p>  Not every country has an insurance compensation fund.  There are only 11 in Europe.  In some of those, such as Germany and Poland, it is just for life assurance.  Ireland is one of the few countries that has a compensation fund which has been in place for the past 50 years.  This is a very difficult, complicated and unprecedented example which will test the ICF framework.  The Minister has asked the Department to review the framework and to report back as to whether it needs to be strengthened.  We will be doing this when there is greater clarity with the legal position concerning substantive insurance later this year.</p></speech>

While we may be one of the unique countries to have an insurance fund, it is of little comfort at this point to claimants with Setanta Insurance because they are not clear as to who will meet their claims.  Maybe it is premature given legal clarity is required around certain issues but we need to streamline the system to ensure if something happens like this in the future, we will not be in a situation into the second year where the courts have to decide on key issues which we told were resolved last year.</p> <p>  Is it the delegations' understanding that the MIBI got legal opinion itself on its own initiative to suggest that it should not be included in the scheme?</p></speech>

It will be a matter for the court to determine the four other parties which we have identified.  The Minister of Finance, the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Attorney General to decide how they will approach it.

The High Court will determine who the parties are to be.  I anticipate that the MIBI will take the lead role in any argument or opposition to the application from the Law Society of Ireland because the MIBI ultimately is the one that has the most skin in that game.  It may be that the High Court will direct that other potential parties should also be parties to it.  Our role is likely to be much more limited than the one the MIBI is going to take in that event.</p></speech>

Whatever the fund pays out, therefore, is ultimately recouped from insurers and goes back to the Minister.  If the MIBI pays out, it is also the insurers that are paying.  I want to clarify that it is not necessarily the case that the State is in or out of pocket.  Ultimately, it is the insurance companies that are paying.  Of course, if the fund pays out, it will impact on its ability to repay the Minister and the timeline because it will be paying out more.  However, what the Minister gives to the insurance compensation fund is a repayable loan.</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance is not part of the agreement, but my understanding from the MIBI is that it is not subject to the 65% limit.  I think its liability is for a third party, rather than a first party.  As regards Setanta Insurance first party or third party claims, we do not know.</p></speech>

If the Minister is a party to this claim and wins, the claimants will only receive 65% from the insurance compensation fund, whereas if he loses and the MIBI is deemed liable, the claimants could receive up to 100% outside what the liquidator will then step in with.

Leaving aside Setanta Insurance, the MIBI is not subject to the same limits.  It ordinarily pays for a third party and we do not know what its role will be.  I am not sure if it is a case of winning or losing; it is a case of clarifying what the law states.  It is a trial of law as opposed to people suing each other.  As I am not a lawyer, I probably should not go beyond this.  However, if the nub of the Deputy's question is that it does not involve a 65% cap, we will have to wait for the liquidation to take place.</p></speech>

I would be failing in my duties if I did not have this understanding and reach my own conclusions.  At this stage, it is premature to speculate whether there was wrongdoing of any sort.  I am not suggesting that there was, I am just saying that the review I have commissioned is one that I have a responsibility to do.  If I did not do it, I would be failing in my responsibilities.

Should we be looking at our regulations in this area?</p></speech>

As I outlined to Deputy Pearse Doherty, a complete overhaul is taking place.  From January 2016, that will become effective and should make the system much stronger.  We have also enhanced our domestic regulator, the Central Bank.  The Central Bank has done its own review internally of its own procedures and is stepping up the management information it requires from insurers, especially looking at brokers and more on-site inspections of brokers.</p><p> The Central Bank tends to do risk-based supervision.  Brokers, being quite small by comparison, up to now were possibly not as high-risk.  They have tried to correct for that.  Setanta was operating about 230 brokers, so it was a sizeable company in terms of the market.  They are paying greater scrutiny in that respect.</p><p> There is a need to ensure the regulatory system is fully kitted out to deal with this type of problem.  It will still be a European system and will rely on good co-operation.  The good co-operation exists and there is no reason to suggest there is a breakdown.</p><p> In this case, looking at how the problems at Setanta came to a head, it goes back to September 2013 when the Central Bank asked a straight question of the Maltese whether Setanta was solvent.  The Maltese came back with the solvency certificate to say it was meeting its minimum requirements.  The bank brought it a step further, did a sample of claims from the office in Blanchardstown and raised the question of the level of reserving.  That was challenged by the Setanta directors at the time, and in fairness to the Maltese, they got Grant Thornton Malta, I think, the auditors of Setanta, to do a review.  They came back and said it was a little bit short on reserving but not materially so.  The bank pressed further and got an independent assessment, and at that stage, coming up to December 2013, a more serious question was emerging.  There was a level of persistence from the Central Bank, and in spite of the objections from the directors, the Maltese and the Central Bank kept pressing to get the answer.  It was  from there that the first direction came in January, I think on 16 or 24 January, to stop writing new business.  There was then a period of months where the Maltese were pressing the Setanta directors to raise capital.  There were a couple of bidders in the frame who dropped out about 11 April, roughly a week before the company was liquidated.</p><p> It is always important to ensure there is connectivity around a system.  The system in insurance is global so if there is not co-operation between supervisors, it cannot work.  In this case, a quite detailed report was given to the committee last July from the Maltese regulator which sets out those steps and brings out the level of interaction that can happen in a case like this.</p></speech>

We all need to remember that behind this story there are many victims of accidents and crashes.  There are people who suffered very serious injury.  One Deputy mentioned that a fatality was involved in one accident.  I do not know the detail.  People are out of pocket and people's livelihoods have been destroyed in some cases.  These are ordinary tradesmen.  There are major consequences.  If we can do anything as a committee or Parliament to help the liquidator's work in bringing this to a conclusion, it should let us know.  Perhaps we can raise matters with the Government and the appropriate Minister, or there may be legislative matters.  The witnesses would find willing support here.</p></speech>

I wrote to the financial regulator in Malta last year and I am thankful that I received a response.  It stated very clearly that the Maltese financial regulator at the time directed Setanta to cease with immediate effect in carrying out any new or renewal of contracts of insurance, as of close of business of 24 January 2014.  Following inquiry with the company as to the number of live policies in its book and expiry dates of these policies, it transpired that a number of live policies from Setanta extended to March 2014.  This, in effect, means the company continued to renew insurance policies after 24 January 2014.  Is there any possibility that those policyholders will be able to claim under the liquidation process?</p></speech>

Under the conditions it has entered into with the 2009 agreement with the Department, anyone paid by the MIBI would have the potential for the MIBI to reclaim the amount from a future insurance policy.  If the individual mentioned by Mr. Mercieca were paid &euro;1 million as a third-party claimant, the MIBI could recover that amount by a levy on a new policy.  Are the witnesses aware of this or concerned by it?  The policyholders who may be paid by the MIBI, depending on the court judgment, could see all the payments recovered by the MIBI.</p></speech>

That was my understanding of the way one might pursue somebody.  In response to what has been described by the Deputy, I was unaware of that interpretation but we will reflect on the matter.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.272" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1097" speakername="Brendan Howlin" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015040100002#O00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for facilitating a debate on two orders under the Freedom of Information 2014 - a new Act that we debated at some length.</p> <p>  One order provides for a different effective date for certain bodies under freedom of information, as I indicated would happen.  The second order provides for exemptions from FOI in whole or in part for certain bodies.  Both of these orders are to be made under section 6 of the Freedom of Information Act and require a positive resolution of both Houses before they are made.  That is the reason I am here today.  I shall deal first with the effective date order.</p> <p>  In the context of FOI, effective date means the retrospective date back to which records are available once an FOI body becomes subject to FOI.</p><p>It is about how far back one looks.  Section 2 of the Freedom of Information Act 2014 provides that in the case of a body that was not subject to FOI legislation under the 1997 Act but is subject to it under the new Act, the effective date is 21 April 2008, unless provision is made to the contrary by order under this subsection.  We debated that issue for some time.  My Department received a number of applications from public bodies requesting that I set a later effective date for the application of FOI legislation to their organisations.  I considered these applications very carefully.  It was always my intention that any change in the standard provisions in relation to a retrospective date would be agreed in respect of only a small number of bodies where there was a clear justification for having an exceptional date.  Therefore, the only applications I agreed to and that I propose the Oireachtas agree to are in respect of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, for which I propose an effective date of 14 October 2014, the date of enactment of the legislation, and the Private Residential Tenancies Board, for which I propose an effective date of 21 April 2012 to coincide with the time when that body moved to electronic operation.</p><p> I want to explain the rationale for those decisions.  These organisations hold large volumes of information, the bulk of which is personal in nature.  Where records created before the effective date relate to personal information on the person seeking access to them, the effective date does not apply.  When a person is looking for information on himself or herself, the effective date does not apply as he or she is entitled to access such records back to whatever date on which they were created.  My agreement to an effective date of 21 April 2012 in respect of the Private Residential Tenancies Board and 14 October 2014 in respect of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal does not, therefore, affect this provision.  The bulk of non-personal FOI requests these organisations expect to receive relate to third party requests for access to personal information.  Given the nature and sensitivity of the personal information involved in respect of the commissioner and the tribunal, we must give these matters very careful consideration.  It is difficult to envisage circumstances where there would be a compelling public interest in the release of such records to third parties.  However, if the records were to remain subject to release under FOI legislation, each individual record would be subject to review, giving rise to a substantial administrative burden on the organisations concerned.  That is why I have given the effective dates as set out.</p><p> I move on to the bodies I propose be exempt in whole or in part.  As the committee is aware, a generic definition of what constitutes a public body was included in the 2014 Act.  This enables FOI legislation to apply to the widest possible definition of public body.  Instead of making orders to apply FOI legislation to bodies as happened under the 1997 Act, the new approach means that an order is needed if a body is to be exempt.  The default position now is that a body is in, unless by order of the Houses it is out.  The old order was that every body was out until it was put in.  My Department has received a number of applications for exemptions from FOI legislation and they have been considered very carefully.  I have only approved exemptions where it is clear that the application of FOI legislation to these bodies in whole or in part would affect their ability to perform their core functions or affect the security or financial interests of the State.  The exemptions I am proposing to the committee and, subsequently to the D&aacute;il and the Seanad cover six bodies.  I am only proposing a full exemption from FOI legislation for two of these bodies.  I am proposing to exempt only certain records of another three.  A technical change is being proposed to the exemption already included in the Act in respect of schools to reflect the original policy I set out when the legislation was going through the Houses.</p><p> I will first deal with full exemptions.  The bodies for which I am proposing a full exemption from FOI legislation are the Irish Red Cross and the Shannon Group.  The Irish Red Cross conforms to the generic definition of a public body because it was established under enactment and would be automatically due to come under FOI legislation in mid-April.  I accepted the case made by the Department of Defence that the inclusion of the society for FOI purposes represented an anomaly in that it had to be established under legislation to ensure, in accordance with the Geneva Convention, only one Red Cross society could exist in the State.  It is a charitable organisation operating in an environment where both Exchequer resources and charitable donations have been reducing in recent years.  The application of FOI legislation would represent a cost for the body which would require a diversion of resources.  The application of FOI legislation to bodies in receipt of Exchequer funding, including the Irish Red Cross, will be considered in the context of section 7 of the Act once the application of the Act to this round of public bodies has bedded down.  Members will recall that we debated this issue at some length during the passage of the Act.  In this way I would not be imposing an administrative burden on the Irish Red Cross as compared to other national and international independent charitable and humanitarian bodies based in this country that are not included as public bodies for the purposes of the Act.  I hope that is not too convoluted a way to put it.  In other words, charitable bodies in general will be looked at under section 7.  The Irish Red Cross is an anomaly because of its unique nature.  It is deemed to be a public body having been created under statute as required under the Geneva Convention.</p><p> I turn to the other exempt body.  The State Airports (Shannon Group) Act 2014 provided for the establishment of the Shannon Group as a commercial company under the Companies Acts and the subsequent transfer of both the Shannon Airport Authority and the restructured Shannon Development which was renamed Shannon Commercial Enterprises to the group.  Consistent with the broader policy approach which we debated at some length and which I have been consistent in supporting, commercial State bodies such as the Shannon Group should not be subject to FOI requirements because of the uneven competitive playing field this would create as compared to privately owned competitors which are not subject to FOI legislation.  Given the very important responsibilities assigned by the Government to the Shannon Group in terms of regional development of the mid-west region, it is critical to ensure the organisation is able to operate without commercial disadvantage.</p><p> I will now deal with exemptions in part.  I am proposing an exemption from FOI legislation for the newly established Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI, in respect of certain specific classes of sensitive records because of the very high standard of banking confidentiality expected by market counterparts in respect of such an organisation.  I have been advised by the Minister for Finance that if such an exemption was not provided, there would be a real risk that potential funders, on-lenders and clients of the SBCI would not engage with it and that its capacity to perform its functions would be severely curtailed.</p><p> I am proposing two exemptions in respect of records of the NTMA, reflecting recent legislative developments of which it was not possible to take account up to now.  The NTMA (Amendment) Act 2014 conferred new legal cost claims management functions on the NTMA in considering and adjudicating on bills for costs presented for payment by third parties awarded their costs by the Mahon and Moriarty tribunals.  These functions were previously carried out by the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and attracted an exemption from FOI legislation.</p><p>It is necessary for an identical exemption to be granted to the NTMA in respect of records associated with these functions in view of the fact that they are performed by the NTMA on behalf of the Attorney General.  </p><p> The NTMA also has functions in relation to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  I have set out the case for putting in place certain specific exemptions for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland to meet market requirements applying to banking confidentiality.  The NTMA has been conferred with certain functions under the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland Act 2014.  For the same reasons, these records need to be protected when held by the NTMA in the performance of its functions under the Act.  The exemption I am proposing for the NTMA in this regard is a mirror image of the exemption for the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.</p><p> The third exemption relates to Oifig Choimisin&eacute;ir na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la.  Exemptions from FOI legislation are proposed for Oifig Choimisin&eacute;ir na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la in respect of records relating to the monitoring of compliance by public bodies and investigations under the Official Languages Act 2003 in order that the office is treated for FOI purposes in a way that is consistent with the approach applied to other ombudsman's offices.  Oifig Choimisin&eacute;ir na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la operates as an ombudsman in respect of the provision of services through Irish by public bodies.</p><p> Consistent with the broader policy approach adopted under the FOI Act, schools with boards of management are already exempt from FOI legislation under the 2014 Act.  I am proposing a technical change to the exemption in the draft order to ensure all schools, other than education and training board schools, will remain exempt from FOI legislation.</p><p> I am satisfied that the orders I am proposing are limited, modest and necessary for the reasons I have outlined.  They are also consistent with the line I have taken throughout the significant debate we have had on completely remodelling the FOI Act to restore many provisions of the 1997 Act and strengthen it even beyond this.  The committee will appreciate that, while previously FOI legislation only applied to bodies explicitly scheduled, every body is now in unless it is out.  The relevant Ministers have given their consent to the provisions of both orders and most of them, in fact, sought the changes.  I look forward to hearing comments members have to make and replying to questions that might arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.275" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015040100002#Q00200"><p>I am shocked that we are here after the trumpeting of the introduction of freedom of information legislation.  We are proceeding to unravel freedom of information legislation.  We are introducing new exemptions and changing effective dates.  It is a serious rowing back, a U-turn on the promise to reform and expand freedom of information legislation.  This raft of changes introduces secrecy in a range of areas that were intended to come under the freedom of information legislation when it was announced.  It <font color="#2F2F2F">excludes the performance of the new Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, certain aspects of the National Treasury Management Agency, the entire Shannon Group, the Irish Red Cross and investigations by An Coimisin&eacute;ir Teanga.  It also restricts the effective date for the Private Residential Tenancies Board and the effective date for making information available from the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  It amounts to eight restrictions being introduced today.  I had hoped the Minister would expand freedom of information legislation, not curtail it.  This is a serious change in approach and I cannot contemplate how we can support it in the D&aacute;il tomorrow.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  We received a briefing note on the effective date.  I heard what the Minister had to say about the effective date and retrospective requests for information.  He is changing the effective date in respect of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal to last October.  The briefing note we received from the Department in the context of the motion to be taken in the D&aacute;il contained a paragraph which was left out by the Minister today.  The note states, &quot;In the case of the refugee bodies an additional concern communicated by the Department of Justice and Equality is that third party FOI requests would have the potential to delay judicial reviews of the organisations' decision making, giving rise to significant additional cost and direct provision&quot;.  That is the real reason for the change, but the Minister studiously dropped that sentence from his statement today.  Some will agree with him, but I did not think he was in the position where he wanted to send people home earlier and not allow them the full protection of the law applying in Ireland.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  On potential judicial delays, I understand third parties who might request this information are probably the legal teams acting on behalf of the individuals concerned, rather than the persons themselves.  The legal adviser would be seeking information on other cases and how matters were dealt with in the past.  As that information might have helped them with the judicial reviews, it seems the Minister is bringing forward this change to help the Department to defeat applicants in cases of judicial review.  He really let the cat out of the bag in the briefing note from the Department of Justice and Equality, which shows that his aim was to reduce the significant costs associated with direct provision, meaning we can send people home earlier.  There is a market for that action, but I did not think it was the Labour Party's.  New parties around town might agree with it, but I did not think the Minister was in that camp and I am shocked that he is going down the road of reducing direct provision system costs and reducing people's ability to seek a judicial review.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  There is also a change to the retrospective date for the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  Again, we received a note from the Department on the matter.  It stated the organisation would be too busy handling the new deposit scheme which involved a significant amount of additional work.  It also stated something which was left out of the Minister's statement today, namely, that the Private Residential Tenancies Board was in the process of taking on significant additional responsibilities in taking security deposits.  These will come to approximately &euro;1,000 per tenancy and relate to 300,000 tenancies.  The board will be dealing with the regulation of approved housing bodies, approximating to 28,000 households, and there is a concern that the resource implications of full retrospection of FOI </font>legislation<font color="#2F2F2F"> to 2008 may encompass large numbers of files which would have the potential to impact adversely on the organisation's ability to successfully discharge these roles.  The briefing note stated the body would be very busy in dealing with all of the new deposits and setting up the new system and that it could not possibly be expected to deal with FOI requests.  I do not think the board has started to take deposits yet and do not think the legislation has even been finalised yet.</font></p><p><font color="#2F2F2F">  The Minister could have taken another option.  A couple of weeks ago he pushed the effective date for EirGrid back from April 2015 to the end of October and that would have been a more honourable way of doing it.  If the Private Residential Tenancies Board would have had an administrative problem for six months, the right thing to have done would have been to give it an extra six months.  I do not know for how many other bodies the Minister did this.  I only came across the information because EirGrid was a big issue in my constituency and I received it by way of a parliamentary question.</font></p><p> On the Irish Red Cross, the Minister might have a point.  I do not know, but I understand that organisation is in some turmoil.  That is probably the real reason for this and if it is, we would be happier if the Minister said that.  I am aware that several senior positions have not been filled but the Minister said he intends bringing this in under freedom of information, FOI, legislation in due course.  I do not understand why we are taking it out now only to bring it back in later.</p><p> I have an issue with exempting the State Claims Agency from this process because nothing can be disclosed.  Adjudicating on bills and costs is essentially an administrative function.  There are no legal implications here.  It has nothing to do with the substance of the cases before the various tribunals.  My view is that if there is an area where there should be more transparency it should be with regard to considering how bills and costs presented for payment by third parties awarded costs by tribunals are being adjudicated on.  It is shocking that the Minister wants to put a veil of secrecy over an area that should come under this proposal, even though they are working for the Attorney General.  That is an administrative area that should be subject to FOI.</p><p> There might be a valid case to be made regarding the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland in terms of who will lend money, who it will lend money onto and market confidentiality.  Various ombudsman offices are already subject to the Freedom of Information Act.  The Minister said he is making Oifig Choimisin&eacute;ir na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la consistent with that.  He might explain where it is currently inconsistent and how it will be made consistent with the other ombudsman offices.</p><p> The Minister might have a point on the School Exemptions Board.  Generally, however, I am very disappointed that he, as a Labour Party Minister in government, is bringing forward some of these proposals to prevent people in the asylum process getting information that could help them with their judicial review.  There is also the underlying issue of the cost of direct provision, and the issue of the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  We would be better off giving them another six months to get their houses in order internally rather than changing the effective date, which will apply from now on.  </p><p> I have asked for some clarification on one or two points but it is not a question and answer session.  I have read the briefing note but I disagree with the approach being taken.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.277" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1008" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015040100002#R00200"><p>I broadly share the concerns expressed by Deputy Fleming.  I appreciate that the new regime differs in as much as bodies have to be exempted.  That is the right approach.  However, I am not convinced by the Minister's proposals before us.  Above all, I am alarmed in terms of the change of effective date, particularly in respect of refugee bodies.  My position on the issue of direct provision is that I want to see it abolished.  I want to see cases dealt with appropriately and lawfully and an end to the practice where people spend years in these centres.  Children spend their entire school careers coming and going in these centres.  The abuses of people's rights, and I put it as strongly as that, are very well documented and it is a scandal that has slowly built and unfolded under our eyes.  The system in this State knows it is happening yet it is allowed to continue.  It is scandalous.  I acknowledge that there is a working group working on this area.  I hope that working group manages to abolish direct provision sooner rather than later.</p> <p>  The reason I am deeply alarmed by any limitation being put on access to information in respect of these bodies is because if ever there were a process and a system that is veiled in secrecy and a lack of clarity, it is the process of refuge and asylum in this State.  We have an archaic and opaque system that leaves people who find themselves in the midst of that system utterly at sea, often with virtually no support, and in many cases very little information.  The Minister might respond by saying that individuals will still have access to their own files.  I accept that, but the oversight of third party bodies in respect of this system in particular is essential, and it is wrong for the Minister to introduce this change in terms of effective date.  I do not doubt that the line Department in question made the request.  That does not surprise me one little bit, but I believe the Minister is making a big mistake in agreeing to it, and it is certainly something I could not countenance supporting.  It is simply wrong, and I put it to the Minister in those strong terms.  However, I do not believe it is an effort by the Minister or the line Minister to necessarily deny people their legal rights, which is a concern of Deputy Fleming's.  I believe it is more that the system is so banjaxed that there has been, and the track record reflects this, a strategy of information containment and keeping things in the dark, and what the Minister is proposing here today adds to that trend.  That is most worrying and disappointing, and I ask him to take that particular proposal off the table.  Of any issue the Minister has come to committee looking for our assent, this is the most worrying of all of them.</p> <p>  In respect of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, I will tell the Minister my experience of that organisation.  It is a miracle if they answer the telephone.  They are horribly under-resourced and anybody who has to interact with them can tell the Minister that at first hand.  I do not know if other Deputies have had that experience.  When one eventually gets through to them I find them helpful, professional and courteous, in fairness to their staff, but it is very clear that they are under-resourced.  I do not accept that they should have this limitation in respect of FOI afforded to them.  It is a fact, and I accept that they need more staff and more resources, but I am sure all of us in our various constituencies can confirm that, increasingly, there is a huge volume of people presenting in respect of disputes with landlords.  It may be most acute in the city of Dublin where property prices are increasing, and rents have increased approximately 9% in the last period.  The problem is very acute.  This is a body that as we speak is difficult to get in contact with.  People report it is difficult to get interactions with its staff.  I believe that is a resource issue.  Others might have a different view but given the sensitivity of this whole area now I see no argument in policy terms or good practice to limit access to information through this body.  On the contrary, we should be looking to resource it more effectively and to make information flow more easily.</p> <p>  I take the Minister's point in respect of the exemption of some of the public bodies.  With the exception of the Oifig Choimisin&eacute;ir na dTeangacha Oifigi&uacute;la, I would have thought there are already sufficient checks and balances within the legislation in respect of information that might be deemed to be commercially sensitive.  The Minister might recall that during the passage of the legislation we had endless debates on what was and was not commercial sensitivity.  It strikes me that those provisions protect those legitimately sensitive areas the Minister identifies.  The Commissioner might be a different kettle of fish.  I accept the Shannon Group is in line with the Minister's thinking in respect of other commercial semi-State entities.  We had that debate here.</p><p>I see the logic of where the Minister is coming from in that instance.  I am not sure about the Irish Red Cross.  My concern relates mainly to the National Treasury Management Agency, the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland and the State Claims Agency.  I do not accept that the Minister has presented a conclusive argument for the action he is taking.  The change that alarms me most is the changing of the effective dates, particularly as they pertain to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal.  It is a mistake to do that.  If the Minister listens to nothing else I have said today, I ask him to take that point on board and withdraw that particular proposal.  It is simply wrong and will make what is a bad situation a whole lot worse.</p></speech>

Does he have any information, in so far as it relates to the Oireachtas, as to whether there has been increased usage of the Act since it was enhanced?  If so, has it been for the purposes of establishing complex and substantive policy issues, or what has been the nature of it?</p></speech>

It speaks volumes as to how we are in a whole new regime in that the freedom of information provisions now apply to everybody unless this committee discusses exceptions and both Houses agree to them.  That has transformed the system.  I do my best not to be discordant but it is difficult to listen to lectures from Deputy Fleming on broadening the application of freedom of information.  I am confident that the 2014 Act we enacted as an Oireachtas last year will stand the test of time.  It is already regarded as one of the best internationally, unlike the 2003 Act which eviscerated the good work done in 1997.  As I outlined, the changes I am proposing fall into two categories.  I am changing the retrospective date applying to a couple of organisations for very practical reasons.  One of the points we made right through the debate on freedom of information was that we must avoid, within reason, creating burdens that are just too much for any organisation.  These are modest changes involving a couple of organisations out of the many hundreds of bodies that are now subject to FOI.</p> <p>  Deputies Fleming and McDonald focused on the slight movement of the date for the retrospective application of FOI to the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner and the Refugee Appeals Tribunal, and there was a suggestion that I did not convey the full briefing note in this regard.  That note is as comprehensive as we can make it given that I have been asked by the clerk to confine my comments to ten minutes.  One has to do some editing in such circumstances.  Either I restrict the quantum of information I give in a briefing note or I exceed the instructions as to the time allocated.  I cannot do both and it is important to give members as much information as I can.  Of course I have an absolute focus on ensuring the refugee bodies deal with applications as expeditiously as possible.  I am obliged to heed them and their parent Department when they say that if there is too much backdating and we divert personnel to the processing of FOI rather than the processing of applications, then there will be a negative impact for asylum seekers who need to have their case heard and, where there is a coherent case to be made, need to have their applications approved so they can get on with their life rather than being caught in direct provision.</p> <p>  I share Deputy McDonald's concern regarding the direct provision system.  As she knows, the Government has established a review group and the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, will report on that matter very shortly.  The Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner estimates that the number of records it holds amounts to 4 million, including paper files and databases, both live and archived.  We are going back to 2012 in all of this but any individual who has a concern about his or her own records will not be affected by the change.  All individuals will be able access their own records.  Likewise, a lawyer acting on behalf of an individual will not be debarred from accessing that person's records.</p> <p>  I am conscious that staff have been squeezed both in the refugee area and in the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  All such public bodies have been subject to recruitment embargoes in recent times.  We have had to deploy staff more effectively in an effort to save money and reduce the public sector pay bill, as people were advocating for.  The burden we place on personnel must be very carefully measured in the public interest.</p></speech>

The outworking of this legislation on FOI, which is, by international acknowledgment, ground-breaking and world class, will change the whole way in which bodies become subject to FOI such that they will be automatically included as opposed to being automatically excluded unless specifically included.  However, we do have to have some discernment as to what is practical in terms of bringing in this whole raft of new bodies for the first time.  As I said, in the case of the Office of the Refugee Applications Commissioner we are talking about 4 million files.  Individuals will have access to their own records without let or hindrance, but we must apply a commencement date in respect of any third party looking for any file if we are to avoid placing an undue burden on the organisation.  It is just disingenuous and wrong for people to claim this in any way impacts negatively on the processing of applications.  Any individual will have access to his or her records, as will a lawyer acting on his or her behalf.  That is the point.</p></speech>

All of these things are fully encompassed in this comprehensive legislation.</p> <p>  On the Private Residential Tenancies Board, I am, again, applying an effective date of 2012.  I picked that date and not 2011 or 2013, for instance, because it is the year in which the board began to gather data electronically.  Before that, it operated a paper-based system, processing some 1.2 million paper-based records annually.  The workload of the PRTB is heavy and intensive, with 300,000 registrations per annum, 150,000 individual landlords to deal with and 635,000 tenants.  Despite Deputy McDonald's difficulty in getting through, I am advised that the board dealt with 54,000 telephone calls in 2013.  Clearly, somebody's calls are being answered.  One must take a practical decision as to whether it is reasonable to say that the date from which the board began gathering data electronically should be the effective date, or if one should put a burden on the board such that it would have to search 1.2 million paper-based files manually for each year prior to that date.</p><p>The answer is if it is the person's own file then he or she will have to do that, but not for a third party.  That is a reasonable position.  I have argued throughout the debate that I want to be as comprehensive as I can be, but the approach must be tempered by some semblance of reasonableness in order that we do not kill off organisations by putting a burden on them that simply stops them from functioning effectively.</p><p> To be clear on the position in response to the question posed by Deputy McDonald on An Coiminis&eacute;ir Teanga, the coiminis&eacute;ir has exactly the same status as any other ombudsman.  The effect of the motion will put the office in exactly the same position as other ombudsman offices.  In other words, the administrative files relating to the office will be subject to FOI but how it deals with individual cases is not.  Have I been too long, Chairman?</p></speech>

This meeting provides an opportunity for members to discuss the recently launched Government policy for Ireland's diaspora.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as they cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee rooms.  As members are aware, today's meeting is being broadcast live on television on the Oireachtas channel.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>i</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Without any further delay I call my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Deenihan, who has done a very good job since becoming Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  He is the Government's first such Minister of State, and in the past nine months he has travelled the world meeting Irish people and making connections.  The recently launched policy is a result of the many meetings he had with the diaspora throughout the world.  They have played an important role for Ireland, particularly in terms of its economic recovery, and it is important to cherish them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.313" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015040100002#B00200"><p>I am delighted to be here this morning.  I thank the Chairman for the invitation to address the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade and to update it on the recent launch of Global Irish: Ireland&rsquo;s Diaspora Policy, and my plans for its implementation over the next two years.  This morning I intend to present some of the key elements of the policy and highlight some of the actions I will implement.  Throughout the policy we reiterate our desire for feedback and comment.  At the outset I want to stress that I am looking forward to the members' feedback, and I especially hope they will remain interested and involved throughout the implementation process in a meaningful way.</p><p>Two key themes emerged from the consultation process we undertook for this policy: representation and communication.  Under representation, there were clear demands for the creation of a post of Minister for the diaspora, and in July 2014 this was responded to with my own appointment.  There were also demands for voting rights in Irish elections for the Irish overseas.</p><p>Regarding presidential elections, the Constitutional Convention, in its fifth report, recommended extending voting rights in presidential elections to citizens outside the State, including those in Northern Ireland.  This would certainly be welcomed by the Irish overseas.  Since my appointment, I have travelled extensively, and the message from our citizens overseas is consistent.  They want to actively express their connection to Ireland and play a more active role in Irish society, and they believe that voting would give meaning to that desired connection.  However, it is not straightforward.  There are a number of policy, legal and practical issues that have to be thoroughly considered.  The Government has asked the Minister, Deputy Kelly, in co-operation with the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, and myself, to analyse these issues and report back to Government, and that is what we will do.</p><p>The other key theme which emerged from the consultation process was communication.  There were calls for the Government to communicate more, and more effectively, with those who have left Ireland, and to facilitate communication among Irish communities around the world.  With modern technology it is more possible than ever to engage with Irish communities globally.  People told us they want to feel connected and they want the Government to play an active role in achieving that.  The communications technology advances in the past ten years have given us the tools.  It is up to us to use them.  Since my appointment I have met with some of the technology and social media companies based in Dublin, including Microsoft, Google, LinkedIn and Twitter, and I will meet with Facebook tomorrow to discuss how it can support us in better connecting with our people overseas.</p><p>We have also started developing a range of communication tools designed to reach different people in different places with different interests and needs.  For example, we have launched an online global Irish portal, which is an easy-to-access source of information on how to remain connected to Ireland through sport, heritage, culture and media.  The portal also provides information on the supports available to the Irish overseas, including information on the emigrant support programme, business supports and information about returning home to Ireland, and is available to view on <i>www.dfa.ie/global-irish</i>.  We will increase our social media presence, initially through our @Globalirish Twitter account, allowing our Irish abroad to interact with us in a direct and immediate way.  Also, we are finalising the details of the new global Irish media fund to support media coverage of diaspora and emigration-related experience.</p><p>The policy is also wider than those two broad themes.  We want to support the diaspora, connect with the diaspora, facilitate diaspora engagement, recognise the diaspora and continue to evolve the policy to meet changing diaspora needs.</p><p>I will now highlight some of the actions under those themes.  In 2014, we provided almost &euro;12 million in financial support to over 200 organisations working with emigrants and the diaspora in over 20 countries spread over five continents.  Funding is delivered through the emigrant support programme, ESP, which has provided &euro;125 million in grant assistance since its inception in 2004.  The new policy confirms that welfare will remain at the heart of the ESP.  We will also pay particular attention to vulnerable groups such as aging communities, Travellers, prisoners, the undocumented and those with mental health needs.  In budget 2015, funding for the ESP was maintained at &euro;11.5 million, with an additional &euro;1 million for new diaspora projects and initiatives.</p><p>I have already outlined some of our communication strategy, which falls under the pillar of connecting with the diaspora, but our links are also strengthened by our language, music, dance, sport, literature and so on.  As we are all aware, more than any other aspect of our Irishness, our culture reaches all corners of the world.  It is one of the most effective ways of connecting with the global diaspora, strengthening links to home and maintaining expression of Irish identity through generations.  St. Patrick&rsquo;s Day is one focal point, but throughout the year Irish sports and cultural organisations maintain that connection.  The Government will continue to support them and provide the necessary infrastructure to facilitate their work.</p><p>This year, we will also support our diaspora in commemorating the creation of the Irish State.  Many of the 1916 leaders were part of the diaspora at different times in their lives, some having been born abroad and others having lived overseas.  We want to remember the role the diaspora played in those events and in the founding of our State.  We also want to support initiatives that connect our diaspora more locally to home.  While the county associations are not as strong as they were, the connection to place remains.  We will support local authorities and local community development committees in seeking to identify initiatives for building these relationships.</p><p>To facilitate diaspora engagement, we will work in partnership with various organisations which aim to make lives better for Irish people at home and abroad.  These organisations can reach people in ways that we simply cannot - for example, the Emigrant Services Advisory Committee and Irish in Britain in the UK, the GAA worldwide, and the Coalition of Irish Immigration Centres in the United States.  In June of this year we will convene our first Global Civic Forum to bring these and other organisations together to discuss the challenges facing the Irish abroad and to capture the voice of ordinary Irish emigrants.  This year, 2015, will also see the fourth Global Irish Economic Forum, which will bring together members the Global Irish Network.  The network has played a significant role in contributing to Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and in rebuilding our economic reputation.  We will ensure that the 2015 forum will have better gender balance and greater participation from younger people.</p><p>The Government will also continue to support Irish business networks around the world.  These networks vary in reach and composition but they all help Irish business people and professionals to connect with each other, seek out new opportunities and, ultimately, advance themselves and their businesses, and we will continue to facilitate that success.  For example, we support the Irish International Business Network, IIBN, in delivering the Irish Executive Mentoring Programme, an online mentorship tool that matches experienced mentors with up-and-coming entrepreneurs and business executives among the diaspora.  Just last week I was delighted to host IIBN in Iveagh House, and the success stories were inspiring.  We had real evidence, in the form of contracts won, proving the value of our support for networks such as IIBN, which are fostering the next generation of Irish business people overseas.</p><p>There are already some initiatives in place that recognise the diaspora.  The Presidential Distinguished Service Award for the Irish Abroad was initiated by the Government in 2012.  It provides recognition by the President of persons living abroad who have given sustained and distinguished services to Ireland or to Irish communities abroad.  So far, 30 remarkable individuals have been honoured, and we are now welcoming nominees for the 2015 awards; the closing date is 22 April.</p><p>There are so many Irish people doing great things all over the world and the awards offer an opportunity to recognise them.  I take this opportunity to encourage members of the committee to consider nominating eligible candidates from their own international networks through the embassy in the country in which those individuals are resident.</p><p> We also have the Certificate of Heritage scheme, which is an acknowledgement of the importance the Government attaches to recognising people of Irish descent.  Uptake of the certificate has been disappointing, with fewer than 3,000 certificates having been produced to date.  In 2015 we will undertake an evaluation of the operation of the certificate scheme.</p><p> This policy will continue to evolve.  We want to be responsive to real need.  Therefore, I remain open to new ideas so that the policy can evolve to meet changing needs in changing times.  We will also try to build better and stronger links with alumni from Irish institutions overseas, as they have enormous potential for the institutions and for Ireland as a whole.  In 2015 we will launch an alumni challenge fund to provide seed funding to new collaborative initiatives by Irish institutions to target their Irish and non-Irish graduates working internationally.</p><p> That was just a small taste of some of the actions contained within our new policy.  The implementation of those will be overseen by an interdepartmental committee that I will chair.  This committee will ensure a whole-of-Government approach, will report to Government on progress and will review the implementation fully after two years.</p><p> I thank committee members for the opportunity to address them this morning.  I am grateful to have the chance to outline the work I have done since I was appointed Minister of State with responsibility for diaspora affairs, and to highlight some of the important upcoming work.  I look forward to the response of members and especially to hear any new proposals they might have.  As I said at the launch of Global Irish: Ireland's Diaspora Policy, it is the first comprehensive policy statement by any Government in the history of the State.  It is appropriate that it is coming at this time, prior to the commemoration of 2016.  The policy is comprehensive, but given that it is a work in progress, we can add new ideas as they emerge.  That is one of the reasons I am delighted to be present at this morning's meeting.</p></speech>

As you are aware, Chairman, the national programme was launched yesterday evening in Collins Barracks.  It is a very exciting programme.  I was delighted that people who had some concerns are now very positive and supportive.  The programme will attract considerable support and participation from everybody.  The programme belongs to everyone.  The main emphasis will be on ensuring that everyone in the country can embrace the programme at local school level, institutional level and nationally.  Very exciting events will be promoted by the Government but also by the cultural institutions.  I was delighted with the response received from people who had genuine concerns, for example, concerning the involvement of the families of those people who gave their lives for Ireland.  They are now very much at the centre of the programme, which is the way it should be.  A major emphasis will be placed on those who participated and gave their lives for Ireland, and their families who were affected by that.  People have been reassured that they will be the central focus of the commemoration.</p> <p>  I mentioned the Global Civic Forum.  We will launch the international programme at the Global Civic Forum.  It will be a very good platform for it.  We are developing plans for the international programme, which will also be quite exciting.  We will work through the embassies and consulates general.  Culture Ireland will have a major role to play in it as well as other organisations.  We will ensure that as part of the programme we will connect with all parts of the world.  As you indicated, Chairman, I have travelled to a number of countries since I became Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora.  I have travelled nearly as much as you.</p></speech>

Members of the diaspora like the fact that we paid our debts and that we have met the financial challenge and are coming out of it strongly.  Those people who want to come back to Ireland realise that the only way they can come back is if there is a strong economy, because a strong economy introduces jobs.  They read <i>The Wall Street Journal</i>and the Financial Times.  They know what forbes.com and Bloomberg say.</p></speech>

They realise that if the economy is going well in this country that it is good for them.  They are very interested in the commemorations as well.  Everyone will be able to connect with the international programme.</p><p>When I was Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht I was involved in the creation of a new website,<i>www.inspiringireland.ie</i>.  I was delighted that the website got an e-Government award.  It will be the platform for the cultural institutions.  The next major project will be the commemoration of 1916.  The offering for our diaspora will be available through <i>www.inspiringireland.ie</i>.  All of the cultural institutions will work together to put the content on the site, which will be driven by Sandra Collins of the Digital Repository of Ireland in conjunction with an expert group.  It will be the place to go if one wants to get information on 1916.  As Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora I will continue the work in which I was involved in the creation of the site with the 1916 commemoration project on<i>www.inspiringireland.ie</i>.  I am very excited about that as well.  Modern technology will give a platform to 1916 all over the world and the place to go will be <i>www.inspiringireland.ie</i>, which will also popularise that particular site.</p></speech>

I note that he states that the policy is evolving and that he is anxious to get input from everybody involved, which I very much welcome.  The importance of the diaspora is very much reflected in Article 2 of the Constitution, Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, which refers to the special affinity of the Irish people with its diaspora.  The work of the Minister of State is very important in that respect.</p> <p>  The Minister of State referred to social communications and the ever-more-important role of communications in terms of new social media.  When we discussed the Estimates I raised a similar concern about those who do not use social media.  We must ensure that our policies do not leave out the isolated and vulnerable people, who in many cases are the older population, and that their interests and issues are represented as well.  We are aware of many instances of isolation, loneliness and mental health issues.  I hope the various programmes, particularly the emigrant support programme, are targeted very much at welfare, with a special emphasis on the needs of the less well off and more vulnerable people.  When the embassy organises a function in a particular country we know the people who are on the embassy list and who will attend, but there is always a cohort of people who are not reached.</p><p>We therefore have to develop policies to ensure they are.  The Minister of State mentioned the emphasis on welfare in the emigrant support programme, which I welcome.  I presume that is intended to assist the different organisations working with the more vulnerable members of the diaspora in cities throughout the world, particularly in Britain and the US.<br/><br/>A number of weeks ago, the former &Uacute;achtar&aacute;in of Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael and its ard st&uacute;irth&oacute;ir made a presentation regarding the GAA and its global remit to the committee.  The Minister of State referred to the reducing influence of the county associations in his contribution.  Oftentimes nowadays, emigrants are organised more through the GAA and Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann.  I have attended Cavan and Monaghan association events over the years and I am concerned that the older age cohorts are the bedrocks of those associations.  It would be a pity if the associations died out because they have an important role to play.  Thought needs to be given by the departmental staff abroad to ensuring they continue to play an important role in conjunction with the GAA, Comhaltas Ceolt&oacute;ir&iacute; &Eacute;ireann and other cultural organisations.  The associations played a significant role in the past but they are not as influential or central as they were.  Is thought being given in the Department to ensuring their work continues?<br/><br/>On the issue of communications, Deputy Durkan and I have raised at the committee the issue of the decision by RTE to cease its long wave radio service.  The proposed cessation of the service has been deferred for a number of years.  A suggestion was made that if it was to continue, it should be supported financially by the emigrant support programme but I disagree.  RTE should fund it and there is a great onus on the organisation to ensure the service continues.  This concerns people who do not have the competence to use modern technology and under no circumstances should those who avail of the service currently be deprived of it.  The service is important in Britain in particular but it is also important in my province, Ulster, for example, in the glens of Antrim and other parts of County Armagh where people depend on the long wave signal to listen to RTE radio.<br/><br/>The Minister of State referred to the extension of voting rights.  A decision should be made in a reformed Seanad to appoint a member of the diaspora to the House.  There is plenty of scope to provide for that.  All Irish citizens, regardless of where they reside, should be entitled to vote in Presidential elections.  If we wait for systems to be put in place before a decision is made to extend the franchise, we will have to wait years.  It would be preferable if a decision was made, for example, to extend the franchise for the Presidential election and then put in place the <i>modus operandi</i>for the electoral system, otherwise we will have report after report and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or local authorities telling us it cannot be done and so on.  A decision should be made to extend the franchise and then the system should be devised.  It is not beyond the competence of the public service to put in place an electoral system to cater for such an extension.</p></speech>

This is a hugely important issue because of our history of emigration.  I agree with Deputy Smith regarding broadcasting and communicating with the diaspora that there is a social obligation on our national broadcaster to do everything in its power to ensure the link is maintained through broadcasting to the UK, in particular, from the transmitter in County Meath.  It is not beyond the realm of possibility for RTE to use television licence revenue for that purpose.</p> <p>  With regard to improving contacts with the diaspora in general, to what extent are universities encouraged to offer scholarships?  To what extent could the State become involved in offering scholarships to people who have a link with Ireland or who wish to have one, particularly to encourage such links and to magnify the opportunities for investment by Irish companies in the US and US companies in Ireland, which has been ongoing for several years?  It would be beneficial to develop those links through the universities because they are excellent at inviting and encouraging foreign students.  It could be beneficial if people were invited in particular from the US and UK.</p> <p>  We were led to believe in recent times that there was a simple way to resolve the issue of the undocumented Irish in the US but I found on closer examination that there is not.  It is the way it always has been.  It is complicated and difficult and the issue has been ongoing for several years.  During discussions with the diaspora, to what extent has it been found possible to encourage the authorities in the US, given President Obama's declaration in this regard, to bring this issue to a satisfactory conclusion and if so, how?  I acknowledge a court case is pending.  What positive influence can we bring to bear on the outcome?  Notwithstanding modern technology and the fact that families can stay in contact daily on the Internet through Skype and so on, it would be more beneficial in the environment in which we live and the fact that some undocumented Irish have been overseas for almost 30 years, to be able to make contact with them, as this could be hugely important for their morale and that of their relatives and for our morale .</p> <p>  As the Minister of State said, the importance of county associations is diminishing while voluntary sporting associations are increasing in importance.  Could statutory agencies such as local authorities be involved to a greater extent in identifying and adopting their former residents?  The Minister of State has beneficial links in this regard through the Kerrymen's association in the US.  I am sure most local authorities maintain links but it is always important that statutory authorities at local level become involved and identified with issues of this nature because it gives them an imprimatur that may be lacking sometimes.</p></speech>

Who are the diaspora?  How are they defined?</p><p>I am conscious of the fact that when I was growing up in Ireland, travel to other countries, mainly to Britain, was part and parcel of one's life.  People went to England to find work in construction to build tunnels and railway lines.  As we know, there are now elderly Irish people living there who have been left behind.  They have to be communicated with, which is why people here have been arguing for the continuation of RTE's long wave broadcasting system.  While I appreciate there are emigrant associations in various places that do excellent work on behalf of emigrants, does the Minister of State agree that there is another element?  Those who have left Ireland within the past 15 years are highly educated, mobile and accessible using Skype or smart phones.  I received a telephone call this morning from Albania which I have not yet had a chance to return.  Nowadays people can communicate easily.  People who are younger and more are availing of work opportunities available around the world.  On the other hand, there are older people, former building workers, who are seen as older emigrants.  Do we pay enough attention to the modern Irish who would not even know RTE has a long wave broadcasting service?  The differences are that great but social communications are important.</p><p> As a small nation, I thought we were doing fairly well in dealing with the diaspora owing to the success of the St. Patrick's Day celebrations, which are phenomenal.  St. Patrick's Day was even celebrated this year in the Georgian capital, Tbilisi, with its magnificent town hall being turned green.  More and more countries are coming on board, while the GAA is increasingly engaging with the diaspora.  I am more concerned, however, about and interested in what is stated on the first page of the Minister of State's contribution, in which he referred to the fact that the European Union had indicated that we were remiss in not affording voting rights to the disapora.  How does one define the diaspora?  Does it include Irish citizens exclusively?  Is its size calculated by the number of passports?  Does the Minister of State know how many Irish passports have been issued?  He hid the complexity of how one could give voting rights in general elections to residents of Northern Ireland, for example, be they loyalists or republicans, let alone move further afield.  As a member of this committee, I am conscious that many countries have afforded members of their diaspora the right to vote in their embassies all over the world, including Albania.  While I appreciate that the Minister of State wants to give away 3,000 certificates and may have printed that number, he certainly has not distributed them yet.  It is a nice gesture, but it is tokenism.  With all due respect to him, the hard core issue is how we can afford citizenship rights to Irish citizens who wish to participate in elections here.</p></speech>

When he has finished answering them, I will call the final three members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1046" speakername="Jimmy Deenihan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015040100002#E00300"><p>All three members of the committee who have spoken have raised some pertinent questions.  I am sure the three remaining speakers will raise further questions.</p> <p>  As regards communications, Deputies Bernard J. Durkan and Brendan Smith referred to the older Irish who would not be into social media.  I agree with them that we did not realise the importance of the long wave 252 transmitter until RTE decided to discontinue using it.  There was then a remarkable response from Irish people, not only in Britain but also in Northern Ireland who were concerned about the issue.  It is welcome that RTE has extended use of the transmitter until 2017.  We have funded research to determine the size of the audience which will I hope guarantee the future of the service in determining what the audience requires and how important it is to it.  The feedback I have received, including especially correspondence from the United Kingdom, clearly demonstrates that the long wave transmitter is an important line of communication for the diaspora , not only elderly people, living in Britain and Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  RTE recently launched the international player and I attended the event.  Last summer its product GAAGO proved to be very successful.  When I was in America, I met the proprietors of major Irish bars in many cities.  They were not seeing as many customers coming to watch GAA matches because they were now watching them at home.  Although at times games were being shown early in the morning, people were getting together in their homes to watch matches.  The international player service will be a major contributor to communication between Ireland and the rest of the world.  </p> <p>  The new Irish TV initiative is also proving to be effective.  It is being carried on the Sky platform.  Its directors are in contact with major American broadcasters and I hope the service will be carried on a number of platforms there.  There is a lot of enthusiasm and excitement about it.  I recognise its work in reaching out to the diaspora.  It uses local positive stories about Ireland from each county, which people like.  Research has recently been undertaken in Limerick by GLN, Global Limerick Network.  It was established by Mr. Tim O'Connor, a former Irish consul-general in New York.  The research shows that people want to hear positive stories from their respective counties and the country generally because that is what excites them.  Irish TV is doing this by seeking positive stories from all counties which are then broadcast internationally.  It is an important development.</p> <p>  The county associations, including those in Dublin, are powerful.  I recently attended an event in County Kerry which was attended by 550 people to honour a great Kerryman in London, Danny Tim O'Sullivan, and it was totally booked out.  The Mayo association held a major event in Dublin recently.  County associations are not as strong as they used to be, but I agree with the Deputies that they are important.  We should make efforts to encourage and keep them together.  During the years I have developed a network for County Kerry.  It was easy enough to do because there was a major affinity on the part of people who had left but who returned regularly to attend major events every September.  When I attended the global economic forum, I did not see many of the people I knew from around the world, although there were a few successful Kerry people in attendance.  I am sure it is the same for every other county.  I have been building a network through LinkedIn, as well as holding meetings with people from County Kerry in different cities around the world.</p><p>We are working with the local enterprise offices and will be launching the initiative shortly.  I hope the offices will have a designated person who will co-ordinate each county's business networks.  Networks, by their nature, depend on the enthusiasm of the people involved.  If, however, they are connected with the local authority, there is a better chance they will be sustainable for the future.  I invite all members of the committee to attend the launches with the county managers and the chief executives of the LEOs.  It will provide a good opportunity to create links between counties and the diaspora in a professional and sustainable way.  I also hope we will be able to revive the county associations through this initiative.  Local councillors will be able to identify and recommend businesses for inclusion in the database.</p><p> The Constitutional Convention recommended members of the diaspora have a vote in presidential elections.  The next presidential election will be held in 2018, which gives us the advantage of time.  There are approximately 1 million active Irish passport holders - it must be remembered a passport has to be renewed every ten years - living outside of the country, including in Northern Ireland.  There are many others who are entitled to hold an Irish passport but who may not have applied for one.  This database of passport holders could provide a register of electors.  The Taoiseach is personally committed to this issue because he has a significant connection with the diaspora.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the line Department in charge of dealing with it.  I will be working on it with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, and the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, Deputy Alan Kelly, to examine the logistics and the challenges involved.  The matter is being taken very seriously by the Government.  As the next presidential election will not be held until 2018, we have time to ensure we get it right.  We must make it clear who can vote and where they can do so.  We must decide whether there will be postal or electronic voting, or at embassies or consulates.  As it may be difficult for some to avail of the latter option, we are examining all other scenarios.  Other Governments have examined this issue, but this is the first time it has been taken seriously.  It will also be the first time in the history of the State that members of the diaspora will vote in a presidential election.</p><p> Deputy Brendan Smith raised the issue of members of the diaspora voting in Seanad elections.  The Irish in Britain group made a good submission on extending voting rights in Seanad elections to Maurice Manning&rsquo;s Seanad reform working group.  It was similar to a proposal I had made in 1991 in the D&aacute;il in calling for one Senator to represent the USA, Canada and South America, one senator to represent Europe, including the United Kingdom, and one Senator to represent Australia and the rest of the world.  If there was a register of electors for the diaspora for presidential elections, it could also be used for Seanad elections.  It will be interesting to see the recommendations of the Seanad reform working group on this proposal.  There would be a possibility of examining nominees for these positions before we were ready for Seanad elections, but that is a matter for the Government to decide.</p><p> The issue of the undocumented Irish in America is challenging and complicated.  During the years successive Taoisigh have made this one of their main discussion points with various US Presidents when they have the unique opportunity to meet them on St. Patrick's Day.  It is estimated that there are 50,000 undocumented Irish, but it could be more or it could be less.  The Obama initiative would help approximately 3 million undocumented immigrants, allowing those with children and no criminal records and who were willing to settle tax arrears the right to stay in America and providing a pathway to their becoming legal and fully documented.  The initiative is, however, being contested in the US courts as there is, unfortunately, huge opposition to it from the Republican Party.  Yesterday Paul Ryan, a leading Republican, visited Leinster House, which gave me a chance to raise this issue with him.  Whereas the Republicans are concerned about the Obama initiative, they are open to certain initiatives that we might be able to take to help undocumented Irish immigrants, as well as others.  It is not that Republicans are closed to immigration reform, but they believe the President went beyond his executive powers.</p><p> The Mitchell scholarships are not confined to members of the Irish diaspora and are a good example of how scholarships can work.  One initiative arising from the diaspora policy we will be rolling out is similar to one that has proved to be very successful in Israel, the taglit-birthright scheme.  It would allow third generation Irish people to spend ten days free in Ireland learning about Irish culture and heritage.  I hope some of the young people involved may return to Ireland to pursue other education programmes in the future.  The programme will commence this year.</p><p>It has proven to be very successful in Israel.  We will target third generation Irish people and I hope it will become a broader programme in future.  The idea is that because there is no legal pathway of immigration to America, at this time there are approximately 150,000 people in America who were born in Ireland.  That connection would wane as time goes on and generations pass, so we are trying to reconnect with the third generation to keep the connection going.  It will be an important initiative from this programme.</p><p> I am glad Deputy Eric Byrne raised the issue of St. Patrick's Day.  When I was Minister, I assembled a number of people, based on the success of Dublin events.  The Dublin festival is now a major event that is organised and co-ordinated properly.  I wanted to use the Dublin example to co-ordinate all the St. Patrick's Day parades all over the world.  Perhaps there could even be one database that could show what is happening all over the world and who are the organisers, so if people such as musicians wanted to travel to perform, they could make their services available.  If organisers wanted people to come from Ireland, they could use the same database.  I have continued this work in the Department and it is mentioned in the policy.  We will accelerate that work for the next St. Patrick's Day, and I hope we will have more co-ordination on what is happening all over the world.  There are several parades that we are not even aware of, and more parades could take place around the world if they could be encouraged.  There must be some focus and co-ordination, and I hope we can link the processes online, for example.</p><p> I am glad the Deputy raised the issue, as it is a marvellous opportunity.  We are the only country in the world which is received at the White House on our national day.  For those of us lucky enough to be abroad - I was in Chicago - we know that the world feels a connection with Ireland on St. Patrick's Day and even on the days before that.  I have always recognised that and the connection is growing as time goes on.  St. Patrick's Day is becoming a bigger cultural event.  Where once it may have been associated with revelry, it is now more associated with culture, quality, business and every aspect of being Irish that is good.  It provides us with a great platform and I hope we will continue to work on that.</p></speech>

With regard to the undocumented in the United States, perhaps we should put a bit more emphasis on the relationship with the Grand Old Party, GOP.  Our traditional connections have been more with the Democratic Party than the Republicans and I know efforts have been made to build that up.  There is scope to do that as there are many Irish links within the Republican Party.  To some extent, we would have quite a bit in common with them as well.  That might help overcome difficulties, as the Minister mentioned there are many obstacles.</p> <p>  My colleague, Deputy Brendan Smith, mentioned Seanad membership and I agree with his comments.  I do not particularly agree with nominations for the diaspora and I do not agree with having Taoiseach's nominees as the Seanad should be an entirely elected Chamber.  It is possible to have that and I was taken by the manner in which the Minister of State indicated there could be three representatives.  In coming to the 1916 centenary and in discussions of inclusiveness, we should extend the vote for the Seanad to Northern Ireland.  I have spoken to Unionist councillors over the years, especially when there were strong North-South links with local authority members.  Many Unionists were very disposed to taking a place in the Seanad but did not want to be isolated within their communities.  Perhaps we could extend this in a way that we could have a certain critical mass, which would enhance the importance of the Seanad and open dialogue North and South that many not be happening as much as it could be politically.</p> <p>  I agree with the comments on the presidential election and extending the franchise.  Some people have suggested this should happen for general elections but I am not persuaded that this is a good idea.  There should be a link between residents and taxation with respect to the formulation of the Government and electing people.  I agree with everything that is being done with regard to communications.  It is extraordinary that a national broadcaster would seek to remove the long wave 252 service.  If that happens, it will offset any good the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora can do.  It is a link that many people depend on, and particularly a certain age group that may not be fully engaged with modern technology and social media.</p> <p>  I will finish by recounting a trip by the committee to Singapore towards the end of last year.  We engaged with the Irish Chamber of Commerce in Singapore, which was a very good exercise.  Perhaps there is scope in countries where there is a diaspora to have a chamber of commerce that would be fairly inclusive.  We have many successful business people living abroad and it would benefit their business and provide reciprocal benefits for us if they could link to what is happening here from a business perspective.  We also met a gathering of young people when in Singapore.  That was interesting and the people were all working.  I asked how many of them went to Singapore of their own volition and how many were forced to move because of unemployment here.  The Chairman or other members might correct me but almost all of them went to Singapore of their own volition, which was also interesting.  I also asked how many of them would be interested in returning to Ireland at some stage in the near future.  They were unanimous in their wish to return.  We need to keep those links alive in order that people return.  They will bring expertise and have a valuable input in the development of Ireland.</p> <p>  My final point was touched on by Deputy Eric Byrne and the Minister of State.  There are people who are not successful when they go abroad and they may fall through the cracks.  In Britain in particular, there are people who emigrated many years ago with a low level of education and found themselves in hard times.  Many people who go abroad now are well educated but people went to Australia, in particular from the building and construction industry, and they probably did not have a high level of education.  They had certain building skills.  I wonder how they would be affected by a slump in that country and we should be mindful of that.  Are schemes and strategies being developed to identify those people?  Often, they slip under the radar.  One of the groups doing tremendous work - although I am sure there are others - is the GAA.  It is extraordinary to go to places like Tokyo or China and see GAA clubs that are a focus for the Irish abroad.  It is a real tribute to the games, of which the Minister of State was an exemplary exponent.  I am sure the Department is working with that body and we could develop a stronger role in that regard.</p></speech>

Opportunities for the diaspora are important issues for those people and the country as a whole.  Some of those people are very successful.  The descendants of the diaspora are important also, as many of those people connect with Ireland over several generations.</p><p>There is an opportunity to tap into their success.</p><p> I will mention one group of which the Minister of State is probably aware and which is local to me, namely, the Irish Palatine Association.  Its headquarters are in Rathkeale.  The Palatines came from Wexford, Carlow, Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  There is still a large body of them in Limerick.  Their association has connectivity throughout the world, particularly in the US and Canada.  It is in contact with many members.  Originally, the Palatines came from Germany in 1709 and settled in Ireland, but many went to the US later.  There are many families in the Limerick area with names like Bovenizer, Ruttle, Miller and Switzer.  I am one of the association's directors, but another is Christy Switzer from Tralee in the Minister of State's county.  The families have a level of connectivity.  There are regular exchanges with and visits to the Palatinate in Germany from where the Palatines came.  There is an opportunity to extend the role of the Irish Palatine Association to introduce people to business and, in particular, tourism opportunities in Ireland.  There is already a level of tourism.  There is a museum with artifacts from 1709 Germany.  Many people visited in 2009 for the tercentenary.  Perhaps some of the Minister of State's staff might consider this suggestion and speak to the association to determine what opportunities exist for improving the relevant descendants' understanding of Ireland, given that some of them are only recent emigrants.</p><p> I look forward to the Minister of State's reply, but I must go as I have another appointment.</p></speech>

We published our paper in July 2013.  When asked in October 2013 whether there should be a Minister of State for the diaspora, the then T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade stated that there should be.  In 2014, Sinn F&eacute;in came out with its policy.  Lo and behold, everyone agreed and the Minister of State was appointed.  That was consensus politics working at its best.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has done a great job in the role.  It is a large one and I would like it to have more resourcing and staffing.  As the Minister of State has seen from this meeting, there is much that could be done in terms of collecting up and connecting with county associations as well as the various religious organisations that have major connections in traditionally non-Irish areas.</p> <p>  The Minister of State touched on the matter of votes for the Irish overseas and those who were born in Ireland and hold Irish passports.  There are many such people.  The county that the Minister of State and I are from had an equally famous politician, Daniel O'Connell, who fought for Catholic emancipation and the right to vote.  In 1918, the centenary of which we will celebrate shortly, women got the right to vote.  In the 1960s in Derry, people marched for the right to vote.  In a modern democracy, though, we are denying many of our citizens the right to vote, even in presidential elections.  Some 120 countries manage to give their citizens overseas a right to vote.  Of the 33 countries in the Council of Europe, only four do not give citizens outside the state a right to vote, those being, Greece, Malta, Cyprus and Ireland.  The Minister of State mentioned that there were technical and logistical issues.  That is undoubted, but any country that can bring the top pharmaceutical and Internet companies to its shores can surely give the most basic right to its citizens, that being, the right to vote.  I attended the Constitutional Convention when extending the right to vote in presidential elections was supported, but the Minister of State should bear something in mind.  Extending the vote to Irish citizens in presidential elections is the least expression of their democratic rights as citizens that we could give them.  Only nine countries extend the right to vote in presidential elections to their citizens overseas, but all nine have executive presidents similar to President Obama.  We are discussing doing this just for presidential elections.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has mentioned Seanad elections.  I agree that citizens overseas should have votes in the Seanad and that the Seanad should be expanded and reformed, but we are a long way off that.  The Minister of State is supportive of the process and the concept, but we need to accelerate it.  As my colleague pointed out, what better way would there be to celebrate the 100th anniversary of the 1916 Rising than to extend the right to vote to people who reside in countries that contributed so much to the rebellion?</p> <p>  The Minister of State has been working with our consuls and ambassadors, but Fianna F&aacute;il's policy document referred to honorary consuls.  It is unfair to expect our ambassadors and consuls in the US, Australia and Canada to cover such vast territories.  We should replicate what other countries have done.  For example, Mexico has a consul or honorary consul in each of the 50 states of the US.  We should consider doing the same there as well as in Australia and the provinces of Canada.  As the Minister of State knows, there is a large Irish-American community in Montana, yet that area is covered by the consulate in San Francisco, which has just two staff from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and some local staff.  They are asked to cover an area that is nearly the size of western Europe.  We are not deploying enough resources to tap into the goodwill or to have people serve as go-to people on the ground.  I am sure that the Minister of State has met the honorary consul in St. Louis.  He has done an extraordinary job for 40 years.  If any Member of our Parliament visits St. Louis, he is the guy on the ground, the connected man and someone we can plug into, as it were.  Perhaps the Minister of State should consider this suggestion.</p> <p>  I welcome the global civic forum.  It is a great idea.  Perhaps the Minister of State might invite members of this committee to attend.  He is also working on the birthright proposal.  It borrows what has worked in other countries, for example, Israel.  The concept would be well received.  I met Mr. Gidi Mark, head of Taglit-Birthright Israel.  It formulated its programme as a business plan rather than a concept.  It brought business leaders together and asked how it could be made to work and have a significant benefit to the Israeli community without being a large burden on the state.  The concept arose approximately three decades ago and has been successful ever since.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is working on an interparliamentary gathering, but we need to be more formal.  He is taking a great first step and the proposal is in the works, but I understand from my colleagues in other parliaments around the world that, as soon as they get elected, they are invited to countries like Israel and India.  Such countries understand the importance of having good relationships with England, America and Canada.  Taxpayers in Ireland might not believe it to be the greatest idea in the world.  Congressman Paul Ryan, who was in Leinster House yesterday, is probably the most powerful politician in America, as he is in charge of the appropriations committee.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has mentioned the complex issue of the undocumented Irish, but he might also touch on the visa waiver issue that has arisen in recent weeks and the possibility of an Irish E-3.  No comprehensive reform will happen in America for the next couple of years.  People are holding out hope that, after the presidential election, something might happen.  We should bear in mind that the Republicans control both Houses of Congress, so it does not matter who is President of the United States.</p><p>What matters is what can be done in Congress at this moment because that is not going to change a lot over the next few years.</p><p> On the 2016 commemorations and the idea of launching and engaging with the Irish overseas on that and the global programme, there is a concept that Congressman Brendan Boyle is taking up of having gardens of remembrance dedicated in 2016.  That might be something the Minister of State might look at in terms of getting it out to the diaspora through our consulates.</p><p> We will discuss later the case of Ibrahim Halawa, an Irish citizen overseas.  Does the Minister of State have any update on that for the committee?</p></speech>

Senator Walsh raised a point about connection with the GOP.  Paul Ryan was here on a private visit and met the Taoiseach on Monday in an official capacity.  Unfortunately, I had to go to Boston for the funeral of a friend of mine and did not meet him then, but I met him yesterday.  He is an up-and-coming politician who ran for Vice President in the previous election.  He is very favourable towards Ireland. In his offices, which Senator Daly has no doubt visited, the first thing to be seen is a hurley.  That is not a surprise because he is a Kilkenny man.  He is a well-grounded individual with a huge feeling for Ireland and I am sure he represents many more in the Republican Party.  As we are also inclined towards and connected with the Democratic Party, we have to use our contacts there who are equally Irish, as we all know.</p> <p>  A critical individual at the moment is the chairman of the judiciary committee, Bob Goodlatte.  His wife is from Connemara and he is very excited about the fact that his mother-in-law, whom I understand is a native Irish speaker, cooked the Sunday dinner for them.  He is in a powerful position now.  Trey Gowdy, who is chairman of the immigration sub-committee, is not from Ireland and has no connection but he is a very good friend of people like Mick Mulvaney who is a good friend of Senator Walsh's as well.  We have great connections there which we must use as much as possible in the sense of communicating with these people and making them realise they are in pivotal positions for Ireland.  We understand it is not easy but at the same time we would really appreciate it if they could help us.</p> <p>  The Senator also raised the issue of Seanad membership.  Certainly that is quite interesting in terms of his views on Northern Ireland and some of his Unionist friends.  I know Senator Walsh has gone out of his way to build up a relationship with both communities in Northern Ireland.</p> <p>  I am sure the committee has probably had the former Senator, Dr. Maurice Manning, before it.  Has the Chairman been in discussions with him about Seanad reform?  I do not want to determine the committee's business but I think it would be an interesting discussion.  That is a major opportunity although we could not have all the diaspora voting to elect Members to the Seanad and then the Irish people having no vote on it.  It would have to be universal.  That would make a very interesting Seanad.  The issue about voting in presidential elections and representation without taxation would be a major consideration.</p> <p>  The President in Ireland is a very important position.  He is the commander of our armed forces and signs all Bills into law.  He is Head of State.  Numerous Taoisigh went to the UK in the past but when our President went, it was a totally different occasion.  I would not underestimate the position of President in this country and I know the Senator does not want to either.  We have been privileged with the calibre of President we have had over the years, in our present and the previous two Presidents but before that as well.  If we can find a way, logistically and policy-wise, to extend the franchise, which I hope we will in the future, it is going to be a very important first step.</p> <p>  Senator Walsh raised the issue of chambers of commerce and that is something I identified myself.  There is a professional network of Irish people around the world, and chambers of commerce are very well organised and very professional.  They attract people from the business sector who want to help Ireland.  The first people I met were the people from the chamber of commerce so we are working on a programme with Dublin Chamber of Commerce and others to see how they can connect with chambers of commerce around the world.  I agree they are a very important connector with the Irish business world and we hope to continue to work with them and come up with programmes.</p> <p>  Regarding the vulnerable, the Irish abroad unit was set up in 2004 by the Government when Brian Cowen was the Minister for Foreign Affairs, and then the emigrant support programme was established.  It was not just setting up a unit in the Department, there was also a fund there.  This fund is one of the most generous in the world.  Most of the budget has been put into emigrant welfare.  The contribution to the UK since 2004, for example, has been about &euro;84 million and to America something like &euro;27 million.  There have been huge contributions made to various Irish welfare centres around the world.  We should recognise that even when this country was challenged, we continued to provide financial support for all those centres, and the reduction in funding was always something they could adjust to and take.  Everywhere I have gone they have recognised that even though this country was really challenged financially and although we did share the pain here at home, we did not forget them.  It was a major statement when we started experiencing our tough economic times in 2008 that we would continue to fund them.  It shows the commitment by the previous Government and the current Government that our diaspora and vulnerable emigrants are important.</p> <p>  The Senator mentioned the support of the GAA.  It is extraordinary what has happened with the GAA around the world.  Irrespective of a person's background in sport, whether it is rugby or soccer or whatever, all young people who leave Ireland go to the GAA club in the place they go to.</p><p>The first time I travelled to play Gaelic football abroad was in 1970, a long time ago, and over the years I kept in contact with many of the people I met there.  I happened to be part of a very successful team which made numerous trips to the United States, United Kingdom and Australia.  At that time one attracted a different type of demographic, consisting mainly of older people, usually men.  These days, the events I go to are mostly attended by young people and, in some cases, the majority is made up of women.  Ladies' Gaelic football has taken off all over the world and is a very suitable field sport for women to play.  They readily adapt to it and really enjoy it.  Indeed, they often play it better than their menfolk, offering more open and skilful games.  While the men's game is often too defensive, women's football is usually more attractive to watch.  It is extraordinary how successful it has become.</p><p> The other game that has taken off all over the world is hurling.  I launched a hurling team in Stanford last year which included nine individuals who had no Irish connections.  When I saw a person with a Latino background striking the ball over the bar from 100 m out, I could see that hurling had really arrived.</p></speech>

The GAA has done a tremendous job and is working very closely with us to advance its aims.</p> <p>  Recently there were a number of unfortunate tragedies in New York and elsewhere involving young Irish people who were experiencing mental health difficulties.  I am delighted that we have recently begun working with Pieta House and the GAA in New York, under the auspices of the emigrant support programme, to put in place an initiative that could be copied in other parts of the world.  Pieta House will provide its professional services in New York and we hope that can be expanded to other cities where young people are challenged in various ways.  We are also working with Console and Immigration Counselling and Psychotherapy, ICAP, in London to develop programmes to assist people struggling with mental health and addiction problems.</p> <p>  Deputy Neville referred to the Palatines, who make up one of the several different Irish diasporas.  The reason these people came to Ireland in the first place was to avoid religious persecution.  Many of them settled in Limerick and Kerry, including the Hoffman family which came from Germany to Kerry 300 years ago.  The Deputy mentioned Christy Switzer, who was my personal trainer at one stage.  He is a great weight lifter and I went to his gym to build up my upper body.  The Palatines made a huge contribution to that part of the world.</p> <p>  As I said in the Seanad some time ago, Senator Daly has made numerous contacts on Capitol Hill.  That takes time and a great deal of patience, endurance, commitment and follow-up.  Making connections does not happen easily.  The Chairman, likewise, has built up some very good contacts in the US and elsewhere.  I take this opportunity to acknowledge the important work done by Senator Daly and the Chairman and the commitment they have shown in this regard.</p> <p>  The question of extending the vote in presidential elections to Irish people living abroad has been discussed at length and there now is universal agreement in the Oireachtas that it should happen.  There are decisions to be made, however, on who will be included on the register of electors, how and where people will vote, and so on.  Those issues can and will be determined in due course and we have that space between now and the next presidential election to get it right.  The matter will have to be decided by referendum because it involves a change in the Constitution.  We have learned from what happened in the referenda on the future of the Seanad and the compellability of witnesses, for example, both of which were lost because a doubt was cast as to what would happen afterwards.  We do not want that to happen when we put to the people the question of extending the vote.  We must be very clear on who will be able to vote and all the other logistical issues.  It would be the worst thing that could happen if that referendum were lost.  We in the Oireachtas will not determine whether the vote will be extended to the diaspora; the people of Ireland will make that decision.  When we go to them, we must be very clear on how it will be done.  I hope to see that referendum taking place in due course.</p> <p>  The proposals regarding honorary consulates are good.  People like Finbar Hill in Los Angeles have done extraordinary things.  Joseph McGlynn, our mutual friend in St. Louis, is still cycling at 80 years of age and we would love to get him back for the Ring of Kerry race.  He has given his life in St. Louis to Ireland in an honorary capacity and is proud to do so.  He has built up a great connection with politicians from all sides of this House.  When an Irish person goes over to St. Louis, it does not matter where he or she is from or which party he or she belongs to, that person is there to represent Ireland.  Mr. McGlynn has been very effective over there.  We will, of course, invite people to participate in the Global Civic Forum.  Any members who are interested in attending will find it affords them a great opportunity to meet with many of these people.  It is important that members should come.</p> <p>  The committee has a role to play in this policy and in working very closely with the Minister of State with responsibility for the diaspora, whoever that might be in the future.  I would be delighted to come back here later in the year to let members know how things are going and what progress is being made.  I have been travelling abroad as a politician for almost 30 years and it is my experience that when one goes abroad, people do not ask which party one belongs to.  I have met people in all walks of life and from all backgrounds and they never ask me that question.  They see me simply as an Irish politician representing this Parliament.  We should all be proud to go out there wearing the green shirt and representing this country, leaving our differences behind.  The global Irish diaspora policy gives us an agenda and action plan from which we can work collectively.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity to address the committee this morning.</p></speech>

Before reading the motion, I ask the secretariat to distribute a letter.  As I arrived here this morning the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade issued a letter.  He has asked me to read it to the committee as he is anxious that it is put on the record.  It reads:<blockquote><br /><br />Dear Chairman,<br /><br />I wanted to write to you to update you and the Committee on the case of Irish citizen Ibrahim Halawa, particularly in respect of the court proceedings over the weekend and the reports that Ibrahim was being tortured.<br /><br />The Court Case on Sunday<br /><br />The postponed preliminary hearing of the case involving Ibrahim Halawa took place in Cairo on Sunday 29 March.  Officials from Ireland's Embassy attended, including our Ambassador Isolde Moylan.  This hearing was different to previous postponed hearings - all the defendants were present and the judge indicated that he would accept oral/written submissions from the lawyers present on behalf of their clients.<br /><br />The very first submissions made related to minors and students.  As part of this group Ibrahim Halawa's lawyers formally presented an application for his release and specifically referred to his youth, his student status and his Irish nationality.  Among the documents submitted was a formal diplomatic note from the Embassy confirming the support of the Government for the application for his release, and other documents supporting the application that had been sourced with the assistance of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The fact that the Irish Ambassador was present in the Court was noted.  The trial was then adjourned until 26 April to allow for consideration of the petitions made.  Lawyers have informed my Department that a decision on the petition is unlikely to be made before 26 April.<br /><br />Reports of Torture<br /><br />I was genuinely horrified over the weekend to hear the reports that had been made to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and in the media that Ibrahim was being tortured.<br /><br />The welfare of an Irish citizen imprisoned abroad is a matter taken extremely seriously by the Government, and the very serious nature of the suggestions of torture being made led to immediate action being taken by the Consular Division of my Department and the Embassy in Cairo to clarify the situation. These initial investigations over the weekend indicated that the reports of torture appeared to be inaccurate.<br /><br />However, as it was not possible for Embassy officials to speak directly to Ibrahim himself during the court proceedings on Sunday, Ambassador Moylan herself made an urgent consular visit to the prison yesterday (Monday).</blockquote>That was last Monday.  The letter continued:<blockquote>She met with prison officials and had a visit during which Ibrahim was able to talk freely to her.<br /><br />While imprisonment abroad is traumatic for any young Irish citizen, I was very relieved to hear that following her visit the Ambassador has reported that Ibrahim looked well, was in relatively good spirits and has not suffered any serious mistreatment, torture or abuse.  Nor had he been housed in a death penalty cell as had been suggested in some reports over the weekend.<br /><br />As such, based on the facts established by the Ambassador through direct contact with Ibrahim himself, the reports of torture were unfounded.  Unfortunately, they may also have been damaging to our ongoing efforts in this case as they attributed to the Egyptian authorities a level of maltreatment and abuse that is not accurate.<br /><br />The Ambassador did note that Ibrahim was sharing a cell with convicted criminals, and requested that he be moved to a more appropriate area of the prison - a request agreed to by the prison authorities.<br /><br />I am aware that this is a very difficult time for the Halawa family, as it would be for any family in these circumstances.  The Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade is keeping them fully informed of developments.  The Department will continue to work cooperatively with them to make positive progress towards our shared goal which is Ibrahim's return.<br /><br />As the Committee Members are aware, where Irish citizens are charged with offences abroad, it is the foreign court which decides matters such as bail and release.  Just as politicians here cannot interfere with legal cases ongoing before the Irish courts, Ireland cannot directly interfere in cases before foreign courts.  However, we continue to work on this case and to give all appropriate support to Ibrahim and his family.  The lodgement of a formal diplomatic note of support for the release application in the Court is an important practical example of this solidarity.<br /><br />Now that a formal application for release is being considered by the Egyptian court, it remains the considered view of the Government that the work necessary to assist in reaching a positive outcome in this case, which is ongoing and continuous, is best done in a low key, measured and resolute fashion.<br /><br />The actions taken by me and my officials at all times are, and must be, guided by the fact that there is a young Irish citizen in prison abroad and subject to a foreign judicial system.  I am grateful for the constructive approach that Members of the Committee have taken to date, and I<i></i>would ask for their assistance in reminding all concerned that, however well meant, injudicious or intemperate public statements or actions may have a negative impact on Ibrahim's plight - rather than assisting the situation, they may in fact be contrary to his best interests.<br /><br />I would also like to reassure you and the Committee that an enormous amount of work has been done on this case by the Department of Foreign Affairs.  There is no other consular case receiving higher priority in my Department.<br /><br />I am aware of the unfair and unfounded suggestions that the Department is failing to act or doing less because of Ibrahim Halawa's name or because of his Egyptian heritage.  These unhelpful comments are so easy to make and so difficult for the officials involved to dispute.  I would like to reassure you and Members of the Committee that any assertion that the Department is treating Ibrahim Halawa less favourably than how it might treat another Irish citizen is utterly untrue and entirely without foundation.<br /><br />I am also aware of various calls for additional action by the Government. We keep all aspects of this case, including the Department's own approach under review.  At all times, the key consideration for me and for the officials working on this case has been, and will continue to be, to take the action that is in Ibrahim Halawa's best interests.  This is a complex case and our approach has to be based on the practical realities of how a consular service must act to best protect their citizens abroad.  I will continue to keep the Committee briefed as appropriate through you Chairman, but I hope Members will appreciate that some of our work will be done quietly, but resolutely, behind the scenes and we would not propose to be making extensive public comment on all aspects.<br /><br />I intend to be active on this case in the coming days and will be in touch with you again before the Easter break.<br /><br />With kind regards, <br /><br />Yours sincerely,<br /><br />Charles Flanagan, T.D.<br /><br />Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade</blockquote>That is the letter from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to update us on the situation.</p><p>As the committee will know, I am in touch with him on a weekly basis on this matter and I am also in touch with Ms Isolde Moylan.  I have also been in touch with the Egyptian Embassy in Dublin on this case.  The committee has taken a serious interest in this case over the past number of months and will continue to do so to maximise our input into getting Mr. Halawa released.  </p><p>Senator Daly has tabled a motion on the matter which reads: &quot;That the Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade requests the Taoiseach to contact the President of Egypt in relation to Ibrahim Halawa's case.&quot;  I call on him to move his move and speak on the matter. </p></speech>

He raised many issues in it which appear to contradict what other governments have successfully done to achieve the release of their citizens abroad.  I note previous correspondence from the Department in which it states that its primary concern is his treatment while in prison.  I believe its primary concern should be his release, not his treatment in prison.  In his letter the Minister mentioned his treatment in prison.  We know from his cell mate, an Australian citizen who was released, that he did not receive any treatment after being shot in the hand during his arrest.  His treatment was carried out by an inmate, which has now left him with a disability.  When the Egyptian authorities say he is being treated appropriately, that must be questioned.<br/><br/>The reports regarding whether he is in a death row cell are not from the Egyptian authorities but from Amnesty International, which has confirmed that until very recently he was in a death row cell.  I am glad he has been moved, if that is true.  However, that is psychological torture.  Written on the walls of those cells are the last messages of people who were condemned to die.  We must remember that is the fate facing Ibrahim Halawa.  He is one of 426 prisoners who could face a death sentence.<br/><br/>I note the reference in the letter to quiet diplomacy.  He has been in jail for 600 days, so the days for quiet diplomacy are over and should cease.  Let us look at what has worked in other countries.  I have distributed some media reports of what the Prime Minister of Australia, Tony Abbott, did to seek the release of Australian journalist Peter Greste.  He had a meeting with President al-Sisi when they were attending the United Nations heads of state meeting.  Mr. Abbott was public about those meetings.  Even President Obama spoke up on behalf of this Australian citizen.  An ABC News report referred to how the release of this Australian citizen was carried out by presidential decree, something that is also open to Ibrahim Halawa as an Irish born citizen.  However, our Government has not engaged at the highest level.  I spoke to the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan, about this case.  Obviously the Ministers for Foreign Affairs in Australia and Canada were involved.  In one instance 19 calls were made in two weeks by the Australian Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Canadian Prime Minister, Stephen Harper, personally raised the case of a Canadian national with the President of Egypt.<br/><br/><i>The Irish Times</i>reported on 29 March that the case has been adjourned again until April.  The days of quiet diplomacy are finished.  The Egyptian Government must be made aware of how seriously the Irish people view this case.  Amnesty International has reported that he has no case to answer and is innocent of all charges.  If the President of Egypt wishes, he can be released by presidential decree tomorrow.  Somebody must simply ask.  We do not want him to be treated well while in prison; we want him out of prison.  That is the reason we are putting forward this motion calling on the Taoiseach to contact his counterpart in Egypt on behalf of this Irish born citizen and seek his release.  We are supportive of everything the officials in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have done.  They have briefed us.  However, if the President of Egypt does not wish to release our citizen, whom Amnesty International has said is innocent of all charges, we should look to the European Union to impose trade sanctions on Egypt.  That would show we are serious and that we will not sit quietly on our hands while this young Irish citizen is in jail.</p></speech>

I did not interrupt the Senator.  The Department's prime concern is his release, but it is also concerned about his well-being.  He is a young student in a strange prison, as the Minister outlined.  You are being unfair to our officials in Cairo as well.  They have visited him on a regular basis to ensure he is well looked after.  It is difficult for them but they do it, and keep a close eye on the situation.  At our last meeting we heard they had made approximately 32 visits to him and they have also kept the family informed.  The record must be corrected in that regard.</p></speech>

That is outlined in the letter as well.  It is important to clarify that so there is no misunderstanding about the Department in that regard.  Its primary concern is his release.  I know it, and I have been speaking to the Minister on a weekly basis about this.  It is unfair to say otherwise.  I also commend our team in Cairo and the ambassador, Ms Isolde Moylan, on their approach and the work they have done on this.

However, Senator Daly also outlined that the intervention at Head of Government level by two countries had the desired effect.  If a contact from the Taoiseach can help to advance the cause to have Ibrahim released as quickly as possible, it would support the work of the Minister, not cut across it.  From that point of view it would be an important intervention.</p></speech>

His lawyers include diplomatic documents from us with regard to his release.  The Chairman, I and others met Ibrahim with his sisters in Cairo prior to their arrest but during the protests.  They struck us as people who were there for a bit of an adventure, but unfortunately it has gone wrong for Ibrahim.  Thankfully, his sisters were released.  We should leave no stone unturned.  I ask that this motion be agreed unanimously by the committee.  The timing of when the Taoiseach would take this initiative, which I believe he should take, is left to his discretion.  Whether it is done now or left until after 26 April when the court gives its decision might be a matter of what is the best strategy.  However, it would be nice if the committee had already endorsed this motion so we would encourage the Taoiseach to continue the process being undertaken by the Government and the diplomatic service.</p></speech>

Senator Mark Daly has presented a motion and Deputy Bernard Durkan has submitted an amendment to it to delete all the words after "Trade" and substitute the following: "acknowledges the efforts by the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade in relation to the Ibrahim Halawa case and urges the Minister to continue his efforts at all appropriate levels to ensure the speedy release of Mr. Halawa."

I do so also on the basis of the discussions taking place as we speak.  I am aware the Taoiseach has been directly involved in discussions with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I strongly urge that we allow those ongoing delicate and sensitive discussions to take place without the distraction of a motion of a directive nature and in order to ensure that in matters of this nature, the procedure that has always been followed will be followed with the anticipated best effect.  The points raised in the Minister's letter in regard to the mistreatment of Mr. Halawa should be noted by the committee.  That is the best information that is available to the Taoiseach and the suggestion that the Taoiseach should override the functions and role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade is not the way business is done in this jurisdiction.  The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade acts with the full authority and imprimatur of the Taoiseach in discussions of this nature and continues to so do and it would not be in the interests of Mr. Halawa to introduce any distraction which might facilitate discourse in a different direction.</p><p>It is important to acknowledge that the embassy staff have been in daily contact and made countless calls and visits to the prison.  They have also met prison staff to ensure the constitutional rights of Ibrahim as an Irish citizen are acknowledged.<br/><br/>We are dealing with another jurisdiction and not our own, where it is improper to interfere in a case which is ongoing in the courts on account of its being <i>sub judice</i>.  Some might say we are failing to recognise that principle in this case but the authorities in Egypt are also very conscious of the need to separate powers.  It is not possible to do things by diktat and send directives to the courts and it would be dangerous to do so.</p></speech>

I have every confidence in the ability of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to have the maximum positive impact on the case of Ibrahim Halawa.</p> <p>  As a person who spent a bit of time inside the walls of a prison myself, I recognise the anguish caused to family members.  Some people may smile about that but I can tell them that when the door closes for the second time and the double lock rings home, a person recognises they are in prison and that is a shock.</p> <p>  Our hearts go out to Ibrahim Halawa and we are doing everything possible at every level.  I have spoken to the Taoiseach on this matter and with the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I do not accept the idea as expressed in the motion that there is a better way to do it.  We are pursuing the better way and that is the way we can bring about the best result for Ibrahim Halawa and his family.</p></speech>

There is a huge amount of human capital involved and there are huge emotions.  There is also danger and a fear on the part of the family that the Egyptian authorities will make the ultimate decision which would affect the life of their brother and son.</p> <p>  I do not like the way this issue is unfolding.  We must remember the context.  Three members of the Halawa family were arrested but while, thankfully, the two sisters were released on bail, the brother, tragically, remains in jail, where he has been for two years, having gone in at the age of 17.</p> <p>  The question for me, as a politician, is how best we can act in the interests of an Irish citizen in an Egyptian jail.  Egypt is not a liberal democracy like Britain or Ireland.  It has a very different judicial system and a very different political system.  We have seen the tragedy of some cases decided by the courts in Egypt, including a mass decision to have some prisoners executed.  We are dealing with an extremely sensitive and delicate issue and it is not one with which we should play politics.  It is worrying that a parliamentarian or public representative, who should have sensitivity and should want to assist in the ultimate release of a prisoner whom the Egyptians claim to be a criminal case, would allege torture in this case, because that has been contradicted by our ambassador and the allegation could provoke a negative reaction on the part of the Egyptians.</p> <p>  We are in public session and we held a debate on the subject in the D&aacute;il yesterday.  We must ask ourselves in what way we believe the welfare of this prisoner will be protected.  I have absolute confidence in the Minister and in our ambassador, with whom I have spoken specifically on this case.  I beg those engaged in the campaign for his release to trust the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister.  If the Taoiseach decides at the appropriate time to intervene, they should trust him to do so as well.</p></speech>

There is no implicit criticism in this motion of the Minister and I endorse the comments of Senator Daly and Deputy Brendan Smith in this regard.  The Minister has shown real competence and I have praised him on his work on Northern Ireland.  I fully accept that he will leave no stone unturned in this matter.  We met ambassador Moylan, whom I know from previous postings, and I know how committed and dedicated she is to this case.  I very much welcome what is in the letter but we are dealing with a hierarchical structure in Egypt and we need to ask how we can best achieve a positive outcome for the release of Ibrahim Halawa.  If it were a son or a brother of any of us, we would want everything possible to be done.</p> <p>  Diplomatic niceties mean the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade cannot contact the President of Egypt, President el-Sisi.  It would be in contravention of normal protocols but we have a template for action nevertheless.  The Australian Prime Minister has intervened directly and has been in touch three times by telephone with the Egyptian President and that was a contributory factor in a positive outcome.  The Canadian Prime Minister has also been in touch and my understanding is that the Canadian prisoner has been released on bail, though he remains in Egypt.  If this committee were to agree to ask the Taoiseach to contact the President of Egypt, it would not cut across what Deputy Durkan and Deputy Byrne have said.  That is all we ask.  We are not saying he must do it today or tomorrow, although my instinct would be to suggest that he do it sometime prior to 26 April and maybe afterwards, depending on the outcome.  The mere fact that we decide upon that, as a committee, will be known to the Egyptian authorities, including the embassy.  I think that would also help the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, in his efforts.</p> <p>  I do not see the proposals as mutually exclusive.  Ultimately we are trying to do the best for this young man and to highlight the concerns we have for one of our citizens.  I know that has been done at a certain level but all we are looking for is to raise it to the next level, namely, presidential level.  It could have an impact as we have quite a large Egyptian community in Ireland, many of whom will have connections in Egypt, maybe even with the Administration.</p><p>We are respecting Egypt but it has a different system.  There is the possibility of a presidential decree.</p><p> I will conclude by making an appeal, particularly to those on the Government side of the House.  This is not a hostile motion against the Government, the Minister or anyone else.  It is purely to see if we can assist the process.  My colleagues will speak for themselves, and I am sure they will endorse what I am saying, but we commend the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, on what he has done to date.  All we are doing is strengthening his position and allowing it to be raised, once it is considered timely to institute this particular motion.</p></speech>

Could we not send a letter to the Taoiseach on the basis that we had another discussion at this meeting on the desperate situation in which Ibrahim finds himself and the obvious concerns of his family and the wider community in Ireland; that we had another detailed report from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and had the opportunity, through a briefing from his officials, to recognise the ongoing work at official and ministerial level; that it was brought to the attention of the committee that the Prime Ministers of Australia and Canada made direct calls to their counterparts in Egypt on behalf of their citizens; and if it was felt by the Department and the Taoiseach's Department that such an intervention or a call by the Taoiseach to his counterpart in Egypt would be appropriate, we would welcome such an intervention to try to progress as quickly as possible the release of Ibrahim?</p></speech>

We do not know the conclusion the court will reach.  We believe the court will make a decision shortly.  That is the information that has been made available.  In those circumstances, we are better off waiting to see what will happen next.  There may be a need for an intervention, which would be unprecedented, but we do not know.  If matters proceed satisfactorily, my belief is that we should proceed with the least fuss because there is always a danger of the Egyptian court deciding to take issue with the interference by a foreign government at the highest level, which may be seen as an intrusion in its internal affairs.  It is very important at this stage that we do not aggravate the Egyptian authorities.  Our job is to be insistent, persistent and persuasive in the way we go about what we have to do.  We must remember also that diplomatic procedures that apply in all such exchanges must apply in this situation as well.  I do not know what will be the outcome.  No one in this room knows what the outcome will be of the court procedure.  They may decide at the next hearing that there is nothing they need to do as there are no charges to be answered.  We do not know.  They may decide otherwise, but I am not aware of any situation whereby we can demand a prisoner held on whatever grounds to be released.</p> <p>  I dealt with the Birmingham Six, the Guildford Four and all the people from this country who were imprisoned in the United Kingdom in the 1980s.  I attended the court hearings with a former Member of the House and Minister for Foreign Affairs, David Andrews, and Members from all sides, and we were conscious of the fact that we could not interfere with the courts and we could not be seen to be influencing the courts.  In one of those cases the prisoners were found guilty by the courts.  There were subsequent hearings and they were released and deported in some cases.  The courts had made their decision and that was the best that could be done.  No one could waive the charges, and the charges were not waived, but there were alleged miscarriages of justice.</p> <p>  We are dealing here with more distant and less familiar circumstances.  If the committee wishes to adjourn the discussion pending the court decision, I have no problem with that.  I believe we should leave the options open to the Minister for Foreign Affairs and allow him continue the work he is doing.  I have no difficulty with Deputy Brendan Smith's suggestion of writing to the Taoiseach and the Minister for Foreign Affairs reiterating the concerns of the committee and the need to ensure that an Irish citizen abroad is being treated properly and that in the event of the situation developing in a way we do not want, we have a different procedure to go through.</p></speech>

Sadly, members not just of this committee but of the Parliament have decided that the old tactic of shouting and roaring from the backbenches contributes more effectively than the diplomatic route being taken by our diplomats.  If there is a serious decision from the Egyptian courts, subsequent to the petitions being decided on, it is implicit that the Prime Minister of the country would plead on behalf of the convicted.  We do not know yet if anyone will be convicted.  It is presumptuous to suggest, in terms of the Taoiseach intervening, that at this stage we would burn our final bridge before a decision on the petitions is taken.  My plea is that we wait and allow our diplomats work behind the scenes in a diplomatic way and wait for the decision of the petition because the lad might be released there and then.  However, if we call in the Taoiseach at this delicate stage, we might provoke the situation.  It is my belief that the more public this case is becoming, given the allegations of torture and the counter position of our ambassador, we are not doing the Halawa family any favours.  We should wait on the outcome of the petition and see how the judiciary in Egypt views the petitions presented.  It is hoped the lad will be coming home.  If not, that will be the appropriate time for the Taoiseach to intervene.</p></speech>

There was nothing from their departments of foreign affairs or their Ministers for foreign affairs.  It was the direct intervention that worked.  We welcome all the work the Minister for Foreign Affairs, the officials and the ambassador in Egypt have done, but in the case we are referring to, it has been proven that it was only the direct intervention of the Prime Ministers of the countries concerned that secured the release of those citizens.  That is why we are asking our members to support them.  There are 426 people on trial.  The chances of a mass trial being fair to this Irish citizen is, to put it mildly, limited.  Amnesty International has said he has no case to answer.</p> <p>  Reference was made to it being improper to interfere but the Prime Ministers of Canada and Australia interfered, if that is the correct word - I would call it intervening on behalf of their citizens - and they were successful.  We must not say we are doing everything possible because everything possible includes the Taoiseach getting involved.  Nowhere in that letter did they say that they might get the Taoiseach involved.  They are saying they are doing their bit.  It did not work for the Canadians until the Prime Minister got involved.  That is why we are asking for the Taoiseach to get involved in this particular case in order that President el-Sisi can do what he did for everyone else.</p></speech>

There is no case so far against Ibrahim Halawa.  What is the goal of the committee today?  For all of us, the goal is to obtain the release of Ibrahim Halawa.  We received a very strongly worded letter today from the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade on the issue.  I ask the members to read it seriously line by line to see what is in it.  I quote one part:<blockquote><br /><br />Now that the formal application for release is being considered by the Egyptian court, it remains the considered view of the Government that the work necessary to assist in reaching a positive outcome in this case, which is ongoing and continuous, is [most importantly] best done in a low key, measured and resolute fashion.</blockquote>I direct members to the end of the Minister's letter, the last line of which reads, &quot;I intend to be active in this case in the coming days and will be in touch again with you before the Easter break&quot;.  We are all saying the Minister is doing a great job and no one here has undermined his work or that of his officials here or in Cairo, including ambassador Moylan.  I ask the members of the committee to take on board what the Minister, Deputy Flanagan, says in the letter he has sent them.  They should take on board what is happening here.  We can revisit the case in the next two weeks to see what the story is if nothing is happening.  I believe something positive can happen in this case if it is left to our officials and embassy to continue to make representations for the release of Ibrahim Halawa.  It is hoped it will.  This is what we all want.</p><p>Rather than jeopardise anything that might happen in respect of Ibrahim Halawa, we should wait and see.  The judge has indicated he will accept oral and written submissions from lawyers on a particular date, which is something that has not happened before.  There is a great deal of progress being made and I ask the members to let the embassy and Minister do their jobs in the coming few weeks to see if we can get Ibrahim released.  Bringing it to another stage now might undermine the role of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></speech>

We must follow the example that worked, not the one that is not working.</p></speech>

Our embassy staff and officials are in Cairo and they are following this very closely.  They feel this is the best way forward in Ibrahim's interests, and we need to take note of that.

The members should let matters go on as they are and if they are not coming to a successful resolution, we can revisit the case in the interests of Ibrahim Halawa.  This is what we are all interested in.  We are interested in the release of this young man from a prison in Cairo.  There is a great deal happening and it should be allowed to go ahead without us adding any confusion to it.</p></speech>

This is not identical to the cases of the previous prisoners who were released.  This case is different.  Amnesty International said that Ibrahim Halawa has no case to answer.  In the event that is true, and I accept what Amnesty International says, the procedure being followed so far is the correct one.  In the event of there being a different outcome, which happened in the other cases, the ultimate intervention must take place.  However, that is a different story.  In that case, the judicial process will have been concluded and the matter will then be in the ambit of anyone to intervene in a way that is appropriate.  My view is that we do not fire our best shot at this stage as we do not know what the eventual outcome will be.  It might well be resented by the courts as they will be conscious of the fact that people in Mr. Halawa's home country and Oireachtas Members are obviously concerned.  If one begins to try to influence the court in any jurisdiction, whether one's own or otherwise, it may not go down very well.  It is not something we should play politics with either.  We should minimise that and recognise that this is a delicate situation.  Someone's well-being and possibly their life are at stake, in which case we should proceed in the best way possible to ensure the best possible outcome.</p></speech>

It is based on Deputy Smith's suggestion.  We should follow up on the correspondence we received this morning from the Minister on what is happening and also send a copy and a separate letter to the Taoiseach on the committee's concerns about Ibrahim Halawa asking that every effort be made by the Department to ensure his release.  That might be a compromise.</p></speech>

That is important.  I am still having difficulty understanding the reluctance to accept the motion that has been put.  There is no time factor in it.</p></speech>

I have accepted everything and welcome the Minister's letter.  I do not understand the reluctance because the motion does not have a time factor.  While I accept there is a judgment call as to whether one does it before or after the court process, I am mindful that the courts have been postponed many times.  He has been in prison for almost two years.  As has been said, he has no case to answer.  From my observations having been there and seen what was going on during the protests, in all probability he has no case to answer.  The problem is that this seems to be a group trial of 426 people.  I cannot see a situation where the courts are going to find that none of the 426 people has a case to answer.  That is unlikely.  How long more will Mr. Halawa continue to be in prison?  I appreciate ambassador Moylan's efforts having recognised that Ibrahim Halawa was with criminals.  I have a concern that the longer he is in the system, the greater the danger of radicalisation.  We have all seen the outcome of that.  He is probably in prison with people who have been radicalised.  I see an urgency about the matter.</p> <p>  I ask for a clarification on the letter.  I commend the ambassador on intervening to get him moved from a cell with convicted criminals.  The letter says the request was agreed to by the prison authorities.  Has it been implemented?  It is one thing to agree, but another to implement it.</p><p>Is he removed from that prison cell?</p></speech>

Members are talking about the court case but I again refer back to the letter, which states:<blockquote><br /><br />The hearing was different to previous postponed hearings as all defendants were present and the judge indicated that he would accept oral or written submissions from the lawyers present on behalf of their clients.  The trial was then adjourned until 26 April to allow consideration of the petitions made.  Lawyers have been informed by my Department that a decision on the petition is unlikely to be made before 26 April.</blockquote>There will, therefore, be a decision on the petitions on 26 April.  We should support the Minister in his efforts in this regard and inform the Taoiseach about what we are doing as well rather than attempt to bring it a step further, which could jeopardise the release of Ibrahim Halawa.  Will Senator Daly withdraw the motion for a few weeks before putting it again to the members after that date because something will hopefully happen in the interim?We should support the efforts of the Department and the Minister and we should let the Taoiseach know that we are supporting them and that we are serious about the case of an Irish citizen incarcerated in an Egyptian prison</p></speech>

On 26 April, the motion will be put to a vote, if needs be.</p></speech>

Let me introduce myself.  I am &Aacute;ine N&iacute; Chonaill, PRO of Immigration Control Platform and I am accompanied by my colleague from the executive committee, Mr. Ted Neville.<br/><br/>Immigration Control Platform was founded in January 1998 as non-governmental organisation seeking strict immigration control and not an excessive level of immigration.<br/><br/>Let me begin by reminding the committee that the two most fundamental duties of a state are the maintenance of law and order and the defence of the borders of the State.  In today&rsquo;s Europe, that defence of the borders of the State is no longer against military attack, but against illegal immigration.<br/><br/>Illegal immigration is the modern form of invasion.  This is readily seen when one sees images of boats heading like an armada across the Mediterranean, but it is no less invasion when it is the more clandestine type of illegal immigration experienced in Ireland.  There are many different types.  It may be so-called &quot;students&quot; whose intention was to abuse the system to gain access to the labour market.  It may be people issued with deportation orders who went on the run and many other categories.  In all cases, these are people who are effectively giving two fingers to the State and its citizens, saying: &quot;No, you won't decide who comes to live here and what limits there will be.  We will decide, not you.&quot;<br/><br/>The State is not an abstraction; it is us collectively.  The defiance of the State which is illegal immigration is an offence committed against the citizens of Ireland.  To quote a former Secretary General of the Department of Justice: &ldquo;It is the absolute right and bounden duty of every sovereign state to control its borders, in the interests of its citizens.&rdquo;  We would particularly emphasise the phrase &quot;bounden duty&quot;.  We hear of the right of states to control their borders but we never hear of the duty of the state to do so, and in the interests of its citizens.  Dealing with illegal immigration is part of that defence of the borders and it is not done by saying: &quot;It's o.k.  You can stay.&quot;<br/><br/>Ireland now has one of the higher levels of immigrants per head of population in the shown by recent EUROSTAT figures, but the authorities, and particularly politicians, have not woken up to that fact.  The level of deportations of illegal immigrants is risible - mere tokenism.  In 2014, we deported 111, we do not have a breakdown of the figure into failed asylum seekers and illegal immigrants.  There were 237 voluntary returns; making a grand total of 348.<br/><br/>In contrast, the following figures come from the Migration Observatory at Oxford:<blockquote>In 2013, 50,741 people were removed from the UK or departed voluntarily after the initiation of removal.  This figure excludes individuals refused entry at port and subsequently removed, in order to focus more clearly on what most people understand by deportation.</blockquote>The UK's population is about 14 times that of Ireland.  A proportionate level of deportation from Ireland would give a deportation figure of 3,624, more than ten times the actual figure.<br/><br/>With the permission of the Chairman, may I ask my colleague to deal with the fiscal elements?</p></speech>

If we take even the lowest estimate of the MRCI figure, that gives us a figure of 17,400 illegals in jobs which should be held by people who are instead on jobseeker's allowance.  The costs to the State of jobseeker's allowance for that number of people is over &euro;170 million per annum.  For clarity the figures round to just under &euro;10,000 per annum multiplied by 17,000 giving the figure of &euro;170 million per annum.  To put it another way - deporting an illegal immigrant, at the most recent figures we have, costs approximately &euro;3,500.  In light of the figures just mentioned, the &euro;3,500 would be recouped from a mere four months of savings of jobseeker's allowance, for persons who are consigned to that situation.  In our view, these figures show the massive monetary harm done to Irish workers and to the State by illegal immigrants.  The committee might be interested in the text of an e-mail received by the Immigration Control Platform on Friday, 31 October 2014. <blockquote><br /><br />Dear Sir/Madam,<br /><br />Where is the best place to report illegal immigrants who work in Ireland? My wife is about to lose her job to an undocumented Chinese girl.  I must stress that my wife is also Chinese but is married to myself, an Irish national, and she has worked here paying tax for the last ten years.  She is being let go as she is here legally.</blockquote>ICP has not even touched on the further harm which is caused by the downward pressure on wages occasioned by the employment of illegal immigrants.  The Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform has worked very reasonably with the Migrant Rights Council of Ireland, MRCI, in dealing with people who were no longer legally present through no fault of their own, when they had perhaps been assured by their employers that their work permit had been renewed and then found that it had not.  The reactivation scheme was set up to help such people, administered by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  We have no objection to such a scheme because there is no brazen defiance of the laws of the State involved.  This reasonableness has been a hallmark of the authorities.  When then justice Minister, Dermot Ahern introduced belated reforms to deal with student visa abuse, one of them was a seven year maximum on the length of time one could be on a student visa.  This was introduced with great consideration during the transitional period.  For example, if someone was half-way through a course they were allowed to finish it.  That consideration was acceptable.  What was not acceptable was what former justice Minister, Deputy Shatter did under the 2004 student probationary extension scheme, where he effectively gave an amnesty to 2,661 students who had exceeded the seven year maximum, plus an unknown number of spouses and children.  Those 2,661 were told &quot;You may stay and work in Ireland for ever,&quot; thereby keeping 2,661 Irish or legal immigrants on jobseeker's allowance.  We want to see no more of that injustice done to our citizens by an amnesty for illegals.  No amount of dressing up a scheme with criteria will change it from being, effectively, an amnesty.  Thank you Chairman.</p></speech>

It has been our practice to treat the matter of numbers as an internal matter.  We have never given an answer to journalists and we will not allow them now to get it indirectly.  I make that point because it would be of some relevance if there were several NGOs like ourselves working on this side of the debate which is a very contested matter all over Europe.  It appears to be the case in this country that there is no other organisation, except our own, working on this side of the debate.  It has been said there are somewhere around 200 working on the other side of the debate.  If there were other organisations besides us, it would indeed be a matter for the committee to know which of us was the biggest one.  However, since we are the only one and since all surveys and polls in Ireland show that between 60% and 65% of the population says it does want controls and it does not want immigration to go too far, we consider we have a valid voice to represent that type of opinion without dealing with the internal affairs of our organisation.</p></speech>

Given that we have thousands of Irish people leaving our shores every year emigrating to other countries can the witness respond to the use of this kind of emotive language in relation immigration and this country's history?</p></speech>

On the business of us having a history of emigration, the answer is - so what?  It is our business to run the country in the interest of our citizens.  I was once on holiday in Norway, not that many years ago, and our guide was a well educated man - a third level lecturer.  I raised this mantra with him, that which we hear in Ireland about our history of emigration.  Norway would be the other country in Europe closest to ourselves in having a very strong history of emigration.  I said to him we hear that "with our history of emigration now it is our turn to let people in".  I asked him if this was said in Norway.  He could not believe what I was saying.  It is not something one hears in any other country.  People in Ireland do not seem to know much about the fact that Germany, between 1850 and 1900, supplied never less than a quarter of all the migrants to the United States.  It is a country that somehow people do not seem to associate with emigration.  If one said to the Germans "you supplied a quarter of America's immigrants between 1850 and 1900, now it is your turn", they would laugh at you.</p></speech>

That is why we challenge their view.  The final thing I will say is very important.  It is a fact of modern life that emigration is a reality, whether it is an economic issue or a social issue or a human rights issue.  Should we not just get on with it?</p></speech>

I believe the hypocrisy, if there is hypocrisy, is wholly and solely on the legislators and the Government of this country for pleading in America for illegal Irish, and putting that position against our situation here in Ireland.  Undoubtedly it is a failure of the State through many generations that it has not been able to productively employ its people in their own country, and that is a great shame.  However, it is not a <i>quid pro quo</i>, that because we went abroad to America as a nation of emigrants, as people from many other countries did, we are then bound to accept limitless quantities of people from Africa or sub-Saharan Africa or Asia or wherever else.  Jurisdiction for controlling immigration in the US is properly a matter for the United States Government.  I do not see it as the Deputy is perhaps implying to some extent, as a population swAp.  It certainly has been a poor feature of the State since its foundation that it has not been able to find productive employment for its own citizens - it is a great failure.  I lament that during the illusory boom we had at the turn of the century, at a time when there were many illegal Irish in the US, that we as a Government and as a State did not actively seek and publicise that we wished those people returned to this country where they could be legal.  Instead employers, driven by all kinds of agendas, were much happier to bring in foreign people who could be employed very willingly at possibly lower rates of pay and so forth.  Our duty in the boom, which has gone, was to bring our expatriated people home to work productively in their own country.  We did not do that.</p><p>It is rather lamentable that we now have to go cap in hand with bowls of shamrock every St. Patrick's Day around the world asking will people take our Irish from us and keep them.  We should want them here.  That is what we should have done and we did not do it.  I do not see a <i>quid pro quo</i>as a population swap between that situation and us taking peoples from all over the world without limit and without input.</p></speech>

Obviously, the reciprocity there would be that if they legalised our illegal immigrants we would have to legalise the small number of American illegal immigrants.</p> <p>  I would like to take up this idea one hears about the hypocrisy of the Government.  Quite frankly, it is rather infantile to accuse the Government of hypocrisy in the sense that it is surely rather puerile and ridiculous to expect that a Government will----</p></speech>

I am just saying one frequently hears that the Government is accused of hypocrisy for seeking an amnesty for our illegals and not giving people amnesty here.  What I was saying is that it is a very silly notion that any government would simply put its citizens only on the same basis as citizens from all over the world.  If the Deputy stood for election and said, "I do not care any more for Irish citizens than I care for the citizens of China or Pakistan" he would not get elected.  It is normal, natural and expected of governments that they will root for their own citizens and will have the brass neck to look for special concessions for them.  Hypocritical it may be but it is what every government everywhere will do.</p></speech>

There is on our Statute Book a law which is the Illegal Immigrants (Trafficking) Act 2000.  The Statute Book by the way does not recognise that the other terminology, illegal immigrants, is the proper terminology.  I hope I have answered Deputy McFadden.</p></speech>

If one were to follow the report of this debate on <i>thejournal.ie</i>, the majority of the comments would be in support of the two speakers.  If we talk about asylum seekers and the direct provision system, the majority of comments on <i>thejournal.ie</i>will be opposed to the asylum seekers and supportive of those who would ask they be deported.  We have a major issue in Ireland that we need to be honest about.  The truth of it is that the two contributors today actually speak for a view that is widely held, privately, in Ireland today.</p><p>Here is my point.  Ireland is the only country in the world that today has a population lower than it did in the early 1800s.  A book was written in 1986 by a man called Raymond Crotty called <i>Ireland in Crisis: A Study in Capitalist Colonial Undevelopment</i>.  The author identified that of all the children who had survived childhood from the foundation of the State, half had emigrated.  Of course, we had the 1980s and emigration - I am a Donegal man so I know all about emigration.  My father, grandfather and I had to emigrate, not as asylum seekers but for economic reasons.</p><p>Having stated those things - through the Chair but obviously directed to the contributors - I ask how, with that knowledge of our history of economic migrants across the world, can we say we will not accept asylum seekers in Ireland?  How can we not have a position that would regularise those who have been living here in Ireland for long periods?</p><p>What I understand right now of policy is not that Ireland would open its door for all to come as has been the case for the Irish people through the ages, but that we would regularise those who have lived here for three or four years or more and allow them to continue their lives here and return to their families.  You may have seen the testimony to this committee of a man from the Philippines, which was deeply moving.  Indeed we are deeply moved for our Irish citizens who give similar testimony over in the United States.  Leaving aside ideological perspectives, we are all decent human beings here.  How can we as an Irish people with that history allow a situation where we would not regularise that or allow genuine asylum seekers to stay in this State?</p></speech>

When this debate is reported on <i>thejournal.ie </i>this evening, and in respect of previous debates on this subject matter, I am saying that the majority of the comments will be in support of Ms N&iacute; Chonaill's view.  We have to be honest that her's is not some view on the fringes in Irish society.  Large numbers of Irish people share her perspective.  That is the basis on which I put my questions to her.</p></speech>

That is an entirely separate issue and not on the agenda of today's meeting.  We would be delighted to be invited to speak to the committee about asylum seekers, but they are not at all the subject of our proceedings this afternoon.</p> <p>  With respect, we already answered the point about our history adequately.  I am pleased but astonished to hear the Deputy say he does not want an open door for all to come here.  I have in front of me the text of motions passed at the Sinn F&eacute;in Ard-Fheis in April 1998.  Motion No. 26, which was passed unanimously, states: "Sinn F&eacute;in will work for the achievement of the optimum position of no restriction on immigration into Ireland."  Motion No. 27 states: "Sinn F&eacute;in deplores all attempts to limit the numbers of political and economic refugees into the country."  Perhaps the Deputy's party has changed its policy on the optimum position being no restriction on immigration, but I was not aware it had done so.</p></speech>

My first point related to sentiment expressed on <i>thejournal.ie</i>, which I clarified for the witness.  On my second point, I said that the suggestions I have heard in respect of possible Government policy do not include a proposal for an open-door approach.  What is being proposed is the regularisation of economic migrants who have been in this country longer than three years.  My question is not about Sinn F&eacute;in's policy but about what is being proposed, as I understand it, in terms of changes to legislation, as suggested by groups working in the sector.</p></speech>

The committee has before it a supplementary sheet which highlights the Government response every time regularisation is mentioned, namely, that member states agreed the European Pact on Immigration and Asylum at the European Council in October 2008, which made specific commitments to use only case-by-case regularisation rather than generalised regularisation under national law.  It is considered problematic to do otherwise.  One of the ways of dealing with illegal immigration, particularly in ensuring it does not go further, is to make it very clear that a particular jurisdiction will not be granting amnesties.  The problem is not that granting regularisation tomorrow would lead to people in Africa or Asia saying, "Oh, the Irish have granted regularisation, let us head over there."  Rather, it is that in the medium to long term, the message goes out from European countries - and we do not want to be among the number sending that message - that people who become illegal immigrants, stick around for long enough and manage to stay under the radar will wear the authorities down because it is the latter who will blink first.  That is what this is about; these people know the authorities will turn around in this sort of situation and say, "Oh, look, we really must let them stay."  They know they will wear the authorities down and it is they who will blink first.</p></speech>

Internationally, likewise, there is a range of empirical evidence to show that regularising the status of migrants who are contributing to a country's economy for a significant period provides a net economic benefit for that state.  Does Ms N&iacute; Chonaill have any evidence to the contrary?</p></speech>

I understand where Migrant Rights Centre Ireland is coming from in one sense, but its comments regarding tax seem to me to be a red herring.  By its own admission, almost all of these people - 87% - are working here and half already pay tax.  I assume many of them, as the MRCI witnesses admitted, are in minimum wage jobs.  I am not too sure whether such workers are even in the tax net.  Indeed, I understand some 30% of workers in this country do not pay any tax at all.  Many of these migrants, as admitted by MRCI, have PPS numbers.  Unfortunately, there is no difficulty, as there certainly should be, for an illegal in Ireland in obtaining a PPS number.  I checked how one goes about getting a PPS number and it turns out one needs nothing but a valid passport and a utility bill.  One does not have to prove legal residency.  MRCI's point about an increased tax take is very strange because, by its own admission, many illegal migrants are already paying tax.</p></speech>

However, I will move on and put my final question.  In Ms N&iacute; Chonaill's view, should all of the hundreds of thousands of Irish emigrants working illegally in the United States and other countries be deported back to Ireland?</p></speech>

It is a fact that people who are perceived as being illegal immigrants in this country are frequently subjected to abuse and sometimes to physical attacks.  What is the witnesses' view on whether using language such as "armadas of immigrants," talking about people coming here and "giving two fingers" to the State, and referring to people from sub-Saharan Africa and Asia, could lead to situations in which people are either verbally abused or physically attacked?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.485" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ted Neville" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015040100002#D01200"><p>I do not see how the Deputy could possibly object to the words "Asia" or "sub-Saharan Africa"; they are geographical, descriptive terms.  We would have no geography taught in our schools if those terms were banned or deemed to be abusive or likely to lead to abuse.  That is not a terribly logical point.  A situation may arise in any jurisdiction where there is not a contrarian opinion expressed in parliament through elected representatives which seeks to give some representation to the concerns of populations within that country as to what is happening all around them.  The single greatest change that has happened in Ireland since I was born in 1957 is that 20% of people now living in the South were not born here.  That is the real figure to consider and it is quite astounding.  It was never the policy or platform at any party's Ard-Fheis or annual conference, or whatever they are called, to announce, "Hey, great idea - we are going to change the demographic of Ireland.  We are going to, by one means or another, allow a 20% foreign population to live here."</p><p>Meanwhile, 50,000 young Irish people will leave annually simply to acquire a job, which is what is happening.  In a short period, Ireland will have a population not entirely dissimilar to that of Russia post the Second World War, with a whole generation of football players and soccer players, young apprentices and skilled people who are not here but in Australia, America and Canada.  I do not think it is a particularly mature situation for a country to turn a blind eye to that once those people have gone on the plane and forget about them.  One has to place hard facts.  This country has 350,000 unemployed people, yet it continues to import a workforce from other countries, while our own people are emigrating and while our own people are unemployed and unable to find gainful employment or, perhaps, are being forced to work at rates which have been artificially driven down by the influx of people who are quite happy to work for very much less in pay.  That is the situation that has not been represented in our parliament.  It then falls to a few people like us who are of a contrarian opinion to point this out, and some people may not like the contrarian opinion.</p><p> May I draw one analogy very briefly?  Great plaudits are being given to and interest expressed in the banking inquiry about people who did offer a contrarian opinion.  I am just making a point of principle, not an exact comparison.  It is now thought that it would have been a good idea, perhaps, if we had listened to those contrarian opinions, whether they were liked or not at the time.  All I can say to the Deputy and the committee is that it would not, perhaps, be an undue indulgence for it to consider our contrarian opinion.  It has a basis, and as the Deputy who has left has kindly remarked, it is the position held by the majority of Irish people as expressed in various opinion polls.</p></speech>

I will say this: Irish elections are held in one particular context.  They are held in the context that immigration is not discussed.  At the risk of upsetting anybody, a vow of silence is taken by every Deputy here before every election not to discuss immigration.  It is painted to us as not discussing racism.</p></speech>

I declare an interest at the outset.  The last time I met Ms N&iacute; Chonaill she was wearing a sandwich board outside the gates of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and holding a placard about something I had allegedly said or done.  I cannot recall what it was about.</p> <p>  I do not agree with anything our two guests have said.  That they are so much out of touch with Irish society and Irish thinking is beyond me.  I cannot put into words how far removed they are from any normal thinking in society.  Following on from discussions I had with the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland and its presentation here today, I launched a Bill which is in the lottery for a Friday sitting.  It is an earned regularisation Bill for undocumented people in Ireland, for which I think there is broad agreement across all the parties in respect of its principles, although there may be differences in regard to the minutiae of how it would be rolled out.  If we were to regularise undocumented people in Ireland, that would be hugely beneficial.  Many of them have put down roots here.  The vast majority, up to 90%, contribute positively to society.  It is a fact that two-thirds of them are working in the shadow economy.  Regularising their position would prevent some employers from preying on them as vulnerable people and using them to suppress official wages.  For all the reasons stated by the Migrant Rights Centre of Ireland, it all points to a positive.  An alternative is to engage in mass deportations - that is not an option.  The other alternative is to do nothing, but that is not an option either.  It is an issue we should face up to.  It is not fair to say it is an amnesty.  It is not credible for people to come in here and make a presentation saying they do not have a view on the parallel situation that exists with the undocumented Irish in the US while saying they can present with credibility about the undocumented here.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.522" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine N&iacute; Chonaill" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015040100002#E03700"><p>The Deputy has mentioned his Bill.  I am glad he did because I consider it extraordinary that the MRCI, which is the advocate <i>par excellence</i>for regularisation, did not consider that it should go further - in reasonableness, apparently - than asking for people to be regularised who had been here four years.  The Deputy, in his excess of zeal to rebrand his party, has decided to bring forward a Bill which provides that if they are here for a mere two years they are to be regularised.  May it bring the Deputy joy.<br/><br/>On the second matter of deportations, the Deputy said one cannot do nothing, and asked what does one do.  We have already said that a level of deportation proportionate to that in the UK would have us deporting 3,500 people per year.  If one deported 3,000 or 4,000 for the next few years, one would soon arrive at 20,000.  One will never deport all illegals.  One deports as many illegals as one can detect.  There is not a Government in the world that would be able to hold its head up and say there is not an illegal in its territory.  On the issue of what we can do about illegal immigration, an illegal immigrant cannot live on fresh air.  As we all agree, they are mostly in jobs.  That means somebody is employing an illegal.  That is an offence according to our work permit law, but one never hears of anybody being charged with hiring an illegal, as far as I am aware.  We made a suggestion to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, which has not been taken up, that it mirror an action taken by the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Joan Burton, which apparently has been successful.  On the Department of Social Protection website there is a facility to report people whom one suspects of being engaged in social welfare fraud.  It can be done anonymously, and I understand it has been a successful operation.  We suggested to the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation that it put on its site a similar facility to report people suspected of working illegally.  That would be an enormous help, because detection takes time, resources and manpower.  I should mention also, if I may, that there is a problem with the National Employment Rights Authority.  When I say that, I mean-----</p></speech>

Does either of the witnesses believe there could be any reason, be it humanitarian, ethical or other, for the Irish State to regularise even one undocumented migrant?  Many migrants have come to Ireland as a result of human trafficking or have become involved in prostitution and sexual violence, and we have had a lot of discussion on that.  Are the witnesses saying that in all cases of undocumented migrants the State, provided it can detect them, should deport them?</p></speech>

Perhaps their employers had assured them they had obtained or renewed a work permit but had not done so.  We do not object to the scheme mentioned in paragraph 8 of the statement in regard to these people.</p> <p>  Ministers replying in the D&aacute;il to calls for regularisation have said that any illegal immigrant may approach the authorities and ask for their case to be considered if they feel they have special circumstances.  They may then be treated as special cases or they may be deported.  </p> <p>  I am very interested in the Senator's reference to trafficking.  I heard an expert speaking on "Six One News" after a conference on the subject, who said there was great confusion about trafficking.  Almost everybody who is eventually considered as trafficked began as somebody who had themselves knowingly smuggled.  They did not know the terrible things that were to ensue.  Trafficking is enslavement.  If people are trafficked onto our territory it is our duty to remove them from that state of enslavement.  Once they are removed from their enslaver, who would hopefully then be severely punished, they revert to being no longer a victim but a perpetrator.  We rescue them from their enslaver but then they are back to where they were, namely, an illegal immigrant.  The answer to the question is "Yes, it is proper to deport them."</p></speech>

I am greatly disturbed by what she had to say in response to my idea on human trafficking.  It seems Ms N&iacute; Chonaill objects above all to the numbers of people who might possibly move through a regularisation process rather than the idea that some undocumented migrants, in some circumstances, would be allowed to remain.</p></speech>

Illegal immigration is an abuse of Irish citizens and it is offensive to think that we would allow an illegal immigrant to stay except under the very special circumstances about which I have spoken - namely, those who fell into illegality through no fault of their own.  I have also said that there could be very special circumstances and, as I said earlier, Ministers replying in the D&aacute;il to calls for regularisation have said that any illegal immigrant may approach the authorities and ask for their case to be considered if they feel they have special, compelling circumstances.  If there is no special case, they should be removed.</p></speech>

I stress that I support the principle that the arguments made by the Irish Government in Washington should be the same as those we articulate here about our illegal immigrants.  There should be an equality of our ideas in this context, but what is missing from the presentation today is a humanitarian consideration of people who are driven by economic reasons to cross borders all over the world to look for work.  Part of the process in Ireland is very slow, especially the part relating to people's rights to challenge a deportation order.  I am faced on a weekly basis with people who are challenging such orders in the courts and the problem is that many cases have been in process for five, six, seven, eight, nine and even ten years.  Due to our legal system the decision is delayed for a significant number of years and in many cases these people's children have gone through primary school and are valued and important members of the community in the local national school.  They are wanted on the local football team, the local soccer team or the local volleyball team.  Do the witnesses see that there is a humanitarian issue arising from the delay in the processing of their applications and that this gives them a valid case to be allowed to stay?  Would the fact that the community in which they live wants them to be part of that community be a factor in considering an amnesty for these people?</p></speech>

There is undoubtedly huge inefficiency, leading to a protracted process, and we hear regularly from asylum seekers who have been in the system for many years.  The facts are not regularly stated but I will try to do so.  The first stage in the process whereby an asylum seeker tries to remain in the country is to make an application for asylum and, on foot of the result of the application, he or she may appeal.  It should be better known that the average time for processing the initial application is approximately 18 or 19 weeks, and the average time for the processing of the second stage - the appeal - is approximately 13 to 16 weeks.  Cumulatively, this comes to no more than six months, by which stage every asylum seeker has received an answer from the State as to the legitimacy of their asylum application.  It is often claimed that people are languishing in Mosney or Hatch Hall for 11 years without an answer, but they have their answer.  They just did not like the answer, but so be it.  It is the State's duty to provide those answers.</p> <p>  Having got their answer, asylum seekers do not lack clarification as to their position, but the remainder of the process, the finalisation of the case, is incredibly inefficient, and in this period these people have children and become part of the community, and local people feel they should stay.  The State should be far more efficient in processing the stages subsequent to the first two.  It is now doing this quite efficiently by managing it within six months.  We have to give these people an answer more quickly.  If the answer is "Yes," they stay; if it is "No," they go.  At the moment it is a system which is easy to play out.  Se&aacute;n Aylward, the former Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, has said that asylum seekers will fight up to the steps of the aeroplane.</p><p>Why would they not do so if they want to stay here?  Anyway, they do that and they have succeeded in doing that for prolonged periods at great cost to the State.  It is rarely mentioned how great the cost to the State is.  In any D&aacute;il term, &euro;1.5 billion supports the entire asylum operation.  It is extremely expensive.  It should be far more efficient and streamlined.  If people get their answer, they should take their answer.  Then the country should, in conscience, enforce the answer; it has a duty to its citizens.</p></speech>

Does he not see that if we regularise the position of all of those people then at least we would recognise the humanity of the families concerned, their commitment to their communities and their children?</p> <p>  This is an issue comes to my door.  If and when it arises, those children cannot go to third level.  They cannot pay the significant fees because they are not deemed to be citizens of the State or the European Union.  Are we going to cast those families into perdition?  The Immigration Control Platform would drive them from the State, but I strongly argue that we should regularise their position.  Whatever adjustments need to be made legally for new people coming in future, we must make the case that those people are entitled to stay.  They have done their time and they have made and continue to make valuable commitments and contributions to Irish society.  People want them here.  That is very important too.</p></speech>

When these families are deported, as they should be, I suggest that the children in question should wave good-bye to Ireland with great gratitude and say that they have received X years of free education in this country despite having no right to be here.  Moreover, although they had no right to be in the country, they have gained a high level of English, which gives them an advantage in the globalised jobs market.  Ireland, at the expense of the taxpayers and in spite of their illegality, has been very good to them and they should thank the country as they leave.  That is my answer to the Deputy.</p></speech>

The level of support among the general population for a greater degree of control on mass immigration is quite significant.  The Deputy is right: we did not get elected when we went before the public on the issue.  Irish general elections tend to veer off on many other things and certain issues get left behind.  I was making the point, to the ire of several Deputies, that at election times they do not discuss immigration.  In the context where something is not discussed and a void is left, it is difficult for people who wish to debate the issue to have an airing and a forum.  The media rather compliantly and generously follow the politicians' lead and will not bring up immigration as a big issue.  Therefore, it does not get discussed.<br/><br/>One particular poll gives some indication of the level of support for the general position we hold.  The source may be surprising.  In October 2009 <i>The Irish Times</i>conducted a poll.  It asked people for their views on immigration.  Fully 72% of people said there was either too much or far too much on immigration into Ireland.  This was a poll by <i>The Irish Times</i>in October 2009.  It did not get a long ongoing discussion in the columns of <i>The Irish Times</i>, but that was the result and the newspaper was fair enough to publish it.  Why does that not get translated into an election result?  That is a question.  I have it to say to Deputies that there is legitimately a pact put before all Deputies - it will be done again next year - to the effect that they are anti-racism.  They are and we are too.  That is quite fine and we have no problem with that; there are no racists here.  The problem is that this is used, unfortunately, to encompass valid discussion of immigration.  Since no one wants to get anywhere near the issue of racism, we also park immigration and a discussion of same.  Therefore, there is no discussion in our general elections on the subject of immigration.<br/><br/>An election is due to happen in another country, our nearest neighbour, within the next month.  They are in a similar situation to us.  In fact, they have probably had a smaller percentage of mass immigration into their country in the past ten years.  Immigration is straight up as one of the issues to be discussed.  Properly so, because their public representatives are giving voice to what their constituents are telling them.  The Deputies may say they never hear from their constituents about this matter and that they do not bring it to their clinics.</p></speech>

I could walk down the road to my nearest Deputy and put it to him as well, but I know he will not stand up on his hind feet in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, face the camera and start talking about my concerns about immigration.  It is not mentioned in either of the two Houses of the Oireachtas.  It simply is not discussed.  Deputies have a duty, and I envy them.  I would love to have been in the House, but I am not, and with 2% of the vote I will not be.  The Deputies who are there are disenfranchising even 15% of the population by not maturely discussing immigration and by using the terms and opinions that we heard earlier from certain members.  I do not think that really adds to the situation.  That is my challenge.</p></speech>

We regularly do so.  Also, there are a number of politicians - I disagree with them - who have raised the issue during elections to try to get votes.  Anyway, I will not go back over the history lesson.</p> <p>  My final question relates to the Immigration Control Platform organisation or group.  It is interesting that Mr. Neville has referred to politics.  Does the group target constituencies on the issue of immigration by sending out thousands of leaflets into certain areas, particularly poorer and disadvantaged areas?  Is that part of the group's work?  Has the group done that in the past two years?</p></speech>

We were outraged at this and said that their constituents should be made aware of what they were trying to do.

I want that on record. I would never sign up to anything like that, because that is an outrageous thing for anyone to say.  There is no pact within Fine Gael, and I speak for Fine Gael.  Not to let my manners go astray, I want to thank the witnesses for coming before the committee, as I did not thank them initially.  I want to thank them for making my mind up for me completely - not that I needed them to do it.  After what I have heard today, I completely support the Migrant Rights Centre Ireland.  After hearing the tone of the witnesses' opening statement, I completely support MRCI. The Immigration Control Platform has just made it more firm for me, and I thank them for that.</p></speech>

In the first paragraph of her opening statement, Ms N&iacute; Chonaill mentioned the image of boats heading like an armada across the Mediterranean, which is a reality that we know.  Why does the witness think the armada of boats is coming across the Mediterranean at the moment?</p></speech>

It has been said that some of the increase in this is due to the appalling situation in Syria.  However, when I see what we are talking about on the television, it is frequently not Syrians but obviously people from Africa.  There is a constant migratory pressure on Europe, but the utter chaos in Libya since the fall of Gadaffi is apparently among the reasons.  Actually, the Libyans had been co-operating with Europe, apparently,  in preventing boats from leaving for Europe, and that has completely collapsed now.  People come from much further south to Libya to cross.  They were previously prevented from doing so, but they no longer are.  The phenomenon has become massively greater.</p></speech>

Could I put it to the witness that the desperation of these people must be absolutely enormous to face such terrible hazards to try and get to Europe?  They must be leaving something absolutely dreadful at the other side.</p></speech>

I can only speak for Immigration Control Platform.  I am not here as an individual.  The issue of rescue attempts not being made, as the Chairman puts it, has never been discussed, so I can only say the following and let it sit there: when these rescue attempts are made, what is happening is that someone is invading Europe and for the first time in history Europeans are aiding that invasion.  The whole understanding of these matters has been turned on its head.  That is all I can say.  One is looking at people who are invading Europe and one is looking at people assisting the invasion.</p></speech>

This armada of boats, if I can put it to the witness, with respect, is because of the horrific situation in Syria and across north Africa and further south.  People are driven because of race, religion or otherwise to try and survive with their lives in many instances.  Their choice would probably be not to have to leave their homelands at all, but if they do not they may be massacred and slaughtered.  They come to the Mediterranean and many have died.  More have been rescued.  I put it to the witness that she herself mentioned an armada across the Mediterranean, so I suggest that she probably did discuss it.  She uses those terms and likens it to a military attack.  I wonder whether putting the two together - military attack and illegal immigration - is a little bit strong?  I would suggest to the witness that when people are coming across on boats that may sink at any time, leading to the deaths of many hundreds of men, women and children, I do not believe it is fair to liken it to a military attack, which is a different type of armada, something like the Spanish Armada, which failed, or the Second World War armada which crossed the English Channel.</p><p>Some of the language Ms N&iacute; Chonaill is using might not help the cause she is presenting.</p></speech>

I am looking at the third line of our opening statement, which reads: "In today's Europe, that defence of the borders of the State is no longer against military attack, but against illegal immigration."  We specifically state that they are not the same.  I mean no disrespect when I say that it is for our organisation to set our agenda.  We will not take direction from the committee as to what we will discuss.  These are difficult things to have to say.</p></speech>

Africa cannot sustain its population properly.  Europe is seen as Valhalla, a place of refuge, but there is a limit on the number of people it can hold and on what valuable and productive inputs people can make in a European industrialised situation.</p> <p>  As to people drowning at sea, the Chairman described a human tragedy.  It is compounded by the fact that European governments have sent out a signal that people should keep coming and that they will be placed on Lampedusa and brought to Italy and Germany.  The European Parliament suggested that camps should be set up on the north African coast, with the agreement of the Governments of Libya, Tunisia and so on, that would receive people on the African continent and try to support and relocate them within Africa.  By not doing so, governments have made the Mediterranean a fortress to cross.  It is dangerous.  The humanitarian tragedy is inexorable and will increase as long as Europe continues to receive people.  We have to rescue them from the sea; no one is suggesting that we let them drown.  Boats, ships and drowned people will be the reality unless Europe states that it can only hold so many people and would prefer to support them on their own continent of Africa.</p></speech>

The committee is sitting today in its capacity as a joint committee on public service oversight and petitions.  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off as they interfere with the broadcasting system.</p> <p>  I am pleased to welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in who has responsibility for new communities, culture and equality.  I thank him for taking time out of his busy schedule to be present today.  I am sure members will be very interested to hear his views on the direct provision system and the progress of the report on direct provision.</p> <p>  Members agreed as part of the 2014 work programme that there was merit in conducting focused work that would address in a determined manner how the direct provision system works, the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the direct provision system and the extension of the remit of Freedom of Information legislation to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the direct provision system, including all the suppliers of goods and services whether from the private or public sectors.  The work of the joint committee commenced on 22 October 2014 with public hearings at which the joint committee invited the Irish Refugee Council, Anti-Deportation Ireland, Doras Luimn&iacute; and SPIRASI to address members.  It was subsequently agreed that members should visit four direct provision centres and on 27 January 2015, a delegation visited the Great Western House direct provision centre in Galway City and the Mount Trenchard direct provision centre, County Limerick.  On 10 February 2015 a delegation visited the Mosney director provision centre in County Meath and on 26 February 2015 we visited the Clondalkin Towers direct provision centre in Clondalkin, County Dublin.  The hearings with the Irish Refugee Council, Anti-Deportation Ireland, Doras Luimn&iacute; and SPIRASI set the scene for members as to issue of concern.  The visits to the four direct provision centres crystallised the issues in the minds of those who were part of the delegations.  In terms of the report the joint committee will publish, the focus will be on the extension of the remit of the Ombudsman and the extension of the remit of freedom of information legislation to cover all aspects and bodies associated with the direct provision system.  We wish to engage with the Minister responsible for this area.  Given the Minister of State's work and initiatives, both policy and legislative that are in train, it was agreed, in the context of the committee's report, that it would be important to have an exchange of views with the Minister responsible.  In was in this context that an invitation was issued to the Minister of State, which he accepted.  I am, however, aware that the chief executive officer of the Irish Refugee Council, Ms Sue Conlan, resigned from the working group on the asylum seekers issue.  At the time the invitation issued it would have been impossible to agree with the Minister of State that an unexpected, sudden resignation from the working group would be an agenda item.  Accordingly, I am sure as a practising politician, the Minister of State will understand that while I will keep the focus on extending the remit of the Ombudsman and on freedom of information legislation, I will allow members to put questions on breaking news, a position the Minister of State will understand and will give him an opportunity to update the committee.</p> <p>  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015040100002#C00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for inviting me to speak today on the direct provision system for accommodating applicants for international protection.</p><p>I have been to the forefront in seeking reform of this system and to that end I very much welcome the committee's interest in this matter.  It is my wish that this engagement today helps not hinders the ongoing consultative process which I will explain in more detail in a few moments.</p><p> The direct provision system came about in the context of an unprecedented increase in the numbers of asylum seekers coming into the country in the late 1990s.  At that time, the majority of protection seekers lived in Dublin and were treated as homeless which involved emergency accommodation and local authority housing.  The shortage of accommodation reached crisis point and the then Eastern Health Board understandably could not cope.  There were reports of protection seeker families sleeping in parks.  In November 1999, the Government resolved the crisis by having the needs of protection seekers met by a system of direct provision which involved the dispersal of protection seekers throughout the country.  It is 15 years later and more than 4,400 persons live in 34 asylum accommodation centres throughout the State, which is a reduction from 60 centres in 2008.  That is a simple statistic.  If one drills down further, one will see the human element involved.  Of these residents, approximately one third are adult males, one third are adult females and one third are children.  Drilling down further, 36% of residents have been in the overall system for up to three years, 43% for between three and seven years and 21% for seven years or more.</p><p> Everyone living in direct provision has his or her own story to tell.  They may be at different stages of the protection determination process or may even have taken a legal challenge against a negative decision made in respect of them.  Indeed, they may be at the end of the process but cannot move on.  For example, more than 500 of the residents in the direct provision system have permission to remain in the State but cannot move on because of difficulties sourcing private accommodation.  Moreover, almost 600 residents have deportation orders outstanding against them, the vast majority of which issued over a year ago.  They are required to report periodically to the Garda National Immigration Bureau.  There are many reasons orders are not or cannot be enforced, including the issuing of legal actions, the making of sequential protection applications for members within a family group, the absence of the travel documents required for the return to the country of origin, and so on.</p><p> Members of the committee have visited centres to see for themselves the conditions in which residents live.  I have done so too.  I have visited a centre in Sligo, two in Waterford, two in Limerick, one each in Galway, Laois and Clare, three in Dublin and also Mosney.  Members will have seen, as have I, that all residents share the common experience of a life revolving around waiting and hoping.  Residents cannot cook for themselves, engage in work or otherwise gainfully occupy themselves during the day.  It has to be said that the direct provision system does not exist in a vacuum.  It has to be seen in the context of the overarching international protection processing system of which direct provision is but one element, albeit a very important one to those who have to avail of its services.  To make progress on direct provision, it is necessary to address both it and the protection system itself in a coherent, thought-out fashion.  This is what the Statement of Government Priorities 2014-2016 commits us to do.</p><p> In terms of processing, last week the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Fitzgerald published the general scheme of the international protection Bill, the aim of which is to reduce waiting times for asylum applicants.  The key purpose of the Bill is to replace the existing multi-layered protection determination system with a single procedure, the aim of which is to enable timely and efficient protection decisions to be made.  This single procedure will identify at a much earlier stage those who are in need of international protection and will be granted status and those who have no entitlement to stay in the State and who can safely return to their country of origin.  The single procedure has been requested for many years by many NGOs and others.  The intention is for the Bill to deal with as many of those who are currently in the system as possible.  A practical approach is envisaged with those who have reached a certain point in the existing process continuing along their current path while others at earlier stages of the process will be brought within the single procedure.</p><p> In addition to committing to legislative change in this area, the Government has set up an independent working group to report to it on improvements to the protection process, including direct provision and supports for asylum seekers.  It is chaired by former High Court judge, Dr. Bryan McMahon, and comprises senior officials from all relevant Departments, the UNHCR, representatives of academia and various NGOs who have a long-standing interest in this area and other representatives of civil society.  The working group developed a work programme early on and established three sub-groups to deal with the following themes.  The first deals with conditions in centres, the second deals with supports for asylum seekers and the third deals with improving the processing of protection claims, essentially the long-stay problem.  Almost 40 meetings at plenary and sub-group level have taken place since the first meeting of the working group on 11 November 2014.</p><p> The working group has taken evidence directly from residents in the direct provision system both in writing and orally, visited centres around the country and spoken directly to residents.  It has engaged with particular groups of applicants including children, victims of torture, victims of trafficking and sexual violence, members of the LGBTI community and has taken oral and written submissions from a number of experts in this field, including the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon.  The chairman of the group has publicly stated that these contributions have informed the sense of urgency that has underpinned its work.  He has gone on to say that all of its members are genuinely engaged in the task at hand, namely to identify a set of recommendations to Government for improvements that will bring tangible benefits to existing and future applicants.  The chairman says that the deliberations of the working group are at a crucial stage with each of the sub-groups developing their proposals for submission to the plenary group over the next number of weeks.  The Government recognises that the issues to be examined by the working group are complex and require thorough consideration to ensure that any recommendations are practical and sustainable from a budgetary perspective and do not undermine existing border controls and immigration policies.</p><p> When I wrote to the committee on 21 October 2014, I said that I hoped to be in a position to brief members on the first stages of the working group's work.  At that time, I had anticipated that the working group would issue an interim report.  However, as is the right of the independent group, it decided not to issue an interim report and proceeded with its work on the basis that it would issue a singular report.  While the agreed terms of reference do not indicate a timeframe for the working group's deliberations, I understand that it will be only a matter of weeks after Easter when the report will be ready.  The working group published its work programme in November 2014 fleshing out the issues to be discussed by each of the three themed sub-groups to which I referred earlier.  I arranged for the work programme to be circulated to the committee before this meeting.  From my own perspective, some of the key issues relate to the scope for residents to prepare their own meals within existing or new physical structures; limitations on the length of time persons spend in the direct provision system; financial supports; and improved processing times.  It would be futile and damaging at this crucial stage of its proceedings to second guess the work of the group.  We have to allow it to complete its work.  I do not propose to engage in any detailed discussions on any of the issues in the work programme on which the working group may make recommendations.  That is the group's job.  I have every confidence in the capacity of the chairman and members of the working group to do their work.</p><p> This is a difficult subject.  I have no doubt that there have been robust discussions within the working group.  As practising politicians, we know that negotiations and discussions are sometimes hard and that there are varying shades among the membership of any group engaged in such discussions.  We all recognise the importance of working together to achieve real tangible change.  I am firmly of the belief that more can be achieved within the working group than outside it.  I know the committee will allow the process to continue and to give it a fair wind.  As part of its deliberations, I had arranged for the working group to be provided with a transcript of the proceedings on this subject at this committee on 22 October 2014.  Similarly, I will arrange for a transcript of today's proceedings to be provided also.  I look forward to hearing the views of members on this matter.</p></speech>

In doing that, we have had to examine the direct provision system itself.  We are mindful that the working group has been tasked with that responsibility and we will respect its process and outcome.  We hope we can assist the group in its work.

I have been on trips to some of the centres.  Many issues were raised concerning the system's oversight, which was the initial reason for this meeting.  The Ombudsman also raised issues.  We have received interesting presentations.  For example, Doras Luimn&iacute; highlighted how social services had been alerted to more than 1,500 child protection or welfare concerns in the past five years relating to young people living in asylum centres.  Authorities had been alerted to numerous cases of inappropriate sexual contact between adults and young children.  Children are sharing bathrooms with unrelated adult men and women.  Children and teenagers share bedrooms with their entire families.  Children are often exposed to violent and sexual behaviour.  Long stays can lead to poor mental health and psychological development issues.  Living in confined spaces, a lack of fresh, nutritious food, no child benefit for asylum seeker children and witnessing and fearing deportations harm psychological development.  The Minister of State is aware of the large number of issues involved, but it is important that we put them on the record as having been raised with us.</p> <p>  The sense that I get from most of the speeches on direct provision that I have heard from the Minister of State and his predecessor is that, if we sort out the length of time people stay in the system, the issues will be solved.  After visiting the centres, I beg to differ.  Does the Minister of State agree that direct provision is inappropriate as a system of housing people who are seeking asylum?  The system is exacerbating people's difficulties, causing institutionalisation and creating a situation that is not healthy for the people living within it.  Therefore, the system needs to be overhauled and rethought.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.608" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015040100002#E00600"><p>I have visited a number of centres.  They vary in their standards.  Some are excellent.  Some are much less so.  I could envisage staying in some, but there are some in which I would not spend a night.  No matter what the standard of accommodation is, those who are seeking asylum do not want to live in direct provision centres.</p> <p>  I cannot stand over a system in which the issues that the Senator has outlined continue, that belittles people, in which people live hopeless, unproductive lives and where they stay for a number of years.  I could stand over a system where there was a number of excellent centres in which people lived fulfilling lives and engaged in training, education and more, where they stayed for just a number of months, not years, and where the issues outlined by the Senator no longer existed.  I cannot stand over a system in which the institutionalisation of families becomes a daily, weekly, monthly and yearly reality.</p> <p>  Initially, I was reluctant to engage with the committee on this issue because of the nature of the work that was being undertaken by the working group.  In my personal opinion, we could have a system of direct provision that afforded people their dignity, but that would only be possible if people living in centres had excellent facilities and a meaningful existence, were rooted in the hearts of their communities with all of the essential links, had genuine family lives and their stays were short, by which I mean six months and no longer.</p></speech>

Even if a stay were to last no longer than six months, such a system would need an independent oversight mechanism.  It is unacceptable that there is no such mechanism in place currently.</p></speech>

It is also the reason that the group comprises people from the Children's Rights Alliance who have child protection expertise.  I am sure that they are making their opinions robustly known and that the recommendations will be at the forefront of the report whenever it arrives on my desk.</p></speech>

It is a fundamental principle, but the decision to sign up can only be taken by the Government.  That decision will inform whatever legislation is to be introduced.  My understanding is that only two EU countries have not signed up to the directive.  It would give people the right to an education and work, issues that many asylum seekers raised with us.  They sit around day after day and cannot access the workplace.  As part of the new legislation, is it envisaged that the Government will sign up to the directive?  It would put in place the rights for which many of those involved are asking and, hopefully, reduce the level of grievances.</p></speech>

Many of the issues raised with us when we visited the centres related to how people must sit around in centres, cannot work and have no right to an education.  A part of the reason given for this is that we have not signed up to the reception directive, which would give people those rights.  Whenever this matter was raised in the Houses, we were told that the directive would be covered under the immigration, residence and protection, IRP, Bill.  We do not have that Bill now, but the protection Bill.  If we sign up to the reception directive as part of that, it should put in place rights for people after six months to work and have an education.</p></speech>

It made sense for the Minister to remove from that Bill the protection Bill, the general scheme of which has only just been published.  The intention is for the latter to undergo the pre-legislative stage before a committee.  It is within that process that Members can make their opinions on the EU directive known.  The working group will also have opinions in that regard.  I am not trying to be evasive, but I am minded of the fact that we established a working group that people were determined to keep independent.  It is for a deliberate reason that the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, and I have not been involved in the group, namely, we did not want a perception of political overtones in or unwarranted political influence over its work.  We wanted to ensure that people could make their comments or representations or do their work without involvement from or interference by practising politicians.</p> <p>  I expect that the members of the working group have made the Senator's points.  I expect that those issues will be to the forefront of their minds as they compile their final report, which is due a number of weeks after Easter.  I also expect that members of the justice committee will make the same recommendations during the pre-legislative stage of the protection Bill.</p></speech>

The group requested that the heads and the legislation's extent be discussed.  The stakeholder stated that issues like the reception directive, which should be taken on board during the Bill's development, were not discussed.  Therefore, and with great regret, Ms Sue Conlan on behalf of the Irish Refugee Council, IRC, withdrew from the working group, which was a major move.  There is a sense that the group is being used as cover to avoid going into some of the details.  Given what we have heard from the likes of Ms Conlan, however, those issues were not discussed prior to her reservation.  She felt that she had no other option but to resign.  To remain would have been construed as agreement with what was happening.</p></speech>

As I have outlined in my statement, I firmly believe that if one wants to get solutions the best place to be is in a room with people who are determined to find them.</p> <p>  I am committed to finding a way forward and want to turn the page on the current system.  Many people in the Houses of the Oireachtas have raised deep concerns about the system.  From the first moments I walked into this House people from all parties have raised concerns about the process and direct provision, in particular.  We have had quite a number of robust exchanges in the Seanad on the matter.  It is to the credit of Seanad &Eacute;ireann, in particular, for taking on the issue.  It has raised issues and concerns about direct provision with me for quite a while.</p> <p>  I know that the place for improvements and changes in the system is within the working group.  I know that the people in the subgroups have remained with the process and are determined to be part of something that will deliver real change.  This is a once in a generation opportunity, after 15 years of overseeing the system, to deliver something that will lead to change.  My decision to not be involved with the group in a hands-on manner was deliberate.  I trust the people engaged in the process and know them to be people of integrity, both within the Department and the various NGOs.</p> <p>  We have talked about direct provision for a number of years.  For many of the people involved this has been a 15-year campaign.  My involvement has been shorter and dates from my appointment as Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality.  We are so close to getting a report that will deliver change that I am willing to wait until I see it.  I believe the chairman and members of the group will be proud of their work and that we will, collectively, be proud of the report when published.  I have anticipated the recommendations and am sure that we will collectively look back on this period saying it was a job well done.   </p></speech>

In her letter of resignation she said:<blockquote><br /><br />The decision not to allow the Working Group, which contains experts on international protection law as well as lay people, to have sight of and indeed comment upon the Heads of the Bill is regrettable.  In addition, the intransigence from officials from the Department of Justice in attempting to reach a compromise over people in the system for more than five years, makes it impossible to reach agreement for a process that will give people in Direct Provision the relief that they need.  The draft report from the group which has been looking at living conditions, despite it being a report from the sub-group, from the perspective of the IRC, reads too much like a document of the Reception and Integration Agency.  </blockquote>I do not necessarily want to comment on her letter but it is important to put it on the record.</p><p>Private contractors is another huge issue.  Some of the figures put on record here, by Doras Luimn&iacute; in particular, are of huge concern.  It has claimed that Ireland has paid over &euro;850 million to private contractors for accommodating asylum seekers since 2002 while &euro;62 million was paid in 2012 and &euro;55 million was paid in 2013.  It was highlighted that many of these private contractors have been involved in property development, etc. previously.  Also, some of them have offshore accounts and have beneficial owners in offshore jurisdictions such as the British Virgin Islands and the Isle of Man.</p><p>There is huge concern over the actual set up of direct provision.  There is also no legislative framework and seems to be an <i>ad hoc </i>system.  Perhaps the Minister of State can tell us a bit more in terms of the following.  How are these companies contracted?  Are they publicly tendered?  If so, where are the tenders advertised?  How often are they advertised?  How often are the contracts renewed?  What is the criteria for renewal of contracts, etc?  An oversight of between &euro;53 million and &euro;55 million a year of Government spending is a huge area of concern.  Is such expenditure audited by the Comptroller and Auditor General, etc?  That is an area of huge concern in terms of the moneys involved as well as the private nature of the contracts, etc.</p></speech>

Not all services provided, on behalf of the State, are provided by State officials.<br/><br/>In regard to the issue of certain companies being registered overseas and so forth, it is important to point out that it is a condition of the contract that any company, that is contracted to RIA, provides a tax clearance certificate every year.  That means every single company that is engaged by RIA must be in good standing with the Revenue Commissioners.  <br/><br/>A lot of these centres were established quite a number of years ago and we have not opened up new ones in recent years.  In fact, we currently have 34 centres but at the end of 2008 we had 60 centres which means the number has almost halved over the period.  It is not an expanding business in that sense.  <br/><br/>By definition, because they are places where people live, there is a tendency to keep centres as they are.  We have had quite a number of difficulties and have had to close centres.  As a few of the members will be aware, the last major centre that we closed a number of years ago was in Galway.  It caused quite a deal of friction and difficulties because people had to be moved.  As a result, there is a disposition to stick with the <i>status quo.  </i><br/><br/>Contracts are negotiated and a negotiated procedure is provided for in EU law.  The Minister of State has made clear during several debates, and in response to parliamentary questions tabled about the matter, what will happen once this working group reports.  Several things happened which disallowed us from going for a full tender process, one of which was a significant number of court cases.  Last November we had a judgment on the CA and TA case which lasted quite a long period.  In fact, it was the third case and the previous two cases had been withdrawn by the applicants.  The court case lasted for six weeks and a judgment was issued in November 2014.  It has not finished yet and is possibly still in play.  The judgment challenged the entire direct provision system.  It means there is no way in the wide world we could go tendering for something that we did not-----</p></speech>

A number of things came into play as a result.  They were the court cases, the value for money report and, currently, a working group.  Once the working group is completed there will have to be a tender process.<br/><br/>Our procurement offices in the Department, the Office of the Attorney General and so forth are well aware of the procedures that we follow.  A fundamental difficulty with this matter is that we are not tendering for glasses, tables or microphones but for places where people can live and who are already <i>in situ</i>.  They have linked into the local community, attend local schools and have established various social networks in the area.  These issues must factor in a tender process.  For example, 600 people live in Mosney.  We could go for a tender process for the place and one may be able to get three centres to house 200 each but some distance away.  Is it possible to close down a centre like Mosney and simply provide living accommodation in places that may be some distance away?  </p></speech>

As the Minister of State has said, in response to various parliamentary queries on the matter, there will be a tender process as a result of all of this.  Even as things stand, we are not 100% sure as to what we will tender for.  The working group may come up with recommendations which, in turn, have to be decided upon by Government.

I have been to a number of reception centres over the years for different reasons, representations and so forth.  Visits were sometimes welcomed by the management and other times management were not happy with people visiting, especially public representatives, even if it was nothing to do with the conditions in the centre itself which were a problem in the past.</p> <p>  I note some figures from Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's presentation.  The first is that 21% of people have been in the system for seven years or more; there are 500 people who are, in fact, out of the direct provision system but still effectively in it; and there are another 600 who have deportation orders.  That is the equivalent of a quarter of all of those who are in the system.  I understand the question around the 600.  There are quite a number of people who will oppose their deportation order.  The fact that 500 people who have succeeded in getting the right to remain in Ireland cannot move beyond a direct provision centre beggars belief.  In some ways direct provision is subsidising what the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Department of Social Protection should be looking at because they are in centres and are being provided with food and accommodation.  Some of these centres are quite cramped.  If 500 people were taken out of the system they no longer have to be paid for but it might allow for greater space in some of these centres if they are still attended.  What can happen there?  </p> <p>  Does the Chairman want me to ask one question at a time? </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.653" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015040100002#G02800"><p>I will give my initial response to that.  I do not know if Mr. Dowling or Mr. Kelly want to come in on that.  On the people who are still in direct provision when they do not have to be there, I think there is a challenge for us in the future to find a step-down facility or a halfway situation because I think it would be unreasonable to expect somebody to go from a long period of living in a direct provision centre to trying to access essential services such as housing or social protection and not to have some kind of halfway situation.  I do not know what that would look like but certainly the figures would suggest that people are finding it difficult to transition from direct provision into community living or independent living and it is their own decision to stay within direct provision.  Certainly it is a challenge for us to find a resolution to that.  I assume in the most recent past that the housing issue generally in the country was part of the problem.  Does Mr. Dowling want to provide more context to that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.654" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Dowling" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015040100002#G02900"><p>It is a relatively new phenomenon in the sense that in the past it was not quite as acute as it is now.  The fundamental difficulty is getting affordable housing where people want to live.  The rent supplement differs depending on the area where one wants to get a house.  It is an issue that is being looked at in the context of the working group and the issue of transitioning from direct provision.  I really cannot go any further than that but there is a big problem facing not only former asylum seekers leaving direct provision but also the State the supply of affordable housing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.655" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015040100002#G03000"><p>The other issue is that if one has been in a centre for a number of years, if one's children attend the local school, if there is some kind of community linkage, or if one is doing some voluntary work in the community, then one probably wants to stay close to that general community in the short term.  That can also be a factor in people staying in the centre beyond the period when they have to stay.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.656" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015040100002#G03100"><p>I understand that.  Part of the reason people who are in direct provision want to stay in direct provision is the length of time they have been in it.  If that issue is addressed it will not be a problem in the future because most people will want to move on and try to access housing closer to schools and services.  If one is in Mosney one might not want to stay there for the rest of one's life; one might want to move closer to Drogheda or Balbriggan, for example.  If there is no alternative one will try to keep a roof over one's head.  I find it odd that there are people who are in direct provision who are in receipt of &euro;19 yet there are now 500 people who theoretically could be working or at least receiving some type of State benefit beyond the &euro;19 and they will be in the system and that will cause its own tensions.  I am not saying there is a solution.  Hopefully the working group will address that.</p> <p>  Mr. Dowling has mentioned that he hopes that the working group under Brian McMahon will report after Easter 2015 and I wish it luck in that.  Will Mr. Dowling publish that report as quickly as possible and also indicate what the short-term, medium-term, and long-term issues are because some of the issues that have been highlighted to us over the years and from the reports from the committee members who attended can be addressed quite quickly as they are minor changes to policy?</p><p>Other aspects are long term, including housing, which is out of the Minister of State's hands.  We need to see action very quickly so that, after the Minister of State receives the report, he will address elements within three months or six months.  Otherwise, it will be another report stacked on a shelf, which is how some people view these reports.  </p></speech>

Members are aware of the centres and I have also been visiting centres.  There will be a report to Government and the Government will decide to publish or not.  It is my expectation that it will be published and it should be published.  I agree with the Deputy there will likely be short-term and immediate fixes that could be introduced immediately and others are longer-term aspects.  The report is the beginning rather than the end of the process.</p></speech>

There is a hard core of people whose situation is very difficult to resolve.  Many of them may be involved in judicial review, which can take a long period of time to resolve.  While the numbers are decreasing, the proportion of people who have been there for a long period is staying.  Factors that produce that length of time are still there and, to a large extent, it is connected to deportation orders not effected and judicial review.  The general point made by the Minister of State is that the working group under theme three is looking at the issue of long-stay people.  That is an important point to note.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.663" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015040100002#H00700"><p>I pay tribute to Anti-Deportation Ireland, the Anti Racist Network and other groups that have spoken out on behalf of people in direct provision or, most important, the people in direct provision whose campaigning and protests brought this issue to the fore.  I remind the Minister of State that he and I travelled to a big protest in Genoa in 2001 for the G8 meeting.  One of the big slogans at marches attended by hundreds of thousands of people was that no human being is illegal.  I think the Minister of State chanted that slogan along with the rest of us.  The sentiment driving it is that all human beings deserve human rights and deserve to be treated with equality, dignity and decency.  The notion of human beings being illegal and consequently treated in a different fashion from other human beings is abhorrent.</p> <p>  The context of our discussion is a scandal and another shameful incident in Irish history, where a group of people have been denied the most basic dignity and human rights for a prolonged period of time in a way that requires immediate remedy.  We owe these people for the wrong done to them over the past 11 years.  This should not be a change of policy but we owe them an apology and remedy for what we have been put through in the centres.  That is the context of my questions.</p> <p>  The Minister of State has put a lot of emphasis on the working group and it is very alarming that some of the concerns of people who have campaigned on this issue, including the asylum seekers and the people concerned, expressed about the working group before it was set up now appear to have been realised by the decision of the Irish Refugee Council to come off the working group.  That is very disturbing and raises serious questions about the credibility of the working group.  I want to know what the Minister of State thinks about this.  Some of the concerns were expressed by campaigning groups before it was set up and the Minister of State has placed emphasis on the working group's recommendations and independence but now a credible player, the Irish Refugee Council, has resigned from it.  Does that worry the Minister of State?</p></speech>

If they believe something is wrong and must be remedied, fixed or reformed, the job is to find some way to do it.  People in the working group have been working incredibly hard and have been campaigning on the issue for quite some time, as have politicians in the House.  I give credit to some sections of the media.  We can be critical of them in the political system but I have great respect for a number of campaigning journalists.  They have given the human dimension and stories behind the reality of direct provision.  How do we come to a conclusion?  What is the best way of advancing the cause of those within direct provision sectors who want a life?  The determination of Government was to assemble a group of people who are experts in the field.  We could have been accused of having a working group made up of people who have a particular perspective but we invited people who know the system inside out from the advocacy point of view and asked them to play their part in finding a solution.  This involves people who are campaigners on the asylum system, the protection system, campaigners for children, academics, people with a trade union background and those with a history of finding solutions to real problems.  I want conclusion brought to their deliberations but nothing is ever simple in life.  I wish it were so.  In trying to find a solution, we must find something that will last and work.  We have inherited something I cannot stand over and I have made my language as clear and forthright as I can.  I am quite sure people in the Department of Justice and Equality do not like me saying things with such forthright language because it is a system they have been trying to deal with over a period of time.</p><p>What is more important than my position or the positions of those on the working group, is what will happen when that report is published and how it will affect the lives of people in the system.  I go to these centres and see the children there, and I consider their lives and futures.  I meet people, the same age as myself, who have literally been broken by the system.  I met a man in Limerick who was in a bad way when he got here, but the system we have has compounded his misery.  </p><p> I see children who do not have the basic family-based type of modelling for food preparation that every other child takes for granted.  It is very much a human reaction to a system.  It is not a black and white report.  We are dealing with human beings and their aspirations and dreams, which we have in our hands.  So what do we do with that?  We are charged with that awesome responsibility.  The best thing to do is to get in with like-minded people who are charged with looking after the system, to try to find a better one.  </p><p> The Deputy may have already rejected what the working group is doing.  He may have already rejected what the report says, even before he sees it, but I will not do so because I trust the people who are doing the work.  </p></speech>

My question was whether it concerned the Minister of State that a credible player like the Irish Refugee Council has withdrawn from the working group on the basis already alluded to by Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh.  To my mind, that raises serious questions about what is going on in the working group.  I have no doubt that there are other decent and credible people there, but there is something wrong if the Irish Refugee Council pulls out of it.</p> <p>  In advance of all this, concerns were raised by the asylum seekers themselves, their representative groups and others who advocate on their behalf, that the whole thing could just be a rubber-stamping of administrative changes that the Department had already decided upon.  That is worrying.  Everything the Minister of State says about the wrongs that have been done just echo what I am saying.  However, is the credibility of the process we are setting up called into question by a credible player like the Irish Refugee Council pulling out?  The Minister of State has replied, but he has not really answered the question.</p></speech>

Ultimately, these decisions come back to the Minister of State.  I take the point about bringing like-minded people together, which is fair enough.  We need to do that urgently because we are 15 years too late, but then it comes back to the Minister of State.  Some details are up for discussion about how exactly we do the right thing and that there may be some difficulties in doing so.  Other things, however, are not up for discussion.  First, we have wronged all the people who have gone though the system if, as the Minister of State rightly says, we cannot stand over it.</p> <p>  It is shameful what has been done to children and shameful that people have had that many years of their lives robbed from them.  It is also shameful, for example, that victims of sex trafficking are put into direct provision centres in completely inappropriate circumstances.  It is shameful that children do not have money to buy school books.  It is also shameful that they do not have access to proper health care due to prescription charges and lack of money.</p> <p>  Is it part of the remit to make as much recompense as we can to the people we have wronged?  Will the Minister of State say that that will be done?  We owe those people in the same way as we owe those who were in the Magdalen laundries and mother and baby homes.  These are absolute racing certainties, otherwise we are not doing what needs to be done.  We are not doing right by these people and it comes back to the Minister of State.  </p> <p>  Is the Minister of State worried about the Irish Refugee Council pulling out of the working group?  Can he say anything about what will happen, one way or the other, regardless of the deliberations of this group?  They have to happen because they are the right things to do.</p></speech>

The Irish Refugee Council can speak for itself, but the best place to be is making these points within the working group.  That is my answer to the Deputy's first question.</p> <p>  Second, I want this working group to succeed.  From its very beginning most people were willing to give the group a fair wind.  A minority were willing it to fail and tried to find reasons to pick holes in it.  Hand on heart, however, I am impressed by the composition of the working group, the issues it is addressing and the way it has set about its work.  The number of meetings it has had, including the establishment of various sub-groups, are also impressive.  </p> <p>  If the Minister, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and I had been attending every single meeting of the working group, we would be accused of political interference.  In addition, people would say the group was not independent and its members could not speak openly.  However, the working group has rightly gone out of its way to hear as many testimonies of the realities of living in direct provision as it possibly could.</p> <p>  We have a short time in politics and my time in this Department will most likely be short as well, with possibly a year to go.  In that time, more than anything, I want to achieve reform in this area.  I know that the working group will deliver that.  The Deputy may not have the same faith as I do, but I have it.  I trust that when the report comes out, and hopefully the Government will agree to publish it - I expect so - it will be the beginning of a whole new start for people in the protection system.  Their faith in the working group will have been justified.</p></speech>

However, faith is one thing but there should be a determination to achieve certain results which I do not think are open for discussion.  That is the point I am making.  Some things are open for discussion, but others are not.  I do not see how we can justify the system the Minister of State has inherited.  In fact, he has clearly said we cannot justify it and that something must be done about it.  I have not heard anybody put forward a credible argument in this regard, however.  I know what the Minister of State thinks and what he has expressed in the past.</p> <p>  People in the system deserve the right to work.  The working group could legitimately examine how that could be made to happen.  The Minister of State and his Government colleagues have to say that the end game, which will happen soon, is that asylum seekers will be allowed to work.  It is unacceptable, wrong, inhuman and degrading that they should be incarcerated for any substantial length of time in a situation where they are denied that basic right.  </p> <p>  What is the bottom line?  What are the red lines that are not negotiable?  It is the Minister of State's job to set them out.  How long do people have to be in the system before they are allowed to work?  We could debate that straight away, but the Minister of State might have an argument for doing so in six months.  There have to be certain bottom lines.  Children should not be put in situations where they could have inappropriate sexual contact.  Families must have proper cooking facilities, also.  These things should be clearly set out.  </p></speech>

I am mindful that the Minister of State agreed to come here before the working group reports.  He said he would have preferred to come before us afterwards in order to have a more constructive debate on the outcome.</p><p>I very much appreciate the fact that the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, has come today to allow us to get on with our report.  We will publish our own report in the near future and so will the working group.  Our hope is to complement the working group and to feed into its process.  I suggest that perhaps later this year, possibly in six months time, it might be prudent to invite the Minister of State back to discuss at that remove the outcome of the working group, our recommendations, what has happened since and where we go next.  That might be helpful.  I share the frustration of Deputy Boyd Barrett.  As Chairman of the committee I have visited the direct provision centres, as has the Minister of State, and all members present.  I also understand the limitations on the Minister of State.  Having already outlined his strong views on the matter, he does not want to be seen to direct the work of the working group but it might be helpful if we agree that in six months time the Minister of State could come before us again to recap on where we are at.</p></speech>

I have two brief points.  First, the assumption that some things are off limits to the working group is incorrect.  There are no limits to what can be discussed by it.  The right to work is being openly discussed.  I believe we are practically the only country in the European Union to have a limitation on allowing refugee applicants to work.  My views on the matter remain the same.  Assumptions have been made about the working group which do not stand up to scrutiny.</p> <p>  I welcome your suggestion, Chairman.  Every political system across Europe has been strangled with immigration.  We in this Parliament are spending time in the Seanad and in the D&aacute;il responding to oral questions and written parliamentary questions on trying to improve the situation for people who come to this country seeking protection.  That is a credit to these Houses and to the committee and other committees that wish to debate the issue.  I agree with your suggestion, Chairman.</p></speech>

I give credit to the Minister of State for at least enunciating the need to radically change the situation but I give most credit to the people in the asylum process who fought on the issue and demanded justice.  However, before we throw bouquets at ourselves for the fact that we are discussing it, we must deliver.  I hope we all agree on that.</p> <p>  I am pleased to hear the right to work is being openly discussed.  However, I do not think there is much to discuss except that must be allowed to happen.  Is an amnesty being discussed for those who have been incarcerated in a system that the Minister of State and everyone else have acknowledged is wrong?</p></speech>

Nothing is off limits, but I have not been at a working group meeting.  I am allowing the group to have the independence it sought.  The group is an independent working group outside of political interference.  I know the members are discussing all the issues the people in this room, those outside it and those who are in direct provision centres feel passionately about.</p></speech>

The other issue on which we have touched that is unacceptable is the veil of secrecy and lack of transparency and oversight in terms of what has been going on in direct provision centres, which have been excluded from the normal inspection and oversight process.  That is shocking.  We were all shocked by what was revealed in the clerk's report, when representatives from the centres came in and talked about the number of people who died in direct provision.  We do not know the full circumstances of those cases as there was no proper oversight.  It is shocking stuff.  There must be an absolute commitment that the situation will be fully remedied.  I accept there can be discussion of how we do that but there should be no doubt that it is going to be done and that the Minister of State is determined it will happen.</p></speech>

Understandably, there is public disquiet and concern about the resignation of Sue Conlan, but I also wish to send the clear message to the working group that we wish it well.  We will wait with anticipation for the outcome and reserve our deliberations until the process is brought to a conclusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.687" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1045" speakername="Derek Nolan" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015040100002#K01200"><p>I do not have many questions because the Minister of State has indicated on many occasions that he cannot answer questions on the working group.  We are not talking about our immigration system, we are talking about our protection system.  Our protection system is extremely important.  It is an international commitment by the country to look after those who by reason of persecution on the grounds of race, nationality or political opinion are fleeing their country and seek sanctuary.  That is something on which one would not get an international convention today if one tried to do it.  One would never get countries to agree to a system where they have an obligation to take people in.  We must cherish the fact that we have it and that it is up and running.  The protection system has been supplemented by European law on subsidiary protection on the right not be sent back to a place where one can be harmed.</p> <p>  Since day one in this House I have been extremely critical of the system of direct provision.  It is something of which I have personal knowledge from very early in my political career from doing constituency work and clinic work with President Michael D. Higgins, then Deputy Higgins.  We met people day in and day out who were in the immigration system.  We were in Lisbrook House, which was closed two years ago.  We met asylum seekers and saw them over a period of years.  We saw them change and lose something inside themselves.</p> <p>  I was banging my head, as were many other Deputies and Senators, for three to four years waiting for something to happen.  For all the good words we got from the previous Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Shatter, nothing came out of it.  We were constantly told that the immigration Bill was due in six months time but when one asked again six months later we were told it would appear in a further six months time, yet nothing ever emerged.  It was rare for the impression to be given that there was any desire to change the direct provision system.  That changed dramatically when the Government set out its mid-term priorities.  As I understand it, the T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Burton, negotiated that it would be a Government priority to address the direct provision system.  In the interim we have seen the protection Bill come into being and a working group was set up by the Minister of State.  That is something about which we can be extremely positive.  I, for one, am delighted something has happened.</p> <p>  Some members of the eminent group of people on the working group are no fans of the Government or the political parties.  They are very critical of the current system and want to change it.  I regret that Sue Conlan resigned from the group.  She gave her reasons.  The Irish Refugee Council, IRC, is perfectly entitled to take such a position but I would not like to see it as a reflection on the group itself because a lot of independent, good-minded people are still on it and by their continued participation on it, they take a different view as to how best to bring about change.  That should also be put on record.</p> <p>  The recommendations of the independent group will be brought to the Minister of State.  I acknowledge and respect the fact that he said he would come back to the committee to discuss it.  Many of us who have been very vocal on this issue are holding our fire while waiting to see what comes out of it.  When the Minister of State comes back to the committee I would like that we would not just discuss the report but also the supplementary issue of how the recommendations will be implemented.  There must be an action plan, timetable, timescales and funding models.  There is no point in getting all of this traction and finally getting something going to get a report that sits on a shelf.  The report must be implemented.  I will challenge the Minister of State in that regard because that is what I want to see happen.</p></speech>

As the Deputy has quite rightly said, we do not want a report, with recommended actions and Government support, but no timeline for those actions to be taken.  It is not my decision as to whether the report will be published but I assume it will.  On receipt of the report we can collectively ensure that whatever actions are recommended can be seen to be enacted.  The people in the centres and the system deserve and need that.  They need us.  People often correctly diminish politics in many circumstances but we are genuinely charged with the responsibility of looking after the interests of possibly the most vulnerable people in our country.  If a report comes in that again heightens expectations and people finally believe - after years and possibly a decade or more of being in the system - that there is finally a breakthrough, the last thing they want is a report that is put on the long finger or not implemented as a matter of urgency.</p> <p>  I accept the invitation to return if we can view it as a collective effort, across parties and non-partisan, to put our efforts behind ensuring that recommendations can be driven forward if they are accepted by the committee.  We have seen that done in the Seanad before.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015040100002#L00200"><p>Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh has indicated that he wishes to make an additional point but I will make some comments before that.  Our committee visited four direct provision centres and I am pleased we have done so.  There are issues of commonality between those who run and manage the centres and the asylum seekers.  It is universally agreed that the length of time for people remaining there is unacceptable.  These places were originally designed for stays of six months.  Without getting into detail and saying whether some centres were good and others were bad, I will speak to the overall system.  Citizens might be content to stay in some centres for six months but there are many where they would not be content to stay.  It is entirely unacceptable for people to be there for anything up to 14 years in any centre.  That is a universal argument from the people who run the centres, asylum seekers and anybody else involved with the process.</p> <p>  The issue of prescription charges is also important.  The cost is &euro;19 per week and prescription charges must also be paid, so that must be addressed.  There is also an issue regarding kitchen facilities.  One of the dynamics any parent has with a child is teaching them about cooking and cleaning; it is a social exchange of parenting from one generation to another.  The people in these centres come from a multitude of countries and cultures, with wonderful and rich ethnic aspects of food etc.  Food is at the centre of so many cultures and there should be an ability to have a place where people can pass on to children those cooking skills and enjoy the process.  The people who run the centres and asylum seekers stressed this as a common point.</p> <p>  I could be here for hours outlining my points.  There is also the issue of somebody having leave to remain but there being no housing available.  That is not unique to people in the direct provision system and it is true across Irish society.  The centres will continue to seek asylum seekers and house them until they can get housing.  If these people have leave to remain and the rights of every other citizen, should they continue to just have &euro;19 per week?  Do they have the right to a job and education?  Should they get the full social welfare payment and work out some arrangement with respect to food and upkeep?  Is there flexibility in this regard?  These are just some themes and I know the Minister of State knows the issues as well as I do.  I could go on but some of these matters stand out as something that could be addressed.</p></speech>

I may be giving a similar answer about not impeding the work or being seen to interfere too much.  The Chairman mentioned parenting and modelling food preparation.  That can sometimes be overlooked as a minor issue but it is not as we are talking about people's childhood.  Some people in 50 or 60 years will be saying that they spent their formative years in a direct provision centre.  That is strong in my mind in dealing with the issue.</p> <p>  Some staff in these centres work really hard and care passionately about people under their care.  They make the same comments to me, the others present today and people in the system.  Every day, they see the humanity and family life with which they engage.  A child playing with a kitchen may not know what it feels like to pour something and may not know how to ask for juice because they are not used to that model of parenting.  It has a long-lasting effect when we consider the responsibility that we have to try to change this system.  All these issues arise from a sense of care and what family life, human life and connectedness should be like.</p> <p>  Deputy Nolan's point is important as asylum is a sacred international status.  It is something that is very serious and important.  We are mindful of that but life is short, and childhood is particularly short.  When we composed the working group and gave out invitations, we wanted to have people with a child focus and understanding at the heart of deliberations.  I know that is the case so I look forward to the report being published and discussed here further.</p></speech>

There has been much discussion about the working group and proposals.  Everybody agrees there will be some form of change and a different system but currently we have a particular system and the transition will take a while.  Both of the ombudsmen are clear that they want oversight of the current system.  All the people we spoke to in the system have said exactly the same to us and it is within the remit of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, who is directly responsible to this committee.  Does the Minister of State agree there is absolutely no reason the ombudsman legislation could not be amended and extended to allow this remit?  That would allow a free, independent and impartial complaints system for those people who will be in the system today and tomorrow.  The ombudsmen want it now and it is important that we do it.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Frank Sheridan and Mr. Brian Breslin from the exploration and mining division of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and two other colleagues.</p><p>I wish to draw the attention to the fact by virtue of section 17(2)<i>(l)</i>of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if witnesses are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons, or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I wish to advise also that any submission or opening statements witnesses have made to the committee will be published on the committee's website after the meeting.

The draft of the Bill was at an advanced stage when, in November 2013, the Government adopted the policy to present the general scheme or draft heads of a Bill to the committee for pre-legislative consideration.  While the pre-legislative scrutiny process ordinarily occurs at the early stage of preparation of a Bill, the Chief Whip's office has endorsed the Minister's proposal that this committee be afforded the opportunity to consider the minerals development Bill in advance of its circulation to Departments and submission to Government for approval.  This best complies with the spirit of pre-legislative scrutiny arrangements and affords committee members an opportunity to provide input before the Bill is finalised.</p> <p>  The heads of the Bill were approved by Government in 2006.  In the meantime other urgent and priority legislative initiatives have impacted progress on the draft statute.  In the interim there has been positive activity in the sector whereby the number of active minerals and prospecting licences in place equals that of the highest on record.  There are positive indications from ongoing exploration activity and the addition to the forecast life of mine for the Bloiden Tara Mines Limited operation at Navan, arising from licensing of the south-west extension. </p> <p>  The economic assessment of the contribution of the minerals sector to the economy which was published in 2013 indicates that it is an important sector and a vital contributor to the regional economy in the vicinity of operating mines.  In 2012, Ireland was Europe's largest producer of zinc metal in concentrate and the tenth largest producer in the world, a ranking that continued into 2014.  Output in mining, as measured by sales turnover, amounted to more than &euro;426 million in 2012 and the activities of exploration and mining companies resulted in a total employment figure of 3,306 full-time equivalents, almost all of whom are employed outside Dublin.  The low import content in mining activity is important.  When indirect and induced economic activity is considered the overall value from the sector amounted to &euro;810 million in 2012, nearly double the direct production value.  To that end it is important that there be in place a modern statutory code suitable for the effective stewardship and development of the sector as well as to foster the discovery of new mineral deposits.  </p> <p>  The purpose of the Bill is to make better provision for the prospecting for and development, management and control of the mineral resources of the State in the interest of better regulation and to ensure that as many provisions as possible, pertaining to the minerals prospecting and mining, are contained in a minimum of statutes.  Most of the provisions of the Minerals Developments Acts 1940 to 1999 will be restated and those Acts will be repealed where appropriate.</p> <p>  The minerals Bill is likely to be one of the larger pieces of legislation that will come before the Oireachtas this year with almost 250 sections.  It will modernise and update all minerals legislation since the foundation of the State.  </p> <p>  I would hope that the following presentation will convey to the committee a sense of the scope, as the acting Chairman said, scale and complexity of the Bill and that my colleagues, Dr.  Eileen Doyle, principal geologist, and Mr. Brian Breslin from the minerals exploration and mining division and I can be of assistance to Members' consideration of the draft Bill in advance of publication.  I invite my colleague, Mr. Brian Breslin, to guide the committee through the presentation we have prepared.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-04-01a.707" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Breslin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015040100002#E00300"><p>We had prepared a Powerpoint presentation but, I believe, for technical reasons we cannot use it.  We have slides printed and we are making copies available.<br/><br/>Minerals exploration and development is currently regulated through the minerals development Acts 1940 to 1999.  This is done through prospecting licences and mining leases and licences with the work being undertaken by the private sector.  Mining means extraction of minerals and is referred to in the legislation as working of minerals as opposed to prospecting which is exploration. <br/><br/>The exclusive right to work minerals has been vested in the Minister under the Minerals Development Act 1979 with the exception of a small number of mines which at the time were in operation on a specific date since 1978.  Ireland is one of the leading zinc mining countries in the world and continues to attract high levels of exploration expenditure.  As explained by Mr. Frank Sheridan output amounted to &euro;426 million in 2012.  This is outlined in a study undertaken by Indecon consultants on behalf of the Minister in 2013.  Exploration and mining companies contributed a total of &euro;56 million in taxes  to the Exchequer in 2012.  The State also benefits from payments made by the prospecting and mining companies in the form of royalties, licence fees and other payments which amounted to &euro;9 million in 2012.  <br/><br/>It is well recognised that a single national system for regulating mineral exploration as well as clarity on the ownership of mineral rights is essential if private investment is to be attracted.<br/><br/>The proposed Bill will replace the legislation from 1940 which was enacted during the Emergency.  The mining industry in Ireland is currently regulated by five statutes which are listed in slide two of the presentation.  They are: Minerals Development Act 1940, Petroleum and Other Minerals Development Act 1960, Minerals Development Act 1979, Minerals Development Act 1995, Minerals Development Act 1999 - collectively referred to as the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999.  There is also a provision within the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006 which relates to specific powers for the Minister on the question of rehabilitation of a particular mine.  Those Acts include, <i>inter alia, </i>provisions for regulation of minerals prospecting and development, a statutory vesting of the exclusive right to work minerals in the Minister, subject to payment of compensation, compulsory acquisition of other rights necessary for efficient development of minerals, subject to payment of compensation; and the payment to the State of rents and royalties from the extraction of minerals.  <br/><br/>The background to the Bill is a Government decision of 2 June 2006 which authorised the drafting of the Bill.  It has been in the course of preparation for a number of years and its completion, as Mr. Frank Sheridan has said, has been interrupted on more than one occasion by diversion of drafting resources to other higher priority legislation.  The initial motivation to prepare the legislation remains the same today.<br/><br/>The objectives of the Bill are to provide a modern regulatory regime for exploration and development of State minerals.</p><p>It will regulate, in accordance with principles of social justice, the exercise of private rights in respect of minerals and ancillary rights and will reconcile their exercise with the exigencies of the common good.  It will provide for the continued vesting in the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources the exclusive right of working, selling or otherwise disposing of private minerals which are not in the course of development, subject to compensation, and it will provide for the preparation and implementation of rehabilitation plans for abandoned mine sites and to provide for consequential amendments.<br/><br/>The Short Title to the Bill is:<blockquote>An Act to make further and better provision for the development of minerals in the State and for that purpose to repeal the Minerals Development Acts 1940 to 1999 (other than certain provisions of the Minerals Development Act 1979) and the Minerals Company Acts 1941 to 1950, to make consequential amendments to other Acts, and to provide for related matters.  </blockquote>The matters referred to in the Title relate to the procedures for compulsory acquisition in respect of ancillary surface rights; the method for the calculations of rents and royalties; and the basis for payment of compensation in respect of private minerals.  The Bill will provide for greater transparency and predetermination of terms, including rents and royalties, which will streamline the permitting process and will bring other aspects of the regulation of the mineral sector in line with best practice, having due regard to the constitutional protection of property.  <br/><br/>The Bill does not directly address environmental matters because these are considered more appropriate to the EPA and local authorities.  In any event, the legislation which established the EPA specifically precludes the Minister from attaching conditions to mining permits which are designed to limit or control emissions to the environment.  That is a matter for IPC Licensing.  Nevertheless, our legal advice is that the Bill must take appropriate account of these matters, in particular to address obligations under the Aarhus Convention.  This convention, which has been ratified by Ireland, relates to access to information on the environment and public participation in environmental decision making, in addition to access to justice in that context.  The implications of the convention for exploration and mining were carefully considered in close consultation with the Attorney General and the provisions of the Bill in that regard have been drafted accordingly.<br/><br/>The Bill is divided into eight parts.  Part 1, shown on slide 11, deals with preliminary and general matters.  This part of the Bill provides standard provisions such as short title and commencement arrangements, scope and interpretation.  It provides that the Bill would apply to all minerals within the State or within designated areas of the continental shelf and that, for the purposes of the Bill, as in previous legislation, &quot;minerals&quot; do not include stone, sand, gravel, clay, turf, peat or petroleum.<br/><br/>Part 2 deals with prospecting and sets out the administrative practice for prospecting licences from application to surrender.  Provision is made for public notice and consultation prior to issuing prospecting licences and for the payment of compensation for damage or nuisance arising from prospecting for minerals.  Provision is made for a new type of licence known as a &quot;retention licence&quot; where the holder of a prospecting licence has discovered a mineral resource that cannot, for a variety of reasons, be brought into production immediately.  It also provides that the Minister, in assessing the public interest of an application, must take into account the economic benefits of the region as well as the environmental impact of the proposed exploration programme.  <br/><br/>Provision is made for the Minister to make regulations regarding the setting of conditions to be attached to a prospecting or retention licence.  A new requirement is that prior written consent will be required for boreholes, trenching and bulk sampling.  While trenching required consent in prior legislation, the other two activities only required prior notice.  Although the regulation of airborne geophysical surveying is a matter for the civil aviation authorities, provision is made for the Minister to be notified of such surveys and for the submission of data.<br/><br/>Part 3 deals with working minerals.  The 1979 Act vested the exclusive right to work minerals in the Minister, subject to the exception of minerals being worked at the time and registered as such, and provided for the granting of that right by the Minister to third parties under licence subject to the payment of compensation to the mineral owners on extraction of the minerals.  This arrangement will be continued under the Bill.  It is a long-standing policy that an application for a licence to work minerals will only be accepted from holders of a current valid prospecting licence over the relevant area.  This policy is now being given a statutory basis.  The main objective is to eliminate the difference between private and State minerals from the developer&rsquo;s perspective, providing greater predetermination and clarity of terms, both financial and non-financial.  Where previously there were leases on licences to extract State or private minerals depending on the ownership of the minerals, there will now be a single instrument to be known as a &quot;mining licence&quot;.<br/><br/>Part 4 deals with ancillary rights.  In order to carry out extraction of minerals efficiently it is necessary to carry out a variety of other activities which are not strictly mining and these are referred to as &quot;ancillary rights&quot;.  The existing legislation provides that the holder of a State mining lease or licence is entitled, during the currency of such lease or license, &quot;to enter on the land on or under where such minerals lie and use such land in such manner as may be reasonably necessary for the working of such minerals or for any purpose incidental thereto.&quot;  This may well have been too broad in scope by today's standards.  <br/><br/>Current legislation also provides for compulsory acquisition of land and rights over land necessary for the efficient working of minerals.  The Bill will clarify what rights may be necessary for working minerals and will divide these into ancillary underground rights and ancillary surface rights for licences issued henceforth.  It will also bring the compulsory acquisition procedures into line with modern best practice.  While it is considered necessary to have these compulsory powers in place the truth is that they are rarely, if ever, used.<br/><br/>Part 5 deals with rehabilitation.  In the case of current mine sites it is the responsibility of the mine operators to properly close and rehabilitate the sites when activity has ceased.  Mine applications in the modern era, as part of the planning applications process, are subject to an environmental impact assessment and require properly drawn-up closure plans to be prepared, with financial sureties in place to provide for the implementation of the closure plan together with its aftercare monitoring and maintenance.  <br/><br/>This part of the Bill, which is based on Part 9 of the Energy (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2006, provides that in certain circumstances the Minister may, having consulted with the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, designate a mine site or adjacent land as a rehabilitation area.  The Minister may make such a designation in respect of a site where a mine has been abandoned or where operations have permanently ceased if it is necessary for the safety of the public or animals or to address major environmental damage.  On designation of an area as a rehabilitation area the Minister may develop or adopt a rehabilitation plan for the area and may implement the plan or authorise a local authority or the Environmental Protection Agency to implement one.  This does not, however, affect any obligations of the former lessee or licensee, the owner or occupier of the mine site or any other person who may have obligations in respect of the site.  The Minister also has the power to recover through the courts any expenditure incurred by implementation of the rehabilitation plan.<br/><br/>The Minister may, with the consent of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, acquire private land either by agreement or compulsorily for the purposes of implementing a rehabilitation plan.  The Minister is required to undertake a public consultation process before making such an order and may, if he or she considers it appropriate, appoint a hearing officer to hold an oral hearing to evaluate objections.  These provisions relate only to legacy sites as modern mines are well regulated in this respect and closure planning takes place before the mine is opened.<br/><br/>Part 6 provides for the continuation of the Mining Board, which has been in existence since it was established under the Minerals Development Act 1940.  The board adjudicates on various issues arising under the Acts, including compensation issues.  It consists of a chairperson and two ordinary members who are appointed by the Government on the recommendation of the Minister.  The chairperson shall be a practising barrister or solicitor of at least ten years' standing.  Each ordinary member shall be a person who is a property arbitrator under the Property Values (Arbitrations and Appeals) Act 1960.  The provisions relating to the board are being updated in line with current best practice.  New provisions in the area of ethics are provided in line with current legislation regarding other statutory boards.<br/><br/>Part 7 deals with enforcement and miscellaneous provisions.  It mainly contains standard provisions which are restated or updated where necessary.  Penalties in respect of offences such as unlawful prospecting or working of minerals are brought up to date in line with current practice.  Injunctive powers are being provided for in respect of continuing offences and in the case where the Minister might be prevented from undertaking certain works.</p><p>Provision is also being made for the appointment of inspectors to enforce the Act; a requirement to notify the Minister of bore holes drilled for reasons other than prospecting or mining, and in relation to data collection in respect of those; divesting of intellectual property rights in the Minister relating to processing of data collected under the Acts on this Bill; the registration of minerals which were exempt from the statutory vesting under the 1979 Act, and other miscellaneous matters.  Part 8 deals with transitional provisions, repeals and consequential amendments.  It provides for various transitional arrangements including the continuation of any licence or instrument granted under previous acts, on the terms under which they were granted, until renewed under the revised legislation.  Applications for prospecting licences or mining leases and licences made before an enactment of the Bill will be deemed to be for licences under this Bill unless the Minister has already given notice of his intention to grant such a licence.  </p><p> Chapter 2 sets out the Acts which will be repealed by the Bill and Chapter 3 lists amendments to other Acts as a consequence of this Bill.  The Act also contains a schedule of a list of substances which, for certainty, are included within the definition of minerals.  The list is not exhaustive as the definition of minerals, contained in section 2, describes the term as meaning "all substances including scheduled minerals".  It may therefore allow other substances which are not on the list to be defined as minerals.  There was a similar schedule to the 1940 Act which has been reviewed with some additions and deletions by our technical staff.  Chalk, flint and chert for example have been removed because experience has shown that their inclusion is not particularly helpful.  Mineral oils and natural gas were removed because the 1960 Act provided for separate regulation of oil and gas exploration and production.  Other substances which were added are certain types of industrial minerals which were not important in 1940 but have since gained significance internationally, such as andalusite, garnite and sepiolite.  The schedule also includes definitions of dolomitic limestone and silica sand to help clarify the meaning of those substances.  That is the end of the Bill as such.  The regulatory impact assessment has been prepared and copies have been circulated to the members.</p></speech>

It is unusual that one would get a Bill drafted to the level of detail done by the Attorney General's office, but given its long gestation period the Minister felt he would give the committee an opportunity to either undertake that pre-legislative consideration or at least provide it with an insight into the format and background to the Bill in advance of publication.</p></speech>

The calculation for our base metal deposits is normally based on net smelter return.  This is the standard we have adopted and going forward we would probably continue with a net smelter return calculation.  However we are now in a position to clearly set out and state what royalty levels we will have.  Rather than carrying out negotiations separately with each company, now the companies go into exploration and development knowing the level of royalties to which they will be subjected to.  Does this answer the Deputy's question?</p></speech>

The royalties will depend very much on the deposit and the production costs associated with it.  This varies considerably from mine to mine.  I will ask my colleague Mr. Brian Breslin to answer the Deputy's question on ancillary rights.</p></speech>

They have rarely, if ever, been used.  They certainly have not been used in my lifetime and I have been in that area for over 20 years.  It really deals with a situation where a mine of national importance is prevented from going into production because rights cannot be obtained by agreement to construct a roadway to it for instance, or the main portal or a number of different scenarios like that which are not actually extracting minerals.  But there is a heavy onus on the developer to use his best endeavours to reach agreement before applying to the Minister to use compulsory powers.  The Deputy mentioned water rights.  That is a matter which is addressed through the planning regulations.  Before a mine goes into production all activities, even those covered by ancillary rights, will be part of the development of the mine as described in the environmental impact statement.  That will be examined in thorough detail in the planning process.  The conditions relating to making provision for alternative water supplies are all planning conditions.</p></speech>

One of the things we have successfully done in the past 25 years, both in Ireland and Europe, is create more bureaucracy and inspections.  I come from a farming community which has been pestered by inspections that are of no significant consequence.  We must take a common sense approach to these particular provisions, with no undue bureaucracy included in the legislation which would stifle people looking to engage in mineral extraction for the benefit of themselves or the State.  At a meeting I attended the other night to discuss farming issues, a fellow attendee said to me that what the country needs is a Minister for common sense.  The words "enhance the powers of inspectors" frighten me because I have seen what that type of thing has led to in other indigenous industries.  I appeal to the witnesses to ensure the final version of this section reflects a common sense approach.</p></speech>

When we talk about inspectors, we are referring to people such as Dr. Doyle who regularly visit mine sites.  We bring in a mining engineer of international standing to inspect the mines every year to ensure they are being operated within the conditions set out under the mining licence.  We also need to have powers to enter land to investigate whether unlawful activity is taking place.</p></speech>

The inspectors will be operating within a particular sphere.  Our concern is that where we go to court to prosecute an offence such as unlawful mining, we must be sure the inspector who identified the crime had lawful authority to so do.  We are seeking to ensure the powers of inspectors are crystallised in that respect.</p></speech>

However, I must state at the outset that I do not understand the purpose of the presentation.  What we are at here today is not pre-legislative scrutiny.  We seem to be examining the intentions behind different Parts of the Bill, but we are not actually looking at a draft Bill.  As such, I am not sure what is expected from us as a committee in respect of an outcome to the presentation and these discussions.</p></speech>

What we are looking at today is the intention behind different Parts of the Bill.  I might be wrong and this may turn out to be a very useful discussion, but at this point in time I cannot see what value I, for one, can add to the debate for the benefit of those who are working on the draft legislation.</p> <p>  Having said that, I do not disagree that the current body of legislation in this area needs to be updated and consolidated.  Indeed, the same is probably true for a lot of areas of legislation.  Generally where one sees a long list of old Bills, there is scope to consolidate and improve.</p></speech>

This is the draft as prepared by the Parliamentary Counsel's office and is effectively a full Bill.  I would have expected members, if they had concerns, to be saying they actually had too much information given that we have provided the committee with the 250 sections of this lengthy tome of a Bill.  What we were trying to do in our presentation was concentrate on the motives behind each of the Parts of the Bill without getting into too much detail.  This is an unusual circumstance in that, ordinarily, the committee would only have available to it the heads of the Bill.  We could have provided members with the heads in this case but because drafting had advanced to such a stage, the Minister of State decided to make the full Bill available.  This was done in agreement with the Whips' office even before the legislation was circulated to Departments or submitted to Government for approval.  This meeting affords the committee the opportunity to provide input into the Bill's final shape before it is published.  That is not to say members will not have another opportunity on Committee Stage and the other Stages of its passage through the Oireachtas to make a contribution to the legislation.  The Minister of State's intention was to give the committee an advance opportunity to examine the provisions.</p></speech>

I would have had different comments had I been aware the draft Bill was made available.</p> <p>  I have several points in regard to what has been presented today.  I note that environmental matters and issues to do with petroleum and so on will be dealt with in separate legislation.  That needs to be examined very closely because there are processes involved in minerals development, irrespective of what type of mineral it is, which impact the environment.  I am not sure that covering these matters in separate environmental legislation is necessarily the best way to do it.  It will have to be very carefully done and the environmental legislation will have to be looked at side by side with this Bill, as will the issue of petroleum licensing.</p> <p>  I am not sure how far the legislation takes into account possible changes in this area at EU and intercontinental level.</p><p>I am thinking of the investor safeguards under TTIP which is currently being negotiated.  We do not know what the outcome of those negotiations will be, but we can be sure that potentially investors' rights will be subject to some form of panel which might supersede national legislation.  That must be taken into account.</p><p> My apologies if I got the legislation already, but I certainly did not see it.</p></speech>

Most of the provisions in the Bill relate to property issues and the regulation of the substance.  It is a basic requirement that all of the activities must comply with all environmental legislation.  However, we are keenly aware of the potential environmental impacts of mining.  The Minister has been, and continues to be, a statutory consultee in the environmental impact assessment process.  The Minister has every application for a new mine, where an environmental impact statement is submitted along with a planning application, examined in great detail.  He brings in outside expertise to examine it and provides comments to the local authority and the EPA, with suggestions for conditions and various other such matters.</p> <p>  The EPA is the competent authority to monitor and regulate environmental emissions, and it does so very diligently.  We co-operate with it in all of that.  In particular, with regard to closure planning the closure funds are managed by the Minister, the EPA and the relevant local authority.  No money is released from those funds without the consent of all three authorities and without proper scrutiny of all the activity that must be undertaken.  We do not propose to change or modify the environmental legislation in any way in this Bill because it is considered that that is the appropriate way to deal with the environmental aspects of it.</p> <p>  I briefly mentioned the Aarhus Convention.  We went into great detail about that.  The environmental decision about whether a mine goes ahead is taken by the local authority, primarily, and it is then licensed under the integrated pollution prevention control, IPPC, licensing process.  The decision of the Minister to grant a mining licence is not considered to be a decision within the meaning of Aarhus, but there is a public consultation process built into the existing legislation and that will continue under this legislation.  There is a public consultation process in respect of prospecting, which is not an activity that has a significant impact on the environment, and the Minister is required to give notice of any decision he takes and allow time for consultation, objections and so forth.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned investors' rights and developments in that area.  These are matters of commercial law and are dealt with under separate legislation.  It is not within our competence or within the Minister's bailiwick, but we keep an eye on developments.  Much of the investment in exploration, initially, and ultimately in mining in Ireland comes from abroad.  We have no restrictions on access to the market here.  Traditionally, however, the ground-breaking exploration has been undertaken by Irish companies, small junior companies that find encouraging deposits, and when it gets to a point where larger, heavier investment is required, the outside interest becomes involved.  Also, we attract investment from major international players in greenfield exploration here.  However, we are not attempting to address commercial investment regulations in this legislation.  That is a matter for other Ministers.</p></speech>

In all cases where companies are carrying out drilling they will talk to the landowner.  To be honest, many of those who are carrying out that activity, primarily geologists, work out in the country and get on with the rural community.  Courtesy at all times is important.  They do not go onto any land without the formal permission of the landowner.  In that regard, the owner of the property has the right of refusal.  While the Bill provides for access, to my knowledge companies tend not to push that legislation.</p></speech>

That is in the 1940 Act and will continue in this legislation under a prospecting licence but it is regulated, controlled and limited.  The reason these powers are given is nobody knows where minerals are.  They do not just advertise themselves.  Drilling is a relatively rare activity.  There are more than 500 prospecting licences at any given time, only a small fraction of which drill.  Drilling is an expensive activity that is only undertaken where the holder of the licence believes there is sufficient evidence to justify it and to prove whether there is a deposit.  Drilling usually takes place from the surface straight down and occasionally at angles.  It is not used as a method of extracting minerals.  It is only an exploratory and analytical tool to determine what the character and extent of the minerals underlying the land.  Government policy over successive years has maintained the view that it is in the national interest that the nation's mineral resources be identified.  It is better to know that they are there than not and to do that, we need to allow people to carry out drilling where it is justified.</p> <p>  By its nature, it is an interference with private property rights but it is justified in line with the protection of the such rights in the Constitution because it is in the national interest that these minerals be identified.  Once identified, a mine is a totally different activity.  The extraction of the minerals and their production in commercial quantities is a major operation, which takes years to plan and bring into development.  The planning process is where all this activity is analysed in the minutest detail as to how the mine will be operated, where the ground will be broken, where the minerals will be extracted, where they will be processed, where the waste will be stored and so on.  That is examined through the environmental impact assessment process and the public, in general, and the landowners, in particular, have rights under the planning process to object to this activity.  The Minister does not have the final say on whether planning permission is granted under the Minerals Development Act 1940.  That is a matter for the planning authorities.  Unless best practice is applied in how the mine is designed, conceived, developed and closed, planning permission will not be granted.</p></speech>

They also have the right to go to the courts, as any individual has.  A prospecting licence gives the holder of the licence the right to drill but, in practice, we have more than 600 prospecting licences at the moment and approximately 10% involve drilling.  Many people spend significant money searching for our minerals and much of this money is spent in vain.  We do not have that many mines.  We had three major lead and zinc mines up to this year.  One of them closed and another will close this year.  We will be left with one.</p></speech>

If the EPA concludes following an EIS that drilling and mining are appropriate to proceed, does the Bill contain a provision that gives the Minister the right to overrule that or must he accept the recommendations of the agency?  Is he under a legal obligation?</p></speech>

If approved and licensed by the EPA, this is one of the criteria that the Minister would take into account in awarding a mining licence.  However, having satisfied the planning and environmental authorities that the mine plan is valid and good, then it is his decision, although he is not obliged to provide a mining licence because that will be ultimately be based on his assessment of the viability and feasibility of the mining plan for extraction of the minerals.</p></speech>

It involves drilling, identifying a mineral underground and then extracting it.  Is that not Mr. Sheridan's experience?  However, there is the new concept of hydraulic fracturing, which is totally different.  It is not just about drilling a hole and extraction using traditional methods; it is about using chemicals, which can affect watercourses.  There is no conclusive evidence other than the experience of those who have witnessed the practice at first hand in other countries, particularly America, where there are serious question marks about its impact on watercourses.  While there are other concerns, that is our main concern.  The EPA is currently carrying out a review of hydraulic fracturing and if all the criteria are adhered to and this practice is safe, the agency will conclude that there is no objection to granting a licence.  Where does that leave the Minister under the proposed legislation?  Is he legally obliged to accept the EPA's conclusions?</p> <p>  There was a case some years ago under the former Minister of State with responsibility for energy, Mr. Bobby Molloy, which proposed the extraction of gold from Croagh Patrick.  He refused the application and said to leave the gold there because there were many other considerations, not just the iconic nature of Croagh Patrick but also the impact it would have on the environment.  That is the background and context to my questions.  Deputy Colreavy was touching on this as well.</p></speech>

It is exported and the developer is given the right to extract the minerals, process them on site and sell them to a smelter abroad, who gets the proceeds.  The royalty we charge is typically based on revenue the mining company gets from the smelter, not profits.  The revenue is quite easy to pin down and the charge is a percentage on revenue.  As Dr.  Doyle said earlier, the 1940 Act was not helpful in trying to set royalties.  Mining companies were making investments in exploration and they can be very substantial investments.  They would like to have greater predetermination of what their liabilities will be when a line comes into production.  That has been a continuing concern for professional investors and we are trying to address it to a certain extent by giving the Minister power to make regulations that set out a range of royalties.  We have not determined the range, which will be done by review in accordance with international practice.  The Bill provides for it to be reviewed on an eight yearly interval.</p></speech>

There is a degree of flexibility provided for as there may well be substances there that we are just not aware of.  This is, after all, an exploratory activity.  The definition at the start of the Bill is to cover all minerals and the purpose of the schedule is to itemise as many of those as possible and it is largely to do with the uncertainty as to the occurrence of those minerals in the terrain.</p></speech>

It is better to describe minerals as to what they are not.  It is any substance or any agricultural land that is not turf, peat, stone, sand, gravel, or clay.  Other than that there is a broad scope of materials that fit within the definition.  The definition in the interpretation section is more important.</p></speech>

I think it would be advantageous to make clear that we are not talking about a borehole for water in order to ease the anxiety that may exist in communities around the country.  That anxiety would be taken away if it was there in black and white for them.</p></speech>

Mr. Breslin makes reference to the Mining Board.  If there are areas of conflict, is it the Mining Board that decides things?

The property rights are the same under this Bill as they were under the previous ones.  What we are doing is modifying the controls over it and improving rights of objection.

It needs to be clarified in the first line of any public statements that the Department makes on this legislation that this does not cover oil or gas because it will generate a lot of unnecessary concern otherwise.  It should be made very clear every time in the first sentence, even if Mr. Breslin gets bored writing it, that this does not include oil or gas.</p></speech>

As has been mentioned, a copy was sent out some time ago but it has not been re-sent in the last number of weeks so we will make sure that it is sent again.  While the committee may decide to meet with stakeholders on the Bill it is considered that because the Bill is at such an advanced stage pre-legislative scrutiny is not relevant.</p> <p>  As there is no other business this morning the joint committee will adjourn until 2.30 p.m. on Thursday,16 April.
