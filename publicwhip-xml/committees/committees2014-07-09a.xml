Last week, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, published an apprenticeship implementation plan.  This involves, among other things, the establishment of a new apprenticeship council to oversee the development of this area of training and on-the-job experience.  This follows on from a review of apprenticeships in Ireland.  I am pleased to welcome Mr. Phil O'Flaherty, Mr. Keith Moynes, Mr. Denis Rowan and Mr. Chris Feeney from the Department of Education and Skills to discuss this issue.  From IBEC, I welcome Mr. Tony Donohoe and Mr. Dermot Doherty and I welcome Dr. Peter Rigney from ICTU.  I ask our guests to either turn off their mobile phones completely or put them in flight mode.<br />I wish to draw witnesses attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise them that the opening statements they have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect I have just outlined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Phil O'Flaherty" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014070900004#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for inviting representatives of the Department of Education and Skills here to talk about the review of apprenticeship training in Ireland.  My name is Phil O'Flaherty and I lead the Department&rsquo;s further education and training section.  I am joined by Keith Moynes from our higher education policy section and Denis Rowan and Chris Feeney from SOLAS.  Today&rsquo;s session is timely, as the Minister published an implementation plan for the review&rsquo;s recommendations just last week.</p><p>  Significant reform is under way across our education and training system and much of this is focused on close engagement with employers to ensure we tailor our programmes to deliver the best work opportunities for learners and continue to develop the sector as an engine for economic growth.  The renewal of the apprenticeship system is a major part of that overall reform programme.  While the time is ripe for a review of the apprenticeship system, the committee should appreciate that apprenticeship has served learners, employers and the wider economy very well over a long number of years.  It is a good product, producing highly skilled crafts people in demand throughout the world and competing strongly in the world skills competitions.</p><p>  Dual training models offer enormous potential to produce practically focused, work-ready people serving the skill needs of the economy across a range of sectors.  That said, apprenticeship currently has a narrow industrial base which exposes it strongly to the domestic economic cycle and lacks flexibility in its overall structure.  The economic downturn exposed difficulties with the model and it has taken an enormous effort on behalf of a range of stakeholders, including SOLAS, to provide opportunities for redundant apprentices to complete their training.  It was in this context that the apprenticeship review was undertaken.</p><p>  The Minister launched the review of apprenticeship in May 2013.  It was led by an independent group, chaired by Kevin Duffy, chair of the Labour Court.  We have two members of that group here today, as both Peter Rigney and Tony Donohoe served on it, and they can probably give some insights into the group's thinking on the recommendations produced.  The review group invited submissions and consulted widely in producing its report, which it delivered to the Minister in December 2013.  The Minister published the report in January.</p><p>  A summary of the detailed set of recommendations contained in the report is in the full presentation I provided, but I will highlight a couple of key points.  While strongly calling for flexibility in structure and delivery, the review group adopted a view of apprenticeship as requiring to be sufficiently substantial in depth and duration to deliver skilled workers who can work competently and autonomously.   It stated that apprenticeship programmes should no shorter than two years and that at least half of this time should be spent on the job.  It saw the potential for apprenticeships to be delivered leading to awards from level 5 of the national framework of qualifications, NFQ, right up to level 10.</p><p>  The review group recommended the completion of the curriculum review under way for existing trades, leading to individual awards for each trade placed separately on the NFQ and with duration determined by learning outcomes.  The group recommended that governance of apprenticeship should be led by a new apprenticeship council, hosted by SOLAS but with strong co-operation from the Higher Education Authority.  The council should also co-ordinate a call for proposals for the development of apprenticeships in new enterprise sectors.</p> <p>The Minister published an implementation plan for the review recommendations on 30 June.  The plan adopts a phased approach to implementation, recognising the need to progress current work on existing apprenticeships and determine demand from new enterprise sectors through a call for proposals before embedding new arrangements in legislation.  This reflects the fact that an approach that begins with legislative change is likely to be slow, will not be enterprise-led in the first instance and will not best facilitate the flexibility required to explore and respond to issues that may be raised in the call for proposals from enterprise sectors.</p><p> The plan sets out how an apprenticeship council will be appointed this month and details a series of actions to renew existing apprenticeships and develop new ones.  These actions will be delivered in three phases.  Phase 1 will focus on existing apprenticeships being reviewed under the existing governance structures, while the apprenticeship council makes a call for proposals from employers and education and training providers for the development of new apprenticeships.  This call will be supported by dedicated resources.  The council will assess the proposals against a sustainability test and report to the Minister in the first half of next year on proposals which stand the best chance of being developed into quality sustainable apprenticeships.</p><p> Phase 2 involves the development of the apprenticeships in the successful sectors.  This will require establishing awarding arrangements, the development of detailed curricula and implementation arrangements.  This process is likely to take some time and vary across sectors, and will be complete from late 2015 into the first half of 2016.  In parallel, legislative implications will be examined to support the expanded system and provide protection for apprentices.</p><p> Phase 3 involves the embedding of new structures, including establishing the apprenticeship council on a statutory basis and bringing together the governance arrangements for existing and new apprenticeships.  This will provide a stable base for implementing the remaining key recommendations of the review group.</p><p> The Department is confident that we now have a good basis for renewing apprenticeship in Ireland as a strong model of learning in further and higher education and training.  We look forward to today&rsquo;s discussion with the committee and the other contributors.</p></speech>

I look after education and social policy in IBEC.  I am joined by my colleague, Mr. Dermot Doherty, who is from the Irish Medical Devices Association, one of the sectoral groups that has established a track record of working with education and training providers and has an interest in this area.  IBEC's submission to the apprenticeship review group has been circulated to the committee and I will be pleased to address any issues arising from it that members wish to raise.</p><p>  My comments, however, mainly concern the report of the review group itself and, more particularly, the Department&rsquo;s implementation plan referred to by Mr. O'Flaherty.  As committee members are aware, the current apprenticeship system, which is limited to 26 occupations, does not reflect the broader skill needs of the Irish economy.  A fixed legislative structure makes it difficult for the system to adapt to economic and technological developments.  A fixed duration of four years in all cases but one, and a fixed award, regardless of the learning outcome also creates inefficiencies.  Female participation is negligible. </p><p>  The starting point for any consideration of new apprenticeship models usually includes a reference to the well-established dual systems of countries such as Austria, Germany and Switzerland.  Much of the commentary, however, tends to ignore the fact that Ireland cannot simply adopt systems that have been built over generations, upon very different economies, labour markets and social partnership arrangements.  We also have to acknowledge the reality that apprenticeships, and vocational education in general, tend not to enjoy parity of esteem in a society that defines educational achievement in terms of Central Applications Office, CAO, points.</p><p>  This is not to say that we do not have much to learn from other national systems.  In fact the apprenticeship review group report has tried to distil some of the principles on which they are based to inform a model that could work in an Irish context.  They include the following: employers and professional bodies are best placed to determine the content, outcome and demand for apprenticeships; expertise provided by education and training providers must also be at the heart of their design and delivery; apprenticeships must be able to respond flexibly to changing technology and market needs; apprenticeship development must be based on transferable skills including literacy and numeracy; different packages of work and learning, with distinct structures, curricula and pedagogy, may provide equally valid routes to enabling an apprentice to become competent in a job; distribution of the cost of training should be shared by all three parties, employers, apprentices, through the acceptance of a lower wage, and Government; apprenticeships should be available at all skill levels from school leaving, level 5 to advanced degree level 10, for countries such as Denmark have industrial PhDs; and governance or training delivery should not be predominantly within the domains either of further education and training or higher education, they should cross both levels which is very important in the context of the parity of esteem we seek for apprenticeships and the system should be underpinned by a robust and independent quality assurance regime.</p><p>  The review group&rsquo;s report certainly reflects these principles but the biggest challenge is moving from strategy to implementation.  The Department&rsquo;s implementation plan, which was published two weeks ago, can help us meet this challenge.  IBEC supports its recommendation for the establishment of a new enterprise-led apprenticeship council.  This council will issue a call for proposals from industry bodies working with education providers for the development of new apprenticeships.  The proposers will have to set out the programme&rsquo;s format, the main occupation needs to be addressed and how it meets a range of other criteria.  Mr. O'Flaherty has described the sustainability test.  The implementation plan comments that the capacity of relevant organisations to assume this role will have to be tested.  I am optimistic about this.  There are already numerous examples of businesses working with the higher education sector in particular to source their training.  There are fewer examples in the further education sector but the recent further education and training strategy has named that and seeks to address it. </p><p>  Some employers also provide input on curriculum development and work experience for students.  This trend has been given further impetus through the more advanced Skillnets networks, Momentum, the Springboard programme and the ICT conversion programmes which are designed and delivered in partnership with industry. </p><p>  I accept that the establishment of a new model requires a huge level of highly detailed work and the plan has set out a realistic timeframe.  We should remember, however, that we will not see these new apprenticeships coming on stream until the first half of 2016.  Thankfully, as the economic recovery takes hold, many companies are beginning to consider how they will meet their future skills requirements.  It would be a pity to miss this opportunity.  If the plan is to deliver, timelines must be adhered to and momentum maintained.  The development of the new apprenticeships must also be properly resourced.  As we move into the 2015 budgetary process, it is important that dedicated funding is allocated to promote the development and establishment of these apprenticeships in new occupational areas.  This should be viewed as a critical investment in our human capital, which will underpin our future economic prosperity.</p><p>  In conclusion, I thank members of the joint committee for the opportunity to present IBEC&rsquo;s views on this important initiative and urge them to provide every support possible to ensure its successful implementation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.16" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Rigney" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014070900005#E00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to speak to it about what will be an extremely important aspect of Irish industrial policy and the education system in the immediate future.</p> <p>We fully support the implementation of the review of apprenticeship and look forward to working with employers and the State in this area.  Ireland is one of several member states to receive a recommendation on apprenticeship under the country-specific recommendations issued recently as part of the European semester process.  In fact, one is struck by how many other countries, as well as Ireland, have received a recommendation in this regard.</p><p> We are right to be proud of our success in this country in the area of designated trades.  However, our track record in embedding work-based learning in our education system is less impressive.  In the past two decades there have been two major reverses in this area.  One was the disappearance of the CERT apprenticeship system, leading to a situation where employers in the hospitality sector are now complaining about a lack of skills.  Second is the failure, following the apprenticeship reform of the early 1990s, to designate a significant number of additional trades.  A prime candidate for a pilot scheme for the extension of apprenticeship is the child care sector, which is facing a crisis of standards at this time.  The State exercises a predominant role in the sector through funding and regulation, a position which it can use to advance public policy in the apprenticeship area.</p><p> Moving towards some type of dual system will present challenges, especially in the area of funding.  Having said that, the EU initiative on a youth guarantee and the new phase of European Social Fund allocations will allow more financial latitude than we might have thought possible.  Another avenue of resourcing could be made available through an expanded national training fund.  That fund was established by diverting an element of employers' PRSI contribution - 0.7%, if I recall correctly - to a dedicated fund.  There is scope to divert a similar small percentage of employees' contribution to an enlarged fund that would support an expanded apprenticeship system.</p><p> It is important to note in any discussion of apprenticeship systems that governance is not an end in itself but must serve a purpose.  Societies design governance systems which achieve a purpose such as deliberation, information sharing or providing feedback.  There is ample evidence that the governance of vocational education and training systems works best when it is structured on a tripartite basis which focuses on ensuring the relevance of training offered and anchoring the training system to the enterprise stakeholders.  These strong links are pointed to by Viktoria Kis as an advantage of the Irish system in her 2010 study undertaken for the OECD.  Robust governance systems keep the courses offered close to the labour market and act as a check and balance on the power of providers.</p><p> If we look at the operational issues which affected - or, more accurately, afflicted - F&Aacute;S in the period prior to 2011, it is clear that many of them arose out of work done by private sector contract providers.  Similar problems arose with Skillnets, where a major breach involving both FETAC and HETAC providers was uncovered in the audit process and detailed in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  One of the lessons to be drawn from this is that the light-touch model of regulation adopted by FETAC and HETAC proved inadequate to deal with the risks posed by a very small number of unscrupulous private providers.  There is a strong argument, therefore, for the education and training institutions of the State to play the predominant role in providing the education and training element of any widened apprenticeship system.</p><p> Despite many efforts undertaken over the past two decades by State authorities, employers and unions, most apprenticeships remain strongly male dominated.  This is partly due to the fact that the construction, engineering and vehicle maintenance industries are in themselves strongly male dominated.  An obvious way of broadening the gender participation in apprenticeships would be to broaden the range of apprenticeships available.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the most significant gender issue in the Irish education and training sector is the under-achievement of young boys.  The apprenticeship system as currently structured goes some way to address this.</p><p> Entry requirements will vary from sector to sector.  In the event of a broader range of occupations being designated, they will vary even further.  There has been a suggestion, for instance, that some groups of employers would like to have level 8 degrees delivered in an apprenticeship format.  The stakeholders in the sector will set the minimum entry requirements and it will be up to SOLAS to ensure these requirements meet the needs of the occupation concerned and are not disguised barriers to entry.  </p><p> A more broadly-based system of apprenticeship would help to minimise dropout rates.  It would also help to address the under-achievement of young men in the education system, which is a common phenomenon in Europe.  Dr. Sean McDonagh, former principal of Dundalk IT, has pointed out that the country that finds a solution to this problem will derive a competitive advantage from it.  In addition, a more broadly-based apprenticeship system would ensure an enhanced supply of intermediate-level skills for our economy and society.</p></speech>

I will now take questions from members, beginning with Deputy Charlie McConalogue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/999" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014070900006#F00300"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  Reference was made to models of apprenticeship which have worked very well in other countries, particularly Denmark and Germany.  Will the witnesses outline the elements that make those systems work so well but which might not work in this country?  In the case of  the German model, my understanding is that students separate into streams at age 16, one being more academic and the other a more vocational route.  Currently and historically, Germany has had a very low percentage of students going on to higher education compared with other countries, presumably because of the significant numbers opting for the vocational route.  It is a system that seems to work well for that country.  Any additional information the delegates can give on the German system and which parts of it are not transferable to Ireland would be helpful.  I understand some of it is cultural, with German companies having very much bought into the system.  Will the delegates comment on the cultural position in respect of companies in the Irish market, including the various American companies which provide employment in different sectors such as pharmaceutical and information technology?  Is there scope for developing apprenticeships that can feed into those sectors?</p><p>  What is the situation in terms of the age profile of young people going into apprenticeships in this country?  Is there a need to develop a greater connection between our second level education system and the apprenticeship system?  For example, if the two were running in parallel and there was a greater crossover, students would not be obliged to leave the education system early.  Mr. Donohoe mentioned that there has historically been more engagement with industry at higher education level in terms of developing pathways than there has been at further education level.  Will he give his take on the dynamic behind that and how it might be addressed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/984" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014070900006#F00400"><p>I welcome the delegates and thank them for their submissions.  I agree with Mr. Donohoe that the timelines are both ambitious and achievable.  They are also very much interlinked.  The point Mr. Donohoe made in regard to the need for funding to be pinpointed in budget 2015 is a critical one. The timelines that are envisaged would mean the Minister having to allocate resources in the second quarter of next year to bring this to the next stage.  If those moneys are not put in place in the upcoming budget in October, we are setting up a roadblock that is bound to delay progress in 2015.  There is some planning to do in this regard.  All of the submissions we are discussing today refer frequently to funding, financing and costing, but I do not see any actual figures.  How can we evaluate the amount of funding that will be required to ensure the timelines can be met?<br />We have had several references to the lack of gender balance in the apprenticeship system and the opportunity we have to address it.  Dr. Rigney stated that an obvious way to broaden gender participation is to broaden the range of apprenticeships types on offer.  He went on to observe:<blockquote>However, we should not lose sight of the fact that the most significant gender issue in the Irish education and training sector is the under-achievement of young boys.  The apprenticeship system as currently structured goes some way to address this.</blockquote></p> <p>I seek elaboration.  Does the current structure, which is mainly aimed at men, mean balance should be addressed through apprenticeships for women?  How can the gender balance be achieved?  How will sustainability criteria be set out?  Proposals for new apprenticeships will be measured by a sustainability test to see if they can proceed.  Apprenticeships have previously been based on needs, rather than being led by enterprise, but once needs change the apprenticeships become redundant.</p><p> The report and some of the presentations touched on the issue of the transferability of skills and this critical area must be developed.  We must create apprenticeship schemes that help develop numerous skills simultaneously.  For example, if the construction industry collapses an apprentice engineer, carpenter or bricklayer may not find work and therefore must learn other skills during his or her apprenticeship that will help the transfer to a new area of employment or further education.  Rather than joining a dole queue it is important that apprentices learn varied skills that will help them progress.  This issue of the transferability of skills will create a challenge in designing new courses and I presume the sustainability test will take it into account.  If the market for which apprenticeship skills were primarily intended collapses it is vital that those skills can be transferred elsewhere.  I seek more information on this.</p></speech>

Conversely, I was told I had hands for nothing.  Being useless at most things I knew I had to become a teacher.  It is a straight line to level 10 and I like the idea of moving all the way to level ten.  It is wonderful that a young person completing an apprenticeship knows he or she can carry on all the way to a doctorate.</p><p>  A charge now applies to apprenticeships that is based on the registration fee for third-level students but perhaps this discourages potential apprentices.  How will SOLAS, which is responsible for much of this, deliver on the programme in the five education and training board areas that do not have training centres?  Will the chief executive officer of an education and training board that does not have a training centre in its region have any input?  This is an issue in some areas and I would like to see it ironed out as early as possible without a row.  This might not be easy but it is important, though it may not be the Department's responsibility.  I would like to know how SOLAS will address the problem.</p><p>  A reference was made to the German system and one of our aims is to increase tertiary education by 10%.  We need to educate people for jobs and some people currently undergoing apprenticeships will employ degree holders in future.  They are the entrepreneurs and wealth creators of the future.  An apprenticeship can be a very good thing and a university degree should not be viewed as the Holy Grail.  It may be sufficient that 50% of school leavers continue into the degree system.</p><p>  On further education, is it the case that colleges have no capital budget and cannot qualify for a summer works scheme?  Perhaps the witnesses cannot comment on this but surely some thought must be given to funding colleges.</p></speech>

Many of the points I wanted to make have been raised so I will not go back over them.  Gender balance is an issue and ICTU raised the matter of boys underachieving.  What can the Department do to address the problem?  Is it possible to broaden the range of apprenticeships and what kind of apprenticeships would have most benefit?</p><p>  It was suggested that a portion of employees' PRSI could be ring-fenced to fund apprenticeships.  The Department hates new ideas with regard to ring-fencing though it does not mind maintaining old systems of ring-fencing when it suits.  Perhaps Dr. Rigney can expand on this and the comparison with the previous scheme of employers' PRSI.</p></speech>

Deputy McConalogue raised the issue of international models and there will be varying views on this as we can learn from some aspects and others represent too great a cultural leap.  The review group did not move towards the formal reintroduction of vocational and academic streams in upper second level schools.  Vocational routes exist in the leaving certificate programme but, from an institutional perspective, people in Ireland do not attend a school based on vocational or academic inclinations, unlike people in countries like Germany.</p> <p>There has been a long-standing concern on the part of parents that there should be a very broad offering across vocational and academic subjects at senior cycle in post-primary schools.  Colleagues from SOLAS will confirm the figure but I understand that well above 70% of people who enter apprenticeships complete the leaving certificate.  At present, therefore, apprenticeship is very much a post-secondary option.  Of course, the position varies across trades.  In that context, the entry rates among those who have only completed junior cycle in secondary school are higher in respect of certain trades.</p><p> Early school leaving is obviously a big issue for all countries in the European Union.  Ireland's performance in this regard has improved somewhat and the rate here - less than 10% - is below the overall EU target for 2020.  We want to reduce that rate even further nationally.  Vocational opportunities and apprenticeships are a means of ensuring that there are options available for people who learn best by doing and they certainly make a contribution in terms of reducing the rate of early school leaving.  It should be noted that the general picture in this regard has been improving for a good many years.</p><p> To return to the question on international models, we are of the view - I believe IBEC would probably agree with us - that great opportunities exist.  A number of companies with operations in Ireland originated in countries with strong apprenticeship traditions.  The European Alliance for Apprenticeships has indicated a willingness to engage more fully with the Irish apprenticeship system, especially if we expand the range of sectors in which it operates.  The experience of companies such as Siemens, SAP and others in the context of how they are set up to deal with apprenticeships is something from which we can learn.  The labour markets in countries such as Germany and Austria are highly regulated and the concept that, under law, people must have specific qualifications in order to undertake particular activities in the economy is very embedded.  This clearly supports an apprenticeship system because if a person is obliged to obtain a qualification in order to become a baker or whatever, there is a model of training in place to support him or her in doing so.  That would be a very big leap for Ireland.  We have a pretty liberal labour market and the flexibility which exists within it is seen, as least by some, as being of assistance in attracting foreign direct investment among other things.</p><p> The type of regulation to which I refer supports the apprenticeship systems in Germany and Austria.  In addition, the chambers model in those countries is very strong and allows the concept of apprenticeship to be supported and led by enterprise.  The structures upon which apprenticeship can be built in Ireland are probably becoming stronger.  What the Irish Medical Devices Association, which Mr. Doherty represents, has done is a good example of how a sector can be organised around training, Skillnets and things of that nature.  We are, however, a long way away from a situation where companies would be legally obliged to be members of chambers and to contribute to them by supporting training models.  Nonetheless, we have a great deal to learn from countries such as Germany and Austria in the context of how to set up an apprenticeship model in a given area, how to define a curriculum, etc.  There is, of course, no need to reinvent the wheel in many respects because being a process engineer in Ireland is not necessarily any different to being one in Germany or Austria.  If curricula have been defined in particular areas, we can use them.</p><p> Deputy O'Brien and others were correct to state that it is going to be important that we make resources available in 2015 and beyond to act as seed capital in the context of the development of apprenticeship.  There will be some resource implications this year from the perspective of personnel being available to support the apprenticeship council with regard to the work it will be obliged to do.  At this stage, I cannot say much more other than to indicate that this will form part of the Department's budgeting arrangements.</p></speech>

There would be an order of magnitude that we would see as being important in 2015 in order that sufficient scale might be achieved.  Obviously, how much of that will be deployed will depend on the strength of what comes back in the context of the proposals that are actually put forward.</p><p>  On the sustainability criteria, I agree with the point made in respect of the transferability of skills.  There is a need to ensure that people who pursue apprenticeships are supported with regard to the type of foundation skills - such as literacy, numeracy, the ability to communicate, etc. - they require.  There must also be clear progression routes, both occupationally, in the context of where one can go in the labour market, and academically, regarding where one can go within the education and training system.  That is going to be important and it will probably have implications in the context of sustainability and how narrowly defined apprenticeships might be.  I refer here to not having apprenticeships that are very narrowly focused in order that those who pursue them will not be left vulnerable.  A key aspect will be that progression opportunities - both laterally and vertically - will be set out.</p><p>  I will now deal with some of the points Senator Jim D'Arcy made.  On the apprenticeship charge, I will to some extent give the classic Civil Service answer in that it was a budgetary decision taken by Government in the context of all of the savings the Department needed to make in 2014.  In the context of whether it has acted as a discouragement, we very much hope not.  We hope that people would see the value of apprenticeship and of the training apprentices receive.  A person who pursues an apprenticeship is employed and receives a wage.  He or she also receives an allowance the periods during which he or she is off the job.  That allowance would be a long way north of what would be payable under, for example, a student grant scheme, which is worth bearing in mind.</p><p>  The Senator inquired about education and training boards which do not have training centres.  There is an ongoing process in this regard.  Like the Oireachtas, the Department is seized of the need to ensure that this does not become a huge bone of contention.</p></speech>

It is a difficult issue.  There is a unit within the Department which is managing the transition process relating to SOLAS and the education and training boards.  We have asked the boards - both those without training centres and those which have such centres and which serve the areas relating to the latter - to come up with proposals regarding how all of this is going to be managed and to how the work of the training centres can be fitted in to the relevant reporting structures.  Those proposals were only received in the past week or so and the Department is considering them.</p> <p>To some extent, the area of apprenticeship is not the most difficult, although it is a difficult issue more broadly because it continues to be legally the responsibility of SOLAS and is delivered through the training centres almost on an agency basis in some respects, unlike education and training more generally, which is the statutory responsibility of the individual education and training boards.  That issue is in hand and hopefully solutions will be found and there is a process in place to manage that.  I will leave it to my colleague on my right, Mr. Keith Moynes, to speak about the appropriateness on our ambitions in respect of the third level sector.</p></speech>

From the point of view of the system, the key question for us is what is the right mix for the individual and for society.  There is a diversity of models that must form part of any system that bring us to what is the right answer for society.  We have a very high participation level in higher education and graduate employment levels are back to where they were at pre-crisis levels.  Much of the investment in higher education is paying off but clearly there must be other models and apprenticeship must be a part of that.  There are initiatives such as Springboard, to return to Deputy O'Brien's point about the transferability of skills, under which people are being reskilled and there is a further education and training strategy.  The key question is about the mix and the individual.  The learner must be at the heart of this together with the skills that they need.  We have a high level of participation, but increasing employer engagement within that system and giving people different avenues into the system will all form part of the mix, rather than a binary way of looking at it where it is either higher education or nothing.  That is the mix we would like to take as a system and that is informing where we are going.</p></speech>

Such provision has been somewhat <i>ad hoc</i>up to now in that in terms of the overall capital allocation that was available for the Department, there would have been savings and a re-allocation to deal with particular capital needs as well as more larger planned capital developments in further education and training, and in the Cavan-Monaghan area quite a lot has been done.  There is a need to systematise that to a much greater extent and ensure that colleagues in SOLAS have a proper engagement with that process and a full engagement on the capital side because the Department has given them the full current allocation around further education and training, except for some of the teacher pay elements for the PLC colleges.  It is important we have a system in place that allows for the capital element to be included in terms of SOLAS and for that to be properly planned.  We would agree on that.<br />On the Senator's question on the eligibility of works under the summer works scheme and the qualifying criteria for it, my colleagues in the schools division would be more well versed than I would be on that but I would be happy to respond to the Senator on that off-line if that is okay.<br />On Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in's point on the gender balance issue, in some respects, it is sad to say that our solution to gender balance in the area of apprenticeship is to broaden apprenticeships beyond the sectors in that we are not saying there are not roles for women in construction and engineering and such areas.  In fairness to SOLAS and employers, efforts have been made in that direction even in the traditional sectors in ensuring that when bigger employers such as the ESB took women into apprenticeships that they would do so in twos and threes because it was perceived that it could be quite a difficult work environment and that it would be a more welcoming one if a few were taken on together.  If we expand beyond the existing sectors, that should go some way towards addressing the gender issue.  The point Dr. Peter Rigney made is also important.  When we consider progression to third level and achievement in skills in literacy, numeracy and other areas, girls are outperforming boys fairly decisively.  The area of apprenticeship has been a little bit of a counterweight against that and it is worth taking that into account in any discussion on the issue of general balance.</p></speech>

I believe there is a great opportunity here.  We have built up apprenticeships in trades and the structure is robust.  It was time for it to reviewed.  The one-size-fits-all model was not appropriate to today.  We have built up knowledge on how to run them.  The expansion of it is the main issue.  My view on it, having only been in the area for the past month or two, is that it must be slow and done right.  It should not be a rush job to find ten new ones and get them up and running fairly fast.  The curriculum should be designed to the standards, have the endorsement of employers, employers should be involved in it and it should be appropriate for  the long term.  The numbers involved is also an important factor in terms of whether we will train 100 people or whatever number.  It is better we do it right.  It better to start off and have two or three good apprenticeships a year and after five years there would be 15 rather that trying to run 20 in the first year.  We are up for it and we have started to do some work on it.  We have changed our staffing levels, we are waiting on this to develop and we will be at the centre of it.  It will be a team approach involving not only us in the training centre but those in third level, employers and the stakeholders all working together.  That is vital because the opportunities for young people are enormous.  There is an opportunity for them to acquire a skill, a job and an award that will be worth something to them.</p></speech>

To increase the number of women apprentices it took in each year and we learned a number of things.  First, it is a single process.  One does not get bodies through the door until the results of the CAO process are known.  Second, there were many false perceptions about the regulations.  People said that one had to have technical drawing but one does not.  One has to have either technical drawing or art and as a result of that the potential female constituency was widened.  The perception was that one had to have  to have science, but one had to have a science subject and when domestic science was included the constituency was widened.  If apprenticeships are confined to specific male dominated industries, they will be male dominated, all other things being equal, despite the efforts by employers and despite the bursary system operated by F&Aacute;S-SOLAS.  Therefore, the best way of having a gender balance, which reflects society as whole, is to have a broader range of apprenticeships.</p><p>  That said, the issue that does not tend to be stated is that the biggest issue facing the Irish education system is the under-achievement of young males.  That is a major issue and if one does a Google search for Dr. Se&aacute;n McDonagh, the former head of Dundalk Institute of Technology, and what he has written on that, one will find it is an eye-opener.</p> <p>We cannot take our eye off that ball.  As we all know, girls mature more rapidly than boys and, frequently, boys of a certain age will not take to being disciplined in a classroom scenario, whereas in work they will frequently accept being informally disciplined with short, monosyllabic words and put in their place.</p><p> On the question of sustainability, the group did not go into that in any great detail because it is question of how to regulate for peaks and troughs.  In an ideal world we should have had a way, at the height of the boom, of telling someone they could not become an electrician, a plasterer or a bricklayer because in the long term we do not have the demand for those.  I suggest if we did that the Deputy's clinics would be overflowing with people complaining that their sons could not get a job, and some people mentioned the constitutional right to earn a living.</p><p> On the other hand, at the bottom of the boom we have to have the long-term vision to decide, if plasterers are not taken in this year, what can we do to keep the facilities in place.  Plastering is a discipline in which one must stop working before the age of 65 because one's joints begin to give out.  Six years down the line from the slump, where will we get people to build houses a couple of years from now?  Mr. Flaherty would be asking what he should do with all the empty classrooms.  Difficult discussions have to be had about the issue of sustainability, but there are not necessarily any easy answers.</p><p> On the question of the German model, the German authorities are asking anyone who will listen in Europe to take on their model.  Fair play to them because they are putting in their money and asking countries like Spain, Slovenia and Slovakia to implement their model.</p><p> The most interesting aspect I would bring to members from our deliberations on the committee is that we had one of the most eminent training academics, Professor Hilary Steedman.  Her main piece of advice was, whatever we do, we should not follow the UK model.  That was the most interesting piece of advice I got on the matter.</p><p> On the question of the national training fund, in 2000, with the prospect of the former communist countries being admitted to the European Union, the Government took the view that the level of European Social Fund, ESF, funding we are getting for apprenticeships would not last beyond accession.  At that time, I understand, employer's PRSI - Mr. Donohoe will correct me if I am wrong - was 12.7%.</p></speech>

I am suggesting that if resourcing is the problem - the Department of Finance does not like this, and will regard it as the end of civilisation it if it is attempted again - there is no reason a similar sliver of employee PRSI could not be taken and put into the national training fund.  The Department of Social Protection might or might not like that.  I say "might or might not" because a proper education and training system is one of the best guarantees against long-term unemployment.  I think I have covered all the questions addressed to me.</p></speech>

One of the big differences is they have been at it for so long.  I attended a conference on apprenticeship in Brussels about a year ago and a British academic suggested that they had been doing this since 1152.  I do not know how they came up with that date but the point is that it has its roots in the medieval guilds.  They also have the institutional arrangements that Mr. Flaherty mentioned - that is, German companies have to be members of business organisations, employer organisations, by law.  If the Deputy wants to suggest that to our legislators I will not have an objection, but we do not have that kind of embedded employer or trade union involvement in our structures in a way that goes back over decades.  What we do have is a responsive education and training system which has a proven track record of working with business, and increasingly so in recent times.  That goes back to the 1970s when the institutes of technology responded to the first wave of ICT companies coming here in a very effective way.</p><p>  The review group did not spend too much time considering the binary secondary system they have in Germany, because in practical terms that will not change, and such a change would probably not be desirable.  It is much more to do with parity of esteem, a phrase I have used a few times, in terms of what happens afterwards.  The guidance counsellors in the secondary system and teachers generally have a role to play, but what will sell this model is if people come out with good-quality, sustainable jobs.  If the model works it will speak for itself.  If people coming through this system are outperforming third level graduates - I will come back to Senator D'Arcy's comments on third level - and if it worked properly in the jobs market it would speak for itself.</p><p>  The Deputy's final question was on disconnection with further education, as opposed to higher education.  The Skillnets network, albeit a relatively small initiative with an investment of &euro;15 million, is a very good model and is similar to what we are proposing for apprenticeships.  We are not proposing the establishment of a separate organisation but the idea of education and training providers and employers coming together and making a proposal which, if it passed different criteria, would then be funded.  The higher education institutions tend to be more receptive to that.  We could conjecture the reason, but F&Aacute;S was embedded with employers on the training side in regard to level 6 or below.  The further education system has been much more fragmented.  It has worked and responded well in some areas but not so well in others.  That was borne out by the recent review of further education, which, in fairness, sets a blueprint that, if followed, would address the concern I raised and that the Deputy picked up on.</p><p>  I echo Deputy O'Brien's comments on funding and the fact that we need to start sooner in terms of seed funding.</p><p>  With regard to meeting fluctuating demand and the fact that over 80% of apprenticeships in 2006 were in the construction sector - we saw what happened to that sector and to the apprentices - economies always move in cycles and there will always be changes in demand.  There are two ways of addressing this, the first of which was mentioned by the Deputy, namely, transferable skills, but there is also the idea of plotting progression routes, as he mentioned, out from levels 5 and 6 into higher education and the idea of job clusters.  That is something we have been thinking about internally.  We have been thinking about this in terms of sectors - for example, what would work for the medical devices sector.  However, many of the jobs, whether they are to do with Six Sigma, computer-aided design or quality engineering, are transferable, so perhaps we should start thinking in terms of clusters of jobs.  That is the sort of detail I presume the Apprenticeship Council will get into when it is considering sustainability, but if a quality engineer is employable whether he or she is in medical devices, food, ICT or a range of other sectors, future-proofing it as far as we can in that way is something we could consider.</p><p>  Senator D'Arcy's comments were on charges for apprenticeships.  Mr. Flaherty covered that to an extent, particularly with regard to the equality dimension between the third level student in an institute of technology and the apprentice.  The apprentice gets much more State support.  However, the entire area of third level funding needs to be examined, as well as the way in which students are supported.  The Minister announced a review of that last week under the chairmanship of Peter Cassells, and it feeds into this conversation in terms of the idea of student loans, etc.</p> <p> An interesting point was raised around tertiary education targets and their legitimacy.  There is no easy answer, except to say it shows the limitations of targets.  What we should remember about the higher education system is that much of it is vocational, which is a potential strength.  This is something that was raised when the committee was discussing the technological university a few weeks ago.  In European countries, particularly in Germany, tertiary education is academic.  It has a strong academic focus, whereas we have a potential strength with some of our universities and institutes of technology where the courses are vocational and have a critical role to play.  If one can plan progression routes and have them transparent and visible, this flexibility that the German system does not have is a potential strength of the Irish system.</p><p> The issue of gender balance was raised by Deputies Jonathan O'Brien and Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in.  It has probably been covered in broadening the range.  It is a subject that recurs, particularly in the area of science, technology, engineering and maths, the so-called "STEM" subjects, regarding attracting young women into related occupations.  There have been many initiatives and role models.  It is encouraging that the president of Engineers Ireland is a lady.  It is that kind of message that must keep being reinforced.  To go back to my original point, if there are good quality jobs as a result of this initiative, as I genuinely think there can be, it will sell itself to both genders.</p></speech>

I revert to the fees issue which was raised by Senator Jim D'Arcy.  One of the recommendations in the Department's summary is that apprentices continue to be paid both on and off the job, with no reduction in earnings during periods spent in education and training institutions.  The payment of fees very much contradict this.  Fees, in effect, represent a cut in the training allowance which is supposed to match what apprentices would receive on the job.  Dr. Rigney might come in on that issue.  What does the ICTU think about the charging of fees for apprentices?</p><p>  A model of employer-driven demand for apprentices still seems to be the one recommended in the report.  Should employers drive it?  They may be conservative or vested interests may be an issue.  What is being done to ensure that, ultimately, we will provide the number of apprentices in these areas which will be good for the economy and which will ensure we will have the people with the skills?  Has there been any analysis as part of the reporting process of the number of apprentices we need to enter the trades?  Has any figure been put on this?</p><p>  Mr. Rowan referred to the need to do it properly.  What things are coming on stream in terms of new sectors?  What is going to come up and what is being planned in the short term?</p><p>  On the gender issue, I note that when I was driving down Dawson Street the other day, I saw people working on the Luas line.  There was a woman there, which was unusual.  One takes note in the circumstances.  One is seeing more and more of this and there is an extent to which it is happening naturally.  I do not know whether she was a construction worker or an engineer, but the issue of the status of apprenticeships will have a knock-on effect in terms of there being more women entering them.</p></speech>

However, I am not sure I agree with the characterisation of the charging of a fee for a service as being, in essence, a reduction in wages.  It might also be worth bearing in mind that the review raises the possibility of employers paying both on and off the job where this might be feasible.  I suspect this might not be a one-size-fits-all solution, but the review went a little further than simply stating the existing arrangement should continue.</p><p>  On the employer-led model, I note that the call for proposals is, in some ways, a move - at least in the initial stages - in the direction of testing proposals against demand forecasting.  There is a very sophisticated set of employment forecasting resources in SOLAS which has a strategic labour market unit.  The unit produces occupational forecasts on a regular basis which informs the work of the expert group on future skills needs.  In considering proposals for new apprenticeships regard will be had to where the growth and the demand are likely to occur.  It is very difficult.  Dr. Rigney hit the nail on the head when he said it was a difficult issue in terms of existing apprenticeships.  The beautiful thing about it is that it is super sensitive to the level of demand in the economy in so far as the route into apprenticeship is to find a job.  When one has a job, the State guarantees that it will row in behind it in terms of education and training.  However, this has led to some of the difficulties around peaks and troughs and apprentices being made redundant.  Some possible solutions have been discussed, but it is difficult to say - this is recommended in the report - in the early stages of implementation that after the 100th electrician, we are going to say to the 101st, "Sorry, we will not train you."  It is one thing when one is planning a new apprenticeship from the ground up, but it is very challenging in terms of the existing trades and needs to be examined.  It raises all sorts of issue around equity.  The throwaway example of the 101st electrician is, probably, not valid.  One would have to do it by calling on employers to state how many apprentices they wanted.  It would be a radical shift away from where we are in the existing trades.  It runs in the opposite direction to some of the employer-led recommendations made in the report.</p><p>  I may leave it to Mr. Rowan to say what is likely to come up in the short term.  Mr. Donohoe might have a view also.  There have been a number of approaches to the Department and SOLAS from interested groups at the early stages.  Dr. Rigney referred to the demise of CERT and the groups have included people in the hospitality and tourism sectors and those at intermediate ICT skills levels.  There are also our colleagues on the medical devices side.  I attended a session they held in Athlone recently.</p> <p>Also, some interest has come up in the engineering sector.  In parts of the engineering sector that are not currently engaged, there is some apprenticeship as well.  I am sure Mr. Donohue would be aware of various sectors that feed into the IBEC structures, but these are some of the sectors that have indicated an interest at this stage.</p></speech>

The forecast for the year was that 1,900 young people were to be registered.  That is based on our research team looking at last year, this year and next year.  To the middle of June, there were 1,214, so we will be way ahead.  It is difficult to predict the demand precisely.  A total of 1,214 young people have been registered this year to the middle of June.  September would be the next peak time.  We expect the number to increase quite a lot.  That is a 49% increase on last year.  In effect, that is a significant return to what it was.</p><p>  As to what type of ideas we have or people who have approached us, Mr. Flaherty has covered them.  I have to say that we are not developing an apprenticeship; we are looking at, and may test out, some ideas that may eventually lead to apprenticeship.  We do not want to pre-empt the work.</p><p>  The areas of chefs, retail and ICT are the three areas on which we have been approached and on which we are having talks.  We are working through those.  If we test something out, it will be a programme that will be an apprenticeship look-alike but it will not be an apprenticeship course.</p></speech>

The local authority will call for the proposals and it is the local authority that will deem something to be an apprenticeship or not.  We will not be in that space.  Any work that we do between now and then over the next year will take into account what the apprenticeship review stated and embed some parts of that into it to test them out.</p></speech>

They make the case - in my view, quite persuasively - that apprentices are being charged fees which are allegedly for student services, despite the fact that for the majority of their short time in college they are not in a position to avail of those services and, additionally, they are paying PAYE and PRSI, so they are making their contribution to society in a different way.<br />As regards potential for further apprenticeship designation, while that will emerge, it is important to remember that traditionally in apprenticeship - solicitor apprenticeship is a classic case - apprentices accept a low wage for a period of time in training to progress to a higher wage.  Hospitality is traditionally a low-wage sector.  If one looks at the Galway city edition of <i>The Connacht Tribune</i>for the week before last, the local head of the Irish Hotels Federation stated that people will not work in their sector even though they pay the third highest minimum wage in western Europe.  Regardless of the rate of the minimum wage, apprentices will not accept low pay for a period of time in order to then work for the minimum wage.  This has to be sold to the mammies of Ireland who sit beside their offspring when they are making out CAO forms.  That is the situation.<br />The other matter about the German model is that Irish society has bought into the idea of a leaving certificate that will qualify a person for everything.  In an ideal world it might be great to have the German dual system and say that one must make a choice at the age of 15 or 16 years, but I do not think Irish society will accept that.  Irish society, as I stated, has bought into the idea that everyone does the leaving certificate.  That is a societal value that we hold.  It may be wrong from the point of view of the sociologist, but it is the value that we as a society hold.</p></speech>

As a major part of the system, they were only able to make a submission.  They feel they should have had more direct consultation.  Does Mr. Flaherty have any comments on that?</p></speech>

It was not a recommendation that there be a reduction to two years.<br />The point with regard to duration - this speaks to the review of the curriculum and the existing apprenticeships - is that it must be led by the learning outcomes that are required in order to undertake the occupation.  It depends on how complex they are, how long it takes to embed those skills, and how long one needs to spend on the job and off the job.  That is the key determinant of how long an apprenticeship would be.  Because the group adopted a view of apprenticeship as being deep, sustained and leading to autonomous and competent workers, it recommended that the period should not fall below two years, but that is very much a floor, not a target.<br />On the short versus longer block release, without getting too technical about this, the annual student contribution is currently &euro;2,500.  That is what one pays.  It is increasing to &euro;2,750 for 2014-15.  Typically, apprentices are taken in in three 10- or 11-week blocks during the year, which roughly equate to the three academic terms, and they pay one third of that figure.  Therefore, it is <i>pro rata</i>.  As the Chairman correctly stated, there are some apprenticeships which involve longer periods in the institutions - for example, for those studying electrical instrumentation on aircraft, where the blocks are longer.  In those cases, the <i>pro rata</i>fee is different.  If their block release is longer, they pay more.  It is a greater percentage of the annual amount.  That is probably not welcomed by those apprentices, but it is equitable insofar as it is based on how long one spends in the institution.<br />On the question of consultation with the institutes of technology-----</p></speech>

Apart from the submissions, of which there were over 70, we had three and a half days of face-to-face submissions from groups that came in to the Department.</p> <p>Institutes of Technology Ireland was among those.  Therefore, there was face-to-face dialogue.</p></speech>

Mr. Phil Flaherty made the point that this was a floor, not a target.  This is a floor and we were very mindful of differentiating between apprenticeships, internships, traineeships and all the other work-based learning models.  We also felt it should be tied to the learning outcomes.  No disrespect to tilers, for example, but the current apprenticeship period for a tiler is four years, the same period applicable to people who are doing aircraft maintenance.  Clearly, that is not an efficient use of time or resources.</p><p>  Let me pick up on the point as to whether the enterprise-led model is a good one and whether there is innate conservatism.  I do not believe there is because I cannot think of any other model that would work.  Labour market forecasting is a relatively inexact science.  We have very good forecasters in this State but one needs the intelligence that businesses bring.  In the consultation informing the work of the review group, we asked our members what would get them to the table on apprenticeships because we have to sell the idea to them.  Three points arose.  First, and most important, was that there has to be a genuine demand.  It does not matter how much the State is prepared to support apprenticeships if there is not a skills demand.  Without this, employers will not get involved.  Second, there has to be a genuine influence on the occupations and occupational standards, rather than the details of pedagogy and curriculum design.  The latter are quite rightly the remit of the education and training providers.  There should be at least some influence on the occupational standards, particularly.  Third was the possibility of State support for the training and education elements.  Those three boxes have to be ticked before a company will engage.</p><p>  There are a number of sectors to be considered, and some have been suggested.  I agree that there are great opportunities in hospitality, retail, advanced manufacturing, ICT, etc., but they will be realised only through the process we have suggested, which has the virtue of being flexible.  If the demand does not exist and the proposals are not thought through properly, they will not receive support.  That is the beauty of this model.  It has to be underpinned by all the other agencies of the State in terms of quality assurance, qualifications, accreditation and matters pertaining to the State providers.  I genuinely believe the proposal has potential.</p></speech>

If employers will not accept foundation mathematics for an apprenticeship because it does not give people the required fluency, why are we providing it?  I do not know the answer to that question.

The medical devices sector in Ireland employs up to 25,000 people, which makes it, per capita, the biggest medical technology employer within Europe.  In February of this year, we conducted a survey of our members.  Over 80% stated they are interested in an apprenticeship in medical devices.  At present, we are examining a proposal for a pilot apprenticeship at level VI in mechanical engineering.  Contrary to what was outlined earlier, there is an option in this case to move from level VI to level VIII.  At present, there is a two-year programme, with a one-year add-on for level VII, and obviously a one-year add-on for level VIII.  As a sector, we really welcome this.</p></speech>

I would like to set out the background to the amendments and what is proposed.</p><p>  As Members will know, the Bill as published made it unlawful for a person, other than a licensed operator, to act as a bookmaker and the Minister for Justice was tasked with compliance regarding remote operators.  The Bill provides that, where an unlicensed remote operator engages with punters in this jurisdiction, the Minister for justice will issue a notice to that individual or company to cease activity.</p> <p>The Bill, as published, also provided that the Minister for justice may apply to the District Court for an order directing service providers, including financial institutions, advertisers and Internet service providers, not to provide services to specified unlicensed operators.  In addition, it also provided for the revoking of a licence and the issue of similar court orders in these circumstances.</p><p> The amendments that are now before the House provide for the temporary assignment of responsibility for enforcement against unlicensed remote operators from the Minister for justice to the Revenue Commissioners - the key point, pending the establishment of the gambling regulator under the proposed gambling control legislation.  This means that Revenue will be responsible for bringing summary prosecutions against unlicensed bookmakers and remote operators.  In this context, Revenue will operate a new model for enforcing compliance by unlicensed remote operators.  The model will operate as follows: where an unlicensed operator is accepting bets from within the State, Revenue will issue a notice to that operator of the need to become properly licensed or cease to provide betting services in the State; and should an operator contravene a requirement of this notice, the operator will have committed an offence and will be liable to penalties.</p><p> Given the practical considerations associated with prosecuting unlicensed operators outside the State, the compliance model will also enable Revenue to take effective action to prevent unlicensed operators carrying on business in the State.  The Bill, as amended, prohibits Internet service providers, advertisers or persons promoting products, from providing services in the State to unlicensed remote operators.  Revenue may issue compliance notices.  The Internet service providers may appeal a compliance notice to the District Court which will either affirm or direct Revenue to withdraw the notice.  A person who fails to comply with such a notice by the specified date shall be guilty of an offence.  It is proposed to bring forward an amendment on Report Stage, or if this does not prove possible, when the Bill is in the Seanad to specify the penalties that will apply.</p><p> Because of the complex way the international debit and credit card payment system works, the most effective way of preventing unlicensed operators receiving payment from consumers in the State is to work with the international payment service industry.  In an approach similar to that taken in the United Kingdom, Revenue proposes to enter into voluntary arrangements under which the international payment service providers will take action to prevent operators using their payment systems to carry out illegal betting.  The Irish Banking Federation and the Irish payment service operators have indicated their commitment, in principle, to concluding an arrangement with Revenue for this purpose.</p><p> Action to prevent Internet access by Irish consumer to unlicensed operators and to prevent unlicensed operators using credit card payment systems for accepting payment provide effective tools for enforcing compliance by remote operators carrying on business in the State.  We believe that the main operators in the Irish market will comply with the law and will welcome the opportunity to become licensed so that they can continue to do business here.  Operators who do not wish to become licensed in Ireland can voluntarily block communications and transactions with Irish consumers and most are expected to do so to avoid Revenue enforcement action, which would also risk reputational damage to the operator in the eyes of gambling regulators elsewhere.  Illicit operators on the margins of the market are unlikely to attract a high level of business from Irish consumers in view of the perceived risk that they will fail to pay out.</p><p> The compliance model proposed provides the most practical and effective approach given the inherent difficulties in dealing with persons operating largely outside the State.  I commend the amendments to the House.</p></speech>

These amendments would make it compulsory for the Minister to publish each application online until the application is adjudicated on and would compel the Minister for Justice and Equality to take observations from third parties, which may be the case but is not in the legislation.  This will allow for more transparency as to who is applying for the certificate and allows for people to flag to the Minister of the day, issues that he or she may not be aware of.</p></speech>

The onus is on the applicant to advertise the application in a daily national newspaper.  In addition, the Minister for Justice and Equality may in accordance with section 32, request information from the Revenue Commissioners, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or a foreign regulatory body for the purpose of making a decision on an application for a certificate of personal fitness. </p><p>  It should be recognised that the Betting (Amendment) Bill is an interim measure, pending the enactment of the gambling control Bill, which is due to be published early next year.  Upon enactment of the gambling control Bill, the Minister for Justice and Equality will become the sole regulator for all forms of gambling with the exception of the national lottery.  This will provide for a comprehensive licensing and regulatory framework.</p><p>  In light of this, it is not proposed to accept these amendments.</p></speech>

In my view these amendments make the section more transparent and will assist the Minister.</p><p>  It is quite interesting that this is the first time I have seen in a Bill the provision that requires the applicant for a licence to provide an e-mail address.  If one wants to be a bookmaker and one does not have an e-mail address, one is snookered.  </p><p>  Obviously the Internet is the way we communicate and the way many people get their information.  While the Bills refers to placing notices in two national daily newspapers, today's national daily newspaper in my house is lighting the fire the following morning.  The Internet is where one sources information.  If the day passes, the daily newspaper is gone.  I suggest that my amendment should have been accepted, even in the spirit of the legislation.  I do not think it would have made a significant different to the Minister.</p><p>  I understand that the gambling control Bill will be introduced shortly.  It is a pity that we are not dealing with both Bills concurrently. </p> <p>This Bill is peppered with requirements to publish different types of applications and certificates in two daily newspapers.  The decision to confine it to daily newspapers limits the options available to people.  A person who is looking for a bookmaker's licence in my own parish of Gaoth Dobhair, for example, will have to publish an application in <i>The Irish Times</i>and the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  I expect that those who might raise issues about that person's fitness would be more likely to look at the local newspapers.  I suggest that the relevant section of the Bill, which I am not seeking to amend at this time, should be re-examined.  I am not seeking to diminish the requirement to place notices in national newspapers.  Given that people in most places outside Dublin look at local newspapers like <i>The Kerryman</i>, <i>The Corkman</i>, the <i>Donegal Democrat</i>and the <i>Donegal News</i>, I am suggesting that there should be a requirement for notices to be published in local newspapers too, where appropriate.</p></speech>

As he has said, all of the gambling issues in the State can be examined in an holistic way in the context of the forthcoming gambling control Bill.  I remind the committee when one applies for planning permission, one has to place a notice in a local newspaper as opposed to the council's website.  I know it is a different area.  I take the Deputy's point.  Obviously, the Minister will be reading this later.  I cannot give any commitment in relation to this matter.</p></speech>

The Minister of State will probably respond by saying this would be more appropriately dealt with in the context of the gambling control Bill.  It is important at this stage to highlight the issue of minors gambling not only in bookmakers' shops but also online, where it is far more difficult to control young people who want to gamble.  A &quot;Prime Time&quot; special on this issue some time ago showed that minors are able to place bets in bookies' shops.  As most young people are <i>au fait</i>with technology, they are easily able to circumvent the minimal controls that are in place at the moment.  I am proposing that if the holder of a licence has &quot;failed to take adequate steps to prevent persons under the age of 18 undertaking betting transactions&quot;, that should be grounds for the revocation of a licence.</p></speech>

All of us who are parents are obviously concerned about our children.  If someone who is under age gets his or her hands on a credit card, he or she can be in business straight away simply by using the Internet to access <i>paddypower.com</i>or <i>boylesports.com</i>.  This is a serious issue.  The principal Act provides that it is an offence &quot;to make a bet or enter into a betting transaction with&quot; a person under the age of 18.  The Bill, as published, provides that &quot;the Minister for Justice and Equality may revoke a certificate of personal fitness ....  where he is satisfied that .... the holder of the certificate is not a fit and proper person to hold a bookmaker&rsquo;s licence, a remote bookmaker&rsquo;s licence or a remote betting intermediary&rsquo;s licence&quot;.  It further provides &quot;a relevant consideration&quot; regarding the refusal to issue or revocation of a certificate of personal fitness arises when &quot;the applicant, or a body corporate of which the applicant is a relevant officer, stands convicted of an offence&quot; under certain Acts of the Oireachtas, including the betting Acts.  Accordingly, the Minister agrees that the protection of minors is indeed a fundamental principle of the legislation and is satisfied that this is already provided for through the provisions of the existing legislation and in the Bill as published.  Therefore, he does not propose to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

I have a problem with credit cards being the <i>modus operandi</i>upon which licences are awarded.  I do not know of any bookmaker at any race track who plugs in a credit card apparatus to take one's details.  I believe that if one wishes to place a bet, one should have the money on one, or one should have access to a debit card.  I have raised this issue with the Department and the Minister.  I put it to the Minister of State that the problem of gambling addiction, which is well documented and not easily overcome, has been exacerbated by the easing of access to credit cards.  I remind him that many people have publicly announced the level of debt they have accumulated.  I suggest that if we were to restrict these transactions to debit cards, nobody could use a credit card to bet money he or she does not have.  I do not think there is a bookmaker out there who would offer credit on these terms, so why should a financial institution facilitate somebody going into hock or debt for the purposes of a fun activity?  An enormous level of debt can mount up as a result of this addiction.  I would like to hear the Minister of State's thoughts on that, if possible.  This relates to the licensing issue raised by Deputy Michael McGrath.  Does the Department have any thoughts on this matter?  Has it worked through what I am suggesting?</p></speech>

The Department's argument is that if one uses one's debit card, people could theoretically have access to one's bank account, whereas that is not the case if one uses one's credit card.  We will note the Deputy's points.  I will ask the Minister to consider them.  I am not making any commitment.  It is clear that we need to be restrictive in this area, particularly if we are to protect minors and people with gambling addictions.  It is definitely a serious issue.</p></speech>

It might encourage people to go back to the betting shops and engage in the social activity that gambling is supposed to be.  The keyboard warriors might be less likely to lose the run of themselves if they are in a healthier environment.</p></speech>

These licences will be valid for a two-year period.  This Bill also extends the period of validity for existing bookmakers&rsquo; licences and the period for registration of bookmaking premises to two years.  The Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 brought the present legislative provisions for excise duties payable on licences into line with the changes made to the licensing provisions under this Bill.  The 2013 Act also provided for an increase in the excise duty payable for traditional bookmakers' licences and registration of bookmaking premises, in line with the extension of the period of validity for both to two years, and provided the option of paying the excise duty in full or in two equal instalments.  These amendments bring this Bill into line with the instalment arrangements.  Basically, we are providing for these moneys to be paid over two years.</p></speech>

This has been raised with me by several independent bookmakers who accept bets by telephone.  They view the threshold as quite low and feel that it should be higher.  If they have to submit a separate remote bookmaker&rsquo;s licence, a significant cost is incurred.</p></speech>

One is looking at, say, a 15 % return on &euro;250,000 which would not really sustain a business.  It might sound like much money in marginal terms but it is actually not an awful lot.  For a small independent betting shop with no significant online base, accepting such bets is usually with individual customers who they know will not be overexposed.  I suggest the threshold should be raised.  Will the Minister examine it for Report Stage?</p></speech>

This levy provides an opportunity to raise moneys on new forms of betting.  Other sporting organisations could benefit from this funding too rather than 100% of any bet placed on any sporting event going to the horse and greyhound fund.</p> <p>Although the Department of Finance always says it cannot ring-fence money for anything, not mental health or suicide prevention, legislation was passed in 2001 to achieve this for the horse and greyhound fund.  Can we ensure the receipts from this new levy will not be ring-fenced for the same fund and can we have an assurance that a different arrangement will be in place?  It is highly questionable that the arrangement will still be in place for this, underpinned by the legislation.  Unless it is amended or repealed, there is little we can do.  I am anxious for the Minister to clarify that receipts from the fund would not be ring-fenced for the horse and greyhound fund and that we would have an understanding that the funding mechanism would, perhaps, be reviewed in the future because the legislation was passed in 2001 and we live in very different times.  Many different sporting organisations would be keen to impress upon the Minister and his Department that it needs to be reviewed.  While I do not take away from the validity of the fantastic resource that is horse and greyhound racing, a dedicated fund for it might be said to be unusual.</p></speech>

Whether we like it or not, even a 1% online levy will not make up the shortfall in the fund, which the Exchequer has supplemented each year through its revenues along with the 1% levy on high street bookies.  Despite the impression that the horse and greyhound fund can become self-sufficient, the Minister says the revenue goes into the Exchequer and may end up anywhere.  It is interesting, to say the least, because it is not the impression the industry or I have.</p></speech>

While I commend the officials on bringing forward a Bill that has not been heavily amended, they have had probably the longest period of time of any Bill I have seen.  Notwithstanding the issues regarding having Commission approval, it is disappointing that we have lost tens of millions of euro of revenue because of the delay in the introduction of this charge on online gambling over the past number of years.  The Finance Bill of 2009 increased the levy to 2% but it was never enacted by the then Minister, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan.  This goes back a long way.</p><p>  The levy must be increased.  The former Minister of State, now MEP, former Deputy Brian Hayes, and the Minister, Deputy Noonan, have said we must get it across the line and then examine an increase in the levy.  While it is expected that the levy will be increased, the fact that the Bill has been delayed for so long suggests that we should increase the levy now.  The State badly needs the revenue.  No matter when we bring in the &euro;20 million from online gambling, the horse and greyhound fund will still need to be supplemented by Exchequer funding if it is to remain at its current level, and that sticks in my craw, particularly as cuts in different areas are announced.  Although last year we examined discretionary medical cards, the Government passed a motion to put money into the horse and greyhound fund.  While the industry has an economic benefit for the State, the fund goes to the winners of races in the State, and a large amount goes to certain stables, which is very difficult to swallow.</p> <p>I am familiar with the economic benefits of the horse racing industry in the State.  While my amendment has been ruled out of order, when the Bill comes before the D&aacute;il in September and then goes to the Seanad, it should include an increase in the levy.  Alternatively it should be addressed a few weeks later when the budget goes through.  The Minister should signal his intention.</p><p> Are we missing a trick here?  I ask the Minister of State and his officials to correct me if I am wrong.  We are dealing with the taxing of online gambling.  If I go onto the Paddy Power website and place a bet on a horse or a football match, the turnover will be taxed.  However, if I go onto the Paddy Power website and play blackjack, the turnover the company makes on that is not taxed.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

If we look at online gambling, sport represents a small proportion of the overall book; it is what attracts people in.  The heavy money is spent on the roulette tables, the poker tables, Texas hold 'em and other such games.  None of that is taxed in this country.  We are taxing online gambling for the first time but we are only taxing a small part of online gambling.  There is obviously difficulty with a turnover tax on some of the other forms, including roulette, Texas hold 'em, poker and blackjack.  However, we can and should develop a profits tax for this.  We need to move into the realm of profits, which would not be a major draw on the Exchequer.  I am informed that approximately 93% of all turnover is paid out again so we would be basically taxing the same thing.  By doing that, it is easier to tax the other books which would be more lucrative for the State.</p><p>  I like to gamble the odd time on all of these types of books, but this is taxing a vice.  It is probably the only thing left in the State that is not taxed appropriately.  I am talking about online activity.  I do not believe people will be turned off if there were a 3% profits tax on a bet.  People will not be turned off over paying 30 cent on winnings of a tenner and if they are, they can afford it because they choose to do this; they do not have to do this.  We can consider the things we have taxed in the past such as fuel to heat people's homes or to get to work in a car, or basics such putting a shirt on one's back or food on the table.  This is an area where we should look at the rate.  Overall we should consider whether we are really taxing gambling.</p><p>  I have talked about online gambling, but there is another area of gambling.  We can walk into any casino in Dublin tonight and there is no duty or tax.  I accept there is tax on the profits of the company and so forth, but there is no duty.  We are identifying one wee area and it took us a long time to close this area down in terms of online sports betting, but there are whole other areas we have just left out.  As we struggle to balance the books in the State we should focus on this area.  I encourage the Government to go down this route.  Moving from a turnover tax to a profit tax is a way to capture those books and also to have a rate that ensures the industry is sustainable.  It would bring in sufficient revenue to the State to fund the horse and greyhound racing fund and also to cover other areas such as gambling addiction and other areas that badly need it.</p></speech>

We all know of the positive benefits of young people especially being involved in sport.  On the other hand we know of the negative consequences of people developing an unhealthy relationship with gambling.  To my mind it makes perfect sense to increase the revenue yield from this source.  I believe it makes much more sense to tax winnings than to tax turnover.  If I won &euro;1,000 on a bet, I would not have any problem paying &euro;20 or &euro;30 to the State by way of a tax.</p><p>  There is also the issue of not capturing what is essentially online gambling.  We need to capture it in all its forms.  That issue is complex.  I accept its scope is wider than the traditional bet we are capturing with this legislation.  However, the debate needs to move on quite quickly to deal with those issues.</p></speech>

As they have acknowledged, this is the start of the process.  Clearly once the gambling control regulator is in place, all these issues will need to be addressed.  The Deputies are pushing an open door in terms of the points they are making.  I will obviously bring their points to the Minister's attention.  The question of increasing the rate now from 1% would be a matter for the Finance Bill and not for this legislation.  However, they have made very good points.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.233" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014070900008#P00600"><p>I have for many years suggested increasing the rate to 3%.  If we were to increase the rate to 3% and without changing anything else, high street bookies would be put out of business overnight.  High street bookies are going out of business overnight for other reasons, such as people moving to using mobile phones and so forth.  However, there will be a certain level at which that will plateau and we are probably reaching it at this point.  The betting duty is putting high street bookies out of business.</p><p>  The rate needs to move to 3% and placed on the punter.  At the moment the shop or company absorbs the 1%.  If it were increased to 1.5% or 2% the likelihood is that the larger organisations could absorb that until they wiped out the high street bookies and then possibly they would pass it on to their customers.  It has to be of a sufficient scale but not inappropriate to gamblers.  I believe companies will not be able to absorb 3% and it would be passed on.  It could also be done legislatively.  If the Government did that overnight, it would save jobs.</p><p>  I have looked at the audited accounts of some high street bookies and they have showed me the margins they are making.  They have closed down shops in the past and they are closing down more.  They are in debt to the Revenue and in arrangements with the Revenue because they cannot pay this.  However, this should be passed on to the customer.  Gambling is a vice and if I am gambling, I should know that I am paying the tax.  I am not suggesting that we impose a 3% tax and leave it as it is with it being absorbed by the industry, because it cannot be absorbed.  We should go back to how it used to be where it was passed on to the customer.  The best way of doing that is by applying it to winnings because nobody minds having a deduction from their winnings, although some people might mind.  However, it is like "take it or leave it" at that stage.</p></speech>

There was a major campaign at the time.  It might have been in the 1980s.  They succeeded and they claimed there was an exponential increase in betting as a result.  The points are very well made and I think the Minister will pay attention to them.</p></speech>

Today in law it is the case that if a bookie creates any material for distribution related to gambling odds for a football match, it is illegal and a party can be prosecuted for it.  This was brought to my attention when somebody sent me a photograph from Mayo featuring our Taoiseach, Deputy Kenny, in a Paddy Power outlet, holding a sign for the odds on a match between Donegal and Mayo.  I was asked if I knew this was illegal.</p></speech>

The fact this is illegal led me to examine this section of the Bill.  The point of the correspondence was not that I should report the Taoiseach for involvement in illegal activity in a Paddy Power shop or the journalist or shop owner who may have breached the law when the photograph was printed.  The point was instead the archaic laws which exist for this sector.  A number of bookie accounts in my Twitter account are giving odds of 10/1 for Argentina to win the soccer match tonight and that type of advertising is illegal in this country.  Anybody publicising odds outside a premises, whether in the newspaper or anywhere else, is breaking the law as it stands, and any citizen can report this to the Garda.  That is why this element of the law should be repealed.</p><p>  Paddy Power had an advertisement related to the outcome of the Oscar Pistorius trial, and in my view and that of many others it was deeply distasteful to say the least.  The company is involved in innovative ways to advertise its product and some of the advertisements step over the mark, while others are just clever and cheeky.  The advertisement to which I refer stepped over the mark.  Nevertheless, there is nothing to prohibit any company taking out an advertisement in a national newspaper outlining odds on whether a person will be found guilty of murder, although there is a law against a local bookmaker publishing in the same newspaper odds for "Bodyke Celtic" playing "High Street United" in a local derby.  That does not make sense.</p><p>  This amendment seeks to repeal the section.  We should be dealing with a gambling control Bill, and I hope it will tackle this issue.  I am concerned that this may be put on the long finger because the Minister has changed.  The gambling control Bill must be introduced as a soon as possible and it should have run along with this legislation.</p></speech>

I may have to wait until Deputy Fitzpatrick becomes the trainer again for the odds to improve again.  The point is well made.</p></speech>

Certain companies should have been subject to VAT but were not.  Those who pay betting duty are exempt from VAT, and I am not arguing that bookies should pay VAT.  Nevertheless, a number of companies operate in Ireland but do not pay betting duty or VAT.  The likes of Betfair or Betdaq operate a service whereby they are an intermediary and they do not pay betting duty.  They offer a service between two individuals so they are not subject to VAT.  Section 34 of the Value-Added Tax Consolidation Act 2010 implies they should be subject to VAT and I do not know any other service in the State that is not subject to VAT.  I am interested to hear why these companies have not paid VAT.  If they paid betting duty, it would be fair enough, but they have not.  They have operated here for many years without paying VAT at all on the provided service.</p></speech>

European Court of Justice jurisprudence has confirmed the principle of VAT fiscal neutrality with gambling, namely, that the exemption applies regardless of the medium through with the bet is placed, once the services provided are identical or similar from the perspective of the consumer and meet the same needs of the consumer.  This means electronically supplied gambling services that are identical or similar, from the perspective of the consumer, to those services provided by traditional bookmakers, such as those subject to betting duty, also benefit from VAT exemption.  Remote bookmakers and remote betting intermediaries will continue to be exempt from VAT following the enactment of this Bill.</p></speech>

They do not take a bet and they do not lay a bet but provide a service for one person to lay a bet and another person to take a bet.  The exchanges do not take or lay a bet but provide a service.  Under section 34 of the same Act the Minister of State referenced they should be subject to VAT.</p></speech>

We are all well aware that an addiction to gambling can cause devastating societal consequences, in some cases, so we should deal with that issue now.  Gambling legislation is just as important as increasing revenue for the State through betting activity.  I ask the Minister of State to convey to Government that we need the gambling control Bill brought forward as quickly as possible.  We will all propose specific measures that will help address the issue and Deputy Spring mentioned an innovative proposal.  There are many more proposals that need to be actively considered.

Gambling is not an enjoyable experience for a large proportion of people.  People chase bets and hope for a silver lining but families and lives are destroyed in the process.  It would be nice if it were true that only large corporate entities created a gambling culture.  However, the State encourages gambling through a lotto and the National Lottery.  It is still gambling even though they use nice advertisements and all the rest.  A person can go into a shop, mark numbers on a lotto slip and hand it over with his or her money to a shop assistant which is probably less addictive, in my view and without a scientific background, than the very addictive scratch cards which are part of the national lottery.  I have seen how addictive scratch cards can be with my own eyes and seen people really hopeful that they will win the next big prize.  The State does very little to support gambling addiction but it has a responsibility and it is important that it contributes.  I understand that only the bookmakers provide such funding at present.  I want the State to take responsibility and not pass it on.</p><p>  Amendment, by leave, withdrawn. </p></speech>

We are joined by representatives of the Central Bank of Ireland and officials from the Department of Finance.  In commencing proceedings, I welcome Mr. Bernard Sheridan, director of consumer protection, Mr. Colm Kincaid, head of consumer protection, and Mr. Mick Stewart, deputy head of consumer protection, from the Central Bank of Ireland; and Mr. Pat Casey, principal officer, financial services division, Ms Br&iacute;d Kemple, assistant principal officer, financial services division, and Mr. Antoine MacDonncha, head of legal unit, from the Department of Finance.  The format of the meeting will be that Mr. Sheridan will make his opening remarks followed by Mr. Casey.  It should be noted that while the Central of Bank has been asked to address a range of matters relating to the collapse of Setanta Insurance, the Department of Finance will address matters specifically relating to the involvement of the insurance compensation fund, ICF.  A question and answer session with members will then ensue.<br />I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be switched off to ensure they do not cause interference with the broadcasting of the questions and answer session later.<br />To move on the formalities regarding witnesses appearing before Oireachtas committees, I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I invite Mr. Sheridan to make his opening statement to be followed by Mr. Casey.</p></speech>

The failure of any firm which impacts on Irish consumers, policyholders or claimants is a matter of serious concern for the Central Bank.  Policyholders buy insurance to protect themselves against future risks and therefore they should be able to rely on the cover for which they have paid.  Safeguarding consumers is one of the Central Bank&rsquo;s primary objectives, and with this in mind, the actions which the Central Bank has taken in regard to Setanta have been with the aim of protecting the interests of Irish consumers.</p><p>  I will give a brief overview of what the Central Bank&rsquo;s role has been in regard to Setanta.  Setanta is a company which was established in Malta in 2007 and was authorised and supervised by the Malta Financial Services Authority, MFSA.  Setanta sold insurance in Ireland on a freedom of services basis, that is, it was entitled to sell here once it had obtained authorisation from the MFSA under the provisions of the Single Market directives.  The firm did not operate on a branch basis in Ireland.  It did, however, have an administrative office in Blanchardstown.  Setanta was required to comply with conduct of business requirements of the Central Bank when selling to Irish consumers.  Setanta provided private and commercial motor insurance policies to Irish consumers and sold exclusively through approximately 230 brokers.  At the time it went into liquidation, Setanta had approximately 75,000 policyholders, two thirds of which were commercial motor insurance policies and one third of which were private motor insurance policies.</p><p>  In January 2014 the MFSA directed Setanta to cease carrying on the business of insurance, including the renewal of existing business.  On 16 April 2014 Setanta handed back its licence to the MFSA and on 17 April the firm announced that it was commencing a creditors' voluntary liquidation as it was unable to meet its outstanding claims in full.  A creditors' meeting was held on 30 April 2014 in Malta at which a liquidator was appointed to administer the liquidation of Setanta.  All policies were cancelled by the liquidator with effect from 29 May 2014.</p><p>  In early September 2013 the Central Bank became concerned about the financial position of Setanta based on market intelligence, and as a result, contacted the MFSA, on a regulator to regulator basis, seeking confirmation that Setanta was solvent and that it had sufficient assets to meets its liabilities to Irish policyholders.  The MFSA confirmed that it received monthly management accounts and solvency calculations and, according to its latest management accounts, Setanta was meeting the relevant solvency requirements in terms of the EU solvency I directive.</p><p>  In October 2013 the Central Bank conducted an inspection of Setanta to examine its practices in regard to claims handling.  In November 2013 the Central Bank met Setanta to discuss the findings of the inspection, including our concerns about how the company was reserving for its claims.  The Central Bank also contacted the MFSA to share our findings and a copy of our inspection report was forwarded to the MFSA requesting that it take appropriate action.  Due to our ongoing concerns for Irish policyholders, the Central Bank continued to engage very closely with the MFSA following the submission of the report to it.  In January 2014 the Central Bank received further market intelligence which raised further concerns.  We again raised these with the MFSA.  We also wrote to the Department of Finance outlining our concerns in regard to Setanta and advised it of the possibility of a potential call on the insurance compensation fund in the event of failure of this firm.</p><p>  Following receipt of the Central Bank&rsquo;s report on the findings of the inspection, the MFSA appointed a liability loss adjuster firm in December 2013 to carry out an independent assessment of Setanta&rsquo;s outstanding loss reserves.  On 16 January 2014 the MFSA notified the Central Bank that it had received initial indications from the liability loss adjuster that there was a material shortfall in Setanta&rsquo;s reserves.  Based on the final report received, and its knowledge of Setanta as its prudential regulator, the MFSA directed Setanta to cease writing new business and issuing renewals with effect from the close of business on 24 January 2014 and a Maltese firm was appointed to manage an orderly run-off.</p><p>  On 27 January 2014 Setanta issued a letter to its entire broker network to inform them of the MFSA&rsquo;s direction to cease writing new business and issuing further renewals with effect from the close of business on 24 January 2014.  Setanta also requested that the brokers issue a letter to the policyholders that provided information about the MFSA&rsquo;s direction.  Following the issuing of the direction, the MFSA continued to engage with Setanta in an attempt to resolve its financial difficulties and ultimately informed the Central Bank on 11 April that Setanta had failed to secure a resolution to its solvency deficit and that the directors were going to propose a voluntary liquidation to its shareholders.  On 16 April 2014 the MFSA informed the Central Bank that Setanta had handed back its licence after the shareholders resolved to wind it up.</p><p>  The Central Bank published a notice on its website on 17 April informing the public and the media about the liquidation of Setanta and that policyholders should make arrangements to obtain alternative cover without delay.  This notice has been updated as new developments occurred.  At the same time, Setanta notified its broker network that a solvent run-off of the business was no longer possible and that this information should be brought to the attention of policyholders.  The Central Bank also communicated directly with the brokers and we instructed them to contact policyholders regarding making alternative insurance arrangements and to offer to assist them to obtain proof of no-claims bonus.</p> <p>We also engaged with the representative bodies of the brokers, the Professional Insurance Brokers Association, PIBA and the Irish Brokers Association, IBA, as well as Insurance Ireland, to help facilitate policyholders transfer to another insurer.  The Central Bank also provided advice to policyholders who contacted us, as well as providing information to the National Consumer Agency.<br />Currently, the liquidator is in the process of assessing the level of potential claims and the assets and liabilities of Setanta in order to estimate the actual shortfall.  This process could take some time, particularly as some claims may not as yet have been submitted, and also some claims may be ongoing for some considerable time.<br />Policyholders or third party claimants who have not yet submitted their claim to the liquidator should do so as soon as possible.  This will ensure the claimant will be included as a creditor of Setanta when its liabilities are being assessed.  Our understanding is that premium refunds are automatically included on the creditors list.<br />The failure of Setanta has clearly impacted on all its policyholders.  While the Central Bank&rsquo;s supervision of Setanta extends to conduct of business issues only, we have sought to protect the interests of Irish policyholders through engagement with the Malta Financial Services Authority, MFSA, the firm and the liquidator.  We will continue to ensure affected consumers are fully informed of any developments and to<font color="#FF0000"></font>liaise with the MFSA during the liquidation process.  I thank the members for their attention.</p></speech>

The fund is maintained and administered under the control of the President of the High Court.  Amounts are paid from the fund, with the approval of the High Court, to a person in regard to an insurer in liquidation or administration, in respect of claims under policies issued by the insolvent insurer in circumstances where it is unlikely that the claims can be met otherwise than from the fund.  The Accountant of the High Court provides annual accounts of the fund to the Department of Finance and the Central Bank, and these are laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  In the period since the early 1980s, the fund has advanced moneys to Primor plc, formerly PMPA Insurance Company, Icarom plc, formerly Insurance Corporation of Ireland, and since 2011, QIL, Quinn Insurance Limited.  Currently, there is a balance of &euro;48 million in the fund.<br />In accordance with section 5 of the 1964 Act, in the event that the fund does not have sufficient funds to meet a payment approved by the High Court, the Minister for Finance may, on the recommendation of the Central Bank, advance Central Fund moneys to the fund to enable payments out of the fund to be made promptly, and on the terms and conditions he decides to be appropriate.  The fund is, ultimately, funded by contributions from insurers.  Prior to 2011, the Act provided for charges to be levied on insurers in respect of policies issued regardless of the location of the insured risks.  Following advice from the Attorney General that charges could not be levied on insurance companies in respect of risks outside the State, an amendment was made to the 1964 Act through the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011.  The amendment Act provides that the fund shall be funded by contributions from insurers who issue policies in respect of risks in the State, whether the insurers are based in Ireland or in another member state, and it changed the scope of the fund from one that covers the risks of policyholders of Irish authorised insurance companies to one which covers all insured risk in the State, except for specific excluded risks.<br />Under the Act, the Central Bank has responsibility for determining whether the fund requires financial support and the level of contribution to be paid to the fund by insurers.  The contribution may not exceed 2% of aggregate of the gross premiums paid to each insurer for policies issued in respect of risks in the State.  A levy in accordance with section 6 of the Act, as substituted by section 7 of the Insurance (Amendment) Act 2011, came into effect on 1 January 2012.  The Central Bank set the levy at a maximum 2% of aggregate of the gross premiums paid.  The Department of Finance estimates that the levy will generate approximately &euro;65 million per annum.  In 2013, the levy generated &euro;64.6 million.  The levy is payable quarterly in arrears to the Revenue Commissioners, who have responsibility for its collection, and they transfer the proceeds of the levy to the ICF account.<br />The committee will be aware that the liquidation of an insurance company is a legally complex and time-consuming process.  In general terms, under the Statute of Limitations, claimants are given two years following an accident to make an initial claim.  However, it could take several years for a particular case to be settled. Protracted legal challenges also add years, and often additional costs, to the claims process.  These are factors that the liquidator is currently examining to get an estimate of the cost of claims in the Setanta liquidation.<br />Committee members will be aware that the liquidation of Setanta Insurance is still at an early stage.  The liquidator has advised us that claims and amounts incurred but not reported are likely to be considerably greater than in the statement of affairs as prepared by the directors at the time of liquidation.  The liquidator has appointed Towers Watson to conduct an assessment of the adequacy of the claims reserves quoted in the statement of affairs.  To date, he has only received preliminary information from Towers Watson on claims and incurred but not reported reserve amounts as part of a detailed examination of the insurance claims against the company.  The liquidator has emphasised that any information on claims is subject to change as more information is received and this may have a material impact on the overall estimate of the likely maximum dividend that will be payable from the liquidation.<br />On the way claims may be paid out, the main factors relating to the ICF payment of claims as set out in the ICF legislation is as follows.  First, a payment may only be made if it appears unlikely that the claim can be met otherwise than from the fund.  This means that it is necessary to clarify how much is available from the liquidator to go towards the claim and whether the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, is in a position to pay the claim or a portion of the claim.  Second, the ICF only pays out on claims where an individual is involved.<b></b>The Act provides that claims by bodies corporate or unincorporated bodies are not covered by the fund except where there is a liability to or by an individual.  While the liquidator has informed us that Setanta had a significant number of commercial policies, he is not in a position to clarify the exact amount at this stage.  He has indicated that:<blockquote>It doesn't necessarily follow that most claims would not be covered by the Fund.  While we have not detailed breakdowns, we expect that the majority of claims will relate to liability to individuals and would therefore be covered.</blockquote>Third, in a liquidation situation, the ICF only pays out 65% of the total claim or &euro;825,000, whichever is the lesser.  Fourth, the ICF does not refund unearned premiums.<br />The Motor Insurance Bureau of Ireland is a non-profit-making organisation registered in Ireland, which was established by agreement between the Government and those companies underwriting motor insurance in Ireland, in accordance with the EU motor insurance directives.  All insurance companies underwriting motor insurance in this country must, by law, be members of the MIBI and contribute to funding claims in proportion to their market share.  The principal role of the MIBI is to compensate innocent victims of accidents caused by uninsured and unidentified vehicles.  This is regulated under the terms of a 2009 agreement between the MIBI and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.<br />The MIBI does not operate a fund.  Claims are received and issued to one of four major insurers which handle the claims on behalf of the MIBI.  When claims are settled, MIBI member motor insurance companies are levied to make up the amount due.  This means that the MIBI is funded entirely by premiums paid by insured policyholders and it has a responsibility to ensure all its payments are appropriate and fair.<br />The arrangements put in place by the MIBI for dealing with the Setanta claims is a matter for the MIBI itself under the terms of the agreement and, as such, it falls outside the remit of the Minister for Finance to issue instructions to the MIBI.  The situation of Setanta Insurance, where an insurance company has gone into liquidation, is believed to be unprecedented.  Given this fact and its potential impact, the MIBI is taking legal advice as regards its role and responsibilities.  The MIBI board will meet in the coming days after which further clarifications are expected relating to that legal advice and its outcome.<br />The question as to how the ICF can assist those policyholders affected by the Setanta closure, the role of the MIBI and the work of the liquidator continues to be examined by the Department.</p> <p>The process to be followed and the formal procedures for making applications will be set out once clarification is reached on a number of issues.  It goes without saying that payments made by the relevant parties must be entirely in compliance with laws and agreements under which they operate.  In the case of Setanta, it is necessary for all the parties to obtain clarity on the legal position.  Furthermore, for the liquidator, each case is subject the terms of the individual insurance policy itself.</p><p> According to section 3B of the 1964 Act, as amended, where a person who performs the functions of a liquidator has been appointed to an insolvent insurer in another member state, the Accountant to the High Court may apply to the High Court for approval for amounts due to claimants, subject to the limitations set out in the legislation.  The office of the High Court Accountant will liaise with the Central Bank of Ireland and the Department of Finance on the state of the insurance compensation fund, ICF, and its ability to meet claims.  The ICF is expected to be adequately funded to meet all claims but the Minister for Finance may advance moneys to the ICF to meet any shortfall, if necessary.</p><p> Members will be aware of the Minister's strong desire that matters relating to the liquidation of Setanta be progressed and concluded in an orderly fashion.  This is important for the claimants as well as former policyholders of Setanta Insurance.  It also is important for the insurance sector as a whole.  In summary, Setanta claimants should continue to contact the liquidator regarding their claims until otherwise advised.  The liquidator is continuing his work on providing clarity to the extent he can on the full extent of claims and the likely dividend from the liquidation.  Once further information becomes available and the outcome of the consideration by the MIBI of its legal advice has been taken into account, the Department will further examine how the ICF can assist those policyholders affected by the Setanta closure.  The Department and the Central Bank continue to work with the liquidator to assist in that regard.  I am happy to take any questions or clarifications to assist the joint committee.</p></speech>

An Irish company could fail tomorrow morning and there are bonds and all sorts of measures in place.  Moreover, there is protection under the consumer code.  A very particular circumstance arose here, in which a company calling itself C&uacute; Chulainn - which is who Setanta became when he grew up - gave the impression that it was an Irish company.  This firm branded itself as an Irish company deliberately to operate in the Irish market, but those Irish customers and people living in the State discovered afterwards that it was not an Irish company and that they were not protected within the same regulatory framework as if they had been insured by an Irish company.  Are there other Setantas, C&uacute; Chulainns or Carrageen mosses out there?  Are there companies which are using Irish names but which are not Irish and which do not provide the level of cover, protection and surety as would Irish companies operating within the Irish regulatory market?</p></speech>

That framework provides that if a firm is authorised in its home country, which can be any member of the European Union or the European Economic Area, EEA, it is entitled to sell insurance provided it complies with notification requirements.  It also must comply with the minimum standards.  These minimum standards will be changed within the next year and a half, when the provisions of solvency II come in and these standards will be raised.  At present, however, once a company is complying with the minimum standards set at EU level, it is entitled to operate anywhere throughout the EU market.  As to whether there is another Setanta out there, I am unsure whether it is dependent on whether it is in Malta or any other country.  It has more to do with how the individual firms are being managed and supervised.  I am not sure whether this is country-specific because the rules apply across the EU market.</p></speech>

The minimum regulatory regime is applied at EU level and that is what these companies must comply with.  Once they do and get authorised in any country in the EU or the EEA, they automatically are entitled, provided they comply with notification requirements.</p></speech>

In certain aspects Ireland has applied higher standards and has provided for higher margins - a buffer in place if one likes - to make the firm more solvent.  However, other countries in Europe have done the same.  Even with those buffers in place, there still is no guarantee that a firm would not fail.  It comes back to how it is reserving and how is it meeting the solvency requirements.</p></speech>

The insurance industry is regulated at European Union level and the issue then is to what degree the safety net is there if there is a failure of an insurance company.  There is not yet a harmonised approach with regard to the safety net.  There are proposals to have a European-wide insurance compensation or protection scheme but it still is at fairly early stages and has not been developed as a proposal.  In Ireland, we have the insurance compensation fund and the legislation surrounding it as a safety net.  However, a number of restrictions are in place in that regard because of the cost of having in place a complete safety net.  For us, the insurance compensation fund is there to protect policyholders in the event that an insurance company becomes insolvent and, consequently, is there at that level of protection.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.312" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="14:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014070900005#E01700"><p>Let us say, for example, that I approached a broker in the morning, as I assume most people who took out Setanta insurance got it through a brokerage.  To use Mr. Casey's own term of a safety net in the context of the absence of harmonisation across the European Union, depending on the insurance company with which one deals, that safety net is either closer to the ground or higher up.  In the case of the latter, one will fall a lot further before one hits that safety net, given the area of regulation.  Could a requirement be placed on the industry in this country - as something over which the State could have control as opposed to waiting for European regulation on harmonisation to happen -  that a broker would inform a potential customer that the proposed safety net was different?  I was obliged to deal with my car insurance yesterday and one rings around, one deals with the broker and one gets different quotations.  One is trying to ensure one is getting the same deal at a cheaper price.  However, were someone offering me a cheaper price with a different safety net, that would have me going back to the original quotation.  Is there a requirement on the brokerage industry to tell potential customers that the safety net available with a product is less than that available with another product?  Forget about the windscreen cover and all the rest, as this question pertains to the safety net in the event of the company going wallop.  Is such a requirement in law in place at present for brokers?</p></speech>

In general, these are insurance companies throughout the European Union and Ireland.  In terms of the safety net, irrespective of which company people use, it essentially is the same.  Before one gets the safety net, it is more about whether there is a difference between dealing with a company based in Ireland and one based outside of Ireland, rather than whether people should be told about the safety net if that company fails, because it is based upon where is the risk.</p> <p>The person is an Irish consumer, so he or she is covered by the insurance compensation fund.</p></speech>

This is another fine mess in terms of insurance and the regulation of the insurance industry not only in Ireland but at European level, coming on the heels of the Quinn Insurance debacle, for which we are still paying and will be paying for a long time to come with a 2% levy, and the issues with RSA Ireland also.  It appears from reading the witnesses' opening remarks that the 75,000 customers directly affected are pretty much left high and dry and that those who do not have a claim are out of pocket for the remainder of the year for which they paid for their policy.  They have had to take out new insurance policies, which is a major issue for many people as money is very scarce.  For those who have claims, it appears to me that they are left high and dry because they have to wait until the liquidation process advances and becomes much clearer.  Is there any indication of how long that will take?  Typically, when an insurance company is being liquidated, how long is it before there is an agreed statement of affairs?</p></speech>

Based on what the liquidator has told us, it is too early at this stage to give any indication of how long the process will take and its cost.  He has indicated, in terms of initial views on it, that it may be a matter of a couple of months before he would have that information.  That would be at a very early stage, where he would have an initial estimate.  I agree with the Deputy that it is the claimants who will be caught up in this process for quite some time.</p></speech>

Obviously, it will be some time before he is able to determine exactly how much will be available to meet claims.  We have asked him to let us know if he finds that there will be a shortfall of at least a certain percentage so that we can set about providing at least some interim payment, if that proves possible, for policyholders who have claims.</p></speech>

The insurance compensation fund will not entertain any claim until the picture surrounding the liquidation has become clearer.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

The liquidator's focus initially was on reducing the number of policyholders who had policies with Setanta.  That is where they spent their energy in the initial period.  Since then they have engaged with Towers Watson to assist in getting a full assessment of claims.  They are still some time away from a completed picture.  The information we have is that it will two months or so before that becomes available.</p></speech>

The bottom line is that these individuals have been involved in some kind of accident and are out of pocket.  They may well be out of work.  They are relying on their insurance claims to be processed as quickly as possible.  It could mean the difference between a reasonable standard of living and none at all.  This is what is at stake, but we are washing our hands of it.  According to the Department, it is examining the questions of how the fund can help policyholders affected by the closure, the role of the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland, MIBI, and the work of the liquidator.  The process to be followed and the formal procedures for making applications will be set out once clarification is reached on a number of issues.  Basically, the Department is saying nothing.</p></speech>

Did the bank not have a duty of care to Irish policyholders, given the fact that those concerns were confirmed in November following its meeting with and inspection of Setanta Insurance?  Policyholders were not alerted to those concerns.  The Central Bank kicked the ball back to the Maltese financial regulator.  The Central Bank has a legal responsibility for code of conduct purposes.  Should Irish consumers have been alerted about its concerns?  According to the policies, Setanta Insurance was regulated by the Irish Central Bank for code of conduct purposes.  To everyone, this means the company was regulated in Ireland.  Even though we now know that prudential regulation is a different matter, that means nothing to most people - let us be honest about it.  Should the Central Bank not have alerted people when it became concerned?</p></speech>

As we have set out, we checked with the Maltese authorities on the firm's solvency position.  Clearly, that was their responsibility.  The Deputy can read the response in their statement.  They are responsible as the supervisory authority, but when our concerns continued, we did not leave the matter there.  We were concerned about what impact the company's financial position could have on how the firm processed claims for which we had responsibility under the code in terms of ensuring they were dealt with fairly.  We visited the firm to determine what was happening with claims.  Based on a relatively small sample of files, our concerns were confirmed, but they related to how the claims were being reserved for on individual files, not the firm's solvency position.  We felt it important to refer the matter to the appropriate authority, which we did.  We forwarded the report to that authority and continued to engage closely with it to ensure it dealt with the matter as quickly as possible.  As the prudential regulator, it was the only one with a full picture of the company.  We had a small window - the small number of claim files - through which to look into the company.</p></speech>

It met Setanta Insurance in November about those concerns and carried out an inspection, which apparently strengthened its concerns.</p> <p>However, the Central Bank did not fulfil its responsibility to Irish policyholders - through its regulatory role, for code of business purposes - by letting them know it had those concerns.</p></speech>

As one can see from the statement by the Maltese authorities, they were taking further steps to try to deal with the solvency position of the firm.  We did not feel we were in a position to warn people about the company until the Maltese authorities came to a conclusion on whether there were serious issues there or not.  The Maltese took the action they did to try to get the bottom of the matter as a result of our inspection and our pressing of them.  They initiated a third-party review of the firm, which confirmed our concerns.  Until that point, the company and its representatives were fiercely disputing our concerns.  The Maltese authorities proceeded to take serious action by suspending the firm from issuing new policies.</p></speech>

That is one of its functions, whereas protection of Irish consumers is not a priority for the Maltese authorities.

However, it failed to protect the 75,000 people who are now out of pocket and prevent the &euro;35 million in losses that arose from this company going into liquidation.

I would say, however, that we were right to go back and escalate the issue to the Maltese authorities.  Could we have done any more?  I do not think we could have done.  We pressed the authorities in Malta to take action, which it did by way of appointing a third party to get to the bottom of the issue.  That was the responsibility of the Maltese.  In my view, we have acted in the interests of Irish policyholders.</p></speech>

Over a two-month period between September and November, the Central Bank appears to have carried out an inspection at Setanta, including contacting the Maltese financial services authority about insolvency.  There was also an inspection of Setanta in Ireland and, in November 2013, the Central Bank contacted the Maltese financial services authority to share its findings.  At that point, could the Central Bank have issued a direction to brokers in Ireland to issue no further Setanta policies?  Did the Central Bank have those powers?</p></speech>

The company is paying the levy into the insurance compensation fund.  Clearly, the Central Bank had serious concerns but the company continued to write new products.  The brokers were uneasy about the Setanta product but they were sure they could continue to deal with policies.  If Mr. Sheridan wished to do so, did he have the authority, based on the findings, to give instructions to the brokers that, in the opinion of the Central Bank, they should not look to new products or renewing existing Setanta products, such as car insurance, to Irish customers?  At this moment, there are claims of &euro;5 million.  Does Mr. Sheridan know the value of premiums people paid but did not get the benefit of in terms of cover?</p></speech>

The Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland is hedging its bets and there are 75,000 customers out there.  Our role is to question whether the Central Bank was asleep at the wheel.  The Central Bank had concerns but the question is whether it had the authority, if it wished, to tell brokers about them.  The products were sold through brokers and, from my sources, I know they had concerns.  Based on the fact that the Central Bank does an audit on the insurance compensation fund and that this product was only being sold through Ireland, did the Central Bank have the authority to issue instructions to the brokers at any stage?  Setanta was dealing with Irish customers so it was purely an Irish situation.  The Central Bank had carried out its inspection of Setanta in October 2013 and then met Setanta to discuss its findings and inspections, including concerns about the company reserving its claims.</p> <p>Did the Central Bank have the authority to issue either guidelines or directions?  It regulates brokers.  Did it have the authority to issue directions based on its concerns?</p></speech>

We carried out an inspection - it was not an audit - of a small number of claim files because we were concerned about how the firm might be dealing with claims.

I will outline how it works.  We are notified when a company is passporting in to the State.  There is provision for host state regulators to receive periodic information on the volume of business being written in that member state.  However, the responsibility to engage in prudential supervision rests with the home state regulator.  The host state regulator is only responsible for the conduct of business.</p><p>  There was a question about pricing.  What represents uneconomic pricing for a given insurer is something of which only the prudential supervisor of the home member state would have sight.  This is because to understand whether that is the case, the regulator must be aware of the full financial position of the company.  The prudential supervisor has visibility in that regard, rather than the conduct of business supervisor.</p></speech>

This is set out in a framework known as Solvency I which has been and is being revised at European level.  From January 2016 onwards, we will have Solvency II, a more sophisticated and robust regime that will apply throughout Europe.  We already operate many of its features in the State in respect of the companies we prudentially supervise.  Of particular relevance in this case is the fact that Solvency II will introduce a more codified method of valuation of assets and liabilities throughout Europe and more uniform approaches to actuarial standards and practices.  The responsibility to establish sufficient resources are available to pay claims is, first and foremost, a that of the management of the insurance company.  It must get it right.  Clearly, where a company does not, in the first instance, estimate correctly how much money it will need to treat a claim, from that point on, all of its calculations will come up short.</p></speech>

I suggested to the committee that we have this hearing because I believe passionately that many of the 75,000 policyholders with Setanta Insurance have been let down.  They were insured with a company which they believed to be regulated here but which, it turns out, was regulated in Malta and went into liquidation.  They were let down because they had seen the treatment of insured policyholders of other insurance companies in the past and the same treatment was not afforded to them.  Furthermore, in the case of those who have been involved in accidents and have claims, there is still no clarity in respect of where they stand and how these claims will be processed.</p><p>  I have a series of questions and will try to be as brief as possible.  If the deputations could be as brief with their answers, I would appreciate it.  </p><p>  I received a response to a question I had tabled to the Minister for Finance on 30 April.  It states the Motor Insurers Bureau of Ireland indicated that it intended to accept all third party claims in connection with Setanta Insurance policies.  We dealt with the matter and now know that is not the case and that the bureau is seeking legal clarification.  We should receive that clarification on Friday.  My question is for Mr.Casey.  The Minister made that statement in the D&aacute;il.  Did the MIBI indicate to the Department or the Minister that it intended to accept all third party claims in connection with Setanta Insurance policies?</p></speech>

If that was to be the case, the issue was how would the MIBI fund contribute to the overall resolution in the absence of a full refund being available from the liquidator.  The early indications were that the MIBI fund would be available to assist in that regard, if there was a shortfall.  Subsequently, it became clear that the bureau needed to have legal certainty on several matters and it informed us that it would do so.</p></speech>

Mr. Casey mentioned that the insurance compensation fund only pays out on claims where an individual is involved.  He went on to state that while the liquidator had informed him that Setanta had a significant number of commercial policies, he was not in a position to clarify the exact number at this stage.</p><p> Can we clarify what we are talking about in terms of commercial policies?  Can one have a commercial policy on which the insurance compensation fund can still pay out?  If I had a company, had insurance in the name of the company and it was a commercial policy, that would not be paid out of the fund but if I had a company and had commercial insurance in my name, could that be paid out of the fund?  Can we get some clarity as to what type of commercial policies will not be able to access the fund?</p></speech>

If, for example, two company cars collide with each other, nobody is injured and physical damage is done to both of those cars, the insurance compensation fund would not pay out for any of the claim arising from that because there is no claim coming from an insured individual, or a natural person, nor is there any sort of liability towards an individual, or a natural person.  It would not cover those circumstances but wherever there is a liability on the part of a natural person, which should be covered by a policy of insurance, or a liability towards a natural person, that is where the insurance compensation fund steps in.</p><p>  If it is the case that a sole trader has an insurance policy in a personal capacity, if the sum is due to him or her as an individual, then even in the example I gave earlier where two company cars were damaged but no personal injuries arose, the fund could also step in in those circumstances.  </p></speech>

If there is a liability towards an individual in his or her personal capacity, then that liability will be met by the fund.  If there is a liability due from an individual, that liability can also be met from the fund up to the limits that apply and subject to the exceptions that apply.</p><p>  In the Deputy's example, he said he owned a company but was insuring a van in his own name or in a personal capacity.  In that circumstance, the insurance fund would pay out for the wall.  If the Deputy does not have comprehensive insurance, obviously it will not pay out for him.  </p></speech>

The claims will have to be examined on an individual basis by the liquidator before he can make a determination.  In regard to the example given, I am not a lawyer but it would appear to me that the individual has a couple of choices left for that &euro;35,000.  The individual can go back to the court to seek to have a remedy put in place where somebody else pays it.  A portion of the distribution from the liquidator could be available.  The individual could have alternative funds in place and the court may instruct the individual that he or she must meet it himself or herself.   There could be another alternative of which I am not aware.</p></speech>

Of the 2,000 claims, which amount to &euro;35 million, on average we could say that two thirds of them had commercial policies.  However, there is a big question mark over whether a commercial customer would be entitled, under certain circumstances, to access the fund at all.  Is it the case that if one is a non-commercial customer, one knows one can rely on the fund with its limitations of up to 65%?  However, if one is a commercial customer, there is a question mark as to whether one will get paid from the fund at all at this point in time.</p></speech>

The issue is quite complex and legally complicated.  The liquidator has said that in his view, from the analysis done of those commercial claims, it is not as clear cut that none of them quality.  It depends on the nature of the claim.  Each of those claims will be examined individually with Towers Watson and the liquidator will be in a position to give us further clarity in about two months' time when it has done that examination.</p></speech>

While Setanta has a significant number of commercial polices, it does not necessarily follow that most would not be covered by the fund.  The liquidator said he does not have detailed breakdowns and that he expects that the majority of claims under those policies will relate to liability to individuals and would, therefore, be covered.

I am of the view that the Central Bank was extremely lax in respect of this matter.  Mr. Sheridan can bat for his own side in a moment in respect of that assertion on my part.  It seems that the only flag that was raised for consumers came in the form of the widely-circulated press release.  On numerous occasions we asked the Minister what he was doing to ensure that customers would not be at a loss as a result of the decision taken in January.  It does not appear that the Central Bank took any serious action to protect customers from having their policies renewed by an institution which the Malta financial services authority had directed to stop renewing them.  Was the Central Bank aware of the fact that policies were being renewed after the 24 January cut-off point?  What action is it taking in respect of the renewal of those policies?  Is the Central Bank of the view that it was appropriate that the policies in question were renewed?  The Irish Brokers Association has referred to a statutory instrument and stated that its members issue renewal notices prior to renewal dates.  This means that if a notice was issued on 23 January last and even though it had been informed that it could not do so from the following day, Setanta still renewed the relevant policy five weeks and six days later.  That is what happened to many people who renewed their policies and paid their premiums in full.  Those people subsequently were without insurance cover, which means that they lost out on the double.  What action has the Central Bank taken - or is it going to take - in respect of that practice?</p></speech>

The Maltese authorities directed the firm to cease writing new business and renewing policies.  They are investigating the fact that policies were sold post 24 January.  We have been in contact with them and they are looking into the matter.  They have committed to sharing the results of their investigation with us.  At this stage we cannot say what happened, how it happened or whether it was at the level of the insurance company.  Obviously, the latter was certainly the case because the company continued to underwrite some business that was going through the pipeline.  The suspension was issued by the Maltese authorities to the company.  The company wrote to all its brokers confirming the suspension and they were all obliged to write to the policyholders to make them aware of it.</p></speech>

What is at issue is the basis on which they were doing so.  The Maltese authorities are investigating the role the company played in terms of underwriting the relevant policies.  None of those policies would have been renewed unless the firm facilitated the underwriting of the business.  That is what is being investigated by the authorities.</p></speech>

The part to understand is that the liquidator has appointed Towers Watson to examine this and to have a full examination of the claims process and the total number of claims.  What the liquidator has clearly said to us is that he has a figure of 2,000 claims but, in addition, there is a further amount of claims that needs to be taken into account which were incurred but not reported.  While he does not know how big or small that is, he expects it could be substantial and could have a material effect.</p></speech>

An awful lot of the policies that were bought were cash injections which did not run the full course of the policy and were not put into the overall exposure.  Therefore, a large percentage of these would be in an asset form.  Of the 70,000 to 75,000 policies, what kind of assets would the witnesses predict are behind that?</p></speech>

Under the current regime, the first thing a company has to do is prudently estimate how much money and resources it will need to meet its liabilities on an expected basis, so it takes a prudent approach to what is expected to happen and it sets aside resources to meet that.  We spoke earlier about the inspection we carried out in October and into November, in which we looked at the claims files.  What we noticed on the claims files was that what the claims team was estimating as the amount it might need for the claim seemed low.  That is what we meant when we said earlier that one cannot extrapolate from that into anything else.  How much is held in terms of reserves really depends on a company's prudential assessment of what it thinks its liabilities are going to be.  The solvency margin is then a measure of freely available assets it must maintain over and above that to act as a buffer against unexpected shocks.  If I follow the Deputy's reasoning correctly, one cannot extrapolate from the number of policyholders necessarily or the quantum of reserves that are shown in the statement of affairs as to what the prudential level of reserving should be, because that is something that only the prudential supervisor and the company itself could do with all of the financial information.</p></speech>

The alarm bell that went off in Mr. Kincaid's office was due to the fact some of the files picked up that the amount allocated for dealing with those cases was low.  That does not talk about the provisions, it talks about the execution, and that could bleed into the overall profitability of the company being higher.  That would not suggest to me there is a problem with the provisions but that there could be profiteering, more than anything else.  What led the Central Bank to opt for further investigation?</p></speech>

That was the concern we highlighted.  I believe the Deputy is getting at a point in regard to the liquidator and the liquidation which perhaps I am not hitting.  That is the point our inspectors looked at.</p></speech>

First, are the people who took out insurance with Setanta going to get their money back and are people going to be looked after in accordance with what one would expect in a developed democracy?  Second, what are we doing to prevent this from happening again in the insurance industry in Ireland?  I do not believe anybody who hears about this meeting will get a sense of comfort, given the provisions of the ICF and the overall provisions Setanta had in Malta, that they are going to get all of their money back - some &euro;35 million.  We are not getting that message.  If the witnesses think that is going to be the case, will they convey it?  I know they said in the opening statement that this will come back to the Department of Finance again in terms of looking for further funds, which pushes it back in here, but the insurance industry itself should be regulated to the point where it can look after itself.</p><p>  Let me put a point to the witnesses.

As the Chairman said earlier, we do not go through the specifics; we look at the bottom line price and make sure the basics are covered.  What recommendations are the Central Bank putting to the Department of Finance?  Have we learned anything in order to stop this happening again?  Is this an issue that needs to be brought up to a European Commission level in order to prevent bogus operations taking place and essentially representing themselves as Irish companies when they are not.</p></speech>

I do not blame the Central Bank for this and it is working within the parameters it has.  However, someone is to blame for it and the policyholders want to know who that is.

As I discussed earlier, clearly, we cannot guarantee this is not going to happen again.  It is back to how the firms are being managed and supervised.  At European level, the solvency II directive will certainly be a step up in terms of the supervisory framework and risk assessments that are in place and the role of the supervisor.  Another issue is the engagement and co-operation among supervisory authorities, which is an important area we need to consider as a result of this.  We certainly had very close engagement with the Maltese authorities but that was when the problems arose, so that is another issue we can certainly look at.</p></speech>

However, from the point of view of those with an outstanding claim, there seems to be a great deal of confusion in this regard.  Let us look at the reality.  We need to be mindful that we are talking about catastrophic injuries, deaths and people who have lost loved ones.  The timeframe in dealing with these claims is an issue.  In response to a parliamentary question on 18 June I was told the Department of Finance had had a meeting with the MIBI on 11 June to discuss the issue of Setanta Insurance and that it had informed the Department it expected legal certainty in the following weeks.  What does that mean?  What is the current position and when can persons awaiting claims to be processed to have certainty?  We need to check what is happening in this regard.</p><p>  The European Union has the European Food Safety Authority, but what do we have as its equivalent for financial products and passporting?  How do we protect consumers?  Mr. Sheridan cautioned against having regulations specific to the Irish market because we operated in a European context.

I understand what has been said and that we have been to the fore in trying to influence practice, but given what the European markets have been through in the past few years, it is staggering that regulators do not yet interact with each other.  How many other insurance companies like Setanta Insurance are there in Ireland?  I understand most insurance companies here are not Irish owned.  Am I correct in thinking FBD is the only Irish-owned and operated insurance company in the country?  If financial regulators across Europe are not interacting with each other, how many more customers will be impacted on and how many more difficulties will we encounter?</p></speech>

In fact, the majority do no business in Ireland.  However, we supervise them prudentially in the same way.  We are also the conduct of business supervisor for the firms selling in Ireland.  There is consistency across the market in that regard.</p><p>  On whether there is another Setanta Insurance, we have a large number of firms - I am not sure of the exact number - that have notified us of their intention to sell different types of insurance policy in Ireland.  However, the number is quite small in the case of motor insurance and these firms are generally not of the size of Setanta Insurance.  Generally, they are in particular categories of insurance in which there would have been one big provider.  I am not really sure how I should answer the question of whether there is another Setanta Insurance.  The European framework is to be and should be applied consistently across countries.  Where it fails is where individual firms do not live up to that standard.  It is up to the supervisors to make sure they do.</p></speech>

Are there cases comparable to what happened in the case of Setanta Insurance or is its case unique?  Is it unique to Ireland or is there a precedent?  Have there been similar collapses in the market?</p></speech>

I do not know how many are selling exclusively in Ireland, but I am sure a small number of them are doing so.  On whether it is unique in terms of its failure, it is not because it was supervised by a supervisory authority equivalent to us and licensed by that authority.  I do not make a distinction - I do not believe I can do so - in terms of whether it is supervised by the authorities in the United Kingdom or Malta or wherever else.  It is a difficult question to answer.  About what are we talking precisely?  Is it the model, the European framework or the fact that it was selling only in Ireland?</p></speech>

If I was talking to a German, an Austrian or an Italian this afternoon, would he or she say to me that the very same thing happened in his or her country and that another country was involved in terms of the company involved trading out of Cyprus, Lithuania or Ireland?

Some 75,000 policyholders have been shafted.  Many of them are small and medium enterprises and many are individuals.  Somebody has failed to see this coming.  If this discussion is to mean anything, we need to learn lessons.  It strikes me that the dogs on the street could have worked out that there was something wrong with a company if it was licensed in Malta although its shareholders were primarily Irish, it was selling exclusively to the Irish market, its main staff operations were in Ireland and, through its name, it packaged itself as Irish.  That is fishy straightaway as far as I am concerned.  I cannot believe somebody in the Central Bank did not figure out much earlier that it was fishy.  Why the hell would a company do that?  There has to be some scam at play.  It is trying to evade regulation, taxation, or both.  Surely that is obvious.  It is absolutely terrifying that the delegates tell me this is happening all over the place in Europe.  There are companies based in Ireland that do not do any business in Ireland.  Why are they here?  What is the reason for their being here?  There are companies selling insurance mainly in Ireland, such as Setanta, that are not licensed here.</p><p>  I had an inquiry from the manager of my son's football team asking why there is such a radical difference between motor insurance premiums offered by various insurance companies.  There are staggering differences, yet the underwriters of the insurance are the same people.  Therefore, there is something fishy going on.  The regulatory regime has failed, both at national and European levels.  Is that not obviously the case?  Must we not seriously ask what went wrong, why we did not spot this and whether there is an endemic problem that could mean there will almost certainly be a recurrence?</p></speech>

We are going to conduct a review of this event in the Central Bank to determine whether we could have done things differently.  None of what occurred would have been an issue had the firm been properly run.  Our concerns were about the reserving.  If the company had been properly run-----</p></speech>

I heard the phrase "properly run" and must challenge it.  The point of regulators is precisely to deal with people who do not do business properly.</p> <p>To throw it back and say some firms do not behave as they should is not acceptable.  Sure, if they all behaved as they should, there would be no need for regulation.  The reason the Central Bank is there and we need laws and regulation is that we know there are many in cut-throat, profit-driven, competitive markets, including insurance, who do not play by the rules.  There are cowboys left, right and centre.  We had it with Quinn.  I am only speculating, but it looks like this gang was up to the same thing as Quinn.  It appears they were under-provisioning as they were using the money for other things, as Quinn was.  Money that should have been applied to provision against losses was being used to leverage other business deals elsewhere.  That is what he was doing.</p></speech>

We cannot guarantee that there will be no failures.  The Deputy is right that a great deal of the supervisory framework is about how it is implemented.  The framework will be strengthened.  We have already strengthened it post other issues with other firms while Solvency II will strengthen it in the wider European context, but that is no guarantee.  It is how that is implemented that is key.  I agree with the Deputy that it is down to supervisory authorities to implement that.</p></speech>

Is that not an obvious conclusion to draw?

Listening to Mr. Sheridan and in view of the actions of the Central Bank on provisioning, is it the case that if the company was regulated in Ireland, as a bare minimum, the problem in terms of blanket provisioning would have been identified earlier?</p></speech>

We have taken enforcement action against firms which have fallen below that buffer.  We see the buffer as critical to protecting policy holders.</p></speech>

Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

Was the Central Bank at any time concerned about a conflict of interest between the company and the manner in which it was established, and the fact that brokers were selling their insurance products?  A number of shareholders in the company are either directors or senior employees and a number of directors are in brokers and groups that provide services for numerous brokers in the State.  Laura Noonan wrote as far back as 2008 of a potential conflict of interest given the fact that so many of the owners of Setanta Insurance were involved in the broker industry in Ireland.  There was a legitimate question about how a punter seeking the best deal on his or her motor insurance could obtain that from a broker company a director of which was also an owner of Setanta Insurance.  Were they peddling their company to maximise their profits?  Is this something the Central Bank looked at or was concerned at all about?</p></speech>

We have specific requirements imposed on brokers in the area of conflicts of interest in terms of avoiding and disclosing them.  There is an overriding requirement in the code that they must act in the customer's best interest.  We have no evidence and have not investigated that.</p></speech>

This is about the mess we are in.  It is a mess one way or another.  We have a company that went into liquidation and do not know when payments will be processed.  We do not know if we can access MIBI to process some of the payments.  We do not know how many commercial claims will not be paid by any of the funds.  It has properly been highlighted that the great concern here is that claims in some cases involve matters of life and death.  We are talking about serious injuries, death and people in very vulnerable situations.  It is very clear that there will be no quick fix in this and that the matter will go on for a number of months until the liquidator finds out what assets and liabilities he has and whether the fund must be accessed.</p><p>  Mr. Sheridan said that it was unprecedented to have an insurance company go into liquidation.  Could we not look at a situation - tell me if I am just crackers on this - where the insurance fund pays out 65% of all claims and becomes a creditor of the assets of the company?  The insurance fund is going to pay out 65% of all claims anyway up to a maximum of &euro;825,000.  Obviously things are structured a certain way, but instead of all this red tape could we not start to act in the interests of citizens - the claimants out there - and introduce legislation, if necessary, to provide that the insurance fund can pay out 65% of all claims where a company goes into liquidation?  While people may get more if there are assets within the company, there would be an up-front payment.  The insurance fund would then recoup whatever it could from the assets of the liquidated company.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.642" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Casey" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014070900016#R02900"><p>That is a fair question.  The law governing the ICF does not set out the administration process.</p> <p>It is clear that it is seen as the fund of last resort.  As I mentioned in my opening statement, the payment may only be made if it appears unlikely that a claim can be met otherwise than from the fund.  These are matters upon which we need to reflect.  The purpose of the fund is to pay out where there is a valid claim.  Its purpose is not to delay payments or otherwise.  Right now, there is an absence regarding what the liquidator's position is.  We need to await the outcome of that to get some indication of what is available for redistribution from its assets and see the impact of that.  We also need to wait for the legal advice and the outcome of that consideration and see what role the fund can play in respect of making the claims.  We will reflect on the suggestion made.  I am not saying "Yes" or "No".  The procedures are not specified, and that is one of the things we will be looking at.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.644" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Antoine MacDonncha" time="16:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014070900017#S00200"><p>It might be worth saying that the legislation does not really facilitate an up-front 65% payment.  However, the first job we have asked the liquidator to do is to come back to us and tell us whether there is a minimum shortfall.  At that point, if we are certain that there will be a shortfall of, say, 30%, even under the existing legislation, we could look at making an up-front payment in that amount.  It is something we are exploring and we cannot promise that it is something we will be able to do but we are at least exploring it and are mindful that it would be helpful for people to have some interim payment if it is possible.</p></speech>

I am not sure if that is the Department's intention or expectation.  There is an openness on the part of my party and, I presume, the Opposition towards changing the rules in respect of the unprecedented scenario of a company going into liquidation.  At the end of the day, it would not cost the fund any more.  It is just a case of cashflow within the fund.  While it may not be available within the rules, we should be looking at changing the rules if needs be to deal with what was an unforeseen circumstance at the time the rules were drawn up.</p></speech>

What is stopping us from doing that?  Is it just because the company was in Malta?  If that is the case, I put it to the witnesses that this is crazy.  We say the regulatory failure was because the company was in Malta and it was the one responsible, but the ICF picks up the tab anyway.  We pay the bill and the company did all its business here but the policy holders do not get the same treatment as people affected by the Quinn Insurance case did.  Is not unfair and inconsistent?  Can anything be done about it?</p></speech>

It does not differentiate based on the fact that this company is authorised in Malta as opposed to here.  They are receiving the same compensation that would be available to somebody pursuant to the ICF if an Irish-authorised company went into liquidation.</p></speech>

The company was seen as a going concern that had a problem relating to the guarantees that impacted on its solvency ratio, but when it was put into administration, the underlying business was regarded as being OK and, therefore, it needed to be given time to trade its way out and come back on to a commercial footing.  Setanta went into voluntary liquidation because it was unable to meet its liabilities.  When it went in at the end of January, it was on the basis that there was to be an orderly wind-down of the company.  The information provided by the Maltese regulator in response to the committee's queries sets out quite clearly that a number of attempts were made by the company from the end of January until mid-April to get adverse claims development cover to assist in a process in which it had a party interested in buying the company.  That fell through after due diligence and the company was unable to put additional capital in.  In that light, the company was put into liquidation on a voluntary basis.  The distinction is that one was put into liquidation and, therefore, the terms of the liquidation set out in the ICF apply subject to cappings, etc., while the other one was put into administration because it needed a period of time to get over a financial difficulty but was seen as being able to trade.</p></speech>

First, that divergent treatment is completely unfair from the point of view of the policy holders.  It would probably be the case that if we had the responsibility for trying to sort things out and keep things going, or selling off the policies to somebody else who would maintain them so there were no losses to premium holders, there would probably be far greater motivation to salvage things in the interests of the policy holders than there might be in Malta which, to be honest, does not have any great interest in solving it.  I am not saying Malta did not make efforts - I have no idea what efforts it did or did not make - but it is fairly obvious that we would have made more efforts, because everything was based here and all the policy holders were here.</p></speech>

It would still be subject to the same qualifications set out in the law in respect of the treatment of policy holders in an insolvency situation.  It is important to understand that it would have the same caps and treatment.</p></speech>

I suppose the top-line concern here is that, as Deputy Boyd Barrett indicates, if I buy a product in the morning, I might be getting the same windscreen and tow rate cover and the same comprehensive insurance but the prudential management of the company I am taking out insurance with is risk-weighted based upon the jurisdiction it is in.  In terms of consumer protection, how do I as a consumer know that this product is prudentially sounder than the other product?  How do we get to that place where consumers have that level of protection?</p></speech>

However one can score a point like Ronan O'Gara and put it 13 metres over the bar.  In some jurisdictions the ball is put over the bar a great deal higher.  Industry unfortunately will just get the ball over the bar in some jurisdictions when one has a global or universal system.  The bar for prudential management in Ireland seems to be a great deal higher than it is in other areas, so regardless of the level the European Union sets as a bar, the difficulty that I and every other citizen has as a consumer is that the company from which I get my insurance may have different prudential risk management from other companies.  Is there a case that the bar needs to be heightened?</p></speech>

That is one element of the question, but there is also the issue of the odd location where the business seeks the licence.  Is that an issue?  There are a great many firms that do no insurance business in Ireland but are licensed in Ireland.  There are firms that do all their business here but are licensed in places such as Malta.  There must be some reason for businesses to do this.  Are insurance companies doing this because of the distance between where they conduct their business and the authority whose job it is to license and regulate them, the companies know that it is a bit harder for the regulator to regulate them?</p></speech>

I agree that the current standard is a minimum harmonisation standard across Europe.  I believe the Central Bank has a stronger and more robust regulatory framework based on that standard than other jurisdictions.  When the new standards, which are a higher standard, come in across Europe the challenge is that the supervisory authorities actually apply them consistently and that individual firms live up to those standards.</p></speech>

If a company does all its business in Malta, but the Central Bank in Ireland is the body that licenses it and is responsible for its prudential regulation, is it not harder to the Central Bank to keep an eye on it if it is doing all its business in Malta?

Given the inconvenience and the losses that are being suffered by the policyholders, are there potential penalties or sanctions against the future involvement of these directors and shareholders in the insurance business or will they face general sanctions for what they have been responsible?</p></speech>

The penalties that would flow from that would be matters of Maltese law.  The Malta regulator is currently conducting an investigation on a number of fronts, so we will see what will come from that.  I am not conversant with what penalties will apply in Malta.  As a matter for ourselves in Ireland, based on the conclusions of the investigations in Malta we would look to see if there is any follow up action by the Central Bank.  Obviously wherever companies come to be authorised in Ireland, they have to go through our authorisation processes, our fitness and probity processes and so on.</p></speech>

If they are guilty of these kinds of practices, what are the sanctions?  Would they be allowed to do business here or anywhere in Europe again?</p></speech>

It is not an allegation that a company has engaged in a criminal or negligent matter but the issue is that the prudential requirements vary from area to area.  Because of the prudential difference, the exposure in one area is greater than in another.  Both Mr. Casey and Mr. Sheridan say it is the issue of harmonisation across the European jurisdiction to ensure that it does not matter whether companies operate out of Malta or out of Ireland, that the Maltese as well as Irish citizens have good insurance coverage.  Is the proposed harmonisation standard below, equal or above the Irish standard that is in place?</p></speech>

We have upped the framework quite substantially in advance of that.  My colleague, Mr. Colm Kincaid, will comment.</p></speech>

There is a panorama of provisions, Solvency II is a very long directive.  The current regime at EU level is a minimum regime.  We have a lot of enhancements to that regime at a prudential level that will apply in this State for a company authorised in this State.</p></speech>

I also wish to welcome the deputy chef de mission, Mr. Hamid Arefipour, who is accompanying the ambassador.<br />I remind members, witnesses and all those in the Public Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as, even on silent mode, they cause interference with the recording equipment.<br />In advance of hearing the ambassador's presentation, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such as way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I welcome His Excellency, Mr. Javad Kachoueian, Ambassador of the Islamic Republic of Iran to Ireland.  The ambassador has a distinguished career in his country's diplomatic service, both in Tehran and in various locations abroad.  Members of the committee will be aware that Ambassador Kachoueian was only recently appointed to his current position in Dublin.  While he has met with some members of the joint committee, this is his first appearance before the committee in formal session.  Earlier this year, Ambassador Kachoueian paid a courtesy call to me and I was delighted to renew that relationship which existed with his predecessor.  It is always good to have dialogue.<br />We are conscious of the various ongoing problems in the Middle East.  For the past three years, there has been conflict in Syria, which unfortunately is showing no sign of being resolved.  More recently, we have seen an escalation of fighting in Iraq, while the situation in Egypt continues to be a cause of concern.  Perhaps more worryingly is the recent deterioration of the situation between Israel and Palestine.  The tit-for-tat - apparently revenge - attacks continue to escalate daily.  Almost hourly we hear of rocket attacks and air strikes, as the views of moderates on both sides appear to be ignored.  Indeed, at lunchtime today, there were further reports of more people being killed in Gaza.<br />The Middle East crisis is obviously something that the committee has dealt with.  We would certainly appeal for restraint because tit-for-tat attacks achieve nothing whatsoever.  The Israelis have been very lucky that nobody was killed by the rockets going into Israel.  Unfortunately, however, many people in Gaza have been killed by Israeli air attacks, which do not solve the problem that is there.  This committee appeals for both sides to show restraint.  We will be talking to the Israeli and Palestinian ambassadors soon to see if the situation can be resolved peacefully.<br />We are well aware of the role and influence Iran has in the region.  Members of the committee are eagerly anticipating Ambassador Kachoueian's views on what is happening in the Middle East, including the nuclear talks concerning Iran.  In addition, Ambassador Kachoueian takes a keen interest in what is happening in Syria.<br />The format of today's meeting is that we will hear a presentation from the ambassador before proceeding to a question and answer session with members of the committee.  I call Ambassador Kachoueian to address the committee.</p></speech>

Mr. Javad Kachoueian" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014070900002#A00500"><p>Thank you very much, Chairman, honourable Deputies and Senators.  In the name of God, the compassionate and merciful, I am pleased to have been invited here to exchange views on different aspects of bilateral relations, as well as important regional and international issues with the committee.</p><p>  Iran attaches great importance to its relations with Ireland.  The people of my country have always had good feelings towards Ireland and the Irish people.  Iran and Ireland have always had good relations with each other.</p> <p>It is very important that there is no negative point in our mutual relations.  We hope very much that the already friendly relations between our countries will develop and deepen under our mutual efforts.  Fortunately, there is much capacity and potential in our relations in different political, economic, trade, scientific and cultural fields.  We share many common international policies, including the importance of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction and rejecting unilateralism and the use of military force in solving international and regional crises.  We continue to co-operate with Ireland on these issues.</p><p> There is lots of potential and there are many possibilities for the two countries.  The value of the annual trade in beef before the appearance of BSE, which caused the ban on the importation of Irish beef, was more than $500 million.  Fortunately, the ban on the importation of Irish beef was lifted last year and the legal ground for the importation of Irish sheepmeat was also prepared.  Other than meat, there are many other potential areas of trade, including IT, petrochemicals, petroleum and petroleum products, pharmaceuticals and medical devices, food and agriculture stuffs and renewable energy.  Iran is a very safe country in the Middle East with a population of 77 million people.  It could be a great market for Irish goods, especially in view of the fact that Irish goods, in the format of joint ventures between Iranian and Irish companies, can be re-exported to the markets of our 15 neighbouring countries, whose populations total 200 million.  The current annual volume of trade between our two countries is approximately &euro;50 million, which is by no means proportionate with the potential and the possibilities.  We can easily increase our mutual annual trade to &euro;1 billion in a year.</p><p> Iran, with its huge oil and gas resources, equivalent to 400 billion barrels, is the world's largest source of fossil energy.  There are two main pillars in Iran's sustainable development program: first, securing long-term sustainable energy in Iran; and second, participation in global energy security.  We are ready to co-operate on these issues as well.  The population in Iran is mainly young and therefore the number of youths looking for seats in universities in all fields has been increasing.  Nowadays, there are 600,000 students taking part in doctorate degree entrance exams each year.  Only 70,000 of them can enter universities in Iran; the rest must find universities abroad.  Given the presence of a few high-ranking universities in Ireland, the two countries can work successfully in this area as well.  Nevertheless, there are some obstacles, namely the long process of granting visas to foreign students, which needs to be solved.  There is lots of potential for mutual cultural co-operation in the arts, including painting and film, and in exploring and rehabilitating historical monuments.  Iran is among the ten leading countries internationally with regard to the presence of historical places.  There is a good potential for Iran and Ireland to expand their co-operation in the field of the tourism industry.  We have already had some university and media delegations visiting Iran, namely DIT and Dublin's Griffith College, and the recent visit of some Irish journalists.  A few MOUs have been signed between Irish and Iranian universities and scientific institutions.</p><p> Iran attaches specific importance to the promotion of parliamentary relations between the two countries.  The Parliament, as the the main pillar of the legislative branch, has an outstanding position in the political system of Iran.  Iran's parliaments have always been diverse, containing women and many ethnic minorities.  It also designates five seats for religious minorities, including Jews, Christians and Zoroastrians, proportionate to their populations.  The recent visit of the parliamentary delegation headed by Deputy Pat Breen, the Chairman of the joint committee, was a good event in the annals of official contacts between the two countries.  The delegation had different useful and constructive negotiations with Iranian officials, including the Speaker of Parliament and the Foreign Minister.  The visit received good coverage in the Iranian mass media.  Following that visit, our Speaker of Parliament officially invited Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett, the Ceann Comhairle, for an official visit to Tehran.  The visit will take place in September of this year.  We are also working on the visit of Mr. Heravi, the head of the Iran-Ireland Parliamentary Friendship Group, to Ireland in the near future.  The visit to Iran last week of a delegation from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - Mr. Barrie Robinson, political director, and Mr. Pat Kelly, director general for Middle East and the north African region - was also a good development in our mutual relations.  We are aware of Ireland's important role in EU and international and regional organisations as well as in maintaining peace and security.  Irish peacekeeping forces under UNIFIL in Lebanon and the Golan Heights perform an important and useful role in that field.  Like Ireland, Iran attaches great importance to the peaceful and diplomatic solution of regional and international crisis.  Iran, as one of the most important and effective countries in the Middle East, is always ready to exchange views with Ireland on important regional and international issues.</p><p> I congratulate Ireland on its successful exit from the troika bailout programs.  It is a good sign which indicates the recovery of the economic situation and the restoration of the economic reputation of Ireland.  We hope, with the reopening the Irish embassy in Tehran and the efforts of the two embassies, to witness the further deepening and development of our relations.  Once again, I express my gratitude to the organisers of the committee for the opportunity that has been given to me to meet with the members to discuss regional and international issues.</p></speech>

Both sides are talking about how to draft the contract document.  According to the strong religious fatwa from the Supreme Leader issued in 2005, any activities such as the production, stockpiling and use of weapons of mass destruction, including nuclear weapons, are forbidden.  The members witnessed during the war between Iran and Iraq that when the Iraqi side used chemical weapons we did not respond, for this reason.  Based on the fatwa, as the Supreme Leader has said, the possession of nuclear weapons is a sin, and having such weapons is absolutely prohibited since they endanger the existence of humanity.  The nuclear fatwa is a principled one since the existence of humanity is at stake.  The fatwa is not dependent on time and circumstance.  It establishes a precedent that future religious leaders may not discard.</p><p>  The fatwa should be taken as an assurance that Iran has no intention of building such weapons.  It can be adopted as an official United Nations document as a way to build confidence.  Based on the fatwa, Iran has called for all nuclear sovereigns to create a world without nuclear weapons.  We are also in favour of militaries free from nuclear weapons.  Nuclear arms do not have any place in our defence structure.  The nuclear issue in Iran is not about nuclear weapons.  The issue is that the people of my country cannot accept others telling them not to have a peaceful nuclear programme.  We want to use this technology only for peaceful purposes.  We are ready to remove all concern and to respond to all questions raised by the "five plus" countries in this regard.</p></speech>

I had an opportunity recently to meet him to be briefed on different issues.</p><p>  Last week, in response to a parliamentary question, the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade indicated there has been progress in the nuclear issue and Iran is engaging fully in resolving it.  Is it hoped the deadline for agreement by 20 July will be met?  To my knowledge, the agreements reached in November last have been honoured.</p><p>  In 2013, Ireland exported &euro;57 million of products to Iran with &euro;1 million of imports coming into this country from Iran.  There is the potential for a substantial increase in trade.  One statistic that stood out was that, prior to the imposition of sanctions, the EU was Iran&rsquo;s major trading partner with trade worth &euro;28 billion.  This is now down to &euro;6 billion while trade with China has grown dramatically and is projected to grow substantially over the next several years.</p><p>  I raised the issue of human rights and the treatment of minority groups in Iran with the ambassador&rsquo;s predecessor at this committee before.  The Baha'i community in Ireland has brought to my attention serious issues concerning the treatment of some of its members in Iran.  There is a need for the human rights dialogue between the EU and Iran to resume.  It is an issue that the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade raised with his Iranian counterpart some time ago.  I am also concerned, to put it mildly, about the report by the Iran Human Rights Documentation Centre that 624 people were executed in Iran in 2013.  The number officially announced by the Iranian Government was 334.  There should be no executions whatsoever.  The number of those executed in 2014 to date is estimated at 250 people.  None of us has words to describe that type of conduct.  No one has the right to take life.  It is an issue that we need to have the full facts on and address.</p></speech>

I was a member of the foreign affairs delegation which visited Iran in January.  The human rights issue was an important matter for everyone on that delegation.  I acknowledge the frank and open discussions we had with everyone we met there on the death penalty, treatment of the Baha'i community and prisoners&rsquo; access to legal representation and medical treatment.  What progress has been made on these issues?  The death penalty was explained to me there but I am against it in all circumstances.</p><p>  Iran could be a stronger voice on humanitarian issues in the Syrian conflict.  We know food deprivation is being used as a weapon of war in the conflict.  Iran could be a much stronger voice on that issue because of its influence.</p></speech>

The sight of the Iranian authorities hanging homosexuals from the jibs of cranes is the most obvious obscenity of the abuse of people&rsquo;s human rights.  The discrimination against women with the implementation of a dress code by the fanatical Islamist police runs counter to what we believe are a woman&rsquo;s human right to dress according to her choice.</p></speech>

It is important Iran focuses on human rights issues.  There is a disparity of culture but we must respect the ambassador&rsquo;s culture.</p> <p>However, there are some fundamentals in human rights that are universal.  They would certainly be about freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.  In particular, there are concerns with regard to people involved in opposition politics not being allowed to articulate their viewpoint or freely participate in the political situation.  Having a robust democratic system would, ultimately, be to the betterment of Iran.  </p><p> The issue of capital punishment has been mentioned by some of my colleagues.  It is not just a problem for Iran but is a problem in the US and various other countries across the globe, including Russia.  It is a very significant human rights issue now upon which an increasing focus is being brought.  Iran also executes minors which would be very unusual even among countries that have capital punishment.  Will the ambassador comment on that?  </p><p> The other issue is freedom of religion, which is often spoken about but not observed as often even, unfortunately, in parts of Europe.  Apostasy is a capital crime in Iran which seems to be an appalling breach of a person's human rights.  We all saw the situation with Mariam Ibrahim in Sudan recently but there have also been situations in Iran.  This committee argued vigorously with the ambassador's predecessor with regard to Pastor Youcef Nadarkhani who was subjected to incarceration for quite a period because of his religious beliefs.  Given Iran's leadership in the region, anything it does should have an influence upon the thinking in the Middle East, which does need to change.  There are aspects of Iran's conservative policies with which people might not have difficulties but there are also aspects which are very oppressive and which, in this instance, would be seen as breaches of human rights.</p></speech>

First, President Rouhani has introduced a charter of citizens' rights in which the rights of all minorities have been mentioned and emphasised.  Like other governments, we have a duty to promote human rights in our country.  We believe that human rights must be promoted in all countries.  Human rights dialogue should be based on mutual respect and can be a universal subject when only human rights are considered rather than political considerations.  The people of my country say that those who do not allow the purchase of medicine needed for patients in Iran have no right to comment on human rights.  The western attitude towards the human rights issue has become political behaviour and is based on double standards.  I have many examples I can show the committee.  In respect of the worst violator of human rights in the Middle East, the Israeli regime regularly violates human rights in Palestine.  Some of the rules and regulations in our country are based on Islamic law and cannot be changed.  We are not happy about the number of executions in Iran.  Most capital punishment in Iran is performed in respect of major drug traffickers who are not only a threat to Iran but to the whole world.  We could reduce the number of executions by 90% by allowing the transit of drugs into Europe.  Until now, more than 4,000 Iranian soldiers were killed by the drug traffickers trying to traffic drugs into Europe from Iran.</p><p>  Recently, our foreign Minister told EU High Representative Ashton that we are ready to resume dialogue on human rights.  We all always ready to talk about human rights with all countries, particularly the EU.  Unfortunately, after that, a resolution issue was issued by the European Parliament to postpone this negotiation.</p></speech>

They are very important subjects.  There is a judicial procedure in Iran in which the victim's family is asked to avoid the death sentence for murderers.  According to Islam, there is thing called Qisas where if a person kills somebody, the family of the victim can get revenge.  However, we ask the families of murder victims to forgive and, fortunately, we have been very successful.  Many families forgive murderers.  This is very important.</p><p>  A Senator asked about the Baha'is.  I want to clarify that according to our constitution, there are four official religions in Iran, namely, Islam, Judaism, Christianity and Zoroastrianism.  However, there is no form of discrimination and violation of rights as a result of being Baha'i.  Baha'is are not deprived of education or put on trial solely because of being Baha'is.  The Baha'is who are in prison have committed illegal acts, as have Muslims in prison.  There is no difference between Muslims and Baha'is in this respect.  Somebody mentioned the recent demonstration in France.  I think he is talking about the Mujahedin-e Khalq Organization, MKO.</p></speech>

Assassinations by this group include those of a president and a prime minister - many innocent people.  It is unfortunate that the name of this group has been removed from the EU list of terrorist groups.  This group also collaborated with Saddam Hussein during the war with Iraq.  In co-operation with Saddam Hussein, it killed many members of the Iranian authorities.  It mentioned that it accepted assassinations in its newspapers and statements.  Unfortunately, we witness terrorist activity in the entire region.  This group accepted the assassinations of innocent people in Iran and co-operation with Saddam Hussein during the war against the Iranian people for which the Iranian people are very angry.  It collaborated with Saddam Hussein to kill innocent people in Kurdistan.  This group was also mentioned as a terrorist group by the US.  All European countries know about this activity.  Unfortunately, instead of fighting against terrorism, the EU omits the name of this group from its list of terrorist groups.</p></speech>

We need to investigate alternatives.  I am aware of the number of Iranian policemen and officials who have been killed in the course of the drug war but executing that number of people, many of whom are probably lower down the chain, is not the answer.  From my experience with drug dealers in this country, I am sure many of them got involved in these activities to feed their own habits.  I suggest that Iran should investigate alternatives to capital punishment.</p></speech>

Baha'i is not acceptable as a religion under our constitution but no Baha'i has been executed for his or her beliefs.  It is similar for others.  The majority of cases of capital punishment in Iran involve drug traffickers.  Under Islamic law, the family of the victim can revenge a killing.  To solve this problem, we have developed a procedure for working with the families concerned to forgive murderers.  Fortunately, it has been very successful thus far and many families have forgiven those who murdered their relatives.  We are also trying to find other ways of reducing the rate of capital punishment.  Nobody is happy with the number of executions in my country.  If the international community can help Iran to prevent narcotic smuggling from Afghanistan, I am sure the number of executions can be reduced.</p></speech>

He must have been delighted to read in the newspapers that Ireland is the country in the world that is most faithful to the values of the Koran.  This finding comes from a study conducted by an Iranian colleague of the ambassador who occupies a high ranking position in a wonderful university, George Washington University.  Those of us who are secularists might find this difficult to understand.</p><p>  When the ambassador was addressing the issue of human rights, he noted that Islamic law cannot be changed.  I consider Iran as a key player in the world.  There are conflicts right across the Arab, Muslim and Christian world, and Iran plays an important role.  I refer to the Middle East, Israel, Iraq and Syria.  Given the ambassador's strict interpretation of Islamic law and the laws of Iran, how do we interpret Islamic law through the Koran?  For example, Saudi Arabia, which is another might world power, has a different interpretation.  The Islamic state of Iraq and the Levant, which has just been announced, claims religious authority over all Muslims under its supreme leader, Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi.</p> <p>He will have a different interpretation of Islamic law.  How many of these conflicts are based on religion rather than politics?  How many of those who are dying as a result of the activities of Boko Haram and al-Shabaab in countries such as Nigeria, Mali, Mauritania, Kenya, the Central African Republic, Sudan and Egypt are the victims of a religious war, rather than a political struggle as these conflicts are sometimes interpreted?  How does the ambassador explain this terrible blood-letting between Shia and Sunni to people from the west who come from liberal democratic, Christian societies?  </p><p> I am delighted the Ceann Comhairle will visit Iran because the more interaction our two countries have, the more we will understand each other.</p><p> On the issue of fundamental human rights, how can Iran claim its interpretation of the Koran is correct and justifies stoning people to death, executing gay and lesbian and transgender people and so forth?</p><p> The challenge is to define what role Iran is playing in the world?  Is it assisting or undermining stability?  We spoke about the conflict in and around Israel and the funding and training of Hamas and Hezbollah.  Are these progressive forces?  Should they be supported or is Iran playing out an international world struggle for supremacy in the world of Islam?  It may take a while to answer my questions but I ask the ambassador to do his best. </p></speech>

In my country there are also different ideas about some verses of the Koran.  Unfortunately, groups in Syria and Iraq misuse Islam for their objectives.  We are trying our best to find ways to reduce capital punishment through the good interpretation of Islam.  We are unhappy about the number of executions in Iran.  I am sure the delegation to Iran had a good discussion about this with the brother of the girl in Iran, and discussed the execution and the issue of the Baha'i with the Iranian authorities and have had a response about it.</p><p>  We should be careful because, unfortunately, some groups such as ISIS, also known as DAISH, try to misuse Islam for their political objectives.  Unfortunately, it can absorb many young people to fight in Syria and Iraq.  Many times we cautioned the authorities in Europe to be careful not to help those groups in Syria.  Unfortunately, they did not understand the groups in the region, so they helped them when they were in Syria.  Now, after Syria, they have gone to Iraq and are trying to reach the other countries in the region.  Today, our deputy foreign Minister is in Kuwait because there is concern there about ISIS.  ISIS does not recognise Kuwait as a state.  We are trying to work with all our neighbouring countries to control ISIS in the region.  ISIS assassinated Sunni clergymen in Mosul last week, and they prayed the Friday prayers there.</p><p>  Although, unfortunately, much of the mass media has portrayed this as a war between Shia and Sunni, it is incorrect.  ISIS has assassinated Sunni people, and some Sunni clergymen in different countries have criticised ISIS and condemned their activities.  I want to clarify the situation.  We must be careful.  We are witnessing two important challenges in our region, namely, extremism and terrorism.  It is necessary for all international communities and members of the committee to help the Iraqi Government to fight terrorism.  They want to continue their activities in other countries throughout the region.  Unfortunately, some countries have helped these groups before, but now they understand that they made a major mistake.  The foreign minister of Iraq, Mr. Hoshyar Zebari, is a Kurdish Sunni.  In an official letter to the United Nations Secretary General, which has been issued to the Security Council, he has asked the United Nations and all its members to fight against al-Qaeda and ISIS.  In the letter, Mr. Zebari officially asked the United Nations to prevent the terrorists from receiving support.  The war is not between Shia and Sunni.  In Iran, many Sunnis live peacefully with Shias, and many Shias live peacefully in Saudi Arabia and other countries.  Fortunately, in principle there are no differences between Shia and Sunni except for a very small few interpretations.  However, unfortunately, some countries are using terrorism to change the political system.  This is the real problem of our region.</p></speech>

Iran's support for President al-Assad's regime is a source of concern to us, given the regime's behaviour over the years and the horror, terror and loss of life inflicted on so many of its citizens.  Could the ambassador refer to it, please?</p></speech>

My country welcomed the recent presidential election in Syria and thinks it is the beginning of a new phase of stability and national reconciliation.  We very much hope that other countries will make necessary a force for the assistance of the refugees as well as the reconstruction process in Syria.  On 1 June, our parliament organised a one-day conference on Syria for heads of parliamentary committees on foreign policy.  The Chairman of this committee, Deputy Pat Breen, was invited, but unfortunately he could not be there.</p> <p>The aim of holding the conference was to attempt to stop the massacre of the oppressed Syrian people and the destruction of resources and to prevent the expansion of terrorism and extremism.</p><p> The Deputy is right that we help the Syrian Government.  Up to now, we have given more than $6.2 million to the Syrian people in medicine, food and so on.  Unfortunately, we are under severe sanctions, but in spite of that, we think the Syrian people need food and medicine and we want all countries to help them in this regard.</p><p> We think the activities of extremist groups are the main threat to peace and security of the region and the world.  Members of these groups will return to their home countries, becoming a potential threat to the security of those countries.  They will be able to organise other incidents similar to the attacks of 11 September 2001.  I have heard more than 1,500 Britons went to Iraq and people travelled there from other European countries.  We should be careful because they will be educated, they will learn how to fight and to make bombs, and when they return to their countries, unfortunately, there may be weaknesses in the security of those countries.</p><p> The fight against violent extremism, sectarian conflict and terrorism is Iran's main objective.  In Syria, we are in contact with almost all parties, including Opposition parties, except for armed groups.  If those groups get into power in Syria, we are sure they will assassinate the Christians there but, fortunately, the Christians in Syria now have good relations with Assad and the Syrian Government.  We cannot impose democracy on countries by military force.  Democracy is a process that needs time.  Unfortunately, some Western countries misuse the situations in Iraq and Syria.  I do not want to name them.  The doctrine is to create problems and to control them for political motivation.</p><p> The UN Secretary General recently expressed disappointment about the Security Council's failure to reach a consensus on finding a political solution to the Syrian crisis and, therefore, he has urged Syria's neighbouring countries to block their borders to prevent weapons smuggling into Syria.  Doubtless, such measures shall prove a positive step towards preventing the expansion of the phenomenon of terrorism.  We believe that all parties must be involved in the government of Syria.  Iraq, Bahrain and Egypt are the same.</p></speech>

From the beginning in Syria, we told them we had to find a political or diplomatic solution to the crisis but, unfortunately, those who do not know about the reality of these groups have given military support and money to groups fighting the Syrian regime.  These people were educated and learned how to fight and they have now gone to Iraq.  After Iraq, they went to other countries.  Unfortunately, the Syrian people were mentioned, but it was not them.  These people come from different countries from Syria, but in some countries they were Syrians.  Some countries want to use the terrorists to change the political system, and it is the same in Iraq.  Recently, in Mosul, more than 1 million people participated in the Iraqi election.  The majority were Sunnis, and this shows that the people of Iraq accepted the government but, unfortunately, after ISIS went into the cities, the people were frightened by them.  Last week, ISIS assassinated a Sunni clergyman in Mosul who was not ready to collaborate with them.</p><p>  We should be very careful.  It is not to the benefit of the entire international community to use terrorism to change the political system.  This is the main issue in Syria and Iraq, and perhaps in future in other countries.  We should let people exercise democracy.  Recently we witnessed democracy in Iraq but, unfortunately, some countries do not like to see democracy there and they are trying to destroy the Iraqi system.  My government officially decried this.  We supported the unity of Iraq and we are against the disintegration of Iraq.  We talked with the old groups there: the Kurds, Sunnis and Shias.  Fortunately, we have very good relations with all of them and we try our best to maintain unity in Iraq.</p></speech>

The ambassador mentioned that we share many common international policies, including the importance of the elimination of weapons of mass destruction.  When I visited the UN last year, Iran voted against the arms trade treaty.  This relates to small arms, which have caused a great deal of devastation, particularly in his region but also in parts of Africa.  Ireland supported it.  That position does not sit with our sharing common international policies.</p><p>  The ambassador referred to the protection of Christians in Syria under the Assad regime.  This was also true of the Hussein regime in Iraq, under which Christians and other minorities were protected.  Once the Shia took control of Iraq, many Christians had to leave and some were murdered.   What does that say about Islam and a policy of ethnic cleansing in countries where Christians have lived for more than 2,000 years?   What is the psyche of Islamists that causes this to happen?  The ambassador will agree that Christians were much safer under the brutal regimes of dictators who were not popular globally or within their countries.</p> <p> The former Iranian President, Mahmoud Ahmadinejad, spoke about the obliteration of Israel.  What is the position of the current administration on that?  We, in my party, and people generally in Ireland have taken a position of supporting the Palestinians' calls for a homeland, which is very justifiable.  We have also condemned the atrocities committed by organisations, such as Hamas, and also by the Israeli security forces which have been equally savage in the way they have retaliated on innocent civilians.  However, we would strongly hold the view that any resolution of that conflict has to accept the existence and protection of Israeli citizens and borders once they are agreed.</p></speech>

There are dreadful casualties at the moment in Gaza.  Last week, we informally met the Israeli ambassador.  There seems to be no impetus for a negotiated peace.</p><p>  Regardless of the political situation in Syria, I ask that the Iranian Government, because it has influence, to ensure that food is not used as a weapon of war and that food gets through to all civilian populations.</p><p>  My third question on the political sphere relates to the Kurdish people.  Kurdish people fall in to the category of people over history who have been very badly deprived of a homeland.  What is happening now in Iraq is a Kurdish state.

Why does Iran's leadership, under the Khameneis effectively, not consider separating state from religion so that equal rights can be honoured as between peoples?  How wealthy are Ayatollah Khamenei and his sons?  I have heard estimates of at least $50 billion or $60 billion.  Fatwas are decrees.  We are not used to the idea of decrees in this country; we have referendums where the people decide on matters that affect social policy.</p></speech>

In this regard we have always supported a Middle East free of the nuclear weapons.  We asked all countries to remove their weapons of mass destruction because many innocent people die when one country is using weapons of mass destruction.</p><p>  The Senator mentioned the control of Shia in Iraq and the effect on some Christians in Iraq.  Fortunately, Islam wants Muslims to respect the other religions.  Many Christians live in Iraq.  The Senator's colleague visited Iraq.  The Muslim Iran has the best of relations with the Christians.  They have their church, education and work.  During the war between Iran and Iraq, many Christians voluntarily went to the war and were martyred.  We have to respect other religions.  In Iran, for each 150,000 persons there is one representative, but for the Christians and Jewish people, it is one for 25,000 persons.  Through this procedure we let these minorities have representation in parliament.  If we applied simple democracy for any person who obtained more votes, we would not witness any representative for the Jewish or Christian in our parliament.  However, we find some solution to let them have representation in our parliament for defence of rights.</p><p>  We also have very good relations with Armenia.  If Iran wants strategic friends, I say that Armenia is our strategic friend.</p></speech>

During some problem in history, many Armenians emigrated to Iran.  They made their church and the others.  Perhaps because of the bad weather the Chairman could not find time to go to the east front.  If he went to the east front he would witness very beautiful churches and many Christians live there peacefully.  Some of the problems in our regions do not relate to the Islam.  Unfortunately, there is some political motivation behind it.  In Syria, there have been very good relations between Christians and Muslims.</p><p>  I believe there is some misunderstanding about the Ahmadinejad remark.  He said that if Israel continued its policy, automatically it may be removed.  As can been seen today in the Middle East - in Gaza and elsewhere - we offer some solution for the problem in this regard.  First, we did not recognise Israel as a legitimate government because we cannot recognise occupation.  I am sure the members understand the meaning of occupation.  At least they understand we cannot recognise occupation.  The problem we witness today is from this policy - from occupation.  If at that time the international community had supported the Palestinians, we would not have the situation we witness today.</p></speech>

How many refugees has Iran taken in from Afghanistan, Syria and Iraq?  Does Iran get international support in this regard?  When we were in Tehran we spoke about the drug situation, particularly drugs coming from Afghanistan.  At one stage there was an agreement between the European Union, Iran and other countries in the region on drug smuggling.  This agreement has fallen apart and one of the reasons given by the Iranian Minister for Foreign Affairs was that drug smugglers are executed in Iran.  Is there potential to have co-operation again between international players in the region, particularly the European Union?  How does the ambassador see this developing in the future?  When we were there we were told the poppy crop in the region had quadrupled.  Much of it goes through Iran but there are other corridors also.  People in Europe and other regions are concerned it will end up on the streets.  We already see drugs getting cheaper in Dublin.  I am interested to hear the ambassador's response.</p><p>  With regard to the Palestinian situation, many calls have been made for restraint from all sides, which is usual when there is conflict.  Does the ambassador agree there is no equity of response with regard to what happens in the region?  There is no equality in what is happening between Hamas and the Israelis or between the Palestinians and Israel.  This in itself is part of the problem which needs to be resolved.  The US Government has tried to initiate talks.  How important does the ambassador see the role of the European Union in being engaged in discussions to bring meaningful dialogue and a peaceful outcome to the difficulties in the region?</p></speech>

Iran has more than 3 million Afghan refugees.  Unfortunately we do not get help from the international community.  The majority of them have been educated in Iran, they have married and mix with members of the Iranian community and they work in Iran.  We had many discussions with the international community about getting help, but unfortunately we did not obtain help.</p><p>  With regard to co-operation between the EU and Iran on narcotics, prior to 2003 I was the director of the first European department of the Foreign Ministry and I was a member of the Iranian delegation which negotiated with the EU.  The three topics we discussed at the time were refugees, how to combat narcotics and the Middle East.  Discussions have resumed to find solutions to the benefit of the region and the international community.  The drug traffickers in Afghanistan told us to give them a short transit route and if we did so they would not distribute narcotics in Iran.  The aim of these groups is to distribute drugs in Europe and not Iran.  We could not agree with this so we fought against them.  Unfortunately, we did not receive any help from European countries.  The gangs have high-quality technology to fight against our soldiers on the border.</p><p>  A number of years ago our leader made a suggestion on the situation in Palestine.  He said Palestinians should be allowed return to their homes and a referendum should be held to select a government for the region, under the auspices of the United Nations.  More than 4 million Palestinians are in different countries and they want to return home.  The international community has a responsibility in this regard to help the Palestinians.  For every one Israeli killed more than two or three dozen Palestinians are killed in a bombardment.  This is not fair.  Unfortunately, the situation in Palestine has created terrorism, which has also been experienced in other areas in the region such as Syria and Iraq and perhaps will happen in other countries.  Kuwaiti officials are very concerned.  Some countries may have helped these groups but now they are frightened and very concerned about ISIS because it has declared an Islamic government, which means it wants to control the entire region.  Terrorism is very dangerous for the peace and security of the region and for the world.  The Iraqi Government has asked the international community for help.</p> <p>I believe the time is right to help the Iraqi Government in its fight against terrorism.  Without this help for the Iraqi Government, there will be many problems for the international community in the future.  We believe the response to the Prime Minister's letter to the United Nations Security Council should be positive.</p></speech>

Our policy is to recognise a two-state solution.  We believe a two-state solution is the best way forward for peace in the region.  We recognise that Israel must protect its borders and also recognise that the Palestinians should have a state.  We believe that in terms of the peace process a two-state solution is the way forward.  Obviously, the situation is difficult.  We appeal to Israel to discontinue its attacks on Gaza.  This is extremely important in the context of the number of innocent people being killed as a result of those attacks.  We also appeal, perhaps through the ambassador, to Hamas not to fire rockets into Israel.  Israel and Palestine are attacking each other on a tit-for-tat basis.  Something terrible could arise out of that, such as occurred during Operation Cast Lead.</p><p>  On the stalled human rights talks, I understand that a precondition of Iran in relation to those talks is that human rights cannot be discussed with any organisation except the European Union.  In other words, they cannot be discussed in the United Nations.  We appeal to all sides to return to the table on the issue of human rights.</p><p>  I thank the ambassador for this open and frank discussion on Iran's political activities in the Middle East.  Obviously, we hope that a solution will be found to the nuclear issue.  We welcome the trade links between Ireland and Iran. However, we believe there is more that can be done by Iran in relation to human rights and that it can play a greater part in bringing an end to the Syrian crisis which has caused the deaths of thousands of people.  We look forward to future dialogue with the ambassador and wish him every success in his capacity as Iranian Ambassador to Ireland.</p></speech>

By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, the witness is protected by absolute privilege in respect of his evidence to the committee.  However, if he is directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continues to so do, he is entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  He is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br />I invite Mr. Jackman to make his presentation.</p></speech>

My name is Alan Jackman and I know nothing about banking except what I have learned through my experience.  I spent 20 years in the telecommunications industry and while I understand my motivation in this regard has also been circulated to each member, essentially it is that one should get a fair go, regardless of one's background or status in society.  The legislation that is the subject of my petition is the Central Bank Act 1942, in particular Part IIIC, and the administrative sanction procedure derived from that legislation.  However, I contend the real issue at the centre of my petition is in fact the public administration of justice and equality before the law.<br />Financial regulation in Ireland, including the pursuit of wrongdoing - even wrongdoing that is of a potentially criminal nature - takes place under the provisions contained in the Central Bank Act 1942.  These provisions include the strict professional secrecy provisions.  The reason for such secrecy at the heart of the regulatory framework appears to be based on the following thinking, namely, the Financial Regulator and the regulatory framework are in place to protect the banking system, not to protect the State or to vindicate the rights of the citizens, in the belief that protecting the banks and the banking system is in the interests of the economy and that a stable economy is in the public interest.<br />The administrative sanction procedure essentially sets out how a separate legal system for regulated financial service providers works.  The procedure sets out how the Financial Regulator will deal with a financial institution if it suspects that the institution has committed a prescribed contravention.  A prescribed contravention will have been committed by an institution if it breaks the law or does not comply with a statutory instrument or code.  I contend that the provisions contained in the Act and the administrative sanction procedure essentially constitute a separate legal system for banks and banking professionals, administered in secret by central banking professionals who themselves are sworn to secrecy.  Is the administrative sanction procedure constitutional?  The arrangements set down legislation appear to be contrary to the Constitution, in that they are not in accordance with the principle of the public administration of justice.  All citizens are equal before the law and it fails to protect citizens and vindicate their rights.<br />There is also a conflict of interest at the heart of the regulatory framework because I contend that the Financial Regulator as presently constituted is fundamentally compromised in supervising and regulating the banking system.  The people it pursues for wrongdoing are the same people whose co-operation it needs to make the system work.  In 2012, the British Government recognised this conflict of interest at the heart of its regulatory framework and split its regulatory authority in two.  As for EU directives, while I cannot make this point with real certainty, I have been informed that these provisions within the Act have been enacted to comply with European Union directives that have been continually updated.  I contend that every nation state reserves the right to make its own laws and it may make sense to enact such provisions to deal with the prudential elements, that is, issues to do with capital ratios and all the technical matters.  I understand why such matters must be subject to secrecy because one does not want to have runs on banks or people to lose complete faith and confidence in the system.  However, it is an entirely different matter to enact these provisions and have them cover elements of financial regulation that relate to the conduct of financial institutions and their employees.  Another issue is the vindicating of citizen's rights, with which I will deal at a later stage as I go through my submission.<br />I will now provide a more detailed explanation of the legislation underpinning the administrative sanction procedure.  As part of the administrative sanction procedure, the Financial Regulator can dispense with inquiries and go straight to a sanction.  In other words, it may have serious issues before it but might decide to not bother to look into them as the bank will settle or it will go straight to a section and that will be it.  It can summon, make findings, caution, reprimand, disqualify and sanction.  This can make settlement at any stage of the inquiry process and can grant immunity from criminal prosecution by levying a fine.  As for appeals, the financial institution can appeal the decision of the Financial Regulator to the High Court.  This effectively is why I am suggesting this is a legal system.  I noticed something while reading the 2013 version of the outline on the administrative sanction procedure, which stated:<blockquote>The Central Bank may decide to pursue prescribed contraventions through the Administrative Sanctions Procedure instead of bringing a summary prosecution.  However, the Central Bank will consider the circumstances of each case on its merits and may decide to pursue matters which constitute both a prescribed contravention and a criminal offence via the criminal courts. In deciding whether to pursue criminal proceedings, the Central Bank will exercise its discretion, having regard to the Director of Public Prosecution&rsquo;s &ldquo;Guidelines for Prosecutors&rdquo;.</blockquote>This raises a question that I cannot answer, namely, is the Central Bank doing the job of the Director of Public Prosecutions?  If that is the case, it is a serious matter but that is what is written in the Central Bank's outline document in which it describes how this procedure actually works.<br />The next issue probably is the reason I am appearing before the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions today and is whether a person can make a complaint to the regulator.  The answer is no, he or she cannot.  A person cannot make a complaint against a financial institution or an individual within financial section to the Financial Regulator, even where the complaint involves criminality and where the person is the injured party.  If a person approaches the Financial Regulator with instances of wrongdoing in a bank, even where it involves potential criminality or wrongdoing that is being perpetrated against him or her, the person will be informed that the Financial Regulator cannot investigate individual complaints.  I have submitted documents to this joint committee showing that this is indeed the case.  In addition, in a reply to parliamentary questions tabled on my behalf, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, stated: &quot;There is no impediment on any person from making any complaint to the Central Bank about a bank or an employee of a bank.&quot;  I can only go on what I have been informed by the Central Bank twice or thrice, which is that this is not the case and one cannot make a complaint.<br />I will now elaborate on various sections within the actual Act itself.  Section 33AK contains the actual secrecy provisions and it covers absolutely everything.  If a person puts information before the Financial Regulator, the person cannot be informed whether the matter has been subsequently investigated or the outcome of any ensuing investigation.  As for section 33AZ, according to the Central Bank's own outline of the administrative sanctions procedure the Financial Regulator can hold the final part of its sanction inquiry in public.  Although the Financial Regulator states it would like to do this, I am not aware of any sanction inquiries ever being held in public.  However, in accordance with section 33AZ of the Act, it cannot do so where the regulator suspects the law has been broken and a banking professional's reputation may be damaged or the wrongdoing relates to matters of a confidential nature.  In these cases, the hearing must be held in private and subject to the strict professional secrecy provisions.  There may be a situation in which the Financial Regulator may wish to do with something in private and does not wish to prejudice a court case at later stage.  Nevertheless, this still involves having a legal system that is subject to secrecy.</p> <p>Last year there was a case in Dublin which engaged a member of the public who had pornographic images on their PC.  RTE went to court.  In the interests of the public administration of justice, the person was presumed innocent pending trial, but they were actually named.  We have had cases in which people in other professions who had defective vehicles such as a bus or been driving carelessly did not get the benefit of secrecy because of their profession.<br />Section 33AT of the Central Bank Act states:<blockquote>No criminal prosecution may be brought if the prescribed contravention in question has already been subject to an inquiry under the administrative sanction procedure which led to an imposition of a monetary penalty.</blockquote>This seems to suggest that if a bank is fined as a result of a contravention, no criminal prosecution can follow after that date.  It is meant, understandably, to ensure a bank is not punished twice.<br />While section 33AP is easy to explain, its implications are more difficult.  The Central Bank must inform a financial institution that it suspects it of engaging in wrongdoing and order it to stop via an examination letter which will specify the grounds on which the suspicions are based.  If a whistleblower comes forward with information of wrongdoing in a financial institution, the suspicions will be detailed in the examination letter.  The whistleblower will not be protected by having the complaint publicly recorded and acknowledged like in a trial because it all happens in secret.<br />The Central Bank is actually publishing settlements, not just sanctions, at this stage, as a result of a decision made by Mr. Elderfield when he was in charge.  In a sense, this gives protection because once everyone knows about a whistleblower from an early stage, it is actually more difficult to pick on him or her.  It also raises an issue around secrecy.  I spoke about conflicts of interest.  There could be a situation where one does not want a bank to suffer a serious loss, but, at the same time, an investigator knows the law is being broken.  Pressure could be put on the investigator to forget the issue because it is all covered by secrecy.  It affects not only whistleblowers but also investigators.<br />Sections 33AR and 33AV allow the Financial Regulator, with the consent of the financial institution, to dispense with an inquiry and impose on the financial service provider a sanction or enter into an agreement in writing.  Could this result in the covering up of other wrongdoing?  The Financial Regulator, like the courts system, is not directly accountable for its decisions taken in pursuit of wrongdoing to the Government, the Oireachtas or the public.  The courts system, however, unlike the regulator, makes itself accountable by holding its hearings in public and acquires its credibility by not publicly administering justice but by publishing judgments made by its judges.  <br />Sections 33AK and 33AZ ensure that not only will investigations undertaken by the regulator and the outcomes remain secret, except if they result in a sanction, but, in addition, that the sanctions inquiry hearing will also take place in secret for the reasons set out in section 33AZ.  How can the public be assured that the impact of the 2010 Central Bank Reform Act and the various consumer protection codes is not diminished by these provisions?  The Financial Regulator&rsquo;s overriding objective is to protect the financial system, not the State or the citizen.  The recent legislative changes have been very much diminished because hearings take place in secret and the public cannot lodge formal complaints.  This means that we still must have blind faith in the regulator.<br />In 2011 the Master of the High Court, Mr. Edmund Honohan, was reported by RTE as having said:<blockquote>It was a criminal offence to demand repayment so frequently as to cause alarm, distress or humiliation; to tell a debtor they are guilty of a criminal offence; to pretend to be officially authorised by law to enforce payment and that unjustified enrichment of creditors was also prohibited under law.</blockquote>The Financial Services Ombudsman only offers binding arbitration as a means to resolve civil disputes between financial institutions and customers.  It is not an appropriate body to deal with the types of issue referred to by the Master of the High Court.  When I raised this matter with the Department of Finance in a parliamentary question, it stated:<blockquote>The Central Bank may not, however, in every instance be the most appropriate authority to whom the complaint should be made.  This will depend on the subject matter of the complaint.</blockquote>I do not believe these matters should be referred to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the first instance.  I also do not believe bank employees should be subject to Garda investigation.  At the same time, however, I do believe members of the public are entitled to protection and have their rights vindicated.  It is the regulatory authority that should do this.  In such matters, including psychological violence as outlined by the Master of the High Court, a person should be permitted to lodge a formal complaint with the regulatory authority.  In an ironic twist, the Central Bank has people in the banks ensuring this does not happen.<br />I have submitted the sequence of events that led to me making my petition to the committee.  Without going into it too much, I engaged with the Department of Finance for two and a half years.  In that time it did not really address the matters I had raised.  I was asked if I had mortgage arrears, which I did not, and whether I could go to the Ombudsman.  I was dealing with capable officials who understood the legislation and its implications.  I have passed on to the petitions committee the correspondence in which the officials stated they would not bring my concerns to the Minister&rsquo;s attention.<br />In 2009 I got into a dispute with a bank.  I copied various e-mails between me and the institution and sent them to an official in the Central Bank.  In a subsequent telephone conversation the official told me that he was wondering if I would ever ring him.  He told me he understood my e-mails which impressed me because they were convoluted, detailed and tedious.  He wanted to investigate the matter and informed me that he required a one line e-mail instructing him to do so.  It may reflect badly on me, but I did not do so for the reasons I have outlined.  He told me that owing to the strict professional secrecy provisions in the Central Bank Act, he would not be able to tell me if he had investigated the matter or its outcome, except in the unlikely event that a sanction was imposed.  If that were to be the case, it would be published in the national newspapers.</p> <p>It would not publish it on its website.  They are the two related issues. </p><p> I would like the committee to bring the matter to the attention of the Ministers for Justice and Equality and Finance.  I would like it to endeavour to have it debated in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann because the single supervisory mechanism is coming up for discussion.  All banks in Europe will be supervised, but from what I have read in the newspapers, enforcement will remain within the remit of the actual Financial Regulator.  I would also like to bring this matter to the attention of other committees such as the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, where it may also be relevant.  </p><p> What legislative changes would I like to see?  I am not the person to answer that question, but the reason I ask it is it might be my only opportunity to do so, apart from the fact that I have thought about it for some time.  I do not want people to think I have any real idea about it.  It is a very complex issue.  Conduct should be separated from the prudential which is very complex.  Economic matters come into it; it is not just about banking.  Risk is also a factor.  When people have to make decisions from they do not get any benefit and are only acting for their institution, psychological factors come into play.  It is not straightforward.  When it comes to conduct, we already have a tried and trusted method - the courts system.  </p><p> I would like to see legislative changes to remove the conflict of interest at the heart of the regulatory framework.  As I stated previously about the position in the United Kingdom, I would like to see legislative change to confine the administrative sanction procedure and the strict professional secrecy provisions to matters relating to prudential regulation alone.  I understand there must be secrecy and that there must be a separate regulation, but what I am objecting to is the fact that matters relating to the public administration of justice have been co-opted into the area of financial regulation.  I would like to see a legislative change that would result in the establishment of a regulatory conduct authority incorporating a specialist unit of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na that would work directly with the Director of Public Prosecutions in deciding if an alleged contravention merited a criminal prosecution.  I would like to see a legislative change to allow individuals to lodge a formal complaint with the financial conduct authority where they were the injured party.  I have very little knowledge of this area, but the making of complaints could be confined.  It has nothing to do with civil disputes.  If that is the case, one goes to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  If it has to do with psychological violence, that is a different matter.  I would like to see a legislative change that resulted in complaints and hearings being subject to a process that adhered to the public administration of justice.  </p><p> As I pointed out, my concerns about secrecy do not relate to the supervision of financial institutions, commercial agreements, prudential matters or anything to do with systemic risk.  Honesty is one of the cornerstones of the banking industry because there are no sanctions if one deals in untruths with the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Honesty is paramount because it is binding arbitration.  Although the banks are obliged to be honest, if they are dishonest in that process, they have all of the records and everything else-----</p></speech>

The reason I say this and would take direction they are hypothetical, but at the same time, they are pretty much 100%.  One concerns a homeowner who, according to his partner, took his own life, but we do not know this.  Nobody can make that decision in respect of the pressures he faced, but we do know that if he had made a complaint, he would have been told that he could not make one and that he would not find out what investigation had taken place.  The second case history relates to share dealings in two financial institutions.  Again, I had to take direction from the Chairman, but for one person there was the public administration of justice, while the other was subject to the strict professional secrecy provisions.  The person in charge of the strict professional secrecy provisions was criticised by the judge in that case which was very high profile and one about which everybody was aware.   Everybody is aware of the suicide issue because the case was well publicised.  The third case history concerns a very famous whistleblower who appeared before Oireachtas committees.  The most important thing I wish to say about this person is that he and the regulator cannot agree on the year.  The issue is not the fact that the regulator asked the whistleblower to withdraw his allegations, the fact that the overcharging continued for two years or the fact that &euro;30 million was given to charity.  The real issue is that the regulator appeared before the Oireachtas committee and informed it that it had first became aware of the overcharging in 2004, while the whistleblower told the committee that he had informed the regulator two years earlier in 2002.  It is extraordinary.</p></speech>

There is an element of prudence, which means we have to accept there will be secrecy, because they are technical matters pertaining to economies.  The regulator requires economists to deal with these issues.  We learned recently that psychology plays an important role.  If people lose money they will spend more money and, similarly, banks will risk more money.  There is also the law.  This is fine in that it deals with prudential behaviour and systemic risks for the banks.  However, I refer to conflicts of interest when people do something wrong.  A bus driver or even a doctor would be tried according to the principle of public administration of justice but banks get a special arrangement.  An example of conflict of interest is the decision as to whether it is preferable to see 10,000 mortgage holders get a bad deal or to save a bank that might cost the country &euro;10 billion that could be spent on hospitals and schools.  This is an extraordinary dilemma.</p><p>  The matter has to be considered as separate issues of prudential behaviour and conduct.  Where people are injured - I am not speaking about a monetary return - there are certain remedies.  However, if I am subjected to psychological violence I cannot go to anybody.  The Master of the High Court has drawn attention to this serious gap.  I am suggesting that, rather than the Garda or the Ombudsman, the regulator is the place to go with such complaints.  It might not result in a hearing or even an investigation but given that the regulator supervises these matters, it is the appropriate body to pursue a complaint.  I understand that if one makes a complaint to a garda, he or she will merely log it.  If 20 complaints are received on a subject, it is clear there is an issue, whereas at present all that is being done is supervision.  It is like garda&iacute; being able to check whether drivers are speeding but an individual not being able to inform them if he or she sees somebody breaking the speed limit.  I hope I have made it clear that there is a difference between prudential behaviour and conduct, and people being allowed to make a complaint which relates to serious matters such as honesty, psychological violence or potential injuries.  These can be confined, and the Ombudsman deals with everything else.</p></speech>

Mr. Jackson stated that he put his complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman for adjudication and he is awaiting a decision.  Does that mean the ombudsman has indicated that it is being investigated or is there silence?</p></speech>

It could be, for example, just the Senator and me and the Senator would decide where I may be in conflict with somebody else.  That is a civil dispute.  I am saying we should forget about that for the moment.  I put that complaint to the ombudsman and cannot discuss the matters arising.  The important element is that in 2009 I copied the regulator on e-mails.  To be fair to the Chairman, I am not going to indicate whether these matters related to my complaint to the ombudsman.  The regulator replied that the matters were serious and asked that they be put forward for investigation but then went on to advise that I could not be told about it.  In my personal view - I do not like saying it - I am essentially opposed to blanket debt forgiveness.  The reason I say that is because people think I have an agenda.  I do not have any sort of agenda.</p></speech>

It was sent through the inquiries unit and somebody acknowledged it but the only note on it was <i>bsdadmin@centralbank.ie</i>.  The response did not say it was from the regulator.  I was informed that it had no role in investigating individual complaints and that it could not advise me as to the outcome.  I was unhappy with that reply and when I rang the regulator I was put in contact with a senior official who told me that he would take receipt of the information.

A number of questions strike me on foot of his presentation.  In regard to the shortcomings in the operation of the regulator <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the ombudsman and the banking sector, including in the variations in treatment and level of fairness, does he regard it as uniquely an Irish problem?  Has he studied the regulatory and ombudsman systems in other jurisdictions and, if so, how do they compare?</p></speech>

I worked in the telecommunications industry for 20 years.  I know nothing about banking.  I am putting myself forward as a Joe Bloggs.  I engaged honestly with the Department of Finance for two years.  The latter is the expert in this area.  I cannot answer the Deputy's question, therefore, other than to note that in 2012 the British Government split its regulator system.  I understand that it did not go as far as I have suggested but at least it decided to have one regulator for conduct and another for prudential matters.  Capital ratios are clearly important because, as we know better than anybody else, we do not want banks to fail due to risky lending.  That is the prudential side but conduct is an entirely different matter.  I do not know how other jurisdictions have operated.</p></speech>

The petition system does not permit a person to raise a personal issue but to make a case for change based on his or her experience of how a public service works.  The person does not have to be an expert in the area.  Mr. Jackman is making a case as a layperson in the field.  Our task, with the Department of Finance and the relevant authorities, is to probe through the models elsewhere and the reasons for the case.  Mr. Jackman has observed issues that appear, on the face of it, not to make sense or be consistent with the overall administration of justice as one would expect, namely, that it would be done in public view with accountability and consistency in decision making.  While I appreciate that Mr. Jackman is trying not to go into his personal experience, we need to touch on it a little.</p></speech>

As another Deputy said, although I had a dispute with a bank, which I brought before the ombudsman, the issue that brought me here is the conversation I had with the regulator after copying him on those e-mails.  I was sending him convoluted information regarding my issue, and he said it was serious.  There is a major imbalance in power between the bank and the individual.  While I had no debt issue, a person in a dispute with a bank can suffer an extraordinary level of chronic stress.  Given that the ombudsman has no power and it is not appropriate to go to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, a person's only source of protection is the regulator.</p></speech>

He has put much work into it and it is very coherent.  As the Chairman said, people find it difficult to take the personal element out of their petitions and many have argued their personal cases, in which we have no jurisdiction.  It is important that Mr. Jackman has highlighted a systemic issue.  It is a very complex issue for people who are not involved in the financial sector.  The committee must be seen to give a fair hearing to both sides of the argument.  As Deputy Kirk said, we should examine international practices in other jurisdictions and get more information on how their regulatory systems handle this and whether the Irish system is different to other systems.

Mr. Jackman did not put it behind him but put the effort in, which we appreciate.  Mr. Jackman has made our job easier by presenting it without confounding it with his personal experience, which would have made it difficult for us.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, we have a duty to ask why the system is as it is and we should decide who are the two or three other people we can invite here to question and present with the information Mr. Jackman has offered here.  Although the other committees have jurisdiction and an interest, our job is to try to sort out matters of public interest and it is our duty to see this through and determine what recommendation we can make.  While it may turn out that we make the recommendations Mr. Jackman suggested, he would appreciate our desire for further clarity on the matter rather than adjudicate now.  As Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh said, we should do more work before arriving at a conclusion.</p></speech>

Members will be aware of the Government's decision in May 2011 to put new arrangements in place for the appointment of persons to State boards and bodies.  The committee welcomes the opportunity to meet the chairpersons designate to hear their views.  We trust this will give greater transparency to the process of appointment to State boards and bodies.

I also thank the Chairman, Deputy John O'Mahony, and members of the joint committee for the invitation to come before them.</p><p>  I am a native of County Wicklow, although I have lived in County Tipperary for the past eight years.  I was educated at Presentation College, Bray and University College, Dublin, where I studied science and undertook a H.Dip before commencing a career as a science and maths teacher.  I obtained a junior transport and warehouse role at Albright &amp;amp; Wilson at the start of the 1980s and progressed my career in transport, logistics and supply chain management through appointments as logistics director at Allegro, group head of supply chain at Fyffes, general manager at Wincanton Ireland, managing director of supply at C&amp;C Group and chief executive officer at Pulse Logistics.  I was honoured to be elected president and a fellow of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport Ireland.  I have extensive experience as a senior executive and a supply chain professional.  I have been a keynote speaker at several European supply chain events, as well as a member of the judging panel for the European Supply Chain Awards.  I was privileged to be appointed a director of Bus &Eacute;ireann in April 2013 and have served on the audit review group and commercial and innovation committees; therefore, I am acutely aware of the issues facing the company.</p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann operates three businesses within one entity, namely, public service obligation, PSO, services in urban, commuter and rural areas; commercial services, primarily, Expressway services; and the school transport scheme.  The main remit of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s extensive network is to connect communities throughout the country with efficient, reliable services, while focusing on innovation through technology and investment in fleet and customer facilities.  PSO services, in particular, are an essential component of the Government's transport strategy for provincial rural Ireland.  </p><p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann had an annual turnover of &euro;324 million in 2013, recording an overall surplus of &euro;400,000.  This was achieved in very challenging conditions and delivered through growth in core revenue, with significant payroll savings and the continuation of a range of efficiency measures.</p> <p>The public service obligation, PSO,  payment of &euro;34.4 million in 2013 has been reduced by &euro;15 million or 30% in the last five years and will reduce to &euro;32 million in 2014, but passenger revenue, excluding schools, has increased by &euro;5 million since 2011.  In 2013, the company carried over 78 million passengers.  Passenger numbers on PSO and Expressway services increased by 0.4 million journeys and schools passenger journeys increased by 0.7 million.  These positive trends are continuing in 2014 with passenger numbers growing ahead of economic indicators, while operational costs, despite significant increases in fuel costs, have been reducing and customer satisfaction remains at a very high level.<br />Bus &Eacute;ireann provides direct employment to nearly 2,500 employees across the country and supports the employment of a further 7,500 among suppliers and subcontracted service providers across its network of services.  The company has been in survival mode in the past few years but it has worked through this difficult period while delivering on all commitments to the National Transport Authority, NTA, the Department of Education and Skills and in creating a framework for a sustainable public transport system.  The return on commercial Expressway services has improved, while still serving many locations in Ireland at no additional cost to the State and absorbing overheads in rural depots that would have to be allocated to PSO services.  Expressway is providing an integrated inter-regional connectivity, in particular where no rail services exist, helping to defray costs for public services.<br />There are four main challenges for Bus &Eacute;ireann arising from the recently agreed five year comprehensive strategic plan to invest further in the business, grow profitability and deliver a best-in-class public service transport offering.  The first key challenge is to grow revenue and passenger numbers, through focused investment and increasing<b></b>financial sustainability across the range of Bus &Eacute;ireann products.  We must continue to work in partnership with the NTA to negotiate and deliver the best possible public transport offering for PSO services provided under direct award contract through passenger and capacity growth on the core network along with fleet and facilities replacement.  We must reposition the Expressway brand along with network improvements for faster journey times and more competitive fares to improve profitability and provide funds for reinvestment.  Third, we must deliver further cost savings in the provision of school transport services, including the introduction of a new information technology, IT, system, while continuing to provide all the services required by the Department of Education and Skills.  Fourth, we must identify opportunities for new revenue streams, particularly in international markets.<br />The second challenge is to continue to build a competitive cost base<b></b>across all products to maintain competitiveness and ensure flexibility of customer service delivery.  The focus must be on delivering a safe, sustainable and competitive cost base with increased operational efficiencies and operational key performance indicators, KPIs, to meet market requirements which are benchmarked against best international practice.  One key requirement will be to work in a practical way with the NTA regarding the tendering of 10% of the direct award contract by the end of 2015 in order to ensure a cost neutral impact on the company and minimise the impact on staff.<br />The third challenge is to enhance relationships with customers, partners and stakeholders<b></b>across the community to further improve customer satisfaction and Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s corporate reputation.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a proud tradition of local transport delivery, working with local stakeholders and suppliers to keep public transport close to the community.  A renewed and invigorated customer focus is essential to grow public transport across the country.<br />The fourth main challenge<b></b>is to have a fully engaged, informed and committed workforce with the right skills and competencies to grow the business in a safe and effective manner in line with evolving market requirements.<br />In conclusion, I look forward to working with the Minister, the Departments, the NTA, the CIE chairman and the Bus &Eacute;ireann board and management to grow public transport in a sustainable, safe and efficient manner and to put in place an investment framework that makes it happen.</p></speech>

I ask members to confine their contributions to questions and to three or four minutes, if possible, as I wish to let everybody contribute.  I call Deputy Dooley.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.880" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014070900004#H00300"><p>I thank Mr. Murphy for his presentation.  I and my party fully support his appointment as chairperson.  Obviously, it is for the Minister to move the appointment from designate to actual chairperson but the fact that he has identified Mr. Murphy as the chairperson designate appears to suggest that his appointment will be confirmed, and rightly so.  Given the time he has been involved with the board, Mr. Murphy has a deep understanding of the issues facing the company.  His qualifications and general understanding of public transport will bring the type of insight that is required to the company, which is clearly going through a transition.</p><p>  There are a couple of issues that I ask Mr. Murphy to address.  One is the challenge posed by the potential loss of the school transport business.  There has been an ongoing challenge to the way the Department of Education and Skills contracts with Bus &Eacute;ireann for school transport services.  I am not commenting on the decision of the Department in that regard, but has the board or the incoming chairperson given any consideration to the potential of losing that business at some stage?  If so, how would it impact on the viability of the company?</p><p>  Second, Mr. Murphy is aware that State subvention has been reducing over a period of time, in line with the current economic situation.  Coupled with that, there has been a general increase in fares for public transport.  What is his view of the theory of elasticity in regard to the pricing of tickets?  Does he believe we have reached a point beyond which further fare increases would lead to a shift away from public transport and back into the car, which clearly none of us wants?</p><p>  Third, is Mr. Murphy aware of any issues that pose significant risk to Bus &Eacute;ireann in the immediate or medium term?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.881" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Murphy" time="09:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014070900004#H00400"><p>First, school transport revenue represents just over 50% of Bus &Eacute;ireann revenue, so it is a very significant part.  That said, we run it on behalf of the Department.  It is cost neutral from the point of the company in that respect.  However, it links in with the three specific entities within Bus &Eacute;ireann and for that reason it is important.  Untangling that would obviously have very significant impacts.  We do not anticipate, at this point, that the business will be lost to us.  We are certainly working very hard with the Department to improve further the cost base, cost competitiveness, IT systems, renew the fleet and so forth.  We recently put in place a new online system for parents to make bookings for children.  At all times we are bringing innovation to the service.  In the final analysis, we believe the service we are offering to the Department will stand scrutiny from any other competitors that might wish to consider it.  Certainly, in an international context we are well regarded in that area.</p><p>  With regard to the reduction in the subvention, unfortunately we are dealing with the reality of the current position.  Despite the positive signals emanating regarding the economy, and we all wish that will continue to be the case, we are under no illusion that there are still difficult times ahead.  It is not simply going to be a case of rolling back to further levels of subvention.  That is why we have a very strong emphasis on the competitiveness of the company and making it as competitive as possible, both to provide the best value PSO services on the one hand and, second, to provide an Expressway service that generates sufficient profits to allow us to reinvest in the product.</p> <p>Our five-year plan envisages that, from our resources, we will reinvest &euro;50 million in the fleet.  The average age of our vehicles on the PSO and Expressway service is of the order of six to seven years.  Given that we do 167 million km per year, people can imagine the distance travelled by each vehicle.  As they grow older, maintenance becomes a significant cost, and this has an impact on the profit and loss.  We will work with the National Transport Authority, NTA, and the Government.  Within the subvention levels, we would like to have the maximum we can but we are working to make ourselves as cost-competitive as we can to meet the challenges.  There are many challenges for the company in the coming years.  We are under no illusions.  In the area of competitiveness, 10% of our award will be contracted by the NTA at the end of 2015.  At the end of 2019, a new regime with regard to direct award will come into play.  We believe we will be well placed from the competitive perspective to manage any competition that will arise.</p></speech>

With regard to feedback, I never had a complaint about the Expressway service.  It is an efficient service and I have used it.  It is welcome that further investment will be made in the service.  Are there plans to utilise smart technology to inform customers or attract more customers to the services?  A high percentage of people use smartphones and it would be beneficial to do so.  Wi-Fi is available on the Expressway service.  Using an app to inform customers about pick-ups, drop-offs and cost helps to attract more customers.  Comfort and the adequacy of the service is also important.</p><p>  I refer to the PSO service.  There are major challenges for Bus &Eacute;ireann and nationally as regards our public transport service.  Public buses in our cities have been heavily subsidised, which is also the case internationally where public transport is provided in cities.  There is a global subsidy.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy can explain how we compare with other cities internationally.</p><p>  I come from Waterford, some of whose services are run by private operators and are not subsidised.  There is controversy with the rest of the services in Waterford city being put out to tender as part of the 10% put out to tender by the NTA.  Is Mr. Murphy confident that Bus &Eacute;ireann can compete for the services when they are put out to tender in 2016?  Are there challenges he envisages in trying to win the services?</p><p>  I do not hear concerns from the public, as the public only wants an efficient public transport service.  It is not a major concern of the public who provides the service.  There is loyalty to Bus  &Eacute;ireann and I would like to see the company compete.  I would like to hear the views of Mr. Murphy on this point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.885" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Murphy" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014070900005#J00400"><p>With regard to the Expressway service, I can confirm that we are making significant changes to the ICT system to be able to manage the apps to which the Deputy refers.  At the start of the year we appointed a chief commercial officer, who was working very hard to bring into play the modern technology that gives customers up-to-date information and make travelling on the Expressway service more streamlined.  Members may have noticed some of our new coach livery on the Expressway service, which is being rolled out.  New vehicles are coming into the fleet at the end of this year and the start of next year, and people will see a higher level of service.  It is our aim to provide the best level of service on the Expressway routes and to compete with other operators to provide a seamless, modern and efficient transport system.</p><p>  The Deputy is correct in respect of the PSO in that we are in a competitive situation.  We accept and understand it and we accept that the customer is interested in the service and does not care a great deal about who provides it.  Having said that, there is a degree of brand loyalty to Bus &Eacute;ireann because it operates in almost every parish in the country.  The closeness to the community gives loyalty to the brand that is different to other operators.  On the one hand, we want to retain that, but on the other, we want to be as competitive as we can in providing services that customers demand.  At the same time, we must respect the taxpayer.  If the subvention is reduced, it is taxpayers' funds and we must be conscious of it.</p><p>  I cannot provide the figures from other jurisdictions on subsidies.  In most jurisdictions there is a certain level of subsidisation for services.  With over 4 million inhabitants on the island, we have over 11 million vehicles.  This amounts to approximately 4,000 citizens per vehicle on the road.  Taking out the large conurbation of Dublin and spreading the remainder over the country, this gives an idea of the sparse population areas we must deal with in terms of the PSO.  If we want to provide a certain level of service, there is a cost.  We must either transparently decide what is the cost and how it will be funded or decide that we will not provide the service.  We will be as competitive as we can but there is a danger in going to a range of competitive situations.  We have seen this in the airline industry.  Many operators came into the airline industry to provide lower fares and many of them went out very quickly.  There must be a sustainable business model that works in the longer term.  We must recognise that if we want a level of service to satisfy the needs of rural Ireland, and Bus &Eacute;ireann is in favour of that, we must be transparent about its cost and how that cost is allocated.  That is why we are working closely with the NTA to provide a level of service, to increase services where we can and to increase frequency, increase journeys and put the focus on the customer.  There is a cost to this and we must recognise that.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Timmy Dooley, I agree that Mr. Murphy's experience and qualifications render him suitable for the post of chairman of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Bus &Eacute;ireann is a trusted and well-regarded company, which goes a long way for any business.  I foresee risks facing the company in terms of the privatisation of routes, particularly where companies can cherry-pick the more profitable routes.  Can Mr. Murphy comment on this?</p><p>  The presentation referred to Bus &Eacute;ireann operating three businesses within one entity, PSO services, commercial services and school transport schemes.  I understand why school transport is shown separately but I do not understand why PSO urban, commuter and rural transport is shown separately from commercial services.  It might be regarded as a fatalistic acceptance that we cannot have commercially viable services in urban or rural areas.  Perhaps Mr. Murphy can tease out that point.</p><p>  Every Deputy receives representations from parents about some of the rigid rules of the Department of Education and Skills with regard to the school transport service.</p> <p>I am sure drivers, inspectors and people in the field hear this from parents also.  Is there an opportunity for Mr. Murphy's people to sit down with the Department of Education and Skills to talk through how it is working, the disappointment for some parents and students and some of what appear to be fairly silly things where a bus drives by somebody's house but the person has to travel in order to get the bus?  Is there the opportunity for that sort of discussion in order to fine tune the service and make it a bit more sensible?</p><p> Is the &euro;0.4 million surplus after provision for fleet replacement and upgrade or is there a totally separate capital expenditure heading for fleet replacement and upgrade?  </p><p> What time commitment does Mr. Murphy envisage will be required of him in order to fulfil this role?  Does he have other commitments in terms of chairmanships or memberships of other boards which will compete for that time?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.888" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014070900006#K00200"><p>I will deal with the PSO first and with why it is separate.  We want to be very transparent about our operation.  The Expressway service is a commercial operation and it should, and will, make a profit to generate further funds for investment, and I will come back to that in a moment.</p><p>  In discussions with the NTA, the regulator, we need to be able to clearly show the PSO services and how that is structured.  It is not a fatalistic view but rather about being transparent with the NTA about how we are managing our business so there is clarity about where the subvention is going and what it is being used for.  We would want to get into further discussions with the NTA about further clarity in that regard in order to demonstrate that certain routes will require certain levels of subvention which comes back to the question about cherry-picking.  </p><p>  There is a real danger routes could be cherry-picked.  Obviously, we will want to compete with any other service providers to manage to get those routes because we believe we have built up an expertise and an involvement with the community that will help us.  However, if one cherry-picks all of the profitable routes, one is left with a number of routes which will require even greater subvention, so there is a balancing act there.  At the moment, the subvention is one sum of money for the PSO operation.  It does not follow the particular routes where a greater element of subvention is necessary.  Maybe that is what will happen in time.  One must recognise that certain routes might be desirable from a social point of view but from a cost point of view, they are very significant in terms of subvention cost.  It is purely from the point of view of transparency and how we face into the future restructured direct award situation that we want to be clear about that.</p><p>  In regard to school transport, the Deputy is right that there is a lot of dialogue between Bus &Eacute;ireann, as the provider, and the Department of Education and Skills.  The Department of Education and Skills lays down the rules and regulations in regard to how it should operate and we operate it on its behalf.  Having said that, our staff have regular updates with the Department, they feed back any information we have and any of the feedback we get from our inspectors on the ground and so on.  I could not tell the Deputy definitely but I understand from presentations made to the board, there is quite a degree of understanding on both sides and, as a result, changes which both sides believe are necessary are then implemented.  However, I could not give the Deputy chapter and verse on that.</p></speech>

We are, for example, investing more than &euro;9 million in new fleet from our own resources this year.  We have been grant aided &euro;25 million by the NTA for investment in the PSO fleet.  All of the time, we are trying to built up the reserves and built up the profitability to reinvest in the fleet and to bring down the average age of the fleet which, at the end of the day, is essential to provide a sustainable business model going forward.  </p><p>  In regard to my own time, I do not have any other directorships but that is not to say that might not happen in time.  Right now, I act as a consultant on my own behalf and, therefore, I have the time available to give.  At the end of the day, I am not an executive in charge of the company.  I will operate on a part-time basis but it is the management team, myself, as chairman, and the board who will direct the strategy and ensure the corporate governance within the organisation is second to none.   That is where I see my brief.  I can assure the Deputy time will not be a barrier.</p></speech>

His CV is impressive and his background in supply and logistics and his membership of the Chartered Institute of Logistics and Transport make him a suitable person for the job.  Mr. Murphy mentioned bringing down the average age of the fleet.  What is the average age of the fleet currently?  Deputy Coffey asked about apps.  I know Dublin Bus has an app because I live in a Dublin constituency where somebody standing at a bus stop can find out what time the next bus is due by using an app.  Does Bus &Eacute;ireann have a similar type of app?  I represent a constituency which does not have Bus &Eacute;ireann services but I am aware that a large percentage of commuters from Meath, Kildare and Wicklow come to Dublin to work every day using Bus &Eacute;ireann or their cars.  How would Mr. Murphy propose to persuade somebody who currently travels in and out of the city by car to switch to public transport?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.893" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Murphy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014070900006#K00700"><p>The average age of the fleet at the moment, between PSO and Expressway vehicles, is just seven years, or 6.7 to be precise.  For the total kilometerage we are doing, that is really high.  I am not saying it is unacceptable but, for example, it is at the level where we are beginning to experience significant overruns in some of our maintenance costs this year.  At the end of the day, it is like kicking the can down the road.  If one delays decisions like that, it starts to pop up at a later stage and then it affects one's profitability in later years, which affects one's ability to reinvest.  One has to confront these things as one goes along.  Obviously, because we have been through a very difficult period of time over the past number of years, decisions have been made to put off some of the reinvestment decisions but we are moving back towards reinvestment and we hope over a period of time to bring the average age down.</p><p>  We have apps.  For example, one can now use an app on one's mobile telephone.  If one buys a ticket online, one can use an app to scan through as one boards the bus.  However, we are developing further refinements, which will be very interesting going forward.  </p><p>  In regard to moving people from their own transport to public transport, there are a number of things one has to do.  It has to be cost effective.  Congestion is beginning to reappear in the greater Dublin area.  For example, our drivers are experiencing congestion starting to creep back in once they reach the outskirts of the greater Dublin area.  That is delaying some of the transit times.  One has to be able to convince commuters that there is a better and a more relaxed way to travel where they can do some work using WiFi and read the newspapers.  They will want a modern fleet with facilities, efficiency of service and connectivity.  They will want to be sure that if they arrive at a bus stop at 7.20 a.m., the bus will be there and not at 7.19 a.m. or 7.21 a.m.  Being able to rely on the service is key for people who have busy lives.  Obviously, there is some discomfort in bad weather but we believe all the other benefits outweigh using one's own car to come into the city, in particular. </p></speech>

He outlined his qualifications and work experience in his presentation.  From his previous work experience in logistics it is evident that he is qualified for the position.  Much of the work in delivering a bus service is unseen.  Consumers have very little idea of the amount of work that goes into ensuring the bus arrives on time.</p><p>  Mr. Murphy has stated that his focus has to be on delivering a safe, sustainable and competitive cost base with increased operational efficiencies.  He has identified the challenges as the public service obligation, PSO, and the school transport service.</p><p>  I wish to focus on how Bus &Eacute;ireann will deal with the challenges of increasing fares.  Mr. Murphy's position is the public face of Bus &Eacute;ireann, but in his drive to achieve efficiencies and competitiveness, issues such as fare increases and industrial relations are in the mix.  How does he propose to deal effectively with the company, the executive, unions and the public in delivering a service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.896" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Murphy" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014070900007#L00200"><p>We make an application and discuss it with the NTA but we are bound by the NTA, which is the final arbiter of the fare process.</p><p>  As a matter of course, Bus &Eacute;ireann does not wish to increase fares but at the same time if subventions are being decreased but the levels of service that consumers are demanding are increasing, clearly there must be a place in the middle to take account of it.  We will have the discussions with the NTA on how the PSO services develop.  There is an element that if one can manage the fares process correctly, one might be able to gain further passengers on buses, which would reduce the cost.</p><p>  As I said earlier in response to another question, the spread of the population does not always give Bus &Eacute;ireann the opportunity to be able to run certain routes on an efficient basis.  If one wants to run routes to fill a social dimension, there is a cost element to that.  The cost element will either be in individual fares paid by the consumer on the day or by increased subvention which is paid through taxes.  There is a balance and that is something for Government to discuss and on which to make decisions.  We will obviously have an input into the NTA and develop as best we can the most competitive model.  If we are as competitive as possible then that should start to reduce the need for fare increases.</p><p>  I am very clear on industrial relations.  As far as I am concerned if one has a fully engaged and committed workforce, industrial relations issues can always be dealt with.  That is not to say there are no challenges for the company ahead.  We have had a great many discussions with our employees in the past period of time and we recognise and understand they have taken some pain in their wage levels and so on.  That is necessary if the company is to survive going into the future.  The most important point is that employees understand the strategy, and the reason for it in a very transparent way and what I have found from my experience is that employees will actual move with the company in that regard.  One is better to do that, talk up-front, be honest and clear with employees, they will come in the main with the company.  We have been rolling out our strategic plan and doing employee engagement surveys to gauge how our employees feel, whether they feel engaged by the company.  We have more than 2,500 employees spread across the country and communications can be an issue because of the spread of the employee base.  I believe from my experience that this is the best way of developing a strong ethos within employees to bring the company forward.</p></speech>

The system that operates in and out and within County Kerry is effective and serves the needs of the community as best as possible within realistic levels.  Of course, there is always room for improvement and to do things better.  My contacts with Bus &Eacute;ireann, employees and with the company representatives have always been very positive.</p><p>  I have three questions about savings, areas where more money could be spent and technology.  Has Mr. Murphy and his team considered the new technology in terms of fuel efficiency devices that can be fitted to HGVs and buses that will reduce the fuel consumption levels by up to 10% in some cases?  Obviously the fuel bill for buses must be enormous and anything that could reduce it will produce significant savings for the company.  Has Mr. Murphy considered this or would he consider it if he was to be pointed in the right direction?</p><p>  If the company were achieving savings in this area, it might be able to spend more money on bus shelters.  I appreciate they are expensive, that the company must apply for planning permission and that the process takes time.  The bus shelter in Killorglin will be ready shortly but I remember campaigning for it in 2002 when I was a student and people have been waiting for 12 years since then.  We live in a very wet climate and in towns and villages throughout the country there are no shelters.  Is it possible that Mr. Murphy will be able to focus more on this?  I am not suggesting that we erect similar shelters to those in urban areas in rural towns and villages but a very tasteful shelter has been put in place in Dingle with the theme of an upturned currach forming the roof.  One can use other materials rather than plastic and glass.  A bus shelter would prevent customers getting wet while waiting for buses.</p><p>  Transport apps have changed things significantly.

As a Kerryman, I agree in the main with what Deputy Griffin had to say about the effectiveness of the service in our county.  I have a particular bugbear, which I raised recently in the Seanad, but without any great satisfaction.  Let me recount this little anecdote, to which I invite Mr. Murphy to respond.  A friend of mine got the train from Heuston Station to Casement Station in Tralee and wanted to continue his journey to Listowel, a distance of about 18 miles.  The train and bus stations share a common yard.  He found, having come off the train, that the bus had left for Listowel about five minutes earlier.  The next bus would come in several hours time so he got a taxi to Listowel, which cost him more than the train fare from Dublin.  He subsequently contacted Bus &Eacute;ireann to complain but he was told that Bus &Eacute;ireann does not run a connecting service.  Is there any way that the bus and train service could be tailored to the needs of those who use both forms of transport?  It is not good for business for Bus &Eacute;ireann if customers off the train must take a taxi when a better timetable would enable people to go from train to bus, which one would expect to be the norm?</p></speech>

In addition, we have speed governors fitted to all our vehicles which control speeds and gives us an opportunity to ensure that one cannot drive at excessive speeds.</p> <p>We have telematics in the vehicles which allow us to see driving patterns.  One can use those telematics to see what the best driving patterns are and then start educating drivers about them.  That system has been used in other companies in which I have been involved.  If two of us go down the road, I guarantee that one of us will operate the vehicle more efficiently.  We are very interested in this matter.  As the Chairman rightly said, our fuel costs are very high so we will certainly make any savings on them that we can.</p><p> We are bound and involved with the NTA on the provision of bus shelters, so we cannot decide to erect a bus stop or shelter any more.  They are no longer specific to Bus &Eacute;ireann, although some of them are specifically Bus &Eacute;ireann shelters.  We have been in dialogue with the NTA about the provision of further bus stops, bus shelters and real-time passenger information.  We want to make savings on the one hand, but will continue to work with the NTA on that.</p><p> We want to develop app technology so that people can use it in a paperless fashion.  That is our objective.  Many airlines are now using that technology and we want to get it also.  The modern generation uses mobile phones and are not going to bring pieces of paper with them.  For that reason, it makes sense to use new technology which is cost effective.</p></speech>

We must be able to have a better system of connectivity.  There are mainline train and expressway bus services, but there needs to be good connectivity at in-between points.  I cannot comment on the individual event that took place and I am not sure about what will need to happen.  I strongly believe, however, that there needs to be an interconnected service.  Going back to Deputy Se&aacute;n Kenny's question, consumers can be enticed to use public transport if they believe there is an interconnected network that goes seamlessly from train to bus and so on.</p><p>  There are two companies involved but, nevertheless, we come under the same CIE group umbrella.

I am pleased to have this opportunity to attend the committee meeting today.  My intention is to tell the committee a bit about myself and my background, reflect on the past three years as chairperson of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann and set out my plans for the company and the board for the next three years, should I have the privilege of being reappointed. </p><p>  I was born in Glasgow 66 years ago, brought up in the east end of the city, and educated by the Marist Brothers and through the Glasgow Education Department's school system.  I joined British Railways in August 1965 on a five-year engineering student training scheme and attained a higher national certificate in electrical and electronics engineering at Glasgow College of Technology.  On completion of this training scheme, I was appointed to various roles in the delivery of re-signalling schemes in Scotland and London, most notably the major rationalisation of Kings Cross station.</p><p>  In 1977, I joined the Hong Kong mass transit railway corporation as a train control and signalling engineer for the construction of the original line of the network.  Over the following 28 years with the Hong Kong MTR, I held a variety of engineering and operations management positions including chief engineer and operations director.  My final position was as managing director, operations and business development.  When I left Hong Kong in December 2005, the network had grown to five lines, carrying 2.5 million passengers on a daily basis and was the most intensively used, most reliable and most profitable metro in the world.</p><p>  In 2000, I was part of the executive management team which successfully launched the company on the Hong Kong stock market.  From 2002, I was the director responsible for developing and implementing an international business strategy, which now sees Hong Kong MTR operating in London, Stockholm and Melbourne, as well as Beijing and other Chinese cities.</p><p>  In December 2005, I retired from Hong Kong MTR and relocated to west Cork where I still live.  I was fortunate to be appointed to the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann board as a non-executive director, a position I held for just over five years.  In July 2011, I was appointed non-executive chair in the revised CIE group and companies governance structure.</p><p>  In addition, I am a non-executive director of Crossrail, London, the largest railway infrastructure project in Europe.  Through my own company, Phil Gaffney Consulting Ltd., I provide advisory services at board and senior management level to a variety of railway industry companies and authorities.  Currently, I am advising the New South Wales Government on the introduction of the first rapid transit railway line in Sydney.</p><p>  Since I became chair of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in 2011, the overriding challenges have continued to be financial.  The board, management and staff have worked to address these.  We have suffered an unprecedented reduction in income, primarily in the form of public service obligation or PSO payments, but also through lower passenger revenue.  While reducing our cost base, which we have done to the tune of &euro;73 million over the past five years, we have operated an expanded network with three new lines opening as well as a number of new stations.</p><p>  We have also seen a significant reduction in the amount of capital funding available to us by 75% over five years.  Therefore, not only have programmes to expand our capabilities and capacities come to a halt, but this has also reduced the volume of essential renewals and overhaul to infrastructure and rolling stock.</p><p>  We have delivered efficiencies, reduced our staff numbers to their lowest level ever, reduced overtime, made savings through re-tendering services and contracts, and improved our fleet efficiency.  In addition, we have implemented lean management techniques which have seen other railways from around the world coming to Ireland to learn from our practices.  At the same time we have increased the service levels we provide to our customers as measured by passenger train kilometres, while maintaining an excellent safety performance. </p> <p> On the issue of safety, I should note that last night we had the first ever derailment of a DART train, just south of Bray.  Fortunately, the 33 passengers on board and the driver were not injured.  It is clear that the derailment occurred due to the train striking a coping stone from a wall above the railway which had been dislodged in what appears to have been a deliberate act.  We are working closely with the Garda to seek out who was responsible for this act.  Actions such as this are extremely serious and reprehensible and, in this case, could have resulted in fatalities among passengers and staff.  </p><p> In the past three years we have delivered efficiencies and implemented on schedule the internal reorganisation of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann required under European Union regulations which had previously been the subject of a derogation for Ireland.  This included the establishment of separate railway undertaking  - a train operations organisation - and infrastructure manager organisations within Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  We have improved customer facilities, including the provision of free Wi-Fi and online resources.  We have become more commercially and customer focused and commenced the Customer First programme which will be central to ensuring strong customer relationship management and dynamic yield management, among many other benefits.</p><p> At board level, I have introduced changes to our financial reporting and procurement processes which have resulted in greater transparency at all levels of the organisation and improved procurement of services and contracts to the benefit of our suppliers.  This has also provided greater protection for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann staff and value for money for our funders. </p><p> Thankfully, we are seeing recovery in the numbers travelling with us across all passenger services, as well as growth and new business opportunities in the freight business.  We have met and exceeded punctuality and reliability statistics under the public service obligation contract with the National Transport Authority and, most crucially, operated safely.  This has all been achieved while reducing our cost per kilometre by 20% in the past three years and a cumulative 33% in the past five years.  Notwithstanding this, the position of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann remains extremely critical.  We are seeking to agree a series of pay and productivity measures with our workforce, including a temporary forgoing of pay increases for a period of 20 months, with the sums involved ranging from 1.7% to 6.1%.  The senior management team and board, including me, have already implemented these proposals in our own terms.  Alone, however, these changes will not be enough - far from it.</p><p> That brings me to the challenges and my vision and plans for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in the next three years.  This will be a period which will determine the role railways will play in the future of transport in Ireland for the coming generations.  Today, resulting from the reduction in PSO payments of almost 40% from what was already one of the lowest levels of PSO payment in Europe and reduced capital funding, the current network we manage and service levels we deliver are not sustainable and there is a real threat to the solvency of the organisation.  We must grow our revenues further.  Working with the CIE Group, the Minister, the Department and the National Transport Authority, we must determine if the current network and services are to be supported adequately, from infrastructure to fleet maintenance to all service operations. </p><p> Investment is required in the national rail network.  Unlike the bus companies or Luas, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is responsible for the infrastructure on which its services operate.  In this regard, agreement on a new multi-annual contract in respect of rail infrastructure is absolutely imperative to secure the future of the railways in Ireland.  Capital funding is required to maintain our rolling stock fleet at its current standard.  We have transformed the quality of the trains on which our customers travel, moving from the oldest train fleet in western Europe to the youngest, through significant investment in the period from 2000 to 2010.  If we are to ensure the return to the taxpayer from the significant investment in the fleet, we cannot allow these assets to deteriorate.  If it is decided not to invest, to sustain safe and reliable operations, the extent of our current network will have to be reviewed.  Also, initiatives which require expanded operations must be adequately funded for the whole-of-life cost.  The position is that stark and I am focused on working with all stakeholders in ensuring there is an understanding of the issues we face and we emerge a stronger and more sustainable organisation. </p><p> There is a strong role for Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in meeting the transport needs of the country - in urban areas and nationally.  We can generate a return for the economy, for instance, by connecting Dublin Airport to the rail network and expanding the DART network, including DART underground, to effect a significant modal shift from private to more sustainable public transport.  There is scope for improving speeds on the network to reduce journey times and improve our service offering and competitive position.  While the challenges are great, the opportunities can be greater still.  I look forward, therefore, to the opportunity of working with the board, management and staff of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann in meeting these challenges and opportunities and providing our customers with transport solutions which are safe, service oriented and sustainable.</p></speech>

It is informative to hear about his success in Hong Kong and elsewhere and the significant challenges facing Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  He referred to a substantial reduction in the amount of capital funding available to the company.  A reduction of 75% over five years is significant in any industry.  There must be a cliff edge, a point at which reductions must not only cease but be rolled back.  Failure to do so will call into question the safety of the services operated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  Mr. Gaffney has noted that the cost per kilometre operated by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has declined by 20% in the past three years and 33% in the past five years.  Again, there must be a point at which it is no longer possible to reduce costs without adversely impacting on the safety of the service.  </p><p>  I am concerned by Mr. Gaffney's comment that PSO payment levels and the reduction in capital funding are not sustainable and present a significant threat to the solvency of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  I am also concerned by his statement that should a decision be taken not to invest in the company, it will be necessary, to sustain safe and reliable operations, to review the extent of the current network.  Is there a plan B?  Has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann examined the routes it operates?  Are routes that depend on the payment of a public service obligation subsidy more vulnerable if the company is forced by economic circumstances to review or reduce its current operations?</p> <p>What discussions are taking place with funding agencies and Government?  What is the state of industrial relations within the company?  I am aware the workforce has taken significant pay reductions.  Have senior management and the board of directors made similar sacrifices?</p></speech>

My presentation was stark because that is the reality.  We will not compromise safety as that is our primary responsibility.  That is why we are in detailed discussions and analysis with the NTA on working out what is the correct level of both PSO and capital funding to sustain the network as it is.  I am a professional railway man and have been for more than 40 years and I am not in the business of closing railway lines but am seeking to open them if at all possible.  We are carrying out a detailed review with the NTA and will be going back to the Department on the outcome of that review, laying out the options for funding models for the network.  Each line will be looked at in terms of inputs and outputs. That work is ongoing and will continue for some time.  However, if that funding level is not sustainable both in terms of safety and reliability and from the financial aspect we will have to look at the service being provided.  There is no plan B.  Nothing has been identified as yet and I hope that will not come about.</p><p>  The operating cost per kilometre is a good measure of efficiency not necessarily driven by cuts but it is also a measure of the return on investment which was made in the late 1990s and 2000 in new trains, removing level crossings and some resignalling.  We are seeing the return from that technology in driving down these costs.  That is not entirely negative and I think there is scope for more of that. </p></speech>

In terms of industrial relations, the staff has seen reductions in overtime and allowances.  There are reports that we are in negotiations with staff for further reductions, as the Deputy said, averaging 1.6% to 6% at senior levels.  Those reductions have already been implemented for all the management staff of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann as well as for board members and myself.  We have been working very hard with our staff and unions to ensure we do not get into a position whereby there is any stoppage of service due to staff action.  We will continue to engage with the unions to ensure that does not happen.</p></speech>

Following on from what Deputy Michael Colreavy said, Mr. Gaffney mentioned that the PSO payments have been reduced considerably from what were already the lowest PSO payment levels in Europe, in comparative terms.  How do the cost structures of the company compare in terms of pay levels or cost per kilometre of network Europe-wide?</p></speech>

I am aware from a very small review of certain railways with which I am familiar that the cost per kilometre, which is the standard way of measuring it, compares very favourably with most networks; particularly in terms of cost per train kilometre, we are very efficient.  In terms of cost per train kilometre, we are certainly in the top half in terms of efficiency.</p></speech>

I missed the beginning of his presentation but I think he appeared before the committee on a previous occasion as I recall listening to him speak on the Hong Kong metro and his work in Scottish Rail.  As he said he is a professional railway man I wish him success in his role.  There is no doubt he has painted a very stark picture.  I hope the new Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, whoever he or she happens to be, will listen to him.</p><p>  My constituency includes 13 DART stations from Clontarf Road to Howth and out to Clongriffin and Portmarnock.  Queries and problems arise all the time around the manning of stations and security on the DART at night, what can happen at weekends in Howth when many people descend on the area, many carrying alcohol and how that is to be managed.  I am aware of private security on the DART and that sometimes the assistance of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is required.  That is a problem that needs to be managed, especially when people, particularly women, may feel afraid getting off an unmanned station late at night.  These are issues that need to be addressed.  Much of this is down to anti-social behaviour which is outside the control of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Gaffney mentioned what happened in Bray this morning and said he thought it was a deliberate act that somebody had caused a derailment.  Unfortunately, those types of actions happen.  Currently there is also a problem with people stealing overhead cables for the metal content.  That is dangerous because somebody will get electrocuted if they continue to do that.  These are the problems that arise on the DART which provides an outstanding service to commuters.  I travelled on it this morning.  The question of security and unmanned stations at night is a real issue. </p></speech>

The issue of security on the DART is a cause for concern and, particularly, anti-social behaviour.  As the committee is aware, some weekends many people gather in places such as Howth.  When we have prior information intelligence from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or local information we put additional resources in place and we are in continuous engagement with the Garda.  We look at the various social media sites to ascertain what is happening.</p><p>  On a broader front, going forward there will be unmanned stations and we have to accept that.  We have one example of what can be done, not in the Deputy's constituency, in Broombridge where we had very active engagement with the Garda and the local community.  Broombridge had a very poor record for many years but we have improved its appearance and reduced significantly the amount of anti-social behaviour through working with the community and engaging with a person part-time to bridge the gap.</p> <p>We are concerned about anti-social behaviour across the rail system, particularly the DART and at weekends, and we are working hard to improve in this regard.</p></speech>

Mr. Gaffney's CV is very impressive and he can be particularly proud of having worked with British Rail and in Hong Kong, an extraordinary achievement.  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann will be all the better for his chairmanship.  Having listened to his presentation, I would describe Mr. Gaffney as an enthusiast.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.927" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014070900011#P00400"><p>That is reassuring.  As other members mentioned, Mr. Gaffney's presentation demonstrated typical Glasgow, brutal honesty and paints a difficult scenario if  options are not taken to support the networks.  As he is aware, since the 1950s we no longer have a rail network in west Cork and can see the lost opportunities now because of the decisions taken then.</p><p>  If Mr. Gaffney is faced with no choice but to review the network and consider line or station closures, how will he deal with that difficult prospect?  Such a decision would not be popular.  Will he give his views on the possibility of increasing or decreasing rail fares?  The figures published in the past few days regarding increasing passenger numbers throughout the network are encouraging.  In light of the challenges facing the company, how will Mr. Gaffney deal with industrial relations?</p><p>  About this time last year, the train accident occurred in Galicia.  Unfortunately, I had the misfortune to see that carnage at first hand.  Has Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann considered what lessons could be learned from that accident?  I know the full investigation process has not been gone through in regard to that accident, but I presume Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has considered what lessons might be learned and how it might avoid such issues occurring here.</p><p>  One issue that has arisen in regard to passenger numbers relates to the management of events.  I hope Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann has not factored in certain concerts this summer as part of its business plan for 2014 and hope we do not see fare increases as a result of the cancellation of some events.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-07-09a.929" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1051" speakername="Brendan Griffin" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014070900011#P00600"><p>I thank Mr. Gaffney for his presentation.  I concur with Deputy Harrington in regard to Mr. Gaffney's background and experience.  It is great to see someone with passion along with professional knowledge in his area of expertise.</p><p>  I have a serious concern in regard to the incident in Bray last night.  It is appalling that this was done deliberately.  This could have been catastrophic and the headlines today could be very different.  I support Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's and Garda efforts to bring those responsible to justice.</p><p>  I commend Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on being one of the only groups or organisations to have shown common sense and decency this week in regard to what it has done in regard to the cancelled concerts.  From a public relations point of view, it was a positive move by Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to refund fares and I hope this is acknowledged widely.  It has been well reported in the media and was a wise and decent move and demonstrates the only common sense we have seen on the issue this week.  Fair play to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on that.</p><p>  Deputy Harrington touched on the issue of fares.  There is some excellent value where tickets are purchased online.  However, sometimes people have to make a journey at short notice and fares in that case can be very expensive.  Also, people may not be able to make an online booking within a few hours of their travel time and feel they are being fleeced when they go to the station.  Is this an issue Mr. Gaffney may tackle?  I appreciate there are extra costs associated with booking at stations, but high fares leave a sour taste.  Will Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann consider more flexibility in the case where somebody has booked on line but needs to get an earlier train?  Generally they have to pay extra to change.</p><p>  In regard to the long term, what is Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's vision in regard to cutting journey time on inter city and longer distance routes?  I acknowledge significant work has been done on this in recent years, but how will the reduced journey times be achieved?  Will this require better stock or will it require track infrastructure to be improved?  Are there other areas I may not be aware of, such as signalling or crossings, that require improvement?  Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann must compete with our new and ever expanding motorway network, and hopefully in ten or 20 years cities like Cork and Limerick will be linked up.  The possibility of making the journey quickly by car will make it difficult to justify the expense of taking the train.  How will Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann deal with that?</p><p>  Recently, a friend of mine contacted me about the DART app, which is giving wrong information about the last DART trains leaving Connolly Station.  Will Mr. Gaffney check this out?  Apparently, the app tells people there is a train at "X" time, but the last train time is before that.  This happened last Monday and I received a call on Tuesday about it.  </p><p>  On a local issue, there is an ongoing issue in regard to the level crossing at Stagmount in Kerry, between Rathmore and Killarney.  The situation there between local residents and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann is at an impasse and local residents are aggrieved.  Will Mr. Gaffney give this issue his personal attention to try to breach the impasse?  If I can assist in that, I will be happy to do so.  The issue is causing significant grief and surely a common sense solution can be found.</p></speech>

How often does such review take place or is it continuous?  People may need to get to work by 8 a.m., but a train may not arrive at its destination until 8.10 a..m.  Are issues such as this - frequency and timetables - constantly reviewed in order to encourage new passengers?</p><p>  I am aware that Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann tries to encourage as much online booking as possible.  I would like to give some constructive criticism in this regard that I hope Mr. Gaffney will take on board.  I had reason to book a return journey online for my family to travel from Waterford to Newry, County Down.  However, for some reason the online booking facility would not allow me tick the box for the return journey.</p> <p>I submitted an online query to Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann's customer service four days ago which said it would respond as soon as possible.  Happily, the family is in County Down, having used Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann but I have not received any response to my query.  That can be quite frustrating for the customer.  I am saying this in a constructive way for Mr. Gaffney to pass on the need for more interaction, especially in this day and age of information technology.</p><p> I have a local question.  Why is the Waterford train always on the furthest platform at Heuston Station? </p></speech>

We are carrying out a very detailed review, line by line, and will have a range of options.  Closure of a line is the absolute last option.  We have nothing of that kind on the table.  We are considering reducing services if the public service obligation, PSO, does not match what is required.  I have said, and it has been agreed, that it would be done in an integrated way, particularly with Bus &Eacute;ireann.  If a gap is created, we should work with our colleagues in Bus &Eacute;ireann to try to improve that.  There is nothing on the table regarding any options for closure, but if we must proceed to considering adjustments, we should do so in an integrated way.</p><p>  Deputies Harrington and Griffin mentioned decreasing fares.  We are not in a position to consider reducing our revenue.  Total revenue is a combination of volume and price and we are very actively trying to get that balance right.  There is quite a difference between the DART and commuter lines and inter-city services.  The DART and commuter line fares are relatively inflexible.  Many people using them have significant benefits arising from the tax saver option.  We have been very aggressive in setting fares for inter-city services.  The &euro;9.99 promotion is a good example.  One area of investment is the customer first programme which will give us much greater ability to adjust fares to meet demand and to be more flexible in how we price our fares, which will answer some of Deputy Griffin&rsquo;s questions.</p><p>  While it is of no comfort to those who have to shell out the money, our fares are very low by European standards.  When one compares similar journeys, for example, Drogheda to Dublin and Luton to London, our fare is one-third of the UK fare, when one takes tax saver into account.  We could be much smarter about how we structure our fares.  The customer first programme will give us more tools to do that.</p><p>  Industrial relations are not particularly challenging.  In my time as chairman we have had a very committed workforce which generally enjoys coming to work every day and doing its best for the company.  It has taken a hit on take-home pay, as has management.  In all our discussions with staff and unions we have insisted, and I encourage it at board level, through the work of directors, that we continue the dialogue and that we never stop talking.  We have a cost containment committee chaired by the chief executive, and the unions are members of that.  That committee examines every single line of expenditure, except payroll.</p><p>  We analyse every major incident that happens overseas, such as the Spanish derailment, get what information we can and consider it in respect of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  We require investment.  A programme has been identified for automatic train protection, which would have prevented that accident.  A pilot scheme for that will take place later this year.  This is one of the areas of capital funding which I hope will come through in the years to come.</p><p>  We treat special events as windfall, and they are not, thank God, factored into our budget.  I thank the Deputy for his comments on our response, which was entirely appropriate to the cancelled concerts and the refund.</p><p>  We have reduced inter-city journey times and are trying to reduce them further.  We hope that within this year we will be able to introduce at least one express train, a morning train from Cork to Heuston which will do the journey in two hours.  We do not require any investment in trains or signalling, but to sustain a two-hour journey, including the current stopping pattern, would require investment in track to get it up to the level required for higher speeds.</p></speech>

There is Wi-Fi throughout the train and that will give us quite a competitive advantage.</p><p>  I do not have any answers to the question about the DART app but I know somebody who will get them for me. </p><p>  I do not know Stagmount level crossing personally but I assure the Deputy, following Deputy Harrington's comment, I will not go about dealing with it in my usual brutal Glaswegian fashion.  I will be a bit more sympathetic.</p><p>  We constantly study the loading of trains.  We make adjustments to timetables at least annually.  That process, however, rests with the National Transport Authority, NTA.  We do not have the authority or autonomy to change timetables.  We have to conform to that process.  We do, however, consider loading all the time.</p><p>  In answer to Deputy Coffey I will look into why one cannot get a return Waterford-Newry ticket online and why he did not get a response from customer service.  Waiting four days for one is totally unacceptable.  I will respond directly to the Deputy on that.</p><p>  I cannot answer his question about the platform for the Waterford train.  I have many friends in Waterford and I hear this often.</p></speech>

I have served as chairman of CIE since July 2011 and am honoured that the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Leo Varadkar, has nominated me to continue in the role for a second three-year term.  Along with my colleagues in the CIE subsidiaries, we were the first appointees to the chairmanship of a State-owned body to present to an Oireachtas committee under the new arrangements back in 2011.  In that context, I will briefly summarise my career history before focusing on the challenges and achievements of the past three years and the future challenges for and ambitions of the CIE group of companies.</p><p>  My background is that I have a bachelor of commence degree and a masters in business studies from UCD.  I have worked full-time in business since I graduated and had a 32-year career with Accenture, the global leader in consulting, technology and outsourcing.  I started my working life as a management consultant and worked with many organisations across various industry sectors and Government Departments in Ireland.  During that time, I led and delivered a succession of successful technology-enabled business change initiatives in both public and private organisations, initiatives which drove business success for those organisations.  I was elected an Accenture partner in 1988 - the first woman in Europe to reach that level in the company.  I ran Accenture's public service business in Ireland for several years prior to being promoted to my first role outside Ireland within the Accenture global network.  I held operational managing director responsibility for profit and loss divisions at Irish, European and global levels.  I spent the latter 12 years of my career with Accenture as a global executive director reporting to the global CEO.</p><p>  I chaired the tourism recovery taskforce between 2011 and 2013 and led the development of the Great Britain Path to Growth strategy.  This enshrined a new way of looking at and driving business from our key markets.  In 2014, we have seen significant growth in visitor numbers - particularly from Britain, which is our largest market.  My experience as a management consultant working in diverse industries enables me to understand CIE and the things that must be done exceedingly well if we are to succeed in achieving our vision.  </p><p>  CIE's vision is aligned to its statutory mandate, which is to provide socially necessary bus and rail transport in a well-functioning, integrated manner which contributes to balanced regional economic development and social cohesion at a reasonable cost.  CIE has devolved certain of these functions to its three operating subsidiaries, namely, Bus &Aacute;tha Cliath, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  Strategic direction, control and overall co-ordination is provided by CIE, but each subsidiary and business unit has a high degree of operating autonomy in its day-to-day business.  CIE also owns CIE Tours, an innovative and highly respected tour operator in North America, the UK and mainland Europe.  Indeed, CIE Tours is the largest single generator of inbound tour customers to Ireland  from North America.  The CIE holding company provides centrally a number of services that support the transport companies in their day-to-day operations.  These include treasury, IT, property and legal-investigations services, as well as the management of the commuter advertising network contract. </p><p>  In the early stages of my term as CIE chairman, it became apparent that the group was in the midst of what the Minister described at the time as a "perfect storm", arising from the cumulative effect of reduced Exchequer funding, reduced demand as a result of the severe decline in economic activity domestically, and increased fuel costs.  My absolute priority was to help guide CIE through that storm, working with my board, the chairmen and boards of the subsidiaries, the management teams, the Minister and Minister of State with responsibility for public transport, and key stakeholders.  In all our efforts to deliver reforms, we also kept in mind the needs of our customers.</p><p>  It is incumbent on me to point out that the cumulative reduction in Exchequer-funded public service obligation, PSO, payments to the CIE group since the onset of the economic crisis in 2007 is more than &euro;110 million, or 35%.  To put this in context, funding in that period to the health sector has declined by just over 10%, to education by 9%, and to the Garda and the defence budget by 16%.  CIE and its subsidiaries continue to play their part in trying to solve the equation of delivering the same level of public transport services on this reduced level of PSO funding.  Much of what we have achieved in this regard has been delivered through additional efficiencies in work practices and reduced payroll costs.  Now, as the economy recovers, there is a need to revisit what is an appropriate level of PSO funding for the services provided.  In very simple terms, it is not possible for CIE and its operating subsidiaries to continue delivering current service levels in return for the current level of PSO and capital funding.  This is especially so in the case of Irish Rail, as delegates have heard from Mr. Gaffney.  I very much welcome the opportunity to work with the Minister, Minister of State and the Department to try to solve this difficult issue.</p><p>  When the chief executive officers of the subsidiaries and I appeared before the committee last July, we outlined the immediate steps taken to address our cash issues in early 2012.  Additional actions we have taken include a continued focus on cost reduction, including the successful implementation of pay and productivity measures with staff in all three companies, with a further process concluding in Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann; strengthened board committee oversight of cash management; improved central governance function over key financial risks; enhancing the central group finance function; developing an appropriate inter-company funding structure; and enhancement of information technology tools.  We are beginning to grow our business again, with an increase in passenger numbers recorded in 2013.  In fact, the group has exceeded ministerial targets to grow public transport users by 2% to date in 2014.  Crucially, we successfully completed negotiations on a five-year &euro;160 million bank facility with a consortium of banks, demonstrating objectively that the group is moving in the right direction in terms of creating a long-term financially sustainable business. </p><p>  Despite the challenges we face, CIE is maintaining its comprehensive network of services through its subsidiaries, which continue to facilitate travel to all corners of the country in line with the group's mandate.  In addition, CIE Tours had its best ever year in 2013, with revenues of &euro;67.9 million and almost 50,000 passengers - a record number for the business.  We continue to try to deliver a comprehensive level of services while receiving significantly less funding than in the past.  My priorities for CIE reflect the challenges we face and include managing the group's debt and liquidity positions; a continued focus on reducing the group's cost base at a time when there is extraordinary pressure on the public purse; improving co-ordination of critical areas of common interest, including risk management, HR initiatives and stakeholder engagement; and an ambitious target for CIE Tours to be the leading tour operator to Ireland and Britain.  It is important to note that the regulatory environment in which we operate removes control over many of the levers one might use in response to these challenges.  In particular, the setting of levels of funding, fares, routes and timetables are all within the remit of the National Transport Authority.</p><p>  A core responsibility of the CIE chairman is to ensure that our shareholder &ndash; namely, the Minister, as representative of the Irish people &ndash; is informed of the key strategic issues and challenges we face.  We have been open and transparent with the Minister, Minister of State and their departmental officials and ensured they have all the necessary information to make policy decisions in the extraordinarily difficult environment they and the wider Government are facing.</p> <p>I thank them for this support and am confident it will continue into the future.</p><p> In this regard we have been clear on the implications of the significant challenge of securing necessary capital investment by the Exchequer in public transport fleets and infrastructure.  To maintain the current standard of the public transport fleet and rail network it is a significant priority of mine to work with the Ministers and the Government to secure the necessary investment to ensure that the nation's transport infrastructure, which is so vital to the country's economic well-being and recovery, does not deteriorate.  This is a huge challenge for both the Government and CIE, given current constraints, and it includes the investment required by the national rail infrastructure network and the funding required to maintain the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann rolling stock fleet at its current standard.  Both of these issues were highlighted by Mr. Gaffney earlier today in greater detail.  In the period from 2014 to 2016 all indications suggest there will be an acute shortage of capital available to the National Transport Authority, NTA, to fund the up-front purchase of new bus fleets for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.  To assist with the purchase of new fleets the NTA and CIE are exploring options around leasing.  While leasing may allow welcome investment in the bus fleets in that period, we must decide on a medium to long-term strategy for the funding for such investment.</p><p> Public transport facilitates a strong economy, environment and society.  We must ensure that it is equipped to meet the needs of our economy and society as they emerge from the unprecedented upheaval of the past seven years.  I look forward to working to ensure that public transport, as delivered by the CIE group of companies, is well equipped.  Should our appointments be confirmed we, the chairpersons, boards, management teams and staff, Ministers, Departments and the NTA, will work collectively to this end with the elected representatives of the people, to whom we are all ultimately answerable. </p></speech>

Last year I pointed out that I know Ms Jupp from her time working at Arthur Andersen many years ago.  I knew then that she would go far and I know she is an exceptionally good chairperson of CIE so I have not been disappointed in any respect.  I will not go through the same series of questions.</p><p>  Is there anything Ms Jupp would like to happen at CIE that has not yet happened?  Has anything occurred since she joined the board that she wishes had not occurred?  It is good that the CIE group can access &euro;110 million through a consortium of banks but will this meet revenue or capital expenditure?</p></speech>

I am in a better position to make predictions on processes and procedures, strengthening treasury and finance functions at group level and this is how I can say that the situation now facing us is serious and must be addressed.  There should be no surprises and if we carry on doing what we are doing there will be difficulties so we must make changes.</p><p>  Obviously, some things happened that I wish had not.  I do not like disrupting customers and on a couple of days, services were not provided.  As we continue to win new customers I hope we avoid such situations.  In terms of the &euro;160 million, a great deal of work was done on the business plan to demonstrate to the banks that we were doing the right thing.  We had to show them that putting money into CIE meant services would be delivered and the loan would be repaid.  All of the money is being used to fund day-to-day operations at CIE and only surplus cash will be invested in capital projects.</p></speech>

Does the NTA not need the same information?</p></speech>

We now engage more with the NTA because of the scale of the problem and the fact that we were able to give warnings.  The CIE group and Irish Rail are working closely with the NTA to find a solution to the problem to present to the Department and the Minister.</p></speech>

I note with concern the flags raised by Ms Jupp on the sustainability of the Irish public transport system.  We must continually evaluate the arguments in this debate to see where our priorities lie.  I do not have particular questions because Ms Jupp has spelled out the challenges facing the company.  Regarding the alignment of the objectives of CIE, I presume there is constant engagement with stakeholders such as the NTA, the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the workforce and the Minister.  When challenges arise and a business model for funding is formulated I presume change management is required and it is challenging to get the unions and the workforce to engage in the process.  Perhaps Ms Jupp can explain CIE's work in this area.</p><p>  What is the state of pension funds in the CIE group at the moment?  Are they healthy or has Ms Jupp concerns?</p></speech>

We cannot allow one company to do something that is detrimental to another.  The bus companies are concerned that we deal with the challenge facing Irish Rail because it could impact upon their services.  Since I took this job I have tried to be clear, concise and transparent in providing all of the necessary information to the board, which includes four worker directors, the management teams, the Department and the Minister.  I do not believe in hiding things.  We must be absolutely clear and transparent and ensure the evidence backing up our point of view is clearly communicated.  I always answer questions from the worker directors on the seriousness of the situation because nobody would want to put people through the changes we are asking people at all levels to undertake if the situation were not deadly serious.</p></speech>

Does she foresee a greater restructuring of the entire CIE Group taking place in the near future in order that it might achieve the greatest possible efficiencies and obtain the strongest possible competitive advantage with regard to the delivery of public transport services?  There is not a country in the world whose public transport service does not operate without some form of state support or subvention.  The concern of the committee is that the subvention to CIE should be used to deliver efficiencies and a competitive and safe service.  In the context of its overall structure, is the group fit for that purpose?  Ms Jupp stated that there is competition both without and within the group.  Mr. Philip Gaffney outlined his aspiration in the context of reducing the journey time between Cork and Dublin to two hours.  Inevitably, that is going to have an impact on bus services.  Would there be some way of restructuring the entire group and perhaps of cutting parts of it loose, for want of a better phrase?</p></speech>

We also try to learn from best practice elsewhere.  There are international bodies which do this.  We contribute to them and receive information back.  This helps us to look at the services we provide and ensure that we operate them in the best possible way.  There are certain services which are consolidated within the group itself and which are not replicated in the individual companies.  That enables us to achieve some economies of scale across those services and to attract the skills that are required to operate those once rather than in three individual companies.  The thing we need to do an awful lot more of is look at the processes and procedures the individual companies - which would be doing similar things - use to run their businesses and determine the services they operate in order to discover whether these are delivering the best outcomes and establish whether we can do anything from a process re-engineering perspective to deliver better services in a more competitive way.  No matter what we have in terms of the money we receive from the PSO, the NTA, as the regulator, should always be demanding improved efficiencies and effectiveness from the organisations every year.  We would always need to do that and we must make a much better effort in this regard.</p></speech>

The deficit in the two CIE defined benefit pension schemes was &euro;118 million at the end of 2013.  This was &euro;73 million less than the figure for 2012 as a result of the fact that the overall economy had done a little better.  The deficit is more significant in what is termed the executive scheme and amounts to &euro;301 million.  In the regular wages scheme, the deficit is &euro;116 million.  The deficit is dependent on the discount raised and used to value the future pension liabilities of the scheme.  That is influenced by bond yields, etc.  We submitted a proposal to the Irish Pensions Board in the context of meeting the minimum funding standard and that has been approved.</p></speech>
