I welcome the opportunity to set out for the committee the role of the Department in relation to the establishment of Irish Water and the systems in place for the oversight of this major undertaking.</p><p>  The establishment of this new utility involves major organisational change, an entirely new funding structure governed by economic regulation and the roll-out of a national domestic metering programme, all in a very short period of time.  There was little flexibility regarding the timeline for delivery as the establishment of Irish Water by 1 January 2014 was a critical commitment under the memorandum of understanding with the EU-ECB-IMF.    </p><p>  The Department is responsible for driving this overall reform process &ndash; developing the policy and legislation, and ensuring delivery of the implementation strategy which was published in December 2012.  We put in place programme management arrangements within the Department, through a dedicated programme management office, to oversee the achievement of almost 80 individual milestones which were reflected in that strategy.  It was also critical to ensure appropriate arrangements for engagement with the local authority sector and a water service transition office was established by the County and City Managers Association and funded by the Department. </p><p>  The involvement of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, BGE, was key to bringing the necessary skills and competencies to this project, allowing the utility to be established within this ambitious timeline at least cost and least risk, by leveraging from their knowledge, systems and skills and matching this with skills within the water sector.  It was recognised that external service providers would be required as part of this process.</p><p>  No Exchequer funds were provided to Bord G&aacute;is or Irish Water in 2012 or 2013 in relation to establishment costs.  In 2014, Irish Water, which now has statutory responsibility for water services, will receive &euro;240 million in equity from the Minister for Finance and &euro;490 million from the Local Government Fund but no other funding from the Department&rsquo;s Vote for establishment or other costs.   </p><p>  Irish Water is a commercial State body within the Bord G&aacute;is group and all the normal governance and accountability rules which apply to commercial bodies equally apply to Irish Water, such as requirements for ministerial consent to enter into capital commitments and raise borrowing, and requirements on the provision of annual reports and accounts.  The legislation also provides for conditions to be attached to any grants from the Central Fund by the Minister for Finance or in relation to grants from Departmental funds by the Minister.   </p><p>  As a regulated utility, Irish Water has to provide considerable detail to the Commission for Energy Regulation in order to allow the CER to  </p><p>  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann had responsibility for most of the deliverables under the Government water sector implementation strategy.  They developed a detailed programme initiation document within the framework of this strategy, which outlined all of the tasks required to establish a fully functioning integrated public water utility.  They also provided an associated budget to the Department which outlined the costs involved in each area of activity at &euro;150 million plus &euro;30 million contingency, and reflected both the estimated use of BGE and external resources.</p><p>  These establishment costs were initially funded by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann and subsequently financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  As they were to be included in the overall funding model for Irish Water, they would also be examined by CER as an integral element of the independent economic regulation of Irish Water.  </p><p>  Pending the CER examination, the Department agreed the classes of activity associated with establishment with Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann as they were required to report on expenditure versus budget under each of these headings during 2013.  These reports did not identify spending to date on external resources.  A report on the outcome of the public procurement for external resources was provided to the Department in March 2013 as part of this process.</p> <p>More broadly the Department was engaged in driving the overall programme with stakeholders and developing the fuller funding model with NewERA and Irish Water to ensure the expected benefits of the utility model to the customer and the taxpayer were realised. </p><p> A key priority  for the Department has been that existing resources within BGE, the Department and local authorities should be maximised to the greatest extent possible.  This was fully understood and accepted by BGE-Irish Water.  The Department worked with other stakeholders to secure agreement with trade unions representing staff in local authorities and the Department to facilitate secondment of staff from local authorities for this purpose and put in place arrangements with the local authority managers to ensure the effective engagement of the sector in the reform programme.</p><p> As part of the development of the overall funding model for Irish Water, the Minister sought the advice of the Commission for Energy Regulation under section 27 of the Water Services Act on this expenditure.  In response, the CER conducted a short review, based on information supplied to it, and gave an initial view to the Minister in this context that pending the full regulatory review to be undertaken in 2014, most of the proposed establishment costs appeared to be reasonable and could be expected to result in value for money from a customer perspective.  The in-depth review of costs by the CER will be critical in validating this view in regard to the full costs.</p><p> The Department has managed a complex programme of work to ensure Irish Water has been established by 1 January 2014 in line with troika commitments.  As part of this process, we have sought to ensure risks are minimised and the utility is developed as cost effectively as possible.  The Department has worked closely with NewERA and BGE-Irish Water to ensure the costs arising, in putting the organisation and its systems in place, are outweighed by the benefits over time to consumers, the economy and the environment, but we recognised from the outset the need for independent scrutiny of this position by the CER.  The  oversight arrangements put in place were designed to feed into this process and ensure that the costs arising proved ultimately to be value for money for the customer.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Tierney" time="18:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014011500004#C00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation to them today.  The invitation from the committee advised that the matter under discussion would be to review oversight and accountability of Exchequer funding to Irish Water, which is one of the largest reform projects in the history of the State.  I intend to cover two main issues, beginning with the oversight of the establishment of Irish Water.</p><p>  The diagram in my presentation describes the model put in place by Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann to govern and oversee the establishment of Irish Water.  The Irish water programme team, represented by Mr. John Dempsey, reports to the board of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann every month.  The board is ultimately accountable for all Irish Water establishment activities.  Specifically, changes in programme direction, scope or budget allocation must be expressly approved by the board.  The board also acts as an escalation point for the resolution of strategic issues and its input and review is requested on activities that pose significant risks to Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  The Irish water programme team also reports to the Irish Water board every month.  Prior to the establishment of the Irish Water board, the programme team reported to a specific Irish Water sub-committee of the BGE board.  The Irish Water board is briefed on all aspects of programme progress and is responsible for ensuring the enduring Irish Water organisation is compliant with legal and legislative requirements.  Strategic issues and risks impacting Irish Water or Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann are escalated to the board of BGE.</p><p>  The Irish Water programme management team reports to the Irish Water programme steering group every month.  The steering group is convened more frequently when required to support programme decision-making.  In addition to reviewing programme progress and risks, this body is also responsible for ensuring the programme is appropriately resourced and may redirect resources in response to issues arising within the programme to ensure the programme objectives and timelines are met.  The steering group escalates any requests for changes in programme direction, timelines, scope or budget to the board.</p><p>  The Irish Water managing director and programme director participate in the water services reform steering group.  This forum is chaired by the Department and Irish Water programme participation is required to ensure dependencies, risk and issues that impact either the Irish Water programme or the water services reform steering programme are managed appropriately.  The Irish Water programme management team and Irish Water also ensure appropriate input is sought for the resolution of key decisions across the programme and, critically, that the outcome and impact of these decisions are understood.  I have listed the various groups in the documentation and these refer to some of the items in the earlier diagram.</p><p>  On Irish Water governance arrangements and compliance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies, the code provides a framework for the application of best practice in corporate governance by both commercial and non-commercial State bodies.  Bord G&aacute;is governance and approval structures have been developed over numerous years in line with best practice in corporate governance.  Bord G&aacute;is seeks to comply fully with the code and also complies, as appropriate, with the UK corporate governance code and the Irish corporate governance annex to the Irish Stock Exchange listing rules.  Bord G&aacute;is continually reviews and updates its policies and procedures to ensure compliance with the code and other best practice guidelines on corporate governance.</p><p>  The code provides that State bodies and their subsidiaries are required to confirm to the relevant Minister that they comply with the up-to-date requirements of the code in their governance practices and procedures.  Bord G&aacute;is confirms its own compliance with the code and that of its subsidiary companies as part of its annual report.  The chairpersons of each of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s subsidiaries formally reports to the main Bord G&aacute;is board on compliance with the code, in a similar manner as the Bord G&aacute;is board chairperson reports to the relevant Minister.  Irish Water is required to report to the Bord G&aacute;is board on its compliance with the code in the same manner as all other Bord G&aacute;is subsidiaries.</p><p>  In regard to the formal schedule of matters reserved to the board for approval, the code contains a requirement for State bodies to maintain such a schedule of matters reserved for the board and specifies some of the items to be reserved.  Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann's formal schedule includes matters such as the review of the effectiveness of the system of internal controls, the annual report and accounts and the review of the risk policy.  Strategic Irish Water matters that fall within the scope of matters included on the formal schedule require Bord G&aacute;is board approval and are controlled at Bord G&aacute;is level, for example, the corporate plan, risk policy and review of internal controls.</p><p>  On the matter of Bord G&aacute;is approved policies, the board has reserved a number of corporate policies for its approval.  Some of these derive from the formal schedule and others relate to matters that are of particular concern to the board.  These board-approved policies include purchasing policy and procedures, authorisation levels and execution of contracts, diversification, and risk policy.  Bord G&aacute;is corporate policy documents have been adopted and applied by Irish Water and any changes to same require the approval of the Bord G&aacute;is board.</p><p>  On the issue of ministerial consents, the Gas Acts contain requirements for Bord G&aacute;is to seek ministerial consent for certain activities.  For example, diversification and entry into capital commitments require ministerial approval.  Irish Water&rsquo;s memorandum and articles of association, M&amp;A, and the Water Services Acts set out the requirements for Irish Water to seek ministerial consent for certain activities, including entry into capital commitments, borrowing and allotment of shares.  Irish Water&rsquo;s M&amp;A specify that the prior consent of Bord G&aacute;is is required in regard to the submission of any ministerial consent request by Irish Water.</p><p>  In regard to Irish Water governance, the Irish Water board is a 12 member board, mainly comprising non-executive directors.  It is responsible for ensuring Irish Water complies with its governance obligations.  As a statutory company, Irish Water is subject to a wide range of governance obligations, including those imposed on it by the Companies Acts, by common law and by the provisions of the Water Services Acts.  In addition, as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is and as outlined earlier, Irish Water is required to report to Bord G&aacute;is on its compliance with the code</p><p>  As Irish Water&rsquo;s parent company, Bord G&aacute;is is responsible for ensuring the proper and effective management of its subsidiary.  Irish Water&rsquo;s M&amp;A provide that all contracts in excess of &euro;10 million must be approved by the Bord G&aacute;is board.  In addition and as outlined, Bord G&aacute;is has implemented its own internal controls and policies, including its risk management policy, within Irish Water.  Any matters requiring the submission of a request for ministerial consent by Irish Water, as in the examples provided, are reviewed and approved in advance by the Bord G&aacute;is board.</p><p>  On the issue of interactions with the State, Bord G&aacute;is meets NewERA and Department officials every quarter and provides details on financial performance metrics for the previous quarter, along with details on forthcoming ministerial consent requests.  Ministerial consent request applications can result in clarification meetings and the provision of additional material to deal with queries raised by NewERA and the relevant Departments.</p> <p>They can come from either the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government or the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The annual report must be considered and approved by the Cabinet prior to publication.  In accordance with the code, Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann provides the Department with a report on compliance with governance requirements.</p><p> We have not covered the material on the establishment budget because the budget, the process and the timelines were contained in our submission yesterday to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, but we copied the documents to the clerk to this committee.  Obviously, we are happy to take questions on that as well.</p><p> The Commission for Energy Regulation is an independent State body that will regulate Irish Water's revenues and expenditure.  The commission will provide a separate presentation.  The regime will allow for a review of expenditure before and after it is incurred.  It is also the independent State body advising the Minister on the establishment costs.</p><p> From a company governance point of view, as a commercial semi-state utility we follow all the codes of practice and seek approvals before any commitments are made.  In respect of the topic today, there is a comprehensive set of systems to review and give oversight of Irish Water spending, including Exchequer funding.</p></speech>

The CER is Ireland's independent energy regulator.  We have broad economic and safety functions in energy.  Following legislation enacted late last year, we expect to be formally appointed as Ireland's water regulator in the coming weeks.  Our duty is to protect the interests of customers.  To that end, we place a strong focus on customer protection measures and ensuring efficiencies in operating and capital expenditure in the utilities that we regulate.  In addition, a stable regulatory environment assists access to capital markets at reasonable rates and therefore minimises costs for the consumer ultimately.</p><p>  Our aim for the water sector is for a high-quality and efficient water system to benefit water customers.  In 2014 we will consult publicly on the structure of water charges and on the customer protection measures that we propose to put in place.  This will be done in April this year.  We will also consult publicly on the water charge levels that we anticipate or that we are proposing in June this year.  This will follow from a detailed submission from Irish Water, which we will analyse.  The commission will then issue its decision on water charge structures and the level of those charges in August this year, and those charges will take effect from October 2014.  Our focus will be to ensure that only efficient Irish Water operating and capital costs are passed through to customers.  To this end, we will include benchmarking against best international practice as part of the process of analysing those costs.</p><p>  Already, following a request from the Minister, the commission has carried out a short high-level review of Irish Water set-up costs.  This was carried out in late October and November 2013.  It found that most costs appear reasonable at a high level.  However, it was pointed out that further detailed analysis was needed to confirm this.  The analysis of these Irish Water costs will be carried out by the CER in the coming months to the timetable that I have set out.  We will look at the totality of those costs and we will only be allowing efficient Irish Water costs to be paid for by water customers.</p></speech>

I will set out our role as I see it.  The citizen looking in is entitled to clarity on the breakdown of costs, what they are for and the service he will be provided with.  I want to go into those areas.  I have no wish to go over old ground because much of it was covered yesterday at the environment committee.  However, I wish to deal with some of the main areas.</p><p>  The first issue, to cut to the chase, is the &euro;50 million that has been spent on consultants' fees to date.  That is the figure being discussed at the moment.  I want to ask a question and then come back in and I want us to interact.  I want to get full clarity on the &euro;50 million.  This is probably a question as much for Mr. Dempsey as for Mr. Tierney.  Irish Water probably has management accounts done at this point.  When Irish Water comes to do the statutory accounts, how much of the &euro;50 million will be reflected as a capital item in the balance sheet?  How much will be reflected as revenue?  That point has not been dealt with but it is a basic and fundamental one.  I call on Mr. Tierney to deal with that straight away.</p></speech>

As part of the finalisation of the statutory accounts we will adopt the appropriate accounting treatment.  Under IFRS rules we will capitalise that element of the programme costs which can be capitalised for accounting purposes.  This will be separate to the treatment that may be adopted for regulatory purposes.  Therefore, when the Commission for Energy Regulation review is complete a view will be taken on the appropriateness or otherwise of the inclusion of that cost in the regulatory asset base, RAB, which in turn forms part of the calculation of any costs that might be allowed as part of what is termed our "allowed revenues".  I do not propose to go into the detail on the regulatory side at this point.</p></speech>

The bottom line for the public looking in at the moment is that if some of this &euro;50 million is regarded as spending on infrastructure, it is a different situation from one in which it is regarded as consultants' fees.  That matter needs clarification.  With due respect to Mr. Dempsey, giving me, dare I say it, a technical accountant's answer is not what I am looking for and it is not what the public is looking for.  I will ask the question again.  In an organisation the size of Irish Water, the deputation should be aware of how much of the &euro;50 million is regarded as a capital item as distinct from a revenue item.  At the moment it is regarded by the public as a revenue item.  It is seen as taxpayers' money going to consultants.  This falls on Mr. Tierney's watch.  How much of this &euro;50 million does Mr. Tierney regard as capital?</p></speech>

They are for the creation of an asset which will be determined, as Mr. Dempsey said, in terms of the scale of the organisation, and it will be applied through the consideration of the regulator.  As we pointed out in our presentation yesterday, the committee will see what the money was spent on in regard to the creation of the company that is Irish Water, rather than being spent on a consultant who writes a report that is not acted on.  This is about building systems which will be in place in future to enable the company to do the work on the asset management system and the capital programme planning-----</p></speech>

There are two parts to this; first, there is the Irish Water programme that was set up within Bord G&aacute;is to do the establishment work.  That is the budget we spoke about yesterday evening.  Second, there is the permanent organisation, the Irish Water business which has been coming on gradually since I took up duty as the first person to do so, on 29 April last year.  It has been building up to take on the metering programme and then the responsibilities under the legislation from 1 January.

The witnesses should know when they spend &euro;50 million of taxpayers&rsquo; money whether it will be regarded as revenue or as an asset that will generate revenue.

Typically, when we receive a submission from a utility it will identify in its view what is capital expenditure and what is operating expenditure.

That was purely for information because the CER had no statutory force at that time.  On the expectation that it would become the regulator we gave it information.</p><p>  In October 2013, we went back and made a formal submission to the regulator.  The numbers were the same.  The spend categories were the same.  The number in contention has not changed.  After we gave it to the CER, it came back and asked a series of questions.  We responded to those questions.  I take Mr. McGowan&rsquo;s point that a more detailed analysis probably needs to be done.  That will be done in due course I have no doubt. </p></speech>

Why did the same not happen in the establishment of Irish Water?  One of the reasons that Bord G&aacute;is is the provider is that it brought this synergy with it.  Why could it happen when it went into the electricity market but it appears to have to reinvent the wheel when it goes into the water market?</p></speech>

What Bord G&aacute;is brought to this was probably 50 people full-time out of the Bord G&aacute;is business to drive the water programme, the establishment of the water utility.  They were subject matter experts in various disciplines across the organisation.  They do not write code.  They do not build hardware.  They do not supply hardware.  It was always explicitly stated that those things had to be recruited externally.  Bord G&aacute;is brought the discipline, the rigour and many years of utility experience to drive the programme to recruit and procure the right skill sets, the right service providers, not consultants - I am choosing my words carefully - to do what we said we would do when we planned it.</p></speech>

On the issue of procurement, my understanding was that 28 contracts have effectively been granted to date for various different projects.  How many of those were given that did not go out to tender, that were extensions for existing contractors within Bord G&aacute;is?</p> <p>I have further questions.  Mr. Tierney stated that every contract worth over &euro;10 million had to be approved by Bord G&aacute;is.  How many contracts were approved by Bord G&aacute;is that were not put out to tender?  A total of &euro;13 million was spent on approximately 22 contractors.  How many of those contracts were not put out to tender?  I ask Mr. Tierney to deal with the issue of bonuses which arose yesterday.  Irish Water is a State organisation - I will have a question for Ms Tallon on this issue - which was established using taxpayers' money.  It is the case that bonuses are not a feature of the public sector in general.  How can a bonus regime in Bord G&aacute;is be justified?  I ask Mr. Tierney to deal with the bonuses first because I want to ask Ms Tallon about the other issue.  How can he justify implementing a bonus system in a public body which is funded by the taxpayer?  Such a system does not apply in the public sector, nor in many other organisations.  I understand that employees who transferred from other State bodies such as the local authorities could not gain.  I do not doubt these are very good employees, but these are issues of value for money, structures, corporate governance and ensuring transparency for the taxpayer.  How did this situation come about?</p></speech>

I clarified that point last night.  For example, our submission gave details of two companies that received legal fees as part of this project.  Those companies were taken from the Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann legal panel, which was openly tendered a couple of years ago, and this would probably be replicated in a number of the lists that the Deputy has seen.  I do not have the details to hand but I can get them for the Deputy.  The benefit was that BG&Eacute; panels were in place and we could draw from them in order to mobilise the project very quickly.</p><p>  If we could park the bonus aspect, I wish to give the committee a brief explanation of how performance management is operated in Bord G&aacute;is and how it will operate in Irish Water.  A high-performing utility such as this requires three planks: people, process and technology.  We outlined in great detail last night our investment in the technology and the process.  The people are the third plank and a high-performing utility needs people who are motivated and are out performing against the targets that are set for them.  The main driver is that they are content in their work, that their talent pool is managed and that they have the ability to move sideways or upwards in the organisation.  I have done a lot of work on this aspect over the past few years and in my view it results in great staff motivation.</p></speech>

In a high-performing utility the enterprise sets its objectives every year at a very high level and this cascades down the organisation to the business units, to the functional areas within the business units, and down to the individual level.  Every year, each individual subject to a performance management regime gets a set of individual targets and objectives for what he or she is meant to achieve and how he or she is meant to go about achieving them, which is a behavioural set.</p> <p>We have done a great deal of work on this in the past two or three years.  It is still evolving, but I am happy with the progress made.  The idea is that members of staff will know on a daily basis when they come to work how they fit into the organisation and that their contribution is relevant to how the overall enterprise is performing.</p><p> There should, in my view, be a monetary payment where a member of staff outperforms the performance level that was set.  Members should bear in mind that while we are talking about people getting bonuses, there are also members of staff who will underperform in the performance management cycle.  When one puts in a performance management system, part of the target is to bring underperformers up and put performance improvement plans in place so that they get to a level at which they can adequately perform in the job they are doing without receiving any bonus payments.  There is a great deal of talk about bonuses attached to performance management, but the tool of a high-performing utility, irrespective of whether staff receive bonuses, is the performance management regime and the honest conversations managers have with their staff to ensure they are motivated coming to work, know how to fit into the overall strategy of the organisation and can contribute positively on a daily basis.  That is what drives an organisation, because the fundamental value of an organisation is its people.  If they are motivated and going in the right direction, one will have a high-performing utility.</p></speech>

Okay, that is fine.  Irish Water was then to be financed by a loan from the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  That was probably done with the involvement of the NewERA body.  Did any of the organisations involved request details with regard to what was being done or did Irish Water have full control, without any political oversight, at that stage?  From what I can gather, Bord G&aacute;is was involved on the expenditure side and the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and NewERA both had roles.  We are now hearing that the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources had a role and that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform also had one, possibly in respect of bonuses.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund provided the bulk of the funding.  It is a subsidiary of the National Treasury Management Agency which, being the parent company, undoubtedly had to approve the allocation of such funding.  Irish Water and the Commission for Energy Regulation were involved.  We are now hearing that the Minister for Finance is going to make a payment in 2014.  I count ten public bodies or entities which played a role or were involved somewhere along the line regarding the set-up costs relating to Irish Water.  This is a classic case of everyone and no one being responsible.  It is no wonder the committee is discussing this matter.  The more inquiries we make, the larger the circle becomes.

Obviously a number of bodies are involved in the establishment as part of the approvals process and as part of the entire process we set out under No. 4 in our presentation yesterday.  The intention is that in the context of the organisation as it has been established - it took over its responsibilities on 1 January - and with the completion of the programme which will gradually be winding down, with the very last component dealt with in the first quarter of 2015, there will be a very clear line of sight to Irish Water in terms of its expenditure and its accountability for any funds it receives.</p></speech>

I accept that when it gets up and running, Irish Water will probably be an efficient organisation.  I will put questions to the Commission for Energy Regulation on that matter in a moment.  I count some 12 organisations or entities that played a role in the establishment of Irish Water but I am sure there are more.  There is something wrong with our system if it takes that level of involvement to get an organisation up and running.</p><p>  I wish to deal now with what Irish Water will be doing in 2014.  What will be its income for this year?  Since 1 January, all commercial water rates payable by schools, hospitals, voluntary organisations, shops, farmers, businesses, etc., are payable to the company.  I presume that payments in respect of the bills that will be issued this year will be made to Irish Water.  Will Mr. Tierney confirm that those payments will be made to the company during 2014?</p></speech>

It is important that the public understands that Irish Water is already in business.

Will Mr. Tierney confirm - perhaps those from the Commission for Energy Regulation will also comment on this matter - that Irish Water will be charging people for water delivered to their homes?  Will it be charging in respect of wastewater coming out of their homes?  Local authorities currently charge for water in and water out.  Obviously, Irish Water is already receiving an income for providing water in and water out to commercial customers.  Will it also be charging domestic users in this way?</p></speech>

I am intrigued by the fact that Irish Water already has 200,000 paying customers and that an official regulator has not yet been appointed.  A system is up and running and charges are being levied on businesses throughout Ireland.  In the past there were instances of regulators being asleep on the job.  I am very concerned that the Commission for Energy Regulation is being brought on board so late in the day that it will be obliged to pay catch-up from the outset.  Irish Water is already up and running and the commission is talking about engaging in a consultation process in May and June with a view to putting a charging scheme in place by August, some eight months after Irish Water began charging customers.  What is Mr. McGowan's view on this matter?  There is no regulator in place for the existing 200,000 customers of Irish Water.</p></speech>

Rather, it is the fault of the Oireachtas.  I accept that.  As we are all aware, the charges levied by local authorities for water services vary.  Will there be a uniform charge - similar to those levied by the ESB or Eircom for the services they provide - for water services or will there be different charges for every county?</p></speech>

Mr. Tierney could say a customer has not been disconnected.  I wish to make the situation clear.  It is established local authority practice that water cannot be cut off.  When people do not pay their bills the local authorities put a restrictor on the pipe.  Mr. Tierney knows that very well.  He is in the local government area.  He has a good history.  I do not wish to knock him.  My questions relate to Irish Water.  Currently local authorities put restrictors on the pipes and one can only get a drop of water.  It allows local authorities to say people have not been cut off.  It is a legal loophole.  Will Irish Water adopt such a legal loophole?</p></speech>

I will be brief.  Let us take the last three charges that were introduced in this country, including the property tax.  Up to 91% of people have paid.  The majority of people pay and they want to see that those who do not pay are penalised.  If affordability mechanisms are built into the system, they do not want to see people being allowed not to pay when they are willing to pay.  That is common in every charging system and ensures the overall cost of the water is kept down for all those who do pay.</p></speech>

While I intend to question Mr. Barry on other matters after other speakers have finished, the fact is that because the witnesses state it went to tender and to public procurement and was advertised, as is expected of the entity, everyone assumes this refers to the here and now, and that it did so as a new entity.  However, Irish Water did not do this as a new entity.  This is one example in which the contract went to tender four years ago and the entity is locked into that service, in this case from Deloitte.  It will be four years old, because Irish Water got an extension, and it has not tested the market again separately with regard to Irish Water, to ascertain whether a reduced price could be obtained or whether someone was doing this for a better price.  Mr. Barry cannot tell me how much it cost, that is, how much Deloitte charges.  Surely that is a major cost?  It is a new cost and Mr. Barry should know it off the top of his head.  He has all the other figures to hand.</p></speech>

The rationale for making Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann the parent company for this new public utility was on the basis of the expertise, standing and so on of that organisation as an established and highly successful utility.  Mr. Tierney gave a rationale for the use of these services or this consultancy expertise and cited the writing of programmes.  If I have understood him correctly, he has characterised these not so much as expenditure but as investment in assets - almost like a capital item - and I will return to that at the moment.  Members do not have the opportunity, because time does not permit, to go through each of the work lots but I draw his attention to what I believe to be lot No. 4, although I could be wrong.  It deals with the issue of customer engagement and brand development and I understand that Ernst &amp;amp; Young were contracted in for the princely sum of more than &euro;4 million to do I am not sure what, in respect of customer engagement and brand development.  I certainly would like Mr. Tierney to enlighten me as to what was that particular piece of work.</p></speech>

I want him to explain how anyone could justify the expenditure of &euro;4 million on brand development for an item such as water by a organisation that is in a monopoly position.  I also want him to enlighten the committee as to what precisely was or might be the customer engagement.  Moreover, given that Irish Water had its parent company, Bord G&aacute;is Energy at its back, why in this particular instance was it necessary to buy in these services, whatever they were?</p></speech>

We were asked to set up a highly complex and challenging project.  Last night, I mentioned our project initiation document, PID.  We created 17 subprojects to deliver the ultimate goal of setting up utility and so we have 17 different projects within the programme.  That probably is not mentioned here but it is in the PID, which we will make available to the committee if it so wishes.  One key element in that is to make sure there is proper integration across all those projects, that they all are working on the same timelines and towards achieving the same aims and that there is proper integration against all the different activities that are going on.  I am unsure whether the Deputy got the description of the scope of lot No.4, but it is to provide integrated programme management across business capability, an integrated operating model and enabling solution.  It oversees the customer work and asset management to support service capability development and IT infrastructure projects.  Essentially, it is providing an overall management approach and discipline to those particular programmes.  I cannot stress enough that the complexity of it, with 17 projects operating on a timeline of approximately 12 months, takes a lot of integrated management.</p></speech>

Mr. Barry has now stated this repeatedly at this meeting and I respectfully ask him not to repeat it, as members have heard that message.</p></speech>

I note there is another reference in another lot to talent management and recruitment strategies.  These are basic human resources competencies and as of yet, I have not heard an explanation from any of the witnesses that explains to me or the public how it is that those competencies and skills were not already within Bord G&aacute;is Energy and the approximately 50 people of expertise who, the witnesses tell us, were dedicated to this project.

This is not a normal situation and this is a start-up.  If, for example, one takes the timescale, we were endeavouring to bring in more than 300 staff members in the space of six months, which is an enormous undertaking.  It would not be available to an organisation the size of Bord G&aacute;is or any similarly-sized organisation to do that out of the norm.  One had to bring in additional resourcing to do this.  I will get the exact brand figure for the Deputy and although I do not have to hand that level of detail in respect of the breakdown of some of these, I am happy to provide that.</p></speech>

There are two aspects to the organisation, in that there is the operational piece, the revenue piece of the organisation in terms of the operation of the organisation.  In that regard, we will keep the expenditure on consultants - in the understood description of consultants in terms of needing reports or anything like that - to the absolute minimum.</p> <p>Because of the scale of some of the projects that one will be doing, and one would not necessarily carry that on an ongoing basis, one will still need engineering expertise brought in to do a lot of work on the capital programme.  That is separate - &euro;240 million from the Government and &euro;70 million - and also utilising the capital office engineering staff in the local authorities.</p></speech>

We need to step our way through it.  I sense a little evasiveness here and I do not want that to happen because we need to be clear.  Can I surmise that, by March 2013, the report on the lots and their value was received?  I presume it listed the successful tenderers and so on.  In March 2013, the Department knew that &euro;50 million was the cost - the quantum - of moneys in respect of external consultants.  Would that be fair to say?</p></speech>

That was our understanding.  We understood those to be the ceilings on the costs.  If, for example, local authority resources or skills appeared subsequently, it was a question of not having to draw down the full amount of the contract.  That was our understanding.  We interpreted it as a ceiling on the costs.</p><p>  As the Secretary General said, we monitored the expenditure against the overall classes of expenditure on an ongoing basis, so at any point in time we would not have known the figure in question.  At the end of December 2013 we would have been due to get a report which would have told us the overall expenditure, but the expenditure of &euro;50 million out of the &euro;100 million would not have been known.  The overall magnitude of the expenditure would have been known.</p></speech>

Ms Graham has clarified one point for me.  By March 2013 - last March - we knew we were looking at &euro;50 million, albeit a ceiling, in respect of outside consultancy.  The Department went to the trouble of communicating with the organisation to get clarification <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>flexibilities and so on.  Ms Graham understands that this is a ceiling amount; this is what she is telling us.  It is all entirely reasonable from her point of view, but she stated that subsequently the Department satisfied itself with the global figure.  Would it not have gone back and asked whether the figure turned out to be a ceiling?</p></speech>

Therefore, we were engaged during the latter part of 2013 in preparing a range of documentation and engagement which would lead into the examination by the regulator.  That included contacting the regulator on submissions it would require in order to look at these costs and ensure efficient expenditure.  In other words, we had set up a regime to ensure the protections were in place, and then it was to be validated by the regulator.  Then, when the statute was in place, when we had clarification on what questions we wanted to ask the regulator to answer for the Minister, we sought advice on that basis.</p></speech>

Meanwhile, back at the ranch, Members of the Oireachtas are asking questions, naturally enough, because that is their job.  A number of these questions were asked of the Minister and found their way to Ms Tallon&rsquo;s Department.  The answers that come back are in the category of non-answers.  The Department knows the Oireachtas has an appetite for establishing what is going on.  The Department has its own procedures in place and is tracking things, in a manner of speaking.  The most astounding thing is that the Minister knew nothing at all about this.  In March 2013, whether the Department believed the figure was a ceiling or otherwise, it knew that the figure was somewhere in the region of &euro;50 million.  The Minister knew nothing about that.  It is now January 2014 and it seems the Minister had to hear the figure on RTE courtesy of Sean O&rsquo;Rourke.  Could Ms Tallon explain to me how her Minister knew nothing about this?</p></speech>

Our Minister was then involved in the question of the NPRF loan and the assessment of that during the following year.  Our Minister was aware of NewERA involvement in the assessment.  Our Minister received a submission from us and sought agreement in relation to the approval of that loan from other concerned Ministers, namely, the Minister for Finance, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Deputy must bear in mind the context.  The management of the funding for Irish Water was one part of a very large project.  That very large project was being overviewed by the Government and Ministers on a regular basis.  There were seven or eight different areas over the course of the period from the end of 2011 through 2012 and 2013 in respect of which submissions went to Government, and there are Government decisions on aspects of the Irish Water programme, be it legislation-----</p></speech>

The dynamic was to ensure it was as efficiently and effectively managed and that the right balance was achieved between resources available in the organisation and external resources.  The key from the overall funding model - as the Deputy said this is what the customer will face - was to see what the overall costs were to make the political system and the Government aware there were costs with an external component.

I believe it stretches all credibility to suggest the Minister had all this information on a project such as this, given the Department&rsquo;s antennae were up with respect to the use of external consultants, parliamentary questions were asked about this by Oireachtas Members but deliberately not answered, with all due respect, and the Minister did not think he should ask for that information.

The witnesses have gone over it a fair bit.  One point in the regulator's presentation says that the report that was carried out in October and November 2013 found that most costs appeared reasonable at a high level but that further detailed analysis was needed to confirm this.  The words "most costs" appeared but the only cost that stood out is way out of kilter.</p></speech>

When we say "most costs", that did not mean that the remaining costs were not reasonable.  It was just that given the fact that this was a high-level analysis carried out over short duration, we could not be categorical around all of these costs.  We did not necessarily identify any particular cost that was completely, to use a phrase, "off the wall".  What we identified was that most of the costs appeared reasonable and could deliver consumer benefit but that a full detailed analysis was required.</p></speech>

By line item level, I mean customer billing, customer service and other line items in terms of establishing the business.  Over a couple of meetings, we would have discussed that and ultimately, formed a view as to whether or not those costs were reasonable and could deliver benefit.  Again, I stress that this was necessarily high level given the short time-frame over which it was carried out, which was why it came with the caveat that they appeared reasonable but that a further analysis was required.  Given that we have been getting the functions appropriate to economic regulation in terms of looking at water charges and water charges structures, we are now in a position to carry out that full analysis.</p></speech>

We will carry out an initial analysis of that and that then goes out for public consultation.  Following the public consultation, we will make a determination that will be published in terms of what we feel the efficient costs are, the overall structure of charges and, ultimately, what the water charge will be.  It is a full consultative process that we would normally carry out in terms of a revenue control in respect of the utilities we regulate such as gas and electricity.</p></speech>

Mr. Tierney and his colleagues had a comprehensive discussion with the Joint Committee on the Environment, Community and Local Government yesterday but today's meeting has helped me to understand the interactions between the three bodies, who is accountable and who knew what and when.  In an era when we are eager to provide transparency to our constituents and the taxpayer, that is beneficial.</p><p>  I am delighted that the Commission for Energy Regulation is represented because, with no disrespect for the work it does, it is probably one of the lesser known organisations from the consumer's point of view.  However, it is about to take on an important role in this project and we are going to get to know it very well.  Mr. McGowan referred to the public consultation to be held in April on structures and customer protection issues and the further consultation in June on the level of water charges.  I ask him to explain what the consultation process will look like and what people can expect from it.  To be blunt, will it be meaningful consultation?</p></speech>

I hope our track record stands of consultation processes which set out options and ask questions, and of genuinely taking on board the feedback that we receive.  We intend to break the overall consultation into chunks.  The consultation in April will be about the form that charges take rather than the amount that would attach to them.  It will ask how charges should be structured for those who are metered and those who are not metered.  In June we will consider revenue requirements, that is, the amount of money needing to be recovered.  We will bring all of this together in the decision on the structures and charges to be applied.</p></speech>

The word "consultant" has been bandied around.  It is the "c" word - people have a different conception of what a consultant does, in terms of writing reports as opposed to providing an asset.  When the Department was defining the ceiling for external services, did it consider these as consultants?  Was that the phraseology used in the Department?</p></speech>

It would be fairer to say that the terminology used was "external service provision".  We tend to think in terms of service providers.  We originally had a consultancy firm, PricewaterhouseCoopers, examine whether a national water utility should be established.  Typically Departments use consultants for specialised work.  We expect that some of this kind of consultancy function would inevitably be required for the work that Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water was doing.  We largely understand that much of this involved once-off costs for setting up the kinds of systems needed for a national operation that would last for perhaps 15 or 20 years.</p></speech>

As the Secretary General noted, there are 13 work streams.  We were meeting regularly with local authorities, Bord G&aacute;is and Irish Water through these.  We could see the output of the ongoing work.  In terms of the work streams, in any area of the organisation, such as the capital programme and the operations dealing with service level agreements, the work would have been led by Bord G&aacute;is people and subsequently Irish Water but it was supported in different areas by external support.  It was only a question of going to the resource, which was a Bord G&aacute;is resource, in Foley Street, where the programme was situated, to see people working on the systems and software development necessary to build the utility.  In addition to examining budgets and programme initiation documents and activities we were highly engaged at a top level work stream in observing how all the pieces were coming together to deliver the utility on time and within the budget that had been set.</p></speech>

We were satisfied with the level of activities and were given robust arguments around the use of external resources.  It was an evolving position because during that time the arrangements with local authorities were being established.  We were in negotiations with the unions around seconding local authority staff in.  Our agreement was with the proviso that these things were used.  There was never any doubt that where existing resources could be used instead of external resources they would be.  We were satisfied at the activity levels and the costs associated with them.  In procurements that were being advertised we were being given sight of the scope before, so that was how we felt the language in the scope of works, as the Secretary General said earlier, perhaps reflects that it would be made clear that this would be supplemental to any resources, and that would have been done.  There was nothing in what we produced that in any way undermined the robustness of the budget that was produced.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General has a role when Exchequer resources are going in from the departmental Vote or from central funds.

That would be very closely monitored.  Generally that tends to pull the performance level up.  If not, we would probably put a second performance improvement plan in place.  Hopefully that would work and in my experience it has.</p></speech>

Abracadabra - they won the tenders.  Will Mr. Barry explain this to me?  These are the guys who won all the tenders from the Government on banking and got it all wrong.  Ernst &amp;amp; Young cost the State a fortune by not warning it about Anglo Irish Bank.  All the usual suspects have turned up to win the tenders again.  How does this happen?</p></speech>

I believe we got good value for money.  The reason the Deputy sees such a high legal bill from Goodbody is that we had legal sitting all over the tender process to be sure we were compliant, that the process was fair and that we got the best result for the establishment costs.</p></speech>

Mr. McGowan will state that he did not have time, but &euro;50 million is a figure which would have stood out, and has stood out since it was brought to public attention.

As the managing director has described, the attitude of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is that as far as bonuses are concerned the Minister has written to line Ministers asking individual Ministers to bring to the attention of the various agencies the need to have regard to pay policy.  The Minister, in approving the remuneration of the managing director, did not include provision for a bonus arrangement for the managing director.</p></speech>

In terms of water conservation, for example, the percentage of capital investment that modern utilities make over a decade in pipe renewal in order to achieve low leakage levels is much more significant than what we have had the capacity to do with Exchequer resources.  The premise of establishing Irish Water is to provide a regulated utility with access to capital markets, allowing capital investment to be doubled and greater operational efficiency so that we might tackle leakages and infrastructural deficiencies.

The practice has been that this committee cannot follow all of the money allocated to local government through our system.  There is a type of mini turf war going on on the side for local government to retain the audit services and not use the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, for what reason I do not know.</p><p>  For example, where money is allocated by the Department of Education and Skills to one of the commercial semi-State companies, we cannot follow that either, or we can with great difficulty.  I was hoping that there would be fresh thinking in this regard by the Departments of Public Expenditure and Reform and Environment, Community and Local Government that would allow the Comptroller and Auditor General to at least follow the taxpayers' money.  Once the Comptroller and Auditor General is involved we can then ask for a value for money report on all of what is going on.  We cannot do that now.  An issue for consideration by this committee will be whether or not to recommend that there be some input from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office in relation to this matter.  </p><p>  My understanding is that the regulator will assess whether the investment is worthy of being included as consideration for an increase in the rate.  If Irish Water invests wisely and such investment is viewed by the regulator as a wise investment, he will allow that to be included and the rate per household or per litre will increase.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

A further &euro;898 million was invested in infrastructure and the Environmental Protection Agency decided there was no benefit whatever in terms of water quality.

The CER will do a full review, but some costs have yet to be incurred.  Advice came back to the Minister that a short review could be done in that time but there needed to be a more in-depth consideration.  We have put in an arrangement which involves Irish Water expanding the data on the expenditure versus budget with regard to future commitments.  With that we can assess whether it will meet the tests that the regulator will want to see in terms of reasonableness of cost and value for money to the customer.  Essentially, a panel will review the cost commitments for the period immediately ahead in advance of the consultation that the regulator has described, and that panel includes the CER in an advisory role and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It is chaired by ourselves and also includes NewERA.</p></speech>

We are dealing with taxpayers' money.  Do the witnesses agree that perhaps it is time to ask the Comptroller and Auditor General to do a value-for-money audit on all of what has happened to date?

There would be nothing to worry about.  I am worried because it is taxpayers' money and it is a huge amount of money to pay for consultants.  The direct answers regarding the assets that were acquired for that &euro;50 million must be stated clearly.  The explanations asked for in respect of a spend of &euro;6 million on due diligence or &euro;4 million on other works must be given.  What is happening here is that there is a passing of the parcel.  It goes around the house and whoever is holding it last must explain it.  That is what appears to be happening to the taxpayer.</p><p>  What I am trying to get from you is a sense of urgency about protecting that money and understanding how it is spent.  That is a reasonable thing to ask.  I am not creating any doubt, Mr. McGowan, about your office, I am just saying that the public conversation about this often happens in this room through the Committee of Public Accounts and we are not part of it, yet it is taxpayers' money.  The Comptroller and Auditor General's office should be used.  He is the chief financial officer of the State.  I will not rest easy until that matter is cleared up.  Using terms for how to describe this money and putting generalities around it is not satisfactory.  The public sees &euro;150 million.  It sees money coming from the National Pensions Reserve Fund, local government and from the household charge.  It is taxpayers' money, and I do not have any other way to describe it.  I will not rest easy until such time as we have some input from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Indeed, that is my view on the Department as well, Ms Tallon, as you know.</p></speech>

It is a State body that happens to be a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is.  It is given, one could say, something from the State; it is State-owned.  It is different.</p><p> The question I am asking, Mr. Tierney, is this: in the current climate, are these bonuses set in stone?  Can they be re-examined at this moment in time?</p><p> Mr. Barry mentioned a figure of 10%, which seems quite high.  If you said to the ordinary person who is out there at the moment that he or she would get a 10% wage increase, which is what it would equate to, he or she would say it was unrealistic.  Many small SMEs around the country would not be able to afford it.  When one sits back and thinks about a 10% increase one realises that it is a very high figure in the current climate.  You might just tell me, Mr. Tierney, where it stands contractually.</p></speech>

No average has been established, and there are different averages that will work out across the pay bands in Irish Water.  As I pointed out earlier, this is about a performance piece to create the high-performance utility model for which we were set up.  We have adopted the existing pay model within the company and that is going to be implemented.  It was done in the context of two significant issues: the need to bring about reductions and efficiencies over time by moving away from an incremental-based system - there has been a lot of debate about the value of such systems - and also a pay freeze.</p></speech>

First, I will outline what is the Irish Forest and Forestry Products Association, IFFPA.  This is an organisation within IBEC that represents the entire industry supply chain from the nursery through to the timber processing sector.  There are 27 members in the sector.  We are the only organisation that produces a review of the forestry sector every year, and a copy of that has been sent to everybody.  It essentially provides the statistics of the sector in the previous year.  It informs us as to what we want to do in the next year.<br /><b></b>I will outline some facts about Irish forestry for members who may not be familiar with the sector.  Forestry takes up 10.5% of Ireland's area, as documented by imaging published last week by the forest service.  There are over 20,000 forest owners in Ireland, with the vast majority of them farmers.  The sector contributes 1.3% of GDP, or &euro;2.2 billion on an annual basis, and last year there were &euro;555 million in exports.  There are 12,000 jobs in the sector, taking in everything from the nursery to processing sectors, along with supporting elements.  The trees in Ireland grow at the fastest rate in Europe, so there is a competitive advantage in that respect.<br />Right now, we are at a critical stage in the sector as over the past 25 years there has been much planting, going from 6% in the late 1980s to 10.5% now.  The vast majority of the planting has occurred in the private sector by farmers and investors.  We are now coming to the stage where the industry is poised to start producing timber.  Last year we produced just under 400,000 tonnes in the private sector, with Coillte producing the remaining 2.5 million tonnes approximately.  Over the next decade, the private sector will increase ten-fold in timber production, so the Forestry Bill is critical to the development of the sector.  It is very important to us that the Bill can facilitate timber production and afforestation, which has sadly not achieved targets in the past number of years for various reasons.<br />I will turn to aspects of the Forestry Bill.  IFFPA has considered a number of areas and we have some issues relating to the development of the industry, costs and the regulatory burden that we have seen coming into the Bill.  On the development of the sector, the Bill is far too focused on enforcement, with excessive measures having the potential to hamper growth in the sector.  The requirement to replant, for example, is already hampering afforestation, and many farmers will not plant on land if they know it must stay as forestry and there are no options.  The vast majority of these farmers will always keep forestry but if they are stuck with the option, they may not pursue that avenue.  That is an impediment to afforestation.<br />The enforcement provisions within the Bill are draconian and overbearing.  A colleague once told me that we are only dealing with trees and not gold bullion, and it is not critical to have many control measures in the sector.  There are powers to be confirmed on officers of the State which will be hard on the sector; for example, there are powers within the Bill to allow an officer of the State to enter into lands and business premises without warrants.  That overbearing action will increase risk and the costs in the sector.  With regard to development of the sector, we recommend that the Bill's enforcement provisions be redrafted with a more proportionate response.  As it stands, the Bill will discourage investment in the supply chain.<br />I can give an example in the proposed section 32 of the Bill.</p> <p>Section 32 of the Bill provides that where a grant has been paid to any person under the legislation and that person is in breach of one or more conditions, &quot;the Minister may recover such grant as if it were a simple contract debt and, notwithstanding the Statute of Limitations, may institute proceedings for such recovery within 20 years of the date of the breach&quot;.  That is utterly ridiculous.  One could possibly go along for 20 years like that.  That measure, in itself, creates risk not just for the forest owner, but also for the forest manager.  That risk must be built into the management processes of those businesses and therefore increases costs, because they must comply.  We think the replanting obligation should be removed, because it hampers afforestation in the sector.  As I said earlier, many farmers will not plant because of it.<br />Moving to the regulatory burden, I will focus on the felling licence system.  We do not believe that what is proposed goes far enough in facilitating the sector.  The amount of timber production from the private sector will increase nearly tenfold in the next decade.  The Forest Service already cannot handle the felling licences it has, and that is for a far less amount of cubic metres per hectare per year.  The system being proposed is over-burdensome and will not contribute to allowing the sector to grow as it must grow.  The Bill envisages a requirement for management plans.  While we would welcome management plans in principle, we do not believe they should be required for every plantation in the country.  Where management plans are required, they should be integrated into the felling licence system.  When one submits one's management plan, one should get one's felling licence.  It should not be a separate system.  The Bill does not integrate those two elements.<br />The power of the Minister to put burdens on people's folios where there is a replanting obligation on those folios is hugely cumbersome and expensive both for the landowner and for the State to administer it.  That element has the potential to get completely out of control.<br />I will deal with the increased costs.  The Bill states that there will be little or no increase in costs to the State or to business.  We could not disagree with this more.  The increased regulations required in the Bill will increase costs <i>de facto</i>.  The State does not have the resources to administer the Bill as it is envisaged.  It will have to increase its manpower dramatically.  In addition, the requirements on forest owners to supply information, do management plans and the other requirements of the Bill will increase costs for them.  It will also increase risk for them and, as a result, they will make different decisions.  The Bill should be about facilitating the sector to grow, not putting barriers and red tape in front of forest owners and the forest industry.<br />There is another section of the Bill on fees, which is basically part of the increased costs.  The Bill envisages fees.  Again, this goes against what the preamble to the Bill talks about in respect of no increased costs to the sector.  The Bill envisages that the Minister should be able to apply fees to felling licences, grant applications and other services for which the forest service wishes to charge.  We believe that provision should be removed because even if it is left in the Bill without applying any fees, it increases risk for investors.  They will wonder what fees will be imposed in the future and, if a fee is introduced now, how much more will that cost in the future.  We need only look at prescription charges in the past.  That, in itself, is an impediment to newcomers into the sector, in particular, and is extremely unfair on those who invested in forestry in the past in the expectation that they would not have to pay fees.<br />I have been in the business for approximately 20 years, and it is a brilliant business.  It is a sector I love.  I dream about it almost every night, to be honest.  What I see now is a critical stage in its development and the Bill must be right to help it grow and create jobs for Ireland, especially in rural areas where job creation in other sectors just does not exist.  The plea we make on this Bill is that it must focus on what the sector needs to grow and create jobs and wealth for Ireland.</p></speech>

We represent the lion's share of the sawmilling sector on the island of Ireland.  Approximately 95% of all the sawlogs in Ireland would be processed by our members.</p><p>  I thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to address the committee on matters of such fundamental importance to Ireland's sawmilling sector.  We have provided the committee with three separate but distinct submissions.  What they all have in common is a plea for certainty about the future of our sector.  In the absence of Government decisions, the forest and forest products sectors are operating in a total policy vacuum.  As a consequence people are afraid to invest, jobs are at risk and there is no sense of a collaborative approach across the sector.  A cloud of uncertainty hangs over one of the country's most promising indigenous sectors, one that has huge untapped potential.</p><p>  Coillte has been the subject of internal and external reviews for the best part of four years.  It is no wonder that, in the absence of a clear mandate, it is in a state of limbo.  The proposed sale of its harvesting rights destabilised the timber processing sector for the best part of a year, due to continuing uncertainty about the Government's decision.  Once the Government's decision on harvesting rights was announced, a merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na was mooted.  More uncertainty has resulted as the Government has yet to pronounce on the recommendations of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Simon Coveney, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte, nor has the long-awaited report of the forest policy review group been published.</p><p>  The Irish Timber Council, ITC, finds it quite extraordinary that decisions are being taken behind closed doors with little or no regard to the views of the industry's stakeholders.  For example, the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, will not meet with us on the proposed merger until after the Government's decision.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, has to date not accepted our repeated requests for a meeting to discuss the many issues facing the sawmill sector.  The forest and forest products sectors and, indeed, individual companies have important views to communicate as interested parties regarding the proposed merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na, among other matters.  We are especially appreciative of being given the opportunity of appearing before the committee today.</p><p>  I will not go through the detail of our submissions as I and my colleagues can discuss any of the issues during the question and answer session and, indeed, on a one-to-one basis.  However, I will highlight the main points of each submission and where we in the ITC believe the committee can assist us.  Our views on the proposed merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na are, in summary, as follows.  We believe Coillte should progressively divest itself of all non-core activities and assets, especially its board mills, and concentrate instead on delivering an aggressive afforestation programme as a national strategic priority.  We want a strong, resourceful and well-managed Coillte to remain as a stand-alone State forest company with a clear commercial mandate to supply the timber processing sector with a sustainable supply of sawlog on the open market at transparent prices.  We also believe there is no commercial justification for a public entity to engage in harvesting and associated haulage activity.  Sawmills should be allowed to harvest and transport what they purchase from Coillte.  On the other hand, Coillte will have a crucial and central role to play in the delivery of many of the recommendations set out in the draft report of the forest policy review group.  The Government as a matter of top priority must give Coillte a clear mandate and redefine its remit in the context of the decisions taken in respect of the forest policy review group.</p><p>  Should the Government approve a full or partial merger, we wish to see the evidence that justifies such a radical departure.</p> <p>In particular, we want sight of the evidence on which the decision is based.</p><p> We have identified significant potential problems.  For example, conflicts of interest as regards the supply of wood biomass to Bord na M&oacute;na&rsquo;s bio-energy plants and the impact that a restricted supply of sawlog could have on prices.  I hope the Government will publish the cost benefit analysis and regulatory impact assessment that forms the basis of the memorandum for Government.  We also expect the Government to confirm that the sale of harvesting rights is off the table once and for all.</p><p> The extensive stakeholder consultations that have informed the preparation of the report of the forest policy review group all share a common theme - Ireland has the capacity to grow its forest and forest products sector.  We all want additional afforestation.  The ITC believes the proposed target of 15,000 hectares is not enough and there is sufficient land available to sustain much higher afforestation levels.</p><p> We also need to restore a level of trust in the sector.  Coillte needs to realise that the current opaque practices of price determination must stop.  We need transparency in the pricing of sawlog and pulpwood supplies that are our critical raw material.</p><p> The State&rsquo;s forest company must above all else support its key customers for the common good and not work against their interests.  A crucial issue for us is a clear policy statement that the use and diversion of Coillte&rsquo;s wood biomass for bio-energy plants must not be at the expense of the security of supply for the sawmill sector.  We also believe that an assessment needs to be carried out on the feasibility of establishing an independent regulator for the sector.  In addition, the report should at least acknowledge the EU&rsquo;s forest strategy and explain how Ireland&rsquo;s proposed strategy fits with what is considered best practice at European level.</p><p> Once the report is published, and to give it credibility, I hope that the Minister will provide a detailed implementation plan with a clear allocation of responsibilities and budgets.  A strategy document without a well resourced implementation plan is practically worthless.  The Irish Timber Council wants to play a full part in securing the rapid delivery of the report of the forest policy review group and expects to have representation on the proposed forest council and all of the relevant sub-committees.</p><p> In the middle of all this uncertainty sits the Forestry Bill.  Members of the committee have made significant statements about the Bill during the Second Stage debate.  The ITC&rsquo;s submission on the Bill was well received by the officials at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine with whom we had an opportunity to meet a while back.  We hope that the Minister will take on board the very many amendments that we have proposed.  In particular, it needs to be better aligned to the decisions that will be taken in the context of the report of the forest policy review group.  It needs to reflect whatever decision Government takes about Coillte.  It also needs to take into account many important protections and safeguards that are provided in similar legislation enacted in other jurisdictions.  Perhaps it major weakness is the absence of a regulatory impact assessment.  As Deputies and Senators will be aware, Cabinet guidelines dating from 2006 require all Ministers to carry out a detailed study of the impacts of all proposed legislation and the administrative burdens that will be imposed on business.</p><p> I shall finish my contribution on a positive note.  The Government wants companies to recruit and export more.  The sawmill sector is willing and able to expand its output and has the track record to prove that we have done so.  The Government attaches the highest importance to maintaining jobs in rural Ireland and the sawmill sector is one of the few indigenous sector capable of sustaining local employment.  The sawmill section has the track record to prove it also.  The Government wants a sustainable, competitive and modern forest and forest products sector.  Again, the sawmill sector has a proven record to show that it has delivered on same.  Provided that the right decisions are taken over the coming weeks, the sawmill sector for one is eager to engage with all of the stakeholders on what should be a clear and ambitious growth strategy for our businesses.</p><p> Finally, let there be no doubt that the two most important issues facing the sector at present are the proposed merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na and the log supply, both of which are inextricably linked.  I thank members for their attention. </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.874" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014011500005#H00300"><p>I welcome the members of the IFFPA and the Irish Timber Council and thank them for the efforts put into and nature of their submissions.</p><p>  The main issue is the Bill which needs a lot of work.  Before I get into that matter I must say that I totally oppose the merger of Bord na M&oacute;na and Coillte because they are like chalk and cheese and are incompatible.  A merger would create a huge monster that would not deliver any great efficiencies.  </p><p>  As has been pointed out, Coillte's main role is forestry and in my view it should remain that way.  I have no objection to Coillte lands being used for other purposes and we all agree to rural recreation, for example.  We also know that such lands are used for telephone masts and so on.  That is fair enough.  However, the main purpose of Coillte's business is to ensure that we have well managed forested areas and to provide sawlog to the industry.</p><p>  All of the industry players share the common aim of maintaining good forests, producing maximum value on the market, both at home and abroad, and to the highest standard possible in a good environmental condition.  It seems to me that there is a lack of consultation and the sequence in which we must work is out of kilter.  We have the Bill yet a decision has not been reached on the proposed merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na and we do not have the report from the forest policy review group.  Therefore, we are working in the wrong order.  </p><p>  There is another issue.  The Bill is all about regulation.  As pointed out in the submission by the Irish Timber Council, a regulatory impact assessment or analysis was meant to form part of the Bill but we do not have it at present.  There is a danger that the Bill will contain a great amount of over regulation.  </p><p>  A number of issues have been raised.  The concerns, if I have summarised them correctly, seem to be over regulation.  In other words, there will be a huge burden of regulation that will add cost to the industry - and this is where analysis comes in - that will not benefit the State or the public's interest commensurate with the amount of extra regulatory burden.</p><p>  The second issue of major concern is retrospection which is important.  In many cases the people who grow timber privately have borrowed money.  What happens if after ten, 12 or 20 years someone says that for the past 15 years, even though the planting, hectarage and everything was approved - and this happened in practice - but we now realise that we have made a mistake in some calculation when double checking the application and seek payments to be returned?  The recipients would then have to explain the situation to their bank manager.  When that happens in a number of cases the bank managers will get wary of lending money and will say that the sanction for forestry grants is not worth the paper that it is written on.  There is always a danger that after a long period has elapsed, and way beyond the normal Statute of Limitations, somebody could seek the money to be returned and a bank could be left short for the last five, six or seven years of the grant.  This is a value issue that needs to be teased out when we debate the Bill.</p><p>  I noticed a slight difference in the approach to fees adopted by the two organisations.  If I recall correctly, the IFFPA has opposed fees and the timber council seems to have said "maybe fees but."  I am interested to hear more clarification on the matter. </p><p>  Another issue is, if I understood it correctly, that the Minister has unspecified and wide powers to amend plans at any time.  He does not have to introduce regulations to do so and does not have to go through any procedure in the Houses.  I would like confirmation that I have grasped the matter correctly.  I am wary of such a provision.  All Ministers will assure one that they would not do certain things - which I do not doubt - but they will not be Ministers forever.</p> <p>The power remains so the issue is worthy of teasing out on Committee Stage.  In that regard, the Minister cannot change how things are done with felling licences and the rest without a transparent system of appeals.  Everyone has the opportunity to look at this.  One of the issues that strikes me is that appeals in forestry do not have the possibility of oral hearings.  We need to ensure a person appealing has access to transparent consideration and the chance to make the point.  It seems there are a whole lot of issues.  I am not sure we should go back to square 1 before we take the debate on Committee Stage and get a regulatory impact assessment.  We all agree the Bill should be in existence and no one argues with the principle of it but it could put a major administrative burden on small people and inhibit people from planting more timber unless there is full scrutiny of all provisions in the Bill.  Otherwise, the Bill might provide extra regulation without much gain.</p></speech>

With regard to Mr. Pat Glennon's presentation and the requests to meet the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, and the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, I think the refusals are deplorable.  There is an obligation on Ministers to meet representatives of sectors contributing to the economy of the country.  This is particularly true in respect of the contribution of 1.3% of total GDP and almost &euro;555 million in exports.  It was wrong that they were not afforded the opportunity to meet the Ministers.</p><p>  The witnesses made reference to officers of the State entering land or businesses to seize equipment and so forth.  It is very similar to what is happening in the farming sector, where officers of the State have unlimited power to enter land.  Does it require a warrant?  I have major concerns about that if it gives unrestricted powers to people to enter land and do what they believe needs to be done without the legal requirement of a warrant.</p><p>  The witnesses believe there is no commercial justification for public entities to engage in harvesting and associated haulage activities.  I assume they are referring to Coillte.  Why do the witnesses have a problem with that?  Some people think of Coillte becoming the incubator to supply the industry rather than the other way around.  Coillte has served us very well and we are delighted a State company will not be sold to private enterprise.  Across the political spectrum, we were concerned about that.</p><p>  The witnesses make reference to forestry land being replanted as it is felled.  The Bill envisages the Minister prescribing species to be planted on such land.  Why do the witnesses have a problem with that?  One would assume the provision is not definitive in that the Minister may prescribe it.</p><p>  The witnesses referred to a 20-year horizon that would carry over if the entity is sold from one company to another.  That is a serious issue and it penalises the recipient for the wrongs of the previous owner.  I have looked at the recommendations made by the witnesses and given them full consideration.  We will have a meeting in the coming weeks on this point.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations and I would appreciate replies to my questions.</p></speech>

I am very concerned about burden on the folio for private farmers planting land who, when they take the first crop away, decide to use the land for farming purposes.  They should be given that right because most will stay with forestry.  I do not agree with putting a burden on farmers or penalising them for stopping forestry.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v about the recreational aspect of Coillte lands, which is important.  We can develop it without damaging the crop or affecting it.  It will add more to tourism.  Coillte are leaving quite a bit of land fallow and not replanting it.  In the area I come from, three or four large parcels of land are being left fallow.  It is a great loss.  For environmental purposes, Coillte will argue it is good but the land was able to produce a good crop of timber over the past 20 or 30 years and it is a pity to see it felled and just lying there.  That should not be allowed to happen.</p></speech>

I share the concern about Ministers not being available.  Perhaps the witnesses can afford some clarity about the reasons given.  Mr. Glennon said that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Rabbitte, will not meet them on the proposed merger.  Is that an interpretation or was it said by him in a letter?  Perhaps Mr Glennon can clarify.  The witnesses referred to meeting the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, and perhaps this was instead of the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  It is an important issue and we need to know more before we go further.</p><p>  Mr. Glennon's presentation gives the impression of a loss of trust in the Departments concerned.  Various observations are made, such as, "In addition, the report should at least acknowledge the EU&rsquo;s forest strategy" and "A strategy document without a well resourced implementation plan is practically worthless."  It seems Mr Glennon is suggesting these things might happen.  Am I reading it incorrectly that he has lost faith and lost trust in the Departments concerned?  Like others, I share the concern that we have policy review group activity, a Bill and a proposed merger.  Where they align and in what order they come is something we should take up.  There are many proposals for change occurring simultaneously.  They seem to provide some confusion.</p><p>  I am a small bit confused by Mr. Little's observations.  He laid out how well the sector is doing and we think that is a good thing, particularly for rural Ireland.</p> <p>The IFFPA goes on to suggest the Bill is too focused on enforcement and it talks about it being overbearing and draconian and that it will perhaps delay or stop investment.  It strikes me as a bit contradictory, where one has an industry that is doing well - the IFFPA talked about the potential within the industry - to state that this is draconian and overbearing.  Things are going well but we need some kind of regulation and perhaps the IFFPA's criticism of the regulation is over the top.  There will always be investors in a successful area and while some of the investors may change, not everybody will walk away, put down their tools and say "Enough already, this is too draconian".  I do not think the future of the timber industry is at risk in the way the IFFPA described because of regulation.  Private businesses always complain and lobby about regulation, as they should, but I wonder if the IFFPA has gone a bit too far in its description of that.</p><p> Things are going pretty well and there is potential.  I know the IFFPA is concerned to develop that, which it should be, and so are we.  However, I wonder if it has gone too far in regard to that kind of language.  It suggests, therefore, that it does not want regulation, which is probably not quite right in that we need regulation.  I am not an expert on regulation, or on regulation of the forestry industry, but I would be interested in the IFFPA's observations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.881" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1063" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014011500007#K00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  Like everybody else, I would be concerned if Ministers would not meet relevant bodies.  The Glennons are based in my constituency where I think they have access to anybody they like in terms of making their case.  I hope Ministers will meet people because it is important to have interaction where people are bringing forward proposals and that the people, who are stakeholders, get an opportunity to convey their viewpoint.  There may well be different viewpoints but distilled wisdom can bring forward something which is better from all parties concerned.  I hope that will be the way forward.<br />Regulation is important in the overall context but one of the problems in Ireland is that we suffer from a deficit of regulation.  There is never a half way measure in Ireland in terms of regulation.  We suffocate and have a surplus of regulation.  Trying to achieve a balance is important.  From a legal perspective, I am absolutely shocked the Statute of Limitations could be extended to 20 years.  There are many cases where it should be longer than, for example, three years in personal injuries cases or six years in civil contract cases.  People must prove special circumstances in very harrowing cases in order to get the Statute of Limitations extended.  To write 20 years into a Bill defies logic and belief.  I certainly concur that it is nonsensical.  A simple contract is six years.  The Statute of Limitations can be extended, for example, in cases of fraud and a court can find on that basis.  This is symptomatic of an over-bureaucratic input into something which requires regulation.  There must be rules and regulations.  <br />I have always had a big issue with forestry companies and I have had a go at Coillte over the years.  Very often people live on rural roads where there is forestry land and big juggernauts arrive to take out the forestry and the timber cuttings and thinnings.  Much damage is done to those roads that many people have to use.  Even from that perspective, I would like some regulation in that there would be a way to ensure local authorities get some recompense to repair those roads because people are living on them.  Going back over the years, including the years I spent on the local authority, I have always held that point of view, which I will not change.  As people know, I do not change.<br />It is important there is a co-ordinated policy.  What I have garnered from the IFFPA is that there is a kind of an <i>ad hoc</i>or stop-go situation in terms of the overall development of forestry.  It has advocated the sort of one-stop-shop forestry development agency which emanated from the forestry policy review group.  A proper forestry development authority with some teeth, some oversight, some coherence and underpinned by a proper strategy with proper funding bringing together all the relevant stakeholders has much merit.  From listening to Mr. Pat Glennon and Mr. Mike Glennon over the years, I know there is a significant deficit in terms of the various requirements and so on and that is why they are concerned about the proposed Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na merger and the impact that would have in terms of supply.  That is a big problem, apart from all the ancillary issues.  <br />How much of a deficit is there in terms of the requirements?  In other words, how much is imported to meet the current situation?  How much would that be accentuated by the proposed merger where much of the wood would be used to supplement the biomass requirements that would emerge as a result of any huge bioenergy division?<br />What success has the IFFPA achieved in terms of product innovation, market innovation and so on?  That is important in terms of generating jobs.  I subscribe to the idea that the IFFPA is important in rural areas, coming from a very rural area myself.  I know the importance of areas like Baronstown, Ballycorkey and places like that in the context of rural jobs.  What concerns me is that the programme for Government sets out an objective of 14,700 ha.  Over the past number of years, as far as I can make out, only about 45% of the target has been achieved.  Where are we going if we have set out a target of 14,700 ha?  I read some of the IFFPA's observations before Christmas that it is insufficient.  I think some have said it should be more than 20,000 ha.  I hope I have not misquoted them but they can correct the record.  If it is 20,000 ha and we are only planting 8,000 ha, we are not in the game at all.  Is that not the huge deficit in terms of the basic raw material - the supply necessary to achieve all the various hardwoods?  There has been some successes there.  I know Mr. Pat Glennon has had successes in terms of product innovation.  Masonite has also had successes.  Where does that leave it?  <br />From an environmental perspective, Irish forests have played a significant role in terms carbon savings and in achieving targets set out in the Kyoto Protocol.  We know the importance of forestry as a carbon sink and in dealing with the greenhouse gas emissions.  We have targets to meet in that regard and in terms of employment and innovation but we are still in a very scattered state.  In order to achieve all those targets, the sooner we get around to having a proper forestry development authority which focused on meeting those targets and is resourced, the better.  <br />Again, I welcome the witnesses.  I know the positive role they play and I will certainly do anything I can to advance the situation.  I will make certain views known in terms of meetings which should take place to ensure there is coherence.  People working together in a co-ordinated way can achieve much.  There is much to be achieved, in particular in rural areas, if we get this right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.882" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014011500007#K00300"><p>I welcome our guests.  It is opportune they are here to discuss this matter.  Over the past year, the discussions we had on Coillte played a significant role in the decision.  I would like to think the discussions today and those following them will play an important part in what may come out of them.  Like other speakers, I have concerns about the proposed merger mentioned in the earlier observations.</p> <p>The forestry industry plays a significant role in Ireland, especially rural Ireland, and 12,000 jobs are not to be sniffed at.  If foreign companies were coming to Ireland and creating 12,000 jobs, that would be the main item on the news.  It is important we sustain the jobs we have.</p><p> Mr. Glennon summed up the situation with his most recent observations.  There are a number of big issues, the main one being the log supply.  It is my understanding that a significant proportion of logs are imported from Scotland.  Those logs are imported at a lower cost than that of producing logs here.  That does not make sense.  If we can import raw materials at a lower cost than producing them ourselves, something is obviously wrong.  Do the witnesses have any further information on this?  That situation is not sustainable in the longer term.</p><p> The witnesses argued that there is no commercial justification for the public entity to engage in harvesting and associated haulage activities.  There has been much talk about a proposed significant investment in board plants in the country, particularly in the south east, and I ask the witnesses for their views on that.  Is there a justification for this?  If it does not happen, what will be the result?</p><p> It is important that certainty is created for the industry in the very near future.  A degree of certainty emanated from the final decision on harvesting rights announced last year.  We need to move on and put a timeframe in place for future plans.  Will there be a merger and what will be the consequences of that?  I have concerns about whether a merger is the right way to go.  I am not convinced that the two organisations are compatible.  That question must be teased out further before we move on.  To some extent, I agree with Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v that we may be putting the cart before the horse in these discussions.  These discussions should have taken place before the Bill was produced at the end of last year.  These discussions should have informed the preparation of the Bill rather than the Bill informing our discussions.  This meeting has been very interesting and the observations made have been valuable.  However, we need to hear more before we move on.</p></speech>

I apologise for having missed the introductory presentations but I heard some of them on the monitor and will read the full submissions later.  I agree with much of what the witnesses have said.  We should all share the common objective of having a comprehensive, coherent forest policy to develop the enormous potential of forestry.  I strongly endorse the call from the Irish Timber Council for clarity with regard to the question of the sale of the harvesting being off the table, fully and finally.  We seem to have achieved that but absolute clarity is important.  I also agree strongly with the argument for proper engagement with all the stakeholders.  It is very unfortunate that the Minister has refused to meet the organisations here today.  However, it is not just the Irish Timber Council and the IFFPA that are involved here.<br />As Deputy Deering has said, our approach is the wrong way around.  A point made to me by one of the forestry NGOs was that it is difficult to have a forestry Bill without the review of Coillte.  That review commenced but the report was never published.  That relates to the point about meeting the Government to discuss Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.  Coillte is the biggest owner of forests in the State by a long mile, and unless we know what is happening with and in Coillte, it is very difficult to develop a comprehensive and coherent policy.  All of the discussions and the reviews should have come prior to a Bill being presented to the D&aacute;il for a Second Stage debate, and I made that very point during the debate.  Perhaps the fact we are having these discussions now, prior to the Committee Stage debate, is an indication that the Government's attitude to this has changed somewhat.  At least we are having these discussions, and I hope all the necessary consultations take place.  I also hope we get the information we need about Coillte in terms of what is being proposed <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>Bord na M&oacute;na.  I share the concerns of the witnesses.  I agree there are potential problems with the proposed merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na in the context of conflicts of interest.  Given the outcry in the past week about lack of information on Irish Water and with the Government now back-tracking, I am glad to say, on the issue of freedom of information, would the witnesses endorse the call for Coillte to be subject to freedom of information requests?  It seems to me that it should be.  It is extraordinary that the biggest owner of forestry in the State is not subject to freedom of information requests.  There are serious questions to be answered about what goes on in Coillte.  We need a much greater level of transparency and accountability from that organisation.<br />I strongly endorse the point made regarding the need for an aggressive afforestation policy.  That is what Coillte should be about.  The target of 15,000 ha is not being achieved.  Even that target is not enough and we need to increase rapidly the amount of forested land for economic, environmental, natural resource and tourism reasons.  There is a huge, unrealised potential that must be developed.  The Bill is not specific enough in that regard.  Would the witnesses agree that there should be specific targets for afforestation in the Bill?  I believe we should have such targets in the legislation.  At present, it is very vague and ill-defined.  A lot seems to be left to the discretion of the Minister.  The witnesses are right to point to the very specific commitment to the stakeholders being involved in the committee that will oversee all this.  We need all the stakeholders to be involved and that should be defined more specifically in the Bill, as should afforestation targets.<br />While I agree with much of what the witnesses have said, I am concerned at their setting of sustainability against the imperative to develop a competitive and economically viable forestry sector.  I believe that is not a very good way to go because we should be trying to achieve both.  The policy of sustainability would be best underpinned by precisely what the witnesses are calling for, namely, aggressive afforestation.  That is sustainable forestry.  It is a mistake for the organisations present to get themselves into a battle with the environmentalists in trying to pursue their objectives.  We should have a united front on these issues in exactly the same way as we had a united front in the battle to stop the harvesting rights of Coillte being sold.  The economic potential of forestry is predicated on forestry being sustainable.</p> <p> There are serious detailed issues on what is an excessive burden on small private forest owners.  The suggestion of distinct types of licences, for example, a licence for clear-felling and a different licence for thinning, is a very interesting idea.  The clearing of a forest is very problematic and gives rise to replanting issues.  A small farmer who is thinning out the forest is in a different category as this has a lesser impact on the environment.  May I put it to the witnesses that they are being slightly confrontational with those who would be concerned about sustainability and proper regulation of the sector from an environmental point of view when what we should be looking for is a common viewpoint?</p><p> I have scanned through what has been said.  Will the witnesses comment on the question of species mix and developing a greater proportion of native forest species as distinct from Sitka spruce and other evergreens?  Do the witnesses think that species should be specified to increase significantly the percentage of native forest cover as part of the afforestation policy for which they are calling?</p></speech>

Deputy Ferris raised the issue of the representatives of the State needing a warrant to enter forestry lands and so on.  From my reading of the Bill, it would appear that the State's representatives can enter lands but a warrant will be required to enter a private dwelling.  They can go into a business premises and seize documents or computer records as they see fit to get to the bottom of whatever they are after.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris also questioned what "may prescribe" means in terms of the replanting of the forest after clear-felling.  While it states "may prescribe", what is prescribed is very specific and the Bill sets out species composition cultivation, species mix, landscaping issues and other matters.  In the neighbouring jurisdiction, the UK, there are detailed prescriptions being put into reforestation sites, so much so that the amount of productive forestry has dropped dramatically from one generation of forestry to the second generation of forestry, the amount of open spaces within the forest and so on.  While I do not have a major objection to that, I question giving the State the role of prescribing what is to be planted in the forest when a forest manager can do the same job equally as well.  We would have a problem of over-regulation in that area.</p><p>  The 20 year provision is written into the Bill.  The State may come back 20 years after planting and find a problem with the mapping.  A major issue in the sector is the issue of over-claims.  The forest service and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are re-examining all their old files, going back 22 years in some places, looking at the old six inch maps, and because they have new mapping technologies and a new map, they may decide there was an over-claim and request the return of money 20 years later.  That will mean a transfer of risk to the forest owner.  In transferring risk to forest owners, the buyers of forest, for example will perceive a risk as they do not know if the area will be changed by the forestry service at some point in the future because they have a new technology for mapping or whatever.  The owner needs to know that when he plants the land, that is the end of the story and he can move on.  We cannot do that under the current regulations.  That particular section of the Bill seems to enshrine the ability of the State to go back and check out anything, making discrepancies in the mapping the fault of the forest owner when the fault had arisen from the State's technology.  That is a significant issue and we are trying to tackle it with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine but we are not getting anywhere.  We need to put a limit on this.  We need to know that when an application for an afforestation grant is successful, the owner having submitted the map which the State digitised, that should be the end of the story.  At present, the Bill seems to enshrine the right of the State to go back and do whatever with the new technology, which is quite amazing.</p><p>  The burdens on folios was raised by Senator Comiskey.  The Bill envisages that the Minister will have the right to put a burden, a replanting obligation, on a folio.  With the expected level of clear-felling and so on in the next decade, a significant level of effort will be required to try to make that happen in the Land Registry.  The cost implications are very significant.  I do not think they truly understand the potential workload they are letting themselves in for because when the replanting obligation has been fulfilled, the burden will have to be removed from the folio.  It will be an enormous task.  That is another major issue.</p><p>  In the preamble to the Bill, it is stated that the proposed replanting order, which is a burden on the folio, is to help new forest owners see there is a replanting obligation on the folio.  That issue can be solved by the contractual obligations on solicitors to check out the law on forestry, and that the land must be replanted.  It does not need to be written on the folio, thereby creating the administrative burden that surrounds that.</p><p>  I have been practising forestry for 20 years and one issue that comes up among farmers is whether they have to replant.  When one tells them they have to replant, they are no longer interested.  They do not want to get involved.  The fact is that most of them will not bother to take land out of forestry because it is not economic to pull the stumps out and reseed the land and so on, but the fact is that once they replant, they must stick with forestry to the end of all time.  That discourages many people to plant land.  We see that as one of the main barriers to planting new land and to meeting the targets of 14,700 hectares in the programme for Government.  This Bill was first mooted ten years ago and the sector went to the then Government asking for the removal of that provision, but it would appear that request was ignored.  The original function of the replanting obligation was to prevent deforestation at a time when we had no forests back in the 1940s.  That is no longer the case.  We have 10.5% forest cover.  People want to plant forests and it is not really necessary to ensure they always maintain forestry on that land. </p><p>  Senator O'Keeffe raised the issue of over-regulation.  In my view there is a serious lack of trust between the sector and the State, which is evident in the Bill.  Our perception is that the State believes it must control those involved in the sector.  Let me take felling licences as an example.  That the Minister has the ability to amend, revoke or suspend a licence at his discretion without giving a good reason or even offering compensation is a step too far for the Irish Forestry and Forest Products Association.  The other aspect of making it a criminal offence for a leak from a ministerially appointed committee is another step too far.  If the Department wants the sector to co-operate, it needs to bring us into the room.  We have not been consulted or asked to co-operate for many years.  We perceive the Bill as the State setting out a menu of how it wants to control the sector at a critical stage in its development.  The sector is trying to attract new investors and bring in new people.</p> <p>In many cases, the sale of Coillte's timber rights has raised the profile of forestry in Ireland outside of Ireland.  There is a huge amount of interest.  A massive number of people are asking how they can get into this sector, about which they have heard so much.  When they look at this draft Bill, they see fees and costs and ask what the hell is going on in this sector.  They ask whether there is something inherently wrong with the sector which means it has to be controlled by legislation that contains such measures.  This is a big problem for our sector.  It sends the wrong message to people who might want to plant land and invest in the future of the sector.  I refer not only to those who might buy forests, but also to those who might build saw mills and processing facilities or develop recreational facilities.</p><p> I note Deputy Penrose's observation about the forestry development authority.  We see that as an area too.  I did not include it in our submission because there has been a great deal of movement in this regard over the past 20 years.  In other areas like fishing and the ports, the role of the development authority is to sift through policy proposals and make coherent observations for the attention of the Minister.  We do not have that in forestry.  Since the current forestry policy was developed 18 years ago, the target of having 17% forest cover by 2030 has been eroded left, right and centre.  All sorts of regulations, for example, relating to the environment and to tax, have been introduced.  We need to look at the policy in much more detail.  The current policy is 20 years old.  In that context, I would like to add something else to the menu for the forthcoming Bill.  I know there are many confusing issues.  We have the policy review group with Coillte, we have the Coillte-Bord na M&oacute;na issue, we have this Bill and we have a policy that is 20 years out of date.  Legislation should be there to facilitate policy.  One of the problems for this sector is that there is no coherent policy at the moment.</p><p> I am moving down through the list of questions.  Deputy Penrose referred to the programme for Government ambition for "an annual 14,700 hectare afforestation programme".  We are not able to reach that target by any stretch of the imagination.  The reasons for that include the designation of land, the policy decisions made by the State and the policy decisions made by other parts of the Government, for example, with regard to tax clearance certificates.  The regulation of forestry is much more stringent than the regulation of other parts of agriculture.  These things are all narrowing availability of land for forestry and undermining the confidence of people.  A stop-start approach has been taken to forestry over the past ten years.  Grants have been stopped and got going again.  The single farm payment has been an issue in the past year.  Many farmers have decided not to do anything until that comes to pass.  When something comes to pass and everything goes again, it stops again a couple of years later for some other reason.  The lack of a multi-annual approach to forestry has been very damaging to the confidence of the sector.  As a result, the extent of the planting programme has started to decrease and people have started to wonder what is going on and why there is no coherent policy.</p><p> I think I have covered everything I wanted to cover.  Before I pass over to Mr. Pat Glennon, I would like to respond to what was said about the need for an aggressive afforestation policy.  This brings me back to the point that we want to plant more land.  Many people in Ireland want to plant more land.  A great deal of land in Ireland is under-utilised and could be brought into productive forestry for the benefit of the landowner and of the State.  We would love to be able to plant more trees on such land.  We would love to have forests with multiple objectives, as opposed to single objective commercial forests.  We are all in favour of other objectives such as recreation, the environment and biodiversity.  The 12,000 jobs in this sector at present largely depend on the commercial sector.  The recreational sector has not yet been developed.  We would love to have a multi-use, multifaceted forestry sector.</p></speech>

Deputy Ferris, Senator O'Keeffe and another member asked about meetings.  We made four or five requests to meet the Minister, Deputy Coveney, in conjunction with the proposed sale of Coillte harvesting rights and the issue we are discussing.  In each case, we received his regrets and were refused meetings with him.  We wrote recently to the Minister, Deputy Rabbitte, to request a meeting about the proposed merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.  We were told we could have a meeting after the Government has made its decision.  We were not offered any meeting other than that.  After we requested a meeting with the Minister of State, Deputy Tom Hayes, we met his officials in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We had quite a good meeting with them in the Department.</p><p>  Deputy Ferris and a number of other members asked about harvesting and haulage issues.  Perhaps Mr. Mike Glennon will explain why we feel it is so important for the industry to hold on to the harvesting and haulage infrastructure and why we are looking for that to happen.</p></speech>

Almost two thirds of the output of this sector was being supplied in the home market.  After the catastrophic collapse of that market, we all had to reinvent our businesses and strive for exports.  We have all done that successfully.  Those who buy our product do not do so because the fibre is unique in some way.  They buy it because we provide a so-called just in time service.  The members of the Irish Timber Council can look at the market, see where the gaps are, respond quickly to them and thereby achieve sales.  It has nothing to do with the fibre.  The efforts we put into our relationships are of assistance.  Our response rate is the most important factor.</p><p>  I will refer to our business because I am best informed in that area.  We supply the Irish and UK markets.  We supply ship-loads to France and we supply material to the Netherlands.  We need a flexible supply chain to respond to those markets.  We feel we are best positioned to do that - we can provide examples in this regard - because we appoint our own harvesters in the forests to ensure we achieve a certain response rate.  Every time we have left that facility to Coillte's harvesting, we have had problems.  Ships have gone to France without the material that Coillte was cutting for us because it arrived late.  I am not sure the State is naturally well positioned to provide the necessary flexibility in rural forests throughout Ireland.  The line of communications needs to be limited.  We have direct access to the guy who is harvesting in the forest.  That allows us to make it happen.  That is why our business always tries to buy standing material rather than harvested material.  We need flexibility in our supply chain to export.  It is not about the quality of our fibre.  We grow wood twice as fast as the Scandinavian players, for example.  Their fibre would have some inherent benefits compared with our fibre.  We do not necessarily win on the basis of the quality of our fibre.  It is about how we approach the market.  Responsiveness is a key issue for us when we are selling.</p></speech>

I disagree with the State being involved in the manufacture of commodities.  It does not happen anywhere else in the world.  I do not feel it should happen here.  We spoke earlier about the scarcity of raw material.  We know that a large proportion of the raw material that is going into these board plants could be processed in the saw mills at a far higher price.  We would be giving the State a far better price.  It is totally wrong that this form of activity is taking place.  There is no transparency with Coillte.  Someone spoke earlier about trust.  There is no trust between the industry and Coillte.  This problem is getting worse by the day.  I will give an example.  We have spoken about responding to the market.  We have to go out and find markets.  Everybody in the timber business has done that successfully.  After we take on orders, we have to bid for the raw material every two weeks to ensure we can supply what we have said we will supply.  When we take on an order, we do not know what price we will have to pay for our raw material.  The shortage that is causing this difficulty is certainly added to by the fact that Coillte is involved in the board mills.</p> <p>It is supplying the board mills with timber that we could otherwise buy and use for orders in the United Kingdom, France and elsewhere.  We disagree with that approach. </p><p> On harvesting, I and all the other companies represented here import timber from Scotland.  One can have a shipload of timber delivered from Scotland by making a couple of telephone calls.  In the case of Coillte, however, we once recorded making 23 telephone calls to the company to have one lorry load of timber delivered and we still did not get the load.  That should give members an idea of what we are dealing with.  Coillte should not be involved in anything other than growing the forests that this country badly needs.  It should not be involved in any other activity.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.894" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim McNamara" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014011500011#O00200"><p>As Pat Glennon outlined, the IFFPA is totally opposed to the proposed merger of Coillte and Bord na M&oacute;na.  The major reason for our opposition is that there is insufficient raw material available to satisfy demand.  Coillte has proposed expanding its plant in Waterford, which would require an additional 300,000 tonnes of material, while Bord na M&oacute;na has ambitions to burn 1 million tonnes of biomass.  From where will this combined total of 1.3 million tonnes of material suddenly appear?</p><p>  As Paddy Murray stated, Coillte has taken into the two plants material that should be supplied to the sawmills for which not enough pulped material is available.  This shortage is likely to continue for ten or 15 years.  The private forestry sector will help but growth will be limited and the sector will certainly not be able to provide 1.3 million tonnes of material immediately.  If the merger proceeds, the amount of material supplied to the sawmills will continue to decline.</p><p>  Transparency is required because there is no transparency on price.  We do not know what price is being paid for the pulp Coillte is supplying.</p><p>  Deputies Boyd Barrett and Penrose referred to achieving only 45% of the afforestation target of planting 14,000 ha per annum.  I am not sure if members realise that Coillte has not planted any new land in the past ten or 15 years.  Private landowners have done very well in this regard but where is Coillte in all of this?  It should be a forestry company purchasing and acquiring new land and then planting it.</p></speech>

The back page of the submission we made to NewERA features a diagram that shows the breakdown of a typical crop of timber.  Pulp wood is at the top, boxwood in the middle and saw log at the bottom.  The price of pulp wood is approximately &euro;20 per cu. m.  Box wood costs approximately &euro;55 per cu. m., while the price of saw log is &euro;65 per cu. m.  It is not the case that the sawmills are trying to commandeer a market.  Our proposal would give the best return to taxpayers and stakeholders.  It is far better to have logs go to the sawmills.  We are not seeking handouts but to have all material placed on an open and transparent market to allow us to bid for it.  There is too much inter-company trading between Coillte and the board mills.  We have stated categorically that the board mills should be stand-alone companies as the potential for a conflict of interest is too great as matters stand.  Timber should be placed on the open market and Coillte should be a stand-alone forest products company aggressively trying to achieve the afforestation target of planing 15,000 ha per annum.  Incidentally, when Mr. Ivan Yates was Minister for Agriculture, he recommended an afforestation target of 25,000 ha per annum.  When this target could not be met, we changed the goalposts and reduced it to 15,000 ha.  Deputy Penrose is correct that the current rate of afforestation is approximately 7,500 ha per annum.  We are a country mile behind the target.</p><p>  To respond to Deputy Boyd Barrett, we are in full agreement on the aggressive afforestation targets.  The hardwood versus softwood balance should be realigned and the minimum target for commercial softwood planting should be 15,000 ha per annum.  While we do not advocate that hardwood planting should cease, our industry is starved of raw material. </p><p>  To respond to Deputy Penrose, last year we imported between 350,000 and 400,000 cu. m. of timber and most of the mills are running at between 70% and 80% capacity.  The industry is crying out for raw material, yet 35% of the new plantation last year was hardwood, for which we do not have an industry and which will not bear fruit, as it were, for approximately 100 years.  The proportions should be rejigged. </p><p>  I was not sure what the Deputy meant when he referred to a clash between sustainability and the commercial side.  Forestry presents this country with a fabulous opportunity because it is one of few areas where we have a natural advantage over our competitors.  Timber can be grown faster here than in the United Kingdom.  We should maximise this advantage.  One achieves sustainability by replanting and growing again.</p></speech>

We passionately believe in sustainability.  If the wording in any of our documentation causes the Deputy concern, his concern is misplaced.  Sustainability is part of the story of the forest products sector.  The industry has great potential.  Why are we not planting more when we can grow trees twice as fast as our Scandinavian competitors can?</p></speech>

Therefore, Coillte has informed us that even though it belongs to a shareholder, it is not economic for it to plant.  What would the representatives do to rejig the balance to ensure Coillte would find it economic to plant?  On the one hand the representatives say the boardmills are at a huge advantage while, on the other, Coillte says it is at a huge disadvantage when it comes to planting compared to the private individual because the taxpayer is subventing the private individual.</p></speech>

First, Coillte, more or less, got the largest land parcel in the State for not a very large amount of money a long time ago and had a huge facility to sell off various strategic assets for quite substantial sums of money for sites, dumps and whatever the case may be.  It is clear from its annual accounts that for land it acquired at a low value on vesting day it got millions of euro when selling it off.  It got a massive natural start and massive advantage.  The issue may be that Coillte got involved with so many non-core activities that the effort on forestry was dissipated.</p></speech>

However, if one is taking over a new factory tomorrow - let us forget about the millions of euro -  the question is whether that factory will make money.  Somebody may suggest that as one has already made millions of euro, one might as well use it to keep the jobs in that useless factory that is going to lose money.  The business person will say that it does not matter how much he makes, but he must make money.  It is clear from Coillte's balance sheet it does not have a huge amount.  The question that Coillte will logically put to us is that if it plants 100 acres, will it make money on it?  Its argument is that it will not make money on it because the individual who is getting a large grant from the State, that is, the taxpayer, is at a huge advantage in respect of every 100 acres that come on the market for planting.</p></speech>

If we take it that the private sector is very efficient, it will still tell us that even to plant its own land, which it has for free, it needs very substantial grants and premia to make it pay.  It appears logical to me that no matter how efficient Coillte is, if the private individual cannot do it, it will not be able to do it on the same 100 acres of land and will have to buy the land, whereas the farmer has it for free.  When one stands back and applies commonsense logic, I do not think that stands up as an argument.</p></speech>

There is a flaw in the logic, therefore, and I think we will have to discuss it on another day.</p></speech>

We have a serious dilemma in that unless there is a rebuilding of that trust, we could talk ourselves around about any aspect of it.  No trust means nothing can happen.  It is very serious.</p></speech>

I wish to make a couple of observations.  In regard to the proposed merger, the representatives and Coillte may have common ground on that issue.  Coillte will probably resist the proposed merger with Bord na M&oacute;na depending on how it is proposed they be knit together.  I agree with what Deputy Pat Deering said earlier that the hearings held last year on the proposed sale did have some bearing on the final decision.  It gave the various stakeholders an opportunity to make a public presentation in this forum.  That is the purpose of meetings such as today's meeting.  There was general agreement that the harvesting rights should not be sold and that Coillte should not be sold.  There was almost unanimous agreement that it needed to be changed.</p><p>  Before the witnesses appeared we went through our work programme.  The purpose of today's meeting was primarily to deal with the Forestry Bill.  That is fine and it is all interlinked, but we agreed to draft a work programme which includes a total land use policy, including the future direction of the forest sector.  In particular, the Irish Timber Council's presentation starts that ball rolling.  The general discussion that followed made it clear that we have a resource which is the land of Ireland, be it Bord na M&oacute;na land, privately owned farm land, privately owned forestry land, estate owned forestry land, etc.  It has multifunctional potential, be it food, energy, raw material for the timber industry, recreation and so on.  I recall when REFIT 2 or REFIT 3 - whichever is on renewables - was being introduced, Coillte had a major issue with the PSO and having to put so much product into what it would see as an inefficient power generation facility when it would say that it would be more efficient to send it to one of its own processing plants.  Furthermore, there are companies which the witnesses will be aware of which can assess electronically or digitally the potential of a wood and say that 95% of a particular tree should go for saw log, or 100% or 50% of another tree should go for box wood.  It can assess the most efficient use of every tree in every wood.  That technology is in place.  We need the income.  It is an Irish company with Irish technology that is going into South America, Russia and Australia and we need to harness that technology.  I believe a Cork gentleman is at the back of it.  It is fabulous technology and has the potential to put to use every tree we harvest in its most efficient way.</p><p>  My vision for total land use is that we would account for all the public good, including carbon sequestration.  Dr. Peter Brennan, EPS Consulting Limited, will be aware of work we did in the last D&aacute;il on the whole issue of using plantations for offsets.  That is something we will look at in the context of the bigger picture of Food Harvest 2020 targets and greenhouse gas obligations.  Unless we can utilise the land to mitigate the output from agriculture, an irreconcilable collision will take place.  While we did not think it would happen, today's meeting has started our work, before we had agreed to start, on land use policy into the future.  We would hope we can be part of the framing of a general policy in that regard.  Yesterday, we published a major report on promoting sustainable coastal and island communities, but this issue could involve much more effort.  Witnesses will get the flavour of what we are trying to do which is the bigger picture and it allows the industry to flourish.</p><p>  On the issue as to whether the boardmills should be sold off, there will be differences of opinion in the industry.  The findings of the forestry review group on this issue will be interesting.  I believe there should be a forestry development authority.</p> <p>It has been done before and does not have to cost a fortune.  It would be advantageous, but should feed into an overall policy.  I believe we are at the start of something here.</p><p> The committee has genuine concerns in regard to the Forestry Bill.  It would have been better if the new policy of heads of Bill being presented to a committee before being developed had occurred and they had been brought to the committee first.  However, we will try to deal with some of the matters that have arisen.  Other submissions have yet to be made and we will have another hearing on 28 January with three other groups.  We are seeking to defer Committee Stage for three or four weeks, until the end of February or early March, which will give us time to give the Bill due consideration and prepare some proposals from the committee to try to ensure it achieves what it sets out to do, namely, to streamline and encourage more afforestation.</p><p> I thank all the witnesses for attending and thank the members of the committee for engaging on this matter.  Deputy Boyd Barrett is not a member of the committee, but obviously has an interest in this area.  This subject is huge and feeds into a total land use policy.  It is something that has significant potential.  While we have advantages in this regard, we face challenges.  The Irish Timber Council made the point in its presentation that this industry was 80% domestic and 20% export, but was able to flip that around during a recession so that where we might have expected a glut of supply material in the market, there is now a shortage.  This demonstrates the adaptability of the industry.  While the industry is driven by both sectors, the relationship and remit of Coillte will be fundamental to its future.  The State will remain a player in the forestry sector, but how it will best work with the industry will be key to defining the success or failure of the industry in the future.</p><p> I hope the groups found their visit here useful.  It was useful to this committee.  We have further hearings on the Bill on 28 January and we will also do further work on it.  If any of the witnesses wish to have any further input, we will welcome any submission they wish to make.</p></speech>

The first thing I must do is read the note on privilege.  I draw your attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee or myself, as committee Chairperson, to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  That includes corporations, Departments and so on.  I emphasise that point and, as Chairperson, I would have to step in if people did not comply.  I advise you that the opening statements you have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br />The Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013 is on the agenda today.  In September last, the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, published a draft general scheme for the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013 as well as draft regulations for discussion ahead of enacting the legislation.  Applying to all 4,000 primary and post-primary schools, the proposed regulations aim to underpin a fair, consistent and transparent enrolment process that would preclude school places from being allocated on the basis of waiting lists and prevent schools from seeking deposits or payment as part of the admissions process.<br />The draft general scheme and draft regulations were referred to the committee for consideration.  The committee undertook a process of consultation on the general scheme resulting in a considerable number of submissions that are now under consideration.  We received over 50 in total.  We have already had two hearings to give groups an opportunity to present the key points of their submissions to the committee and to respond to whatever issues were raised by the members.  The people we invited in specifically looked to come before the committee.  It is unusual to have individuals before the committee although that is what we have today.  The committee decided it would be good to include individuals and not only groups.  All in all, when these sessions are complete we will have had approximately 25 groups or individuals in, a substantial number.  The meeting today will consider the final hearings on the issue.<br />I welcome Sr. Marie C&eacute;line Clegg, Loreto Education Centre, Mr. John Suttle, Ms Derval Duggan, Mr. Noel P. Malone, Col&aacute;iste Chiar&aacute;in, Croom, Limerick, Mr. Gabriel McCabe, Ms Eithne Read O'Doherty and Ms Eukaria O'Grady.  The format of the meeting is that each witness will make an initial presentation, strictly no more than five minutes in duration.  It is important that people do not simply read their submission.  Rather, the committee is seeking an overview to allow sufficient time for questions and answers.  This will be followed by questions from members of the committee.  To get proceedings under way I invite Ms Clegg to make her presentation.</p></speech>

The trust had welcomed the original intention of a new framework as articulated in the discussion paper, namely, to regulate "only those aspects of enrolment policies and practices where a common or national approach may be desirable, and otherwise to provide the maximum discretion to schools".  Having consulted with stakeholders to the extent that the limited timeframe allowed, it is our view that the extent to which the proposed legislation confers a right on the Minister to prescribe and regulate in respect of each stage of the admissions process is excessive.</p><p>  The Loreto Education Trust board respects the autonomy of boards of management in the exercise of their statutory responsibilities while providing clear guidelines, from the perspective of the patron, regarding what constitutes an inclusive school environment and the implications of that for admissions policies.  It is our contention that the role of the board will be diminished in the scope of its decision making and autonomy by the proposed level of ministerial regulation regarding all stages of the admissions process.</p><p>  There are some specific concerns.  While our written submission has addressed in considerable detail the main concerns about the general scheme of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013 and the draft regulations on policy and process, I wish to refer in particular to several issues.</p> <p>Our written submission has addressed in considerable detail specific concerns about the general scheme of an Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013 and the related draft regulations on policy and process.  I want to refer now in particular to several issues. <br />The requirements specified in the Bill in relation to the publication of a school&rsquo;s policy on admissions are those already being met by the vast majority of schools.  The requirement of the stated intention in the introduction to their admissions policies with regard to all details of  the Equal Status Acts 2000&ndash;2011 seems unnecessary.  If people already comply with the Equal Status Act in every respect it is possible that having to insert a large amount of legislative detail in this regard will make the policies less accessible to parents and guardians. <br />The new section 33 makes provision for the Minister to regulate on all stages of the admissions process with particular emphasis on the content and the manner in which the admissions process must be conducted by schools.  This is ministerial involvement at its most extreme in terms of micro-managing.  Imagine, for example, the implications of ministerial involvement in granting derogations in respect of the past-pupil criterion across the diversity of schools throughout the country.<br />Another issue of concern is the offer of &quot;provisional places&quot;.  As public representatives, members are aware that parents and guardians want to know whether their child has a place.  Delays and uncertainties cause very understandable tension and worry at a time when they need reassurance.  There is a lack of reality in regulation 32, in this regard. <br />The balancing of rights is an important governance and management function in schools as it is for the Government.  Article 26.3 of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights states &quot;Parents have a prior right to choose the kind of education that shall be given to their children&quot;.  Protocol 1, Article 2, requires the State to respect the right of parents to ensure such education and teaching as is in conformity with their own religious and philosophical convictions.  The UN International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights unambiguously upholds this right. <br />Accountability is being sought in the proposed legislation respecting arrangements for those who wish to withdraw from religious instruction, as is their constitutional right, but there is no corresponding emphasis on accountability in relation to the rights of those who wish to have religious instruction as an integral part of the curriculum in accordance with the characteristic spirit of the school as articulated by the patron in the exercise of its statutory responsibility.<br />The highly prescriptive nature of the proposed legislation is illustrated in sections 33(<i>m</i>) (iii) to (ix) of the Bill which describe how the regulations will &quot;prescribe&quot; in respect of every aspect of enrolment, format, content etc.  We suggest that a set of guidelines accompanying a regulatory framework, concentrating on key principles only would be a much more appropriate means of ensuring compliance by schools rather than the sledge-hammer approach of the current Bill and regulations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.935" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Suttle" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014011500004#E00200"><p>This committee has been asked to review proposed legislation to deal with admissions in schools in Ireland.  The proposed legislation however ignores the elephant in the room, religious discrimination in admissions.  A religious apartheid system of education is being introduced into our national schools.  This is illegal.  It is in breach of the Constitution and of international human rights agreements into which the State has entered and it is in breach of the Equal Status Act 2000.  All schools receiving any support from the State must abide by the two principles of the national school system which are one, all religious denominations together in the same school, and two, with separate religious instruction.  These are the two pillars of the national school system.<br />This State was founded by the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921.  This treaty is only three or four pages long with 18 clauses, 17 of which refer to political, financial and military matters.  Only one, No. 16, has a social dimension which is to ensure that the provisions of the national school system carry through into the new State.  This provision was carried through directly, using virtually the same words, into the Constitution of 1937.  The provisions of the Constitution remain unchanged today, with parents having a right to privately funded denominational education, but where there is any State funding, all such schools must live within the two pillars of the national school system.  The Equal Status Act 2000 continues these rights, under section 7(2) religious discrimination on admission to schools is banned.  The exception in section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) does not apply to national schools because it is limited by Article 44.2.4<sup>o</sup>of the Constitution.<br />The basis for the ethos of all national schools in seen in the foundation documents of typical schools.  There are thousands of documents available to show that the ethos of all national schools under all patronages includes a commitment to be open with equality to children of all religious denominations.  Religious instruction is allowed and encouraged in national schools but there are limits.  Separate religious instruction worked perfectly well until the early 1970s and can work today.  Children have a constitutional right to be allowed to go to their local national school without attending religious instruction.  There has never been a report from any State body that recommended that our children should be divided at four years old into different religious denominations for their education.  In fact there have been many Government-sponsored reports that have condemned what is going on.  In 1996 the Constitutional Review Group said that the integrated curriculum, which was introduced in the early 1970s, is illegal because it removes the constitutional right of children to withdraw from religious indoctrination.  This illegality remains today.<br />In 1998 in the Supreme Court, Mr. Justice Barrington inferred from Article 44.2.4<sup>o</sup>of the Constitution that &quot;if a school was in receipt of public funds any child, no matter what his religion, would be entitled to attend it.&quot;  In 2011, the Irish Human Rights Commission, in its report on religion and education, stated that Article 44.2.4<sup>o</sup>of the Constitution.provides that there may not be discrimination between different denominations in the State and that children have the right to attend State-aided schools without attending &ldquo;religious instruction&rdquo;. <br />There has never, however, been a direct judgment in any court, or a Government report directed specifically at religious discrimination in admissions policies.  The report of the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector is the closest the State has come to seeking specific advice on how to deal with religion and primary education.  The advisory group considers that enrolment policy in a stand-alone school should not discriminate on grounds of religious belief.  This report has been turned completely on its head by the actions of the State.<br />The committee should be careful about whom it listens to.  Schools at primary level receiving State financial support are national schools.  The committee should watch out for anyone who never uses the term &quot;national school&quot;, but always replaces it with &quot;primary school&quot;, &quot;parish school&quot;, &quot;denominational school&quot;, &quot;Catholic school&quot; etc.  The senior people involved in education understand very well that all primary schools receiving State funding must abide by the constitutional and legislative provisions which only allow for schools under the national school model, that is all religions together in the same school with separate religious instruction.<br />This is another disgrace for this country.  We are heading for another humiliating redress programme.  Nothing has changed in the Department of Education and Skills since the Ryan report condemned its support for the Catholic Church above the well-being of children, and above the law.  This country has suffered from religious sectarianism for too long and just when our national schools were becoming multicultural, we are breaking the law and going against the Constitution to create religious apartheid in our schools.  I hope that this committee will support the equal rights enshrined in our Constitution.</p></speech>

Several areas require amendment if the Bill is to achieve its stated goals.  Head 3 refers to schools to which the provisions of section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act apply which states: &quot;[such a school] does not discriminate where it admits a person of one religious denomination in preference to others or where it refuses to admit a person who is not of that denomination, where it is proved that refusal is essential to maintain the ethos of the school&quot;.<br /><i></i>Under<i></i>head 9 the school can refuse to admit the child even if the National Educational Welfare Board or the National Council for Special Education has designated the school for a child who has no place.  There is no definition of the proof required but in the regulatory impact analysis a religious body expressed concern that such a designation might mean having to accept a person who does not actively support the religious ethos of the school.  The Bill does not explain what happens if every school in an area refuses a child on these grounds but the regulatory impact assessment refers to the cost of providing home tuition for such students.  Under these provisions religious discrimination will continue in 3,500 of our 4,000 schools.  I am concerned also that parents have no right of appeal against the designation of a school which will undermine their ethos.<br /><b></b>Under head 4 there is a requirement on a board of management to consult with parents before approving the admission policy.  This requirement should be strengthened as currently it is too easy for school management to ignore parents&rsquo; views in the development of policy.  Head 4 requires the admission policy to set out the position of the school in regard to its arrangements for upholding the constitutional rights of any students who do not wish to attend religious instruction.  If religion class is scheduled during the school day extra teaching resources may be required for the students who do not wish to attend.  For primary school students there is no practical way to uphold their rights under the current integrated curriculum.  Schools must not be allowed to tell parents to remove their child from school, as some do at present.<br />Heads 5, 6 and 7 propose the repeal of section 29 of the Education Act which deals with the refusal to enrol a child.  A child refused a school place by the principal of a school must now appeal to the board of management, whose decision is final.  Given that the principal, board of management and patron develop and approve the admission policy, an appeal to the board cannot be viewed as independent.  An independent appeals process would provide reassurance to parents and better feedback to the Minister.<br />If the Oireachtas passes the Bill in its present form it will simply add another layer of hypocrisy to the rules, laws and international commitments governing our education system.  The Equal Status Act confers unequal status; the Employment Equality Act confers inequality; the Constitution states the State will not endow any religion but taxpayers pay primary teachers to spend 10% of their day teaching religion; the Teaching Council code of professional conduct states that teachers must, &quot;uphold human dignity and promote equality&quot;, but there is no dignity for children in hearing their<i></i>teacher disrespect their family&rsquo;s beliefs; thousands of school mission statements welcome diversity but some children are made to feel very different or are turned away; the Minister says that anti-bullying policies must emphasise the dangers of homophobic bullying while the patron of most of our schools teaches that homosexuality is &quot;an objective disorder&quot;; the Constitution recognises the inalienable rights of parents in the matter of their children&rsquo;s education but religious organisations control both the schools and the curriculum at primary level.  <br />In its consideration of the Education (Admission to Schools) Bill 2013, I ask the committee to be more ambitious for our children so that children in the 21st century are not paying the price for nineteenth-century segregation and sectarianism.  Our public schools should not be Catholic, Protestant or Muslim.  Education is about children, not churches.  It is about children fulfilling their potential, going to school locally with their friends, making new friends, respecting and being respected by their teacher, feeling proud to belong to their class and their school community.  Children should learn together in school, just as they will study, work and socialise together throughout their lives.  <br />Members of the committee are legislators and they should act now.  They should ban religious discrimination in all admission policies; establish an independent appeals procedure for refusal to enrol a child; amend or repeal section 37 of the Employment Equality Acts; repeal section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act and section 2 of the Education Act; repeal rule 68 of the rules for national schools; implement a common moral and ethical education syllabus for all students.  Members have the power to give all our children the education system they deserve.</p></speech>

Malone, principal of Col&aacute;iste Chiar&aacute;in, Croom, County Limerick.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.942" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Malone" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014011500005#F00300"><p>As an experienced principal I urge this committee to review these proposed regulations in light of the experience of the Limerick area post-primary schools common application system.  I refer in particular to the Minister's proposal to extend a similar system to other parts of the country.  Limerick is an area of the country that has grappled with the whole issue of educational inequality for many years and remains the only area in the country where a common admissions and application system applies.  It is, therefore, an ideal test case for the application of these regulations.  I welcome the fact that the Bill has included the right of the Minister to impose a similar system elsewhere.  However, it is with some alarm and regret that we note the Minister&rsquo;s assertion:<blockquote><br />It is not the intention, in such a scenario, that the schools concerned will be required to apply a common policy.  Rather that each school will continue to apply its own policy, in that only the process will have to operate in co-operation with other schools.</blockquote>On this point in particular, I believe the Minister should insist on a common admissions policy across all participant schools, with geographical location as first priority, after brothers or sisters of existing students.  Unfortunately, in my experience in Limerick, it is widely perceived that the system as it operates is unfair and discriminatory, and the last thing such a system needs is light touch regulation.<br />A key characteristic of schools in Limerick is the lack of social mix.  This has negative consequences on those lower down the social hierarchy and brings additional advantage to pupils in these schools which are almost entirely middle class in their social composition.  The centralised procedure has caused considerable anguish and uncertainty among parents and children.  If children do not get their first or second preference school they may be left with the very last of their preferences.  Ironically, participant schools are given a certain level of protection from any imputation of perpetuating inequality, by using the scheme as a kind of cover.  Schools cannot be allowed to continue to operate independently in terms of their admission criteria, and therefore decide their selection criteria with no independent scrutiny.  Of course, this really becomes relevant where demand exceeds supply.<br />Generally speaking, there is an aging population within the city boundary.  Most of the growth in population is in the suburbs and outlying areas.  In some areas with large and highly sought-after schools, the profile of the immediate area is one of an aging and sometimes affluent population, so those schools must draw from a larger catchment area.  Unfortunately, in many instances this is largely contrived.  Vast swathes of population are often ignored in favour of other applicants living significantly further away.  This can mean children are travelling substantial distances away from their home by private bus or car.  A key point is that current admissions policies do not observe the spirit of inclusiveness, even though many claim to do so.  This has to change.  If it does, greater equality of opportunity will follow.<br />Some schools apply preferential criteria, such as favouring children living in certain affluent areas, children from cherry-picked traditional feeder schools, brothers or sisters of past pupils, sons or daughters of past pupils and so on and finally, all others.  In effect, very few places are left in this last category, as the schools have pretty much wrapped up their preferred clientele and end up sending refusal letters to many disappointed 12 year olds.<br />This leads to an extraordinary situation where some children have right of entry although they live some distance from the school while other children are refused, even if they reside adjacent to the school, or indeed attend the local feeder primary school.  Surely, proximity to a school should have a higher ranking than when a child has a father or mother who attended a generation earlier.  This could be construed that this is a means by which a certain social class is protected and the best students are cherry-picked to the detriment of those schools who genuinely strive for inclusivity.<br />The fact that the Minister may now consider granting a derogation to permit a school's admission policy to include a past pupil criteria of up to 25% will skew the process and cannot be explained away by defending its inclusion on the basis of tradition.  If it is accepted that tradition can be used by a school to discriminate against other applicants, the very basis of the proposed regulation is undermined.  Who will oversee the selection of this 25%?  Where is the transparency of selections?  Surely, this will give licence to some schools to continue to actively favour the socially advantaged, academically gifted or those who have exceptional sporting prowess.  Furthermore, this proposal appears to reward those schools who have adopted such discriminatory practices in the past by limiting this derogation to those who allowed such a provision in the past five years, effectively penalising those schools which have embraced a much more progressive and open admissions policy.</p> <p> There is no real justification for giving preference to children of past pupils or, to a lesser extent, siblings of former pupils.  Again, this is always discriminatory and unfair.  The proposed limit of 25% should be withdrawn and no derogation should be applicable.  Instead, a fair and reasonable geographical radius in respect of any particular school in a city or rural location should be agreed.  This would put all students in the agreed catchment of that school on an equal footing.  Where there is an oversubscription for that school, other priorities can be addressed.  Allocations to each school should be based on a common agreed admissions policy, on a genuine lottery basis, and should be centrally managed by the local education centre.  This would make the system completely transparent and avoid any suspicion of manipulation.</p><p> I very much welcome the spirit and philosophy behind this draft Bill.  However, unless the fundamental issues I have outlined are addressed, the current iniquitous system may be preserved under an illusion of fairness.  These proposed changes are long overdue and I urge the committee to consider this submission in the spirit of true equality and justice for our children, regardless of background.  They deserve nothing less.</p></speech>

The State, as corporate parent to these most vulnerable members of our society, is, by way of these provisions, denying their very existence.  In the United Kingdom, United States, Canada and Australia, 40-page policy documents are in place detailing the educational treatment of children in care and the admissions entitlements applicable to them.  There is not one paragraph or even one word about children in care in this Bill.  What parent, corporate or biological, would treat its most vulnerable child in this disgraceful manner?  We have seen the same attitude before in this country in the case of the Magdalen laundries, industrial schools and clerical child sex abuse scandals.  We were in denial about such matters in the past.  The provisions of this Bill, as it currently stands, prove that in 2014 we are still in denial about our treatment of children in care.<br />I ask the committee to show leadership, wisdom and foresight by recommending to the corporate parent of these children - that is, the State, as represented by the Government - that they be granted equal status with their international peers and given highest priority when it comes to admissions to schools.  The onus should be placed on school authorities to prove the student's unsuitability for the school rather than the child or carer having to prove the suitability of the child for the school.  In England in 1988 a status of highest priority was granted to looked-after children.  This was reaffirmed in education regulations published in 2006 and again, despite strong challenges from school authorities looking for increased autonomy, in the school admissions code of 2012.  These provisions guarantee the admission of looked-after children to their preferred schools. <br />There are approximately 4,000 school-going children in care in Ireland and there are 4,000 schools in the country.  In other words, we are talking about an average of one child in care per school across all classes.  It is hardly a major burden on each school to do its share to alleviate the plight of these disadvantaged children.  In May 2013 a report commissioned by Ms Emily Logan, the Ombudsman for Children, and undertaken by the ESRI and the children's research centre at Trinity College, Dublin into the education of children in care in Ireland was published.  The foreword to the report refers to children in care facing &quot;multiple obstacles to the enjoyment of their rights&quot;.  Three months after the publication of this report, the corporate parent of these children - namely, the State - published this proposed Bill, which ignores the very existence of the children for whom it bears a significant responsibility.<br />In 2006 and again in 2011, the UN Committee on the Rights of the Child, following its audit in Ireland, highlighted the failure of the State to put in place a comprehensive and systematic system of data collection on children in care.  This failure, the committee noted, represented &quot;a serious impediment to evidence-informed policy-making and practice&quot;.  The State has continued to ignore the UN in this matter and, eight years later, no such study or data exist.  The ESRI report states, on page 33:<blockquote>At the level of national education policy, children in care are not visible, as such...  [C]hildren in care are not the focus of any specific policy initiative within the [Department of Education and Skills].  Nor are children in care the focus of targeted initiatives [by] the NEWB, the National Council for Special Education (NCSE), or the National Educational Psychological Service (NEPS).</blockquote>These children are apparently invisible.<br />Low educational achievement is the dominant theme in international research on children in care.   In an article in <i>The Guardian</i>in September 2011, the situation in England was outlined as follows:<blockquote>Last year, 49% of looked-after teenagers failed to get five GCSEs, compared to 7% of all pupils.  While the situation is improving, the Adolescent and Children's Trust (Tact) estimates that it will take this fragile group 50 years to match the average achievements of other 16-year-olds.  At age 18, the statistics are just as gloomy.  Only 7% of looked-after young people make it to university, compared to 40% of their peers.</blockquote>The particular barriers to educational achievement for children in care include, among others, issues relating to early life trauma, school attendance, discipline, behaviour and peer or social relations.  Failure to gain admission to appropriate local schools is a strong barrier to social integration, mental well-being and continued attendance at school.  Children who are forced to attend schools outside their own community have great difficulty integrating with other children from within the community in which they live.  This leads to loneliness and isolation, contributing to mental health issues that can have a significant impact.  What these children do at the weekend and during holidays is as important to their development as what they do at school, particularly in the case of adolescents.  In addition, arriving to school in taxis with a different person each day singles these children out among their peers and leads to bullying and isolation which, in turn, lead to poor school attendance and the resultant under-achievement.  The cost of transport and social care worker time is a cost that would be far better directed to providing children's educational support needs.<br />The granting of highest priority status to children in care is the international norm in developed, English-speaking countries and should, by way of this Bill, be extended to children in this situation in Ireland.  Such a development is not the solution to all ills, but it would be an important cornerstone in helping children to integrate socially within the community in which they have been placed.  This would lead to increased school attendance and provide the child with an environment where he or she can improve the likelihood of academic success.  Failure to address the educational and social needs of these children leads to homelessness, poverty and contact with the criminal justice system.  To better understand social isolation, I urge members to read my daughter's care leaver's statement in the supporting documentation and the warning about exclusion in <i>The Guardian</i>article I have distributed.  I conclude with a statement from that article in reference to legislation in England: &quot;Barnardos and Tact also fear that the education bill, in giving heads more power over exclusions, will be to the detriment of looked-after children, who are already nine times more likely to be excluded...&quot;.</p></speech>

I am here today in a personal capacity rather than as a representative of the panel.  I am opposed to the provision in the Bill that there will be no appeal against a decision of the board of management of a school refusing enrolment.  Instead, I am advocating for the retention of an independent appeals body and arguing, moreover, that it is unconstitutional not to have such a body.  We are dealing here with three constitutional rights - the rights of the child, the right to education and the provisions in Article 43 regarding fair procedures.</p><p>  My submission to the committee focuses on four main points, namely, the constitutionality of the Bill in respect of the role of the principal and board of management, the Supreme Court decision in the St. Molaga's school case, the notion of equal status under EU law, and the relevance of the Charter of Fundamental Rights of the European Union, which is directly applicable in member states.  The role of the principal, as defined in the Long Title and in heads 5 to 7, inclusive, is to implement policy.  This represents an incorrect use of language - the role of the principal should be to apply policy, while it is the role of the board of management to implement policy.  Policy is formulated by boards of management through a process.  Implementation involves a range of steps, including a consideration of such issues as the characteristic spirit of the school, procedures, criteria and so on.  It involves a consideration of the provision for special educational needs and the particular ethos of the school.  There are many steps in a policy and it is formulated through a process.</p> <p>The word to be used here is &quot;apply&quot;.  At present, what is happening in schools is that the administrative work relating to the policy is delegated to the principal.  He or she must send out forms and take receipt of them when they are completed and returned, apply the relevant criteria - which is a mathematical exercise - and then place them in folders or whatever.  The decisions regarding who will receive a place is usually made by the staff of the school and then a list is presented to the board of management.  The difficult cases will then be discussed by the board of management.  That is what happens at present and the board of management ultimately makes the decision.  I am of the view that this should still happen and the use of the relevant word is wrong.  There should be daylight between the decision maker and the decision.<br />The board of management is the decision maker and that must remain the case.  In order to maintain the integrity of the three constitutional rights, under Article 40.3 in respect of fair procedures, there can be an allegation of bias if there is no redress in respect of a decision of a board of management.  The board of management is the decision maker and it also makes decisions about the allocation.  That is why we have the external appeal.  The second of the rights are those of the child under Article 42A.  There has never been litigation in respect of this provision in the Constitution and we actually do not know what it means.  The State guarantees to vindicate the impresciptible and inalienable rights of the child but what does this mean?  Then there is the right to education, which is an extremely strong one.  This is the only socioeconomic right provided for in the Constitution at Article 42.4.<br />We are introducing an item of legislation to disapply constitutional rights.  Previous speakers advocated the retention of an independent appeals mechanism.  I refer to Mr. Caoimh&iacute;n &Oacute; hEaghra from An Foras P&aacute;tr&uacute;nachta, who referred to it in the context of reform.  The reform should be to widen the remit.  We are talking about a panel of individuals who now have expertise.  What people did not pick up on before today was the mediation service.  Section 29(4) of the Education Act 1998 makes provision for a mediator to be provided, if that is deemed suitable and workable.  The Department always makes mediators available in section 29 cases.  Mediators work between schools and the persons making appeals.  There is a communicative role in this regard and the fostering of good practice.  All of this happens and 27% of cases are resolved on the ground.<br />In the case of the Board of Management of St. Molaga's National School <i>v</i>. the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, it was decided that a board of management is the decision maker in the context of policy formation.  In that case, the stages of policy formation relating to the school's decision to exclude children, who were subsequently approved for admittance under section 29, were evaluated.  The matter went to the High Court and on to the Supreme Court.  As indicated in my submission, the Supreme Court upheld the High Court's decision to the effect that the integrity of the decision remained with the board of management.<br />In the context of the decentralisation of decision making and as flagged by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, in some areas budgets will be allocated to boards of management to decide on class sizes and the number of teachers.  Here we are again seeing the copperfastening of the decision-making role of the board of management.  In my submission I also included details of an Equality Tribunal case as a statement of the current practice in one school.  In the case in question the section 29 panel directed the Secretary General of the Department to recommend the enrolment of the child involved in the school.  The child, who has a disability, was still not enrolled in the school and the matter was referred to the Equality Tribunal as an equality issue.  I urge members to read the details relating to the case in question as an example of what is happening in some schools between principals and boards of management.</p></speech>

I will just brief members on what the presentation contains.<br />My focus is on head 3, which relates to section 15(2)(<i>d</i>) of the Education Act 1998, and the allowance that is made in respect of discriminating under section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act 2000.  I was shocked when I discovered that such discrimination is allowed, particularly in light of everything I, as a citizen, had read in recent years from the Irish Human Rights Commission, etc.  I acknowledge that the proposed education (admission to schools) Bill 2013 will bring about a great deal of change and that much of the work relating to it is absolutely brilliant.  However, I am concerned about the discrimination to which I refer.  When such discrimination is allowed under the Equal Status Act 2000, it means that someone must provide proof of denomination or membership of a denomination in order to access a State-funded right to education.  This runs contrary to constitutional and human rights.  In that context, I refer, in particular, to the European Convention on Human Rights by which this State is statutorily bound since 2006.<br />When it comes to parents, what is involved here could be a violence of their conscience and law preference and particularly with regard to those whose children attend the 1,700 stand-alone schools.  Why should parents be obliged to disclose this information?  In turn, this breaches their constitutional rights and those rights they are guaranteed under Articles 8, 9 and 14 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Under the latter articles, people are not obliged to disclose the information to which I refer.  The main point I am trying to make is that this matter does not revolve around religion, ethos or ethics.  As is the case with any institution, one can state that one will sign up to and respect the mission statement, ethos or ethics.  However, one should not be obliged to prove membership of a denomination in order to access a human right that is State-funded with taxpayers' money.<br />The next part of my presentation relates to stipulations and requests from the Department of Education and Skills and the line Minister, Deputy Quinn, issued in September and October.  When seeking submissions, the Minister stated that the system is quite unfair and arbitrary, indicated that he wanted to make it more inclusive and said that he would respond to reasonable suggestions.  The Irish Human Rights Commission, the relevant boards and the Equality Authority all submitted papers on this matter to the Department.  The most recent of these is the report of the advisory group to the Forum on Patronage and Pluralism in the Primary Sector, which states that the derogation in section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act 2000 may impede the duty of the Department of Education and Skills to provide for education for all children.  I was highly confused because the request for submission even states that this matter requires further consideration in the context of possible amendment.  We have included the derogation in the draft scheme of the Bill, which makes the State legally culpable.  Education law experts Mawhinney and Glendenning stated that the refusal to maintain the ethos of schools has yet to be teased out in law.  That is where we are going.  If we include the derogation in the eventual Bill, that will be the next step because we will be legally culpable.  If we proceed with what is proposed, we will be operating contrary to all the advice we have received and for which we have paid - including that from the forum - because what has been put forward impedes our policy of education for all.  We will become legally culpable in the context of children's rights under the Constitution and we will also be legally culpable before the European courts.  Is that the next step if what is proposed is included?<br />I included some recommendations and remedies in my presentation.  The Equality Authority has stated that if it is eventually passed, the legislation may need to be amended.  It referred, in this regard, to an incident where 50 non-Catholic children could not gain admission to their local school and where a charity had to provide them with emergency access to a school.  Similar incidents could arrive if that to which I refer is included in the eventual Bill.  Until the principal Act is amended to exclude discrimination under section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act 2000, there must be a response to reasonable suggestions.  Such suggestions have been made and even if the relevant provision is included, the Oireachtas must respond and indicate why it is the case.  As citizens, we deserve to know that.<br />My final point relates to how, in circumstances where we are legally culpable, we explain how a five year old cannot gain admission to his or her local school because his or her parents cannot provide proof of membership of a particular denomination and is obliged to attend a school five miles away from his or her home, family and neighbours.  How is it possible to justify this in legal terms?  How can one explain it to the five year old involved?</p> <p>The remedy is that the city and county councils could do the administration of admissions.  They could go to the school and that is what happens in England.  </p><p> In terms of children in care, in England all SEN provisions in terms of legislation apply to children in care.  Under this Bill SEN provisions can come under a directive of the National Educational Welfare Board.  This Bill presents great hope and I hope it can provide the equality which we as citizens and a nation, on the basis of what has been put forward by all the advisory boards, are capable of ensuring is put in place.</p></speech>

As this is our third hearing on this Bill, we have discussed many of the issues with which our guests have dealt.  I do not have too many questions but I will ask a few before I pass on to fellow members.</p><p>  The first speaker, Sr. Marie C&eacute;line Clegg, made the point that as many schools are following the procedures proposed already, that what is proposed is excessive.  To flip that back, I would ask if most are doing it already, why would it be such an issue to enshrine it in legislation?  She also referred to the procedures in the Bill for those who wish to remove themselves from religious instruction within the curriculum and that there is not also the right for those who may wish to have it.  She might elaborate on that point.  </p><p>  The points made about children in care are ones the committee has not discussed in depth previously.  They were put very well and provide much food for thought, as do the wider legal arguments which were put.  Our guests have given us much food for thought and I thank them for giving of their time.</p></speech>

As Deputy McConalogue has said, this is our third session of hearings on this Bill.  Many of the issues addressed were raised in the previous two hearings but I believe this is the first time we have touched on the subject of children in care.  As Deputy McConalogue said, there is some thinking for us to do on that.  One of the advantages of dealing with legislation in the way we are doing so now is that we get to discuss and tease out all these issues before the Bill is published.  That is one of the advantages of having groups and individuals appear before the committee.</p><p>  On the appeals process, I do not want to put our guests on the spot as people who sit on a board, but a consistent theme in nearly all the presentations to date has been the need for some review of what is being proposed in the heads of the Bill with regard to the buck stopping at the board of management, having regard to the removal of the section 29 appeals process.  The only option open then to parents is a High Court judicial review, which clearly would not be used as much as the section 29 process.  When the Department officials appeared before the committee we put it to them that what they were proposing did not make sense.  To follow the process, we are now saying that the board of management sets out the policy, the principal implements it or applies it and if a parent disagrees with how that has been implemented or applied, he or she can appeal it to the board of management which set out the policy in the first place.  That does not make sense.  The only option open after that is a High Court judicial review, and there has been much food for thought in that regard.</p><p>  The only concern I have about the removal of the section 29 appeals process is that having regard to the number of appeals, a great number have been upheld.  That proves the value of the process.  When Mr. Loftus from the Department appeared before the committee he was upfront in saying that the appeals process, as it currently operates, is not ideal and is flawed.   Our guests who sit on one of these boards might have opinions on how we can approve an appeals process.  I do not want to put them on the spot in their capacity as members of the board, but they might have opinions on how we can move on from the proposal in the legislation that the board of management is the final appeals process for parents, noting that we are removing the section 29 process.  What are their opinions on that and how do they envisage we can improve the Bill in that area?</p></speech>

We do not do it often enough.  Our education system is something we have inherited from the past.  We as a committee visited Finland and if one talks to anybody in Finland about what is the underpinning ethos of their education system, they all know what it is.  It is equality and they will constantly remind one that it underpins their education system.  I do not think that we have re-evaluated what ethos underpins our education system.  It possibly is the choice of parents - our ethos is what guides our education policy - and that is something with which I personally am not comfortable.</p><p>  I have a problem with the obsession we have in Ireland, for historical reasons, of linking education with religion.  When I became a school principal the first thing I was told was to pare down every decision I would make to make sure that the child was at the centre of it.  Far too often in education we pare down decisions we make -  there are geographical considerations, ethos and many interest groups -  but far too often children are not at the centre of those decisions.  That is why I am pleased that the vast majority of presentations today had children fundamentally at the centre of what we are trying to achieve.</p><p>  I was particularly taken by Mr. Malone's presentation.  He works in this field.  The issue of admissions comes to the head where demand exceeds supply.  A  minority of schools will use their admission policies to keep their schools as mono-cultural and middle class as possible.   There will be school A, school B, and school C and in my constituency school C tends to get all the Traveller children, all the immigrant children and all the children with special needs and the other schools will utilise their admission policy and their ethos to ensure that they stay as mono-cultural and middle class as possible because they are all in competition with each other and they all need the numbers to keep the school going.  Such inter-school rivalry and inter-school competition is another problem in our education system. </p><p>  In terms of the 25% limit, I completely agree with our guests.  With regard to the idea that a son or grandson or a daughter or granddaughter would have priority admission over somebody else, what is proposed in the Bill in this respect is an improvement but it is not perfect and I do not believe anybody would suggest that it is.  The 25% limit is an improvement but I do not believe it is necessary.  If one's father did not go to secondary school or if one comes from another part of the country or from another country, how can one compete for a place in a secondary school on that basis?</p><p>  I am striving, as I believe other people are, for a society and a republic where children go to school together and nothing else is important.  We have not got our head around that yet and everything else seems to be more important.  Mr. McCabe has raised a very important aspect which we have not considered properly up to now.  It is incumbent on all of us to take what he has said on board and to work on it and make sure it is reflected in the Bill because he is talking about the most vulnerable children, provision for whom needs to be reflected in legislation.</p><p>  I thank our guests for their presentations.  The spirit of what we are trying to achieve is acknowledged but the nuts and bolts of it will be more difficult to achieve.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.962" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Sr. Marie C&eacute;line Clegg" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014011500009#K00100"><p>The specific question related to whether there is a need for legislation given my claim that the majority of schools are compliant at the moment in terms of general legislation pertaining in particular to admissions policies.  When the Department of Education and Skills did an audit in 2008 on enrolment policies around the country the outcome was that there was no major concern about admissions policies and their implementation.</p><p>  On the need for legislation, if we take for example the National Educational Welfare Board guidelines on school code of behaviour, I would argue that they are complied with to the letter in practically every situation.  They are a set of guidelines emanating from a piece of primary legislation.  What we object to in our submission is the level of detail and the role of the Minister in regard to every aspect of the admissions policy formulation and implementation.</p><p>  With regard to the implementation question, it is evident that patrons take a huge interest in the manner in which boards of management are fulfilling their statutory responsibility.  If boards of management are made to feel that they do not have a significant autonomous role to play, guided by main underlying principles which the Minister has every right to formulate, that will undermine the role of the board of management as a statutory body.  Boards already act voluntarily.  Patrons also have a role in admissions policies and they also act voluntarily.  They are not funded by the State for the role they fulfil.  It appears that the intention behind the legislation is one of achieving greater inclusiveness, social inclusion and social cohesion but that is achieved as a central tenet of policy and practice not through legislation on its own.</p></speech>

Deputy O&rsquo;Brien asked whether section 29 is flawed.  Does she have any comments on how to reform it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.964" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eithne Reid O'Doherty" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014011500009#K00300"><p>I thank Deputy O'Brien for his question, which I welcome.  I do not necessarily agree that the section 29 process is flawed.  The jurisdiction is narrow in that it is confined to section 29 of the Act and we work within it on enrolment, suspension and expulsion.  We are talking about enrolment today.  One can always improve.  Currently, in terms of the role we play, mediation has not come up in any of the discussions yet, but a mediator can speak to the parties.  There is often an inequality of arms in that one is talking about a school board of management that is quite conversant with the legislation, the system and the language.  On the other hand one might have a parent with literacy difficulties who is not a professional who seeks to get equality and justice for his or her child.  Our job as mediators is to explain the issue and what is happening and to give the parents a voice without being biased or partial.  We redress the imbalance at the mediation stage.  The second stage of the mediation is that we attempt to get a resolution where both parties can win if there is fluidity and they can move towards a resolution.</p><p>  Where there could be improvement is in the provision of more training.  There is an expert panel in place.  Some people are there for quite a while and they have a lot of experience.  One could broaden the remit of the training to include training by the Office of the Ombudsman.  I mentioned Article 42A.  We do not know what it means yet until it has been litigated.  The Ombudsman is the expert on it as the office has carried out research.  I read that 42% or 47% of all complaints coming to the Ombudsman concern education so there is expertise in the office on the matter.  The Irish Human Rights Commission and the Equality Tribunal are other places where training could be accessed.  We do not deal with equality issues.  They are dealt with in a different forum.</p><p>  I am sure the Bill will be enacted with amendments.  The parental rule derogation of 25% will have to be monitored.  Who will do that within the system?  Schools say they are full.  How do we know when that is the case?  Who makes the decision?  We are talking about accountability and transparency.  An external body could review and inspect in certain cases.</p><p>  To go back to the St. Molaga&rsquo;s case, the school said it was full for very objective reasons.  It had made decisions on health and safety grounds and educational practice that it was full and it refused children.  The Supreme Court looked at the case and said that the section 29 committee, as well as having a review jurisdiction would also have a full right of appeal, which means it sat in the role of the board of management when it made the decision to refuse the children.  It is important to retain an independent appeals mechanism to sit in the place of the board of management and to examine how it reached decisions through its policies and processes and to question whether it made the right decision in terms of capacity and the allocations involved at the implementation stage.</p></speech>

Admission to school is one very narrow aspect of the needs of children in care.  There is a wide educational need and a support system does not exist.  The evidence of far superior supports in other countries still leaves children in care with low educational achievement.  The three important issues that affect children in care are protection, education and social integration.  The Bill will not do anything specific for protection or education but it will certainly help children enormously on the social integration side.  Mental well-being is a serious issue for children in care.  It is exaggerated when children are pushed out of their community and they are strangers in their community who spend long, lonely times in their room or during school holidays when they do not have association, which is especially vital for adolescent children.</p></speech>

While I spoke about the Limerick situation it was in the context of the Minister&rsquo;s view on implementing a similar approach in other parts of the country.  It cannot be like everything else because it changes everything once one has a geographical area and one operates on a centralised basis.  One of the things we lack, as Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in said, is transparency, openness and the social mix on which we need to work hard to achieve.  I would be disappointed if we accept 25% as a great move forward.  It is great but why should we not get it right?  I do not see why we cannot get it right from the beginning.  Like the Deputy, I am a firm believer in looking at tradition and seeing how we can improve it.  Otherwise, nothing will ever change.</p><p>  Very few schools would come here today to talk about this unless to get at other schools or because they perceive another school is gaining an advantage.  I come from a position of strength.  I would like the committee to remember that.  I have 150 first-year students every year.  My school is one of those with an excess of students so I have everything to lose by what I say.  I am not griping about my colleagues' schools that are doing this and that.</p> <p>I firmly believe that in going about our business we must consider what is right for the children.  I came from a disadvantaged background and I was given an opportunity to attend a middle class school, which transformed me.  That is the reason I am here today.  I feel very strongly about this issue and I see the advantage in a school such as Col&aacute;iste Chiar&aacute;in, where we have children from a wide mix of backgrounds, in that the disadvantage element of our DEIS status has become less of an issue, which is a wonderful achievement.  I am very proud of that.  I thank the Deputy for his comments.</p></speech>

I just want to say that the members of the panel are the most articulate, passionate, informed and alert group of people to have come before us in my short time as a member of this committee.  I congratulate them on that because that is what this process is supposed to be about.  We then try to influence the Bill by bringing into being the witnesses' suggestions.  I was very impressed by the presentation.  Some of the information was new to my ears, especially the 4,000 places for the young people in care.  I just want to congratulate the witnesses because the work they put into their submissions in terms of their knowledge and what they brought to the committee is unique.  I have learned a great deal and I hope to bring much of what the witnesses said to the way we will try to influence the Bill.</p><p>  I thank Ms Duggan who was so articulate in making her submission but I would caution her slightly against making generalisations.  There were many generalisations in her submission in so far as anti-bullying and the dangers of homophobic bullying are concerned, and patrons of schools and most teachers saying that homosexuality is an object of disorder.

This is a particularly informative debate.  I am sorry I missed the first two submissions but I will read the transcript.  I was delayed at an earlier meeting.</p><p>  I wish to pick up on two specific issues.  Like other members I was intrigued by the points made about children in care.  That was probably more of an oversight from the point of view of the Bill, which reflects the general point the witnesses made that other countries have proper guidelines.  As this is a much broader issue than admissions, we should have an overall system that looks out for these children from an education and health point of view and ensure there is a proper comprehensive policy.  It is a reflection of that lack of priority given to terminal care in general that they were not even thought of when this legislation was being drafted but it is a very important point.</p><p>  The draft scheme as published would address some of the issues.  I was touched by the story Mr. McCabe's daughter told in the two page personal testimony she sent to the committee.  She referred to having to travel from her area to a school in another area and finding herself at home on summer evenings and not knowing any of the children she meets in the shop.  Part of that problem is to do with waiting lists in that she said she was at the bottom of the waiting list for the most local school because she had sought a place too late.  The abolition of waiting lists will address some of that issue but I can still see a problem arising where exceptions are allowed for parents or siblings who attended the school because equally those rules would have put her at a disadvantage.  Is Mr. McCabe asking that the committee would suggest that children in care are put at the top of the list as a priority before other criteria in the legislation-----</p></speech>

The management bodies told us they were nervous about being put in that position.  The boards of management do not want to be the last port of call in deciding on an application only to find they are exposed to legal action because they cannot prove there was proper independence and the whole process becomes nasty.  Equally, not all parents would be comfortable with that and having to trust that it would be given a fresh look if the same people are deciding at a later point in the process.  Do the witnesses believe the existing system should change or what would they recommend as an alternative that would still have those elements?  Independence is crucial, and it must be a fresh process, but is the existing system with its requirement for the Secretary General of the Department to be involved and ultimately sign off on it correct?  Should we be looking at an independent national or regional committee that everybody would have confidence in but that would not be overly cumbersome?</p></speech>

The Bill deletes the previous section 29 but brings in a new power for the National Educational Welfare Board to designate that schools must take not just special needs pupils, but students who have been refused admission because of oversupply or whatever.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  I will come back to them on that point.</p><p>  I am very interested in the common policy idea.  In my area we experienced a problem, which has lessened in recent years, in that there was more demand than supply at primary level due to the boom in young families and so on.  I found that what excluded most people was the first come, first served policy where parents had to put down their child's name when they were born.  The issue that has arisen a lot today is to do with the religious discrimination.  I agree with that in principle but in my area the schools that are the most inclusive in terms of a social mix are the Catholic schools.  We can have a situation where at one end of the spectrum students in Educate Together schools are almost totally white and middle class whereas at the other end of the spectrum 80% or 90% of the children excluded from those schools were immigrants.  The first come, first served policy can discriminate against people who are immigrants, Travellers and those with a social disadvantage, but a common admissions policy might be a way to get schools to co-operate and ensure students can get into a local school if that is what they want.  I would be interested to hear any comments from the witnesses on that.</p><p>  I will call witnesses who did not contribute a second time.  I will start with Ms Duggan who may wish to respond to the issue raised with her.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.983" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derval Duggan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014011500010#L01500"><p>Absolutely.  I have been a practising teacher for ten years.  I taught in France as well as in different types of schools in Ireland quite a number of years ago and more recently and I see the penetration of the religion of the patron in the school, particularly at primary level, as a serious issue.  As a parent one does not know what is happening in one's child's school.  It depends sometimes on the teacher.  One teacher can be quite religious while another is not.  I stand by what I said about the teaching on homosexuality.  I have taught young men in my school who are gay but the school's relationships and sexuality education programme can be delivered through the ethos of the patron.  If the patron is Catholic, that is what is being taught in the school, depending on the teacher, but I would not agree that I am generalising in a vague way.  I am being precise.  I know what happens in schools.  I have the issue of my children not being baptised and not having any religion, yet they have to attend a school with a religious patron because we could not get them into an Educate Together school.</p> <p>I know what it is like to have that conflict at home, to want to support one's child's school and teacher but yet, one's beliefs and values are being disrespected every day.  Only last week I was told to keep my children at home instead of sending them to a service in school when I asked if they simply could be minded somewhere else.  There are many serious issues for parents like myself.  Many people simply go along with it and say they will get them baptised, because it just cuts out those problems or they will go along with the communion because that is what one does.  This is not Iran or Saudi Arabia; we are supposed to be a democracy in the 21st century.</p></speech>

Again, three of the presentations made today pertain to religious discrimination in admissions and what is happening within the schools after children gain entry.  I understand the Chairman has stated previously that many Catholic schools are highly inclusive but in Dublin, the right of a child to enter the school has been taken away.  Children should not be waiting for the privilege of being invited to attend a school under Catholic patronage.  They have the constitutional right and that is not implemented in the Chairman's area or any other area in Dublin.  Many inclusive schools have Catholics-first admissions policies.  Again, when it comes to section 29 appeals, the board of management is the instrument that introduces Catholics-first admissions policies and it is nonsensical to consider that the board of management might be the last port of call in appealing against its own policy.  If section 29 is to be enhanced, fine, but section 29 definitely should be kept because it is working quite well as it stands.  However, it certainly could be enhanced.  I wish to agree with Mr. Gabriel McCabe on a side issue.  Again, this was a very good presentation but it is very serious when a child must leave his or her area to attend school and the isolation that this causes is a serious matter and can last a lifetime.  Children have the right to attend their local school and every child on the road should be allowed to attend his or her local school.  If the religion of their school is not what they wish, they have an entitlement to withdraw.</p></speech>

The principle of diversity, diverse provision, parental choice and the right of a patron to run a particular kind of school all are running through the various issues that have been mentioned today.  I was glad to hear the Chairman mention that voluntary Catholic secondary schools are noted for the level of their inclusion.  In an ideal situation, there would be no problem were we, within this country, to have denominational, multidenominational and non-denominational provision in every area.  However, that is unrealistic in terms of resources and there then is a question of a parent having the right to access what is his or her choice, even if it means travel to another area.  However, I also worry regarding the kind of reference to the effect that if a school is coming from the Catholic perspective, there is little or no respect for those of other faiths and none.  The evidence is there is a high level of respect for those coming into a Catholic school who come either from other faiths or none.  However, as I mentioned in our own submission and again today in the brief introduction, we are talking about a balancing of rights.  I believe it would be agreed that only in countries in which there is a completely non-democratic regime does one not have a recognition of the rights of faith schools to exist in the public space and to be funded.  Consequently, in terms of section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of the Equal Status Act 2000, it certainly presents problems in situations in which there is a stand-alone school.  I believe this to be particularly true in the context of primary schools.  However, as for the possibility in a given area that if there is a Catholic school, and no other Catholic school is available to parents who want a Catholic school, there is considerable pressure on that Catholic school to give preference to those of Catholic denomination.  I am sure this also is true of other denominations but I just happen to be coming from the Catholic perspective, because I am coming today from the Loreto Education Trust.</p></speech>

I favour a model of State multidenominational education.  However, I suppose it is just in terms of how things work out in practice, that it is not just the birth certificate requirement as being the only discrimination.  First come, first served is another one.  I should clarify that while they are inclusive, I am not stating that I agree with that model.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.992" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eukaria O'Grady" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014011500011#M00900"><p>This actually is off my own point but relates to that of Mr. McCabe regarding children in care.  I used to work in admissions in England for children in care.  Senator Power asked how they got priority.  When that Act was changed, one of the first things they did when introducing the law pertained to special needs law.  While the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs, EPSEN, Act for young persons has not yet come into effect, the proposed Bill provides that an education welfare board can direct, in respect of someone who might have a special need.  As Mr. McCabe has proved in his report, children in care have special needs in that sense.  The majority actually do come under the EPSEN provisions for reasons such as mental illness or things that may have happened.  This could be a way of amending the draft Bill quickly to include children in care, which obviously is essential.</p><p>  As for my own point, I really believe the issue is not ethos and religion, as that is something that can be discussed after admissions.  We have an unfortunate position in Ireland, which I believe Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in noted, which is that historically, religion and education went together.  I am aware that in the Stanley letter of 1833 they did not and then everyone pushed for them to be pushed together.  However, it is something to be discussed afterwards, because these are voluntary schools, the majority of which are State-funded and that is the anomaly we have.  There are 1,700 schools that are stand-alone and 80% to 90% of voluntary schools are State-funded by the taxpayers.  The census recorded that the second religion is no religion and this needs to be reflected.  It is just a proof of membership of denomination and the religious instruction can then be discussed after admission, because then the human right is respected.  Ultimately, the admissions Bill is about children's rights to education and above admissions or schools rights, this is about children's rights to education.  It is a human right and as a country, we must show we are doing that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.993" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Malone" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014011500011#M01000"><p>I revert to the issue of the common application system to concur with what has been said there.  I have been a principal for 15 years and this common application system has been there for nearly as long as I have been a principal.  In my experience, a highly positive aspect is that religion has not really played much of a part because one does not apply particularly under those kinds of terms.  I have never heard that being an issue in the context of the 16 schools involved.  However, to revert to my original point, the real problem is in respect of social class and mixture.  It is extraordinary to me and I find it to be incomprehensible that a kid can come to a school from another county altogether while a kid living across the road or in a primary school across the road cannot get into the same school.  As for the section 29 issue, speaking as a practising principal, we all hate them because they are terribly cumbersome and terribly long, there is a great deal of work involved therein and usually it is not really about some of the aspects about which people have spoken today.  Usually, it is about a problem with the admissions being fair in the first instance.  In many cases, it is not really about not having enough room.  Any of the section 29 appeals with which I have been involved certainly have been skewed situations, such as where a child might be living across the road from a particular local school but has been advised he or she is not very clever and another school would be very good at handling the child's particular needs because it is very good with additional resources or whatever, and the child should go there.</p> <p>Perhaps that person cannot then get into my school because we are overwhelmed because we take all comers as such and they take a section 29 appeal, not against the school that is right across the road from them but against ourselves.  Therefore, it is complex.  Fundamentally, religion and other such matters will not be an issue if we think of geography first.  Primarily, within reason, one should be able to go to one's local primary school, and that is what needs to be looked at.</p><p> I would recommend a common application system.  In many ways, there are many advantages to it.  However, it needs to be fine-tuned.  Certainly, I would hope the Minister provides that, whatever about the 25% anywhere else, in the context of a closed group it has to be a common playing field.</p></speech>

First, there is no definition of oversubscription, whether it is when they have two over, ten over or 100 over.  Supply and demand seems to be working in some areas.  Some schools are very popular and people head towards them.  Other schools are less popular and they have free capacity.  There is the issue of dealing with the significant oversubscription in some schools.  Other schools will say it works out over the summer in that parents apply to multiple schools, they have their choices in priority and it works out.  As the school places get filled, come the month of August the child has a place.</p><p>  As for the designation of a place by the National Educational Welfare Board to override a school policy, how will it stand constitutionally?  There is the aspect of ethos and characteristic spirit.</p><p>  As to whether it will work in practice, I do not know.  There is a need for it in some areas to get children into schools.  They take section 29 appeals against multiple schools.  That happens where the child is looking for a place.  If it could be sorted out with some to say the child will go to that school, it would rectify the problem.</p><p>  There is an appeal from that.  The draft does not yet state where the appeal is to.  As a result, one would suppose an appeals body will be retained for this as well as the designation by the special educational needs council.</p><p>  I would recommend to the special education needs council that a quota of places be allocated in each school for children with special needs.  There are some schools that have a very small intake of children with special needs.  It should be representative of the common population of those with special needs.  They all are clustered in some schools.  Some schools will say there is 30% special needs in their schools at second level and some schools have none.</p><p>  On another improvement, I note section 29 appeals were hit but they provide for accountability, transparency and the fostering of good practice.  I have seen over the years that schools get better in their practice when they have been subjected to a hearing.  One improvement would be to publish decisions.  Whatever body is put in place as an independent appeals mechanism, its decisions should be published.  People would know what they were coming to and they would know the reasoning.  It would foster good reasoning within the committee or tribunal.</p></speech>

I take on board Mr. Malone's analysis that these are cumbersome and nobody likes them.  Parents do not like them.  The Department does not even like them.  However, the reality is they are useful as well.  In 2012, there were 355 section 29 appeals.  Some 141 of those were resolved, and I presume that was through the mediation process.  Only 66 appeals were upheld.  Therefore, 147 appeals of decisions in terms of enrolment were not upheld.  In 2010 and 2011, the comparable figures were 171 and 121, respectively.  In that regard, one of the big issues is that while section 29 appeals are cumbersome and time-consuming, there is a value to them.  What is being proposed in the heads of the Bill in terms of getting rid of that appeals mechanism is not best practice and it is something that the Department needs to look at.</p><p>  I still have not heard how we would enhance the process.  Apart from the mediation that Ms Reid O'Doherty outlined, I still have not heard any concrete proposals on how we can enhance the process.  As a principal, has Mr. Malone any ideas on how we can enhance it?  There is a value to it.</p></speech>

That is the point.  Maybe it is the nub of where the solution lies.  Going back to my original point, it is often the case that a section 29 appeal is taken against a particular school but the issue may not be about that school at all.  It might be that the particular child has been brought from Billy to Jack between many different schools and this school happened to be the one that is the subject of the appeal.  First, regarding the board, ombudsman or whoever makes the decision, the number involved should be much smaller.  In my experience of section 29 appeals, the review boards tend to be a bit big.  Second, the person making the decision should be able to explore options beyond the particular school in question because that might not necessarily be the best solution.  If the board, in looking across the city and county of Limerick, for instance, found a solution, it should be able to ask whether it would be a better solution for the child.  I understand that power does not exist at present.  The appeal can only deal with the particular case, parent A against school B, which is restrictive.  There should be scope for the education centre.  We are not utilising the education centres enough, and that is why I mentioned that they could be involved on a lottery basis in terms of applications.</p></speech>

It has been utilising them much more.  The education centre administers the common application system in Limerick, for example.  All applications go into the education centre and they come back out for schools to decide, "Yes" or "No".  The centre administers them.  All that is required is that all schools would have a common, fair and reasonably transparent admissions system and that places would be allocated by the education centre.  That in itself would provide a level of independence and fairness because the education centre represents nobody.  The education centre represents the best interests of all in the locality.  The education centre could be one possibility.  What is more, there should be more power, if a section 29 decision is retained, to come up with solutions that go beyond the particular school and the particular child.</p></speech>

It does a very good job.  That is why I suggest it.  Those centres have no particular axe to grind.  The Limerick one is doing a particular job.  In effect, it is a secretariat.  It is administered by the administrators and there is an integrity from the beginning.  People trust it.  That is the bottom line.</p><p>  All engagements parents have are not with the individual school in Limerick, where there are 16 schools, but with the education centre.  When one applies to a school, the school sends the application to the education centre.  Today, for example, we got a letter from the education centre stating the following students have applied to us as their number one choice.  We will say "Yes" or "No", send them back to the education centre, and by Friday it will move on to the number two choice, and then the number three choice.  It is administered completely in that regard.  That model could be looked at.  It would be transparent and probably alleviate many of the issues we have with section 29 appeals because it would be independent and an education centre or other body would have the scope to think outside the box and think beyond the particular case of a student trying to get into a particular school, because it may not even be the best fit.</p></speech>

One applies to the city and council, and that is what happens with children in care.  The authorities look after the system to ensure a fair and non-arbitrary process.  The only issue I am aware of at present concerns the interview process of schools, particularly secondary schools.  Perhaps this needs to be examined because meeting parents before the child applies stops schools and boards of management from being fair.  I believe the education centres are run by the professional development and training service.  That will be PDSTs here but that is definitely what works in other European countries.</p></speech>

It is very unequivocal in defining the meaning of "highest priority".  I have supplied this information to the committee in digital form.</p><p>  If provision is made for children in care, I ask that the wording be chosen carefully.  If "local school" is referred to, it should be noted it may not be the most appropriate school for the child.  I ask the committee to take that into account.</p><p>  Let me outline a little case history in regard to the policies.  We live approximately 200 yards from our local secondary school, which is built on land that was acquired under compulsory order from my wife's family, who have lived in the area since the 1800s.  My daughter, who is present, and her brother - the first two - were excluded; they did not qualify.  My 12 year old son is due to enter secondary school in 12 months, and he is well down the list of names for admission to the school.  Bearing in mind the approach of extending the waiting lists so schools can work off waiting lists, one should note that in our particular area it will be 12 years before that aspect of discrimination will cease.  Every September, my son, who has special needs, goes back to school and meets 30 familiar faces and one unfamiliar one, a new teacher.  It is at least mid-October before he can settle in and begin to function well within the classroom.  If he is faced with 30 new faces and ten new teaching faces, he will be absolutely devastated.  He relies on the support of his peers who can manage him and, more important, his peers' parents, who are a great support in managing his behaviour and needs and ensuring he is well integrated socially in the community.  He will be excluded if there is no provision for him in this regard.</p><p>  Clearly, I am very much in favour of the committee considering a far more comprehensive education policy for children in care.  On placement, the children are well behind their peers educationally and there is a large gap to be made up.  They then face the barriers of exclusion and social isolation, including the effects of the trauma that resulted in their being brought into care in the first instance.  To overcome all those barriers is a huge challenge for them.  I ask the members to look at the children's particular needs in a broader sense.  I thank all the members for listening to me.</p></speech>

The constitutional provisions in Ireland are stronger than in any other country in Europe.  They are different from those in other countries in Europe.  Parents have a constitutional right to send their children to a religiously exclusive school in Ireland but only one that is privately funded.  Article 42.1 uses the term "according to their means".  Parents do not have a constitutional right to send their children to a religiously exclusive State-funded school.  In fact, the State is obliged to provide free primary education, but only in schools that are open to children of all religious denominations.  The State is not allowed to support in any way a school that has religious exclusion as part of its admissions policy.  The idea of having Catholic, Protestant and multidenominational schools all State supported seems acceptable to most people, but if the State got involved, it would involve religious apartheid in schools, or the separation of children of four years into different religious groups.  The State is excluded from involving itself in that sort of thing.  It is not allowed to support schools that are not open to all religions.</p><p>  The forum on patronage and pluralism has made many recommendations in this regard.  However, all the State seems to be doing at present is focusing on areas where the children of all religious denominations are going to school together.  However, they are going to school together where the patronage of all the schools is Catholic.  At present, the State is taking one of these schools and changing its patronage with a view to making it the non-Catholic school in the area.  If this is done in Dublin, where Catholics-first policies are in every national school under Catholic patronage, there will be an area divided into Catholic and non-Catholic schools.  This is nonsensical and ridiculous, and it completely goes against the thrust of what the forum wanted to achieve.  The forum made eight recommendations that could be implemented without legislation to try to make all schools receiving State support appropriate for taking children of all religious denominations, which is the children's constitutional right.  The State is not doing anything in this regard.  The forum recommended that rule 68 be removed, but this is not being done.  The forum recommended that the Minister raise awareness of the constitutional rights of children, but I do not believe this is being done.  It was recommended that religious education be a separate subject, but this is not being achieved.  It is recommended that religious education and sacramental preparation should not encroach on the general curriculum, but this is not being achieved either.</p></speech>

If it is being considered as a very possible option, it should be examined very carefully.  There are many difficulties associated with it that did not emerge today.  It is not that they were being hidden but that we have not had the opportunity to examine this in great detail.  It is quite possible to have a common application system and yet have soft barriers and a level of non-inclusion.  I appeal to the committee to bear that in mind.</p><p>  A second point that I regret has not arisen today, perhaps because time is limited, concerns the implications for the role of the principal under the emerging legislation.  I am not sure how many people have experience of direct contact with principals at present but the level to which this has the potential to add yet more to their workload is unbelievable.</p><p>  With regard to the requirement that schools be inclusive, if the legislation that emerges emphasises the underpinning of principals, I would go fully with that.  The level of micro-managing, to which I referred, is still an issue.  I recommend to the committee that it examine this very carefully as it will have implications for everybody throughout the system.</p><p>  I appeal that the requirement to be inclusive be balanced with clear recognition of the right of a patron to run a particular type of school, both in the Constitution and in the various EU instruments that have been mentioned today, and the right of parents to choose a particular kind of school.  I ask that we focus on the balance of rights.  The danger is focusing on a particular right while forgetting the overall fabric.</p><p>  In examining the emerging legislation against the background of everything that has been heard today, we should consider its workability in real terms in order we will not emerge with a sledge-hammer arrangement.</p> <p>I used the word "sledge-hammer" deliberately in my initial statement because it would worry me hugely if we did something for all the right reasons but, unfortunately, the outcome does not benefit anyone throughout the system if it is overladen with an overly directive approach.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear and to engage with the other witnesses.</p></speech>

I am happy that it is provided for in the Bill but I do not see how they can be protected under the current integrated curriculum.</p><p>  I would like members to look forward 20 or 30 years in the context of what kind of education system we want.  If this Bill proceeds as drafted, it will perpetuate religious discrimination.  As previous speakers mentioned, we will end up with a two-tier system.  Parents want the best quality of teaching and learning for their children and they want the school with a good reputation.  The National Parents Council has conducted surveys and the patron is not the most important thing for us as parents; it is whether our children are happy and will receive quality teaching and learning.  I hope this does not happen but I am afraid that it will transpire that the schools that have been operating for a long time with a good reputation will remain under religious patronage and all the new schools that are currently being built will be run by everybody else or the people who are not happy to pretend they are of a religion and there will be segregation.  Academic segregation, which is also an issue currently, will worsen.  That would be a disgrace in the middle of the 21st century.  I would like members to think ahead about what we want for our children.</p></speech>

It has been brought up <i>ad infinitum</i>as this stage but there will be litigation.  The bottom line is boards of management will find themselves judicially reviewed or sued.<br />The independent appeals mechanism could be enhanced with great involvement of society and greater knowledge.  I have thrown out some ideas but such a mechanism needs to be retained.  The publishing of decisions is a safety valve.  They are written, one can refer to them and there is good reasoning.  It is good practice.<br />I refer to equality issues.  The Bill provides that one must provide for such issues but that is superfluous.  The Equal Status Act 2000 covers this.  Currently, there are tensions, which have been raised during the meeting, around the religious aspect and the constitutionally provided denominational aspect of schools as opposed to the child's right to attend any establishment.  Then there is the protection of section 7(3)(<i>c</i>) of this Act.  Where does one refuse to protect the denomination aspect of the school?  There will be legal change in this regard and I can see it coming through the High Court invoking European legislation.  Religion is only one discriminatory ground that has been addressed.  We are still looking at the Traveller situation and the Stokes case, which is under appeal to the Supreme Court, and at disability.  Gender has not been fully addressed either.  I would like the debate on equality issues opened up.  Policies should be put before boards of management and they should be supported in regard to what they want to say in them and how they run their school.  The right to education includes access.  Article 42.4 refers to access.  How will one receive people into one's school and how will participation be fostered?  The debate needs to be opened up.</p></speech>

There are drawbacks and no principal is probably happy with it but then no system is perfect.  Where there are drawbacks, they mostly relate to inequality in terms of a common admissions policy.  In this country in the 21st century surely we can agree what are the fundamentals, having taken up any of the issues raised by all of us.  We all want the best for our children.  We want equal access and we want to give them the best, regardless of religion.  Why can we not agree on fundamentals through the Department and the vehicle that will shape the future of our children's lives and have that widely accepted across the board?  From that point on, we would probably achieve diversity, which we are all looking for, and equality.</p><p>  Many of the issues that have been raised, including section 29, would become less important if all schools applied fair fundamentals.  I am sorry they are not in place at the moment.  The 25% provision is a particular problem for me.  If I was in Hong Kong, my son would have right of entry to the school I attended in Limerick and a child living across the road from it would not.  If people look at this in those stark terms, that will explain what 25% means in reality.  That is a significant percentage.</p><p>  I am in a DEIS school.  In the context of the common agreed admissions issue, what would be better than DEIS kids attending all sorts of schools bringing their DEIS funding with them rather than putting them into a ghetto-type situation and giving them loads of resources.  I wonder whether that is good value given the financial accountability in the State because very often one is compounding disadvantage upon disadvantage.  Children should be given an opportunity to attend different schools and, through parental choice or otherwise, to explore other options and to bring the DEIS funding them to give them the extra edge they need.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1034" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014011500002#A00700"><p>I am pleased to have the opportunity to appear before the select sub-committee today in connection with the 2014 Estimates for my Department and for the offices under the ambit of my Department, including the Revenue Commissioners, the Appeal Commissioners and the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p><p>  I record my thanks to all the officials at the Department who worked together to continue to meet all the demands placed on them in 2013, including delivering a very successful Presidency agenda, introducing a budget under the new European cycle, positively interacting with the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council and managing the elements of the troika programme to leave the country in a position where we could successfully exit the three year EU-IMF programme of financial support, an economic transformation that allows us to remain unique, at this stage, in the EU and eurozone.</p><p>  The Department has achieved important objectives during the year in a number of policy areas as targeted in the Statement of Strategy 2011-2014.  Our success in achieving these objectives was facilitated, in large part, by changes in how we worked.  This included the development of an integrated business planning process, which ensured resources were directed towards key priorities, the filling of senior appointments and a focus on training and development to ensure staff are appropriately skilled to meet the challenges.  This thrust will continue during 2014.</p><p>  We are committed to increasing transparency and openness, including regular reporting against targets, and outreach to our national and international stakeholders to better inform our policy development.  The statistics bear this out.  During 2013, my Department received 5,866 parliamentary questions, processed 220 freedom of information requests and processed 302 Government memos.  In addition, my Department facilitated a number of consultation fora to extend the scope of our external interfaces.</p><p>  In line with this we have enhanced our communications strategy, launched a renewed website, and are publishing more of our policy papers and discussion documents, including detailed analysis on the effects of the pharma-cliff, an international tax strategy, and a report on the research and development tax credit review, with the goal of ensuring the Department's message reaches a wider audience and generates informed debate.  The report card that we update weekly has proven a very useful means of communicating effectively with both the public and professionals interested in our continuing progress.</p><p>  Before we commence our discussion of the 2014 Estimates, I would like, if I may, to touch briefly on the key outputs of the Department during 2013.</p> <p>Looking briefly at initiatives in the banking sector, 2013, it is worth remembering, saw the delivery of a number of policy initiatives as well as a reduction in the State's exposure to the banking sector.  During the year, my Department extinguished the eligible liabilities guarantee, the so-called bank guarantee, which has generated some &euro;4.3 billion in fees and income for the State.  My Department also returned some &euro;4.5 billion to the State, through the successful sale of Irish Life, along with an additional dividend, the sale of contingent capital, CoCo, notes and preference shares in Bank of Ireland, both of which were sold at a slight profit.  In addition, the entry of IBRC into special liquidation enabled a restructuring of the promissory notes, with associated benefits for the Exchequer.</p><p> We have seen the State, through the NTMA and the banks themselves, successfully access the international capital markets through bonds and, in the case of the banks, covered bonds and securitisations, at lower margin premia that reflect the significant progress that has been made.  Across the broader financial landscape, legislation has been introduced promoting reform of the credit union sector with the establishment of the ReBo, NewERA was established and legislation to establish the strategic investment fund has commenced and will continue to be a focus during 2014.</p><p> The Government recognises that SMEs are the lifeblood of our economy and play a crucial role in employment growth.  A key priority of the Government is to ensure an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy.  In terms of bank lending, both AIB and Bank of Ireland had a &euro;4 billion lending target in 2013.  The recent Red C demand survey indicates that the banks are approving 80% of credit applications, which is in line with their European counterparts.  For those businesses which have their credit applications turned down, the Credit Review Office continues to provide a vital service and is overturning 55% of bank refusal decisions.  I increased the CRO appeals threshold from &euro;500,000 to &euro;3 million in budget 2014 to ensure a broader range of SMEs could utilise this facility.</p><p> The access to finance chapter of Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contained a number of commitments to assist the SME sector, which the SME State bodies group, chaired by my Department, has overseen to completion.  These included the monitoring and implementation of the ten point tax plan for the SME sector; the recruitment of additional reviewers to the CRO; and the establishment by the National Pensions Reserve Fund of three SME funds to make &euro;850 million available through the provision of equity, credit, and restructuring investment.  In addition to some positive developments in the area of bank lending, the Red C survey also indicated that 2013 saw an increase in the levels of employment, profitability and turnover in the SME sector and I will strive to ensure these positive trends continue into 2014 and beyond.</p><p> Attracting increased flows of funding from capital market and institutional investors and effectively channelling it towards long-term investment and the SME sector must be a core policy priority for Europe.  This is why we made non-bank funding a key policy priority of our recent EU Presidency.  The Secretary General of my Department was appointed co-chair of the Commission's high level expert group on SMEs and infrastructure financing.  The group&lsquo;s final report, Finance for Growth, contains a broad suite of recommendations for European policymakers that are designed to diversify funding for SMEs.  Ensuring viable SMEs have access to a stable supply of credit is also a central element of the medium-term economic strategy.  In particular, the strategy outlines the importance of developing a more diversified and stable financial system.  Such a system must be premised on a competitive and profitable banking sector and increased direct capital market financing of enterprises, including SMEs, with greater involvement by institutional investors, multilateral banks and alternative financial markets.</p><p> Another area in which we made progress, and where it will be important to make even further significant progress this year is the problem of mortgage arrears.  A comprehensive strategy to tackle the problem is in place and the implementation of this strategy is of prime importance.  In that regard, the new personal insolvency system and the full implementation of the Central Bank mortgage arrears resolution targets, MART, process are fundamental.  As statutory regulator, the Central Bank has the power, from both a prudential and consumer protection perspective, to require banks to address mortgage arrears cases on their books meaningfully.  It will no longer be acceptable for banks to apply short-term solutions to cases where there has been a fundamental and long-term change in the position of the borrower.  Durable long-term restructures will have to be applied, having regard to the circumstances of individual cases.  The mortgage arrears data for the end of November 2013 in respect of the six MART banks, published by my Department on 9 January, show there is an increasing number of permanent restructures being put in place by banks.  However, it will be necessary for banks to build on this significantly in 2014.  The fact that the new insolvency frameworks, in particular the personal insolvency arrangement framework to address unsustainable mortgages or other secured debt, are operational should provide a further incentive to banks to move to address the mortgage problem in a definitive way this year.</p><p> My Department also took a lead role in the roll out of the national payments plan.  This plan, which was approved by the Government in April 2013 and is overseen by the Central Bank, aims at making savings of up to &euro;1 billion annually to the economy by increasing the use of electronic forms of payment such as debit cards and electronic banking.  The year 2013 saw a number of initiatives under this umbrella, including a rounding trial to test public reaction to removing 1 and 2 cent coins from change.  This trial was undertaken over two months, up to mid-November, and the Central Bank is finalising a report on the outcome, which I expect to receive shortly.</p><p> The project team also launched eDay, the date in September 2014 when Departments and agencies will discontinue the use of cheques in their dealings with businesses.  A pilot project was undertaken to test reaction to a standard bank account, which would be attractive to the financially excluded, and the Government has recently published a paper on the outcome of this project.</p><p> A major initiative at the European level is the single European payments area, SEPA.  This comes into effect from 1 February 2014 and will considerably ease cross-border payments between EU countries, providing a major incentive to increased business activity.  Members will be aware that the European Commission has published a proposal to allow an additional six months transitional period for all payments, up to 1 August 2014.  Agreement of the European Council and of the European Parliament to this proposal is awaited.</p><p> Ireland held the 7th Irish Presidency of the Council of the European Union between January and June of last year and the Department of Finance played a lead role in many areas of what was widely acknowledged to have been a very successful Presidency.  I presided over six formal ECOFIN Councils and one highly successful informal ECOFIN in Dublin.  The Presidency had significant achievements in its engagement with the European Parliament and with the European institutions.  Running a successful Presidency has helped improve the relationship between Ireland and Europe and its institutions which we can build on to improve further Ireland's influence in Europe.</p><p> In terms of achievements, agreement was reached on a number of important dossiers.  In economics, the final part of the economic governance measures for the eurozone, the two-pack regulation, was agreed, and we successfully managed the European semester process.  These are important in ensuring financial stability in the eurozone.  In financial services, we prioritised work on the banking union proposals designed to break the link between the financial sector and the sovereign.  The main achievements were agreement on the capital requirements directive and regulation, the single supervisory mechanism and banking recovery and resolution.</p> <p>There was also agreement on a range of other financial services dossiers, for example, the regulation on markets in financial instruments, MiFIR and the markets in financial instruments directive, MiFID.</p><p> In taxation we obtained a decision on enhanced co-operation to allow for discussion on the financial transaction tax.  Anti-fraud measures were agreed for VAT.  There was agreement on Council conclusions to combat fraud and tax evasion and on adoption of a negotiating mandate on savings taxation agreements agreed for third countries.  My Department also significantly contributed to work on the multi-annual financial framework for 2014-2020, achieved agreements on other EU budget measures and set the stage for further budget discussions during the Lithuanian Presidency.</p><p> The year 2013 represented another significant stage on our road to economic recovery.  Although economic data from the first half of last year were somewhat disappointing, recent figures have been more encouraging.  The economy returned to growth in the second quarter of 2013 and the Central Statistics Office quarterly national accounts released before Christmas show that in quarter 3, GDP grew by 1.5% in quarterly terms.  Revisions to the data also show a stronger second quarter, with plus 1% quarter-on-quarter than previously estimated.  In year-on-year terms, GDP grew by 1.7% in the third quarter of the year.  Overall, the figures are in line with the budget forecast of modest growth of 0.2% last year, with growth expected to pick up to 2% this year.</p><p> Given the open nature of the Irish economy, our economic performance is heavily reliant on external developments.  Private consumption still fell in year-on-year terms in the third quarter of 2013 but exports rose.  The growth in exports occurred in spite of the patent cliff in the pharmaceutical sector, which is still impacting merchandise exports.  However, the effect on employment is likely to be limited.  The domestic economy growth, in particular recent growth in construction, is welcome.  Labour market performance has been positive recently and appears to have de-coupled from GDP.  Employment in the third quarter increased by 1.2% or 22,500 relative to quarter 2 of 2013, marking a fourth successive increase in quarter-on-quarter terms.  As a result, employment in the third quarter of last year was 3.2% or 58,000 persons higher than in the same quarter of 2012.  This is the largest annual increase since quarter 3 of 2007.</p><p> Ireland exited the EU-IMF programme of financial support on 15 December and did so without the need for a prearranged backstop.  Our exit from the programme is the result of the commitment and determination of the people to get the job done.  The programme has met its key objectives, namely, to put the public finances back on a sustainable path, to restore financial sector feasibility, to return Ireland to financial market funding and to raise growth potential.  The economy is recovering, the public finances are under control, the banking system is restructured and well-capitalised and, most important, jobs are being created.  Market confidence in Ireland is high and we made a full return to normal market funding earlier this month.  This is an important milestone on Ireland's recovery and will send a further signal that Ireland is recovering, returning to normal market funding and building for a sustainable future.</p><p> The recently published December Exchequer returns saw tax revenues grow by 3.2% year on year.  Strong income tax receipts from PAYE workers and the self-employed are encouraging and are consistent with recent data on the recovering labour market.  Additionally, expenditure remains below profile in most Departments.  These returns give confidence that, once again, Ireland will meet and indeed better its fiscal target in 2013.</p><p> Looking to the future, budget 2014 targeted a general government deficit of 4.8% of GDP.  While all the targets under the excessive deficit procedure have been met to date, 2014 will be the first year we will be actively seeking to overachieve the target.  This overachievement will form a prudent buffer to allow for any possible external shocks to the economy and will reassure the markets of Ireland's steadfast commitment to restoring the sustainability of the public finances.</p><p> Within the Department we established a risk and stability unit, which is responsible for monitoring internal and external risks and proposing corrective action as appropriate.  In light of our emergence from the EU-IMF programme, we are keen to remain vigilant, learn the lessons from the past and continue to embed a risk-focused culture within the Department.  The work of this unit as well as related changes to the governance structures of the Department will ensure my Department maintains a balanced approach towards developments, nationally and internationally, as they occur.</p><p> The business of the committee today relates to the funding allocation sought for the Department of Finance group of Votes.  For 2014 this totals &euro;358 million and compares with a 2013 Vote group total of &euro;362 million.  Of this, some &euro;31 million relates to Vote 7, which provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department of Finance, a reduction of &euro;2 million compared with 2013.  This arises largely because 2013 contained once-off costs relating to the EU Presidency.</p><p> Almost 60% or &euro;19.2 million of the gross Estimate for my Department is provided to cover salaries and allowances, with a further &euro;4 million to cover facilities and non-pay administrative costs.  A large portion of this relates to over 70 of the total complement of staff who work in shared services, that is, payroll, pension, banking and financial management services to other Departments.  We expect to see these costs reduce in the coming years as these services transition to the shared services Vote.  My Department has utilised economies of scale in these areas, delivered significant savings to date and worked within a prudent budget in 2013.</p><p> The remainder of the gross Estimate is provided to enable the Department to widen its engagements at an international level, to be proactive in addressing policy issues and to secure a robust banking system and economic climate.  The focus will be on providing support and expertise to continue the policy of promoting domestic lending, analysis of the property market and developments within the international financial services sector, a review of which is taking place that the Department has been asked to lead.</p><p> Vote 8, the budget of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General, is applied towards a single programme with the following outputs: auditing the financial statements of public bodies and issuing audit opinions; control of issues from the Central Fund; and examining and reporting on financial management arrangements in public bodies and the value for money of public services.  The committee will be aware that the Comptroller and Auditor General also assists the Committee of Public Accounts in it scrutiny of the public finances.</p><p> Vote 9, Office of the Revenue Commissioners, has requested a budget allocation of &euro;320 million, a reduction of 2% compared with the 2013 allocation of &euro;323 million.  The year 2013 saw the successful implementation of the local property tax, the largest self-assessment system in Ireland to date.  The 2013 LPT compliance rate currently stands at 91%, with &euro;242 million collected in respect of 2013 and &euro;76 million collected in respect of 2014.</p><p> Revenue achieved similar high levels of compliance for the other taxes and duties which are placed in its care and management, while also providing a high quality customer service to facilitate taxpayers in meeting their tax obligations.  It extended its range of digital services for compliant businesses, for example, the new diesel rebate system, met broader environmental changes, such as the single euro payments area introduction, while at the same time reducing the administrative burden on business.  However, non-compliance is an ever-present challenge for Revenue and significant resources are now deployed to target risk throughout all sections of the economy.  Through targeted and risk-focused compliance interventions, Revenue continued to pursue those who do not meet their tax and duty obligations.</p> <p>To detect those involved in tax evasion, shadow economy and smuggling activities Revenue used "big data" and innovative technology such as social network analysis and predictive analytics.  It is important to underline the crucial role played by an effective and modern tax and customs administration in achieving the Government's fiscal consolidation programme and Ireland's exit from the bailout and, in this regard, I would like to commend Revenue for their achievements in 2013.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and I commend the Estimates for the finance group of Votes to the committee.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1039" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014011500005#D00300"><p>I would like to thank the Minister for his comprehensive statement and welcome him and his officials here today for the Estimates meeting.</p><p>  In his statement the Minister strongly emphasised the positives and there have been positive events in the past 12 months, principally the exit from the troika programme, the National Treasure Management Agency's, NTMA, recent access to the markets, the progress in the public finances and the quarter three figures for employment from the Central Statistics Office, CSO, are particularly positive.  There is, however, also a negative side and the country faces significant risks under several headings that the Minister covered in his opening statement.  He painted quite a rosy picture on banking whereas several market participants have announced their departure from Ireland.  There is a significant lack of competition in banking for personal customers and for small and medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, and even among the banks that the State owns, both Permanent TSB, PTSB, and AIB await approval from the European Commission of their restructuring plans.</p><p>  There is the major outstanding issue of the liquidation of the Irish Bank Resolution Corporation, IBRC, and we await a comprehensive update on how that process is going and what the net impact will be for taxpayers once the loan portfolios are sold on or transferred into the National Asset Management Agency, NAMA.  There was no reference to the lack of progress on implementing the agreement made at the June 2012 summit to separate bank debt from national sovereign debt.</p><p>  The Minister referred to the mortgage arrears crisis and there are signs of increased activity within the banks to try to deal with that problem but progress is far too slow.  We need to see greater emphasis on rolling out long-term restructuring of mortgages that are in difficulty.  People who need to access the new insolvency service encounter very real difficulty in doing so because of the fees being charged by the personal insolvency practitioners, PIPs, and when their own income levels fall below the guidelines issued as part of that process.  NAMA was not discussed although its stress tests for the banks will come up this year.  The Department faces major challenges and there are challenges on the wider economic front in 2014.  I look forward to discussing the Estimates with the Minister and his officials.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1040" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014011500005#D00400"><p>I welcome the Chairman, the Minister and his officials to our first meeting of 2014.  I hope they had a nice break before facing into the challenges that 2014 presents.  Deputy Michael McGrath touched on many of these and there are probably more, including ones that have not yet been identified but will raise their heads over 2014.  When we gather here in 2015 we will have to have seen big progress in four key areas.  I do not wish to deny any of the other issues affecting NAMA&rsquo;s stress testing of the banks but there are four issues on which the Department, and the Minister as its driver, need to see big progress.  First is the mortgage arrears crisis.  It is deeply depressing and frustrating that we are so far into a financial crisis, with the collapse of property prices and the number of people in mortgage arrears, yet the latest figures from the Department of Finance show that 83% of people in arrears have not received a long-term sustainable offer.  That is not acceptable and should have been resolved long before now.  I engage with the banks as an Opposition spokesperson and it is clear that the energy does not exist within them to resolve the crisis.  We cannot continue to drag our heels down this road.  There are far too many families looking for solutions.  It is important not only for them, for their financial situation and mental health, but also for the banks themselves.  The stress tests may pose a major challenge for those institutions later on this year.</p><p>  The second point is the need for real growth in the economy.  The growth projections put forward by the Department of Finance, since the Minister took office almost three years ago, have not all been met.  The original growth projections for where this economy should be today have not been met.  My analysis is that the austerity policy of this Government has strangled the potential for growth.  I am conscious that external factors in respect of our trading partners have also had a major impact.  We can refer to the statistics and projections in 2011 for growth last year which simply have not materialised.  Any bit of growth is to be welcomed.  We need to grab it with both hands.  If we were to turn back the clock a couple of years and project the levels of growth, unemployment, long-term unemployment, emigration, mortgage arrears that we have today I do not believe we would have followed the policy direction that was followed because the consequences are too great.</p><p>  The third area in which we need to see major progress is the national debt.  The key point is to ensure that we have an outcome from the agreement made at that famous June summit to separate bank and sovereign debt.  It is my view, and I hope I will be proved wrong, that the Minister is giving up the ghost on that agreement and that it is more likely that the Department&rsquo;s policy agenda is to make the banks as profitable as they can be, which involves not writing off debt, increasing fees and what not, and trying to get some external partner to buy into the banks, instead of fulfilling the commitment of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, to pay the money back to the State that we put into it as a result of our decision to save the rest of the European banking system from the contagion. </p><p>  Many Government spokespersons have painted a rosy picture of what is to be presented in budget 2015 but unless I am wrong the Minister still plans to take &euro;1 billion from this year&rsquo;s budget.  The one simple thing that has been missing from this process is fairness.  There are ways, as we have shown each year, to reduce the deficit to the required amount but to do so in a fair manner that would sustain growth.  Those issues, mortgage distress, growth in the economy, the national debt and banking, and fairness need to be resolved.</p><p>  This year this committee and the Department will hopefully face the challenge of the banking inquiry.  I am sure that many people are deeply frustrated that we have not had one heretofore.  My stated position, and that of our party, is that the public really wants those who were involved in inappropriate behaviour to be held accountable before the courts, not before this committee.  There has lately been some movement in that direction and justice will take its course.  It is deeply worrying that two of the eight documents on the recapitalisation of the banks have gone missing in the Department of Finance.  I hope that the Minister can shed some light on that.  We are here considering the Estimates for the Department and I am not casting any aspersions on the staff in that Department because I have seen their work in dealing with the challenges facing the State.  However, over a period of two months before the bank guarantee and four months after that only eight items of communication passed between the governors or chairpersons of the covered institutions and the Minister for Finance, two of which have disappeared or cannot be found. </p> <p>The only reason we know those two cannot be found is that the document was requested under the freedom of information provisions on two separate occasions.  I worry about documents that were never requested under freedom of information.  If the journalist in 2009 had never requested that document and if I had not made a freedom of information request for the correspondence between the governors and chairpersons of the banks and the Minister for Finance during that period those documents would simply not have seen the light of day and they would not have been recorded.  I ask the Minister to explain to the committee how documents of that nature could go missing.</p></speech>

For example, he changed his mind about one of his requests and I changed the agenda to facilitate him.  If he wishes to request that this issue be raised I will accommodate him, but I ask him not to say, please, that I am shutting him down when I ask him to desist from raising an issue.  I am not shutting him down and I have never shut down a debate in this committee.  I ask that we return to dealing with today's agenda.

However, it is my genuine belief that this is an issue because as we consider the budget for the Department of Finance in greater detail, including training and human resources costs, we need to know if there is a need for additional resources such as additional IT facilities in order to ensure that no sensitive key documents about very important decisions for this State could be misplaced within the Department.  It is a relevant concern.  I have said my piece.</p></speech>

Expenditure on travel and subsistence has increased by 19%; expenditure on post and telecommunications has increased by 36%; and expenditure on consultancy and other services has increased from &euro;25,000 to &euro;112,000.  A percentage increase of zero is given, but I do not understand how that reflects the figures, which show an increase.  I ask the Minister to shed some light on this expenditure.  I note the explanations provided in the document with regard to travel and subsistence expenditure, which is broken down under costs such as ministerial drivers, activities related to EU and World Bank business and other miscellaneous travel.  It amounts to an increase of nearly &euro;130,000, which equates to 19%.  Ireland held the Presidency of the Council of the European Union last year and many meetings were held here.  I expect the Minister and departmental officials had to travel to attend numerous meetings, but it seems that the expected travel expenditure is quite substantial.</p><p>  The figure for miscellaneous and incidental expenditure has decreased by 4%.  However, the provisional outturn shows an increase of &euro;120,000, which means it is intended to spend more this year than was spent last year.  I understand this is due to upskilling and training and development for members of staff and also website development costs.  How many staff have been involved in this training to date?  The Minister explained that the pressure of work on the Irish Presidency last year meant that many staff were unable to participate in training courses at that time.  I ask the Minister to comment on that point.</p><p>  I have a query about the expenditure on consultancy services, which has increased from &euro;25,000 to &euro;112,000.  I refer to page ten, which shows that the provisional outturn on this expenditure was zero in 2012 and 2013, meaning there was no expenditure on consultancy.  Has a contract been provided to some consultant for &euro;112,000?  It would seem that the clear beneficiaries are the consultants under every single administrative heading.  I note expenditure on consultancy services under headings A, B, C, D and E of more than &euro;5.1 million.  The consultancy costs incurred by Irish Water are the news of the day.  I ask how the Department of Finance believes it needs to spend more on consultancy this year than in previous years.</p></speech>

The Estimates for 2013 and 2014 reflect the Department's increased interaction at European level.  Our strategic target is to enhance engagement with external stakeholders and to improve our influence with relevant ministries, potential investors, rating agencies and so on.  We are undertaking an increased EU workload in the financial services area.</p> <p>Some of the additional external engagement was achieved in tandem with the Presidency meetings during the course of 2013.  The additional costs were not as I anticipated for 2014, because travel costs relating to the Presidency were captured under the Presidency subhead for 2013, while they are under the travel and subsidence subhead for 2014.</p><p> The administrative consultancies subhead, which is projected at &euro;112,000 for 2014, relates to a particular human resources issue.  For privacy reasons, the issue itself must remain confidential, but I can say that it is non-recurring.  In other words, it is a once-off human resources issue for which that sum has been set aside to settle it.</p></speech>

This is not directly tied to the Minister as a line Department issue, but the role of this sub-committee is tied to the Department in many ways.  One of the criticisms that was made of the Government prior to our entering the bailout programme was the evidence of what might be described as a level of disconnectedness with Europe, including poor attendance records at EU meetings by Irish parliamentarians and officials.  We have now exited the bailout programme.  Looking at the outputs, cognisance is given to the need to maintain a centre-of-Europe approach in dealing with these issues.  How does the Minister see that materialising and what are the nuts and bolts of the strategy?</p></speech>

That compliance requirement is met, in the first instance, by the relevant Departments and, in particular, the Department of Finance and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  There is then a reporting system to the Commission, with the latter assessing whether a sovereign has complied with the conditions of the various new arrangements.  The Commission then brings its assessment to be placed on the agenda of ECOFIN.  I often meet with the sub-committee prior to ECOFIN meetings to discuss where we are at and where we are going.  There is an opportunity for the sub-committee at that stage to have an input into the process.</p></speech>

We are a functioning member state that is not in a bailout programme.  Country-specific recommendations will be issued to us as part of that, very much based upon what is best for the country and what might be decided in that regard.  Those recommendations are addressed to the Irish Parliament for discussion, not just at Government level but in terms of the entire Parliament engaging with the process.  Does the Minister envisage a role for this sub-committee, working with the Department, to provide some of that input?</p></speech>

In the case of the excessive deficit procedure, to give a practical example, our commitment is to get under 3% by 2015.  It is regarded across the eurozone that a deficit is in excess if it is over 3% of GDP.  We are getting into the mainstream, therefore, once we get under 3%.  If at any stage there was a drift above that - say, for example, as a consequence of budgetary procedures or internal or external events, we brought in a deficit of 3.5% in 2017 - then we must report that to the Commission and the latter will evaluate it and put it on the agenda at ECOFIN.  The Commission would state that this country was in excess and would also make country-specific recommendations as to how we could rectify the situation.  My intention would be to signal the situation in that regard in advance of ECOFIN meetings to the Chairman and the clerk so that members could discuss it at the sub-committee in advance of the meeting.  As it stands, I have an agreement to meet the sub-committee four times per year.</p></speech>

This is one of the areas that was flagged up in terms of the Department not being fit for purpose at the time of the crash - that we did not have the necessary skills mix among staff.  Given what the Minister has said at previous meetings about what has been achieved in this regard, I am grappling with the figures relating to consultancy and other services, which are there in black and white.  We have been told that the provision of this programme in 2014 covers "consultancy and other costs associated with EU and international policy".  In fact, &euro;350,000 is being spent on consultancy and other services for the purposes of exploring options to improve the growth potential of the economy in order to reduce the level of unemployment.</p> <p>In view of the fact that there are now so many economists in the Department of Finance, why are we still obliged to outsource this type of work?  Why are we setting aside a total of &euro;720,000 - ten times what was spent last year - for consultancy and other services?  It appears that &euro;350,000 will be spent on consultancies.  Will the Minister indicate, in the context of other services, what the international assignee programme on which &euro;100,000 is being spent involves?  It is indicated that the Department of Finance is paying for two officials to serve at the IMF and the EBRD.  Are these permanent positions and will the &euro;120,000 allocated be spent each year?</p><p> A further &euro;150,000 is allocated for the transformational project within the Department.  The Minister states that this money will be used to develop improved governance, risk and compliance frameworks, undertake business process re-engineering and develop and improve work flows and controls.  This goes to the heart of what I said earlier and in respect of which the Chair challenged me.  Does what is involved relate to recording the receipt of documents within the Department, etc.?  There is a one-line explanation provided for a spend of &euro;150,000.  Will the Minister provide some further detail?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1079" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014011500008#G00200"><p>Departments tend to be generalist in nature.  It would not be possible to retain on an in-house basis all the necessary levels of expertise that might potentially be required, particularly in respect of once-off functions.  When, for example, we dealt with the arrangements relating to the promissory notes, there was a great deal of expertise in-house and there was also much expertise in the Central Bank.  Expertise is required elsewhere as well.  A matter such as the liquidation of IBRC would not be something which would usually come across the desks of the relevant civil servants in the Department.  Again, it was necessary to seek external expertise.  In addition, legal advice is included under the various consultancy headings.  We require such advice from time to time.  There are very tricky issues that arise in respect of the banks, in particular, and we must also defend cases taken against us.  Many cases are taken against the Department.  Some of these are dropped before they reach the courts but others go all the way to the courts.  There is a constant process.</p><p>  If we moved to an alternative model and argued that all expertise should be retained in-house, then we would have on the payroll any number of people on whose services we would only be occasionally obliged to call during the course of a year.  This would mean that the Department would be carrying a great deal of dead weight.  The model is to have general practitioners who are good at a range of things operating in Departments on a day-to-day basis.  If, however, it is necessary to call upon some very specialised expertise, then it is hired in.  It is sometimes not possible to know in advance when such expertise might be required.  That is why I cannot indicate, in explicit terms, the areas in respect of which it will be necessary to consult in 2014.  We are, therefore, making a provision on the basis of historic data.  If that provision is required, we will spend it.  If it is not required, then there will be a saving at the end of the year.</p><p>  In the context of the matter to which the Deputy refers, namely, why it is necessary to seek external economic expertise, it was decided that an external economic view - to complement the Department's own economic expertise - would be sought as in input to the process.  The development of the medium-term economic strategy is a significant item of work and it is not something which the Department would do regularly.  Accordingly, we are of the view that it is appropriate to seek the views and expertise of professional economists and stakeholders, both within and outside the service.  In the development of the policy, the consultants co-ordinated closely with the Department of Finance in the preparation of their report.  The draft findings of that report were shared with those Departments which contributed to the preparation of the medium-term economic strategy.  That is the process which obtains.  The external consultancy services, including those of an eminent economist, in this case were requisitioned in the aftermath of a tendering process.</p><p>  There are qualified economists within the Department.  At present, 67 individuals with economic qualifications are on the staff of the Department.  Those qualifications range from certificate level right up through diplomas, primary and postgraduate degrees and even a doctorate in pure economics.  However, very few of the people who possess such qualifications would describe themselves as professional economists.  They are permanent civil servants who, as part of their further education, studied economics.  I studied economics in university but I would never describe myself as a professional economist.  I know the basics of economics because it was one of the subjects I took for my degree but that does not make me an economist.  There are not that many professional economists within the Department.  However, there are 67 people who have a competence in economics because they studied the subject to one level or another in the course of their further education.</p><p>  There are always matters in respect of which one needs either additional input or the specialised expertise necessary to check what is happening.  If one strips out the legal fees - much of which we recoup from the banks in any event - one will see that our allocation for consultancy services is quite modest and reasonable in the context of the model used across the public service.</p></speech>

The liquidation of the IBRC and legal challenges relating to the banking sector come under other headings with which we will deal presently.  The briefing note provided indicates that the &euro;350,000 relates to the development and implementation of the medium-term economic strategy.  We know that the Department issued two tenders for consultancy in respect of developing the strategy.  I am seeking to discover if it will be hiring a group of consultants to implement that strategy.  The impression one is given is that this is the case and that the cost will be &euro;350,000.  The briefing note does not mention professional economists, rather it refers to the implementation of a Government policy.  When we deal with public money, it is right and proper that we should ask why the Department is not able to implement its own policy and why it found it necessary to procure external assistance to develop that policy.  The Minister offered a legitimate argument to the effect that the Department does not retain the services of the necessary specialist economic or advisory experts.</p><p>  Implementation is one issue.  I also asked the Minister three other questions.  Will he indicate what is the international assignee programme, which costs the State &euro;100,000?  Will he also indicate why we are paying &euro;120,000 in respect of positions for two individuals, one at the IMF and the other at the EBRD?  Are those positions permanent and will this be a recurring cost?  In the context of the transformational project, will the Minister comment on the additional expenditure of &euro;150,000 the Department is seeking under consultancy and services in this regard?  Will he also indicate who will be the beneficiary of that &euro;150,000?</p></speech>

From these pie charts it seems that the proportion is very significant.  Under the subhead with which we are dealing, the figure is 19%; under subhead B the figure is an incredible 59% for consultancy and other services; under subhead C the figure is 13%; under subhead D the figure is 25%; and under subhead E the figure is smaller at 4%.  Those figures are very significant.  Given the discussion that has positively taken place on the value-for-money issue in terms of consultants with respect to Irish Water, surely we have to ask the same questions here because we are talking about significant amounts of money.  Under one of the subheads, the figure is &euro;6 million.</p></speech>

The obvious question that begs an answer is whether it would be cheaper to employ people with that expertise directly.  When we are talking of figures of hundreds of thousands  of euro or, in one case, millions of euro, it must be asked if it would not be cheaper to employ somebody full-time in those instances.  When the Minister seeks such expert advice, we do not know what lies behind the subheading.  Who are these consultants and how much are they getting paid?  The figures seem to indicate they get paid a great deal.</p></speech>

It is done on the basis that particular expertise is not needed all the time and is only needed occasionally to address particular tasks.  It can be compared to the what many of the Deputy's neighbours in his constituency in D&uacute;n Laoghaire would do when they want to paint their houses.  They would not add to their staff by having a full-time painter, they would hire in the painter.  If they want to fix a leak, they would not hire a full- time plumber and put another three or four maintenance people on staff.  The Deputy would know that from his experience in the constituency.  One would supplement particular expertise by hiring it in occasionally.</p><p>  The Deputy quoted a number of percentages but percentages do not give the full picture because if one spends &euro;1 and the following year one puts the figure up to &euro;2, that is an increase of 100%.  The real amounts of money are the significant aspects of it.  </p><p>  Deputy Pearse Doherty asked some specific questions.  On the &euro;350,000 included this year on the economic strategy, I cannot give him the specifics of that because nobody has been hired under that head yet and nothing has been specified.  To implement the economic strategy, an estimate has been made that we may need consultancy services up to that value.  The provision is made in the Estimate to allow the Department to do it in the course of the year but there is no procurement yet.  That is the way Estimates are done.  If we did not put it in the Estimate at the start of the year, we would not have the authority to do it without a Supplementary Estimate.  That is what has happened there.</p><p>  On the overseas postings and so on, there is an international assignee project and it is linked to replacing people in the EU Presidency as it rotates.  I am very much in favour of this.  I remember in the 1970s when we entered the EU we had significant people transferring from Departments entering the European bureaucracy and going right to the top.  For example, Ms Catherine Day is the lead civil servant in Europe at present and she is the civil servant who services the policy requirements of President Barroso.  We have had other examples of Irish civil servants going to the top but it is quite evident for the last three years that because of the various job opportunities, probably due to the Celtic tiger, that this was discontinued and there are not Irish civil servants, by and large, at significant levels in Europe.  It is time that we recommenced a programme to put Irish civil servants in there in our own interests.  We have done that now.  It is going to be possible in my view to do so, and maybe relatively easy to do so, because the reputation of the Irish civil servants who participated in Brussels during the Presidency was very high.  Already we have had inquires from Commission staff and so on to hire specific people whose work record they know from when they were in Brussels.  That is what the assignee project placement is about.</p></speech>

In the EBRD there are three posts - director, alternate director- adviser - and they rotate between Ireland, Denmark and Lithuania.  There are three postings in the IMF also and that is part of that international element.</p><p>  On the transformational budget, the money there is intended to help to develop and implement an IT strategy for the Department.</p> <p>It needs to procure an IT adviser in that respect and to improve document management and CRM systems, which dovetails with the Deputy's initial request for better documentation management.  There is a banking shared services project.  There is a governance and policy development business process that includes an optimal legal structure and a secure document management process.  In addition, there is the implementation of a general reform programme.</p><p> If one adds up all the consultancy provisions in the Estimates it comes to &euro;9 million to implement all the policy developments across the Department but also to defend legal issues and banking and to run the national payments plan steering committee single euro payments area, SEPA, campaign.  Some of the very heavy expenditure is legal - legal advice for particular projects for which we do not have the legal expertise within the Department, but also to defend legal challenges.  Quite a lot of these items arise from the work of the Department over the past four or five years.  We recoup a significant proportion of the amount.  Last year, of a total of &euro;3.3 million we recouped in excess of &euro;2 million from the banks in particular.  It is not all a net figure.  That is the overview.  If any supplementary information is required the Deputy should inform us and we will give it to him in writing.</p></speech>

I know the role of the committee.  I do not sit on the Committee of Public Accounts.  The role of the committee is to scrutinise the Estimates.  I would not be doing my job if I did not ask questions such as the purpose of a new spend of &euro;100,000.  I know it is for the programme and to assign somebody to the Civil Service but what I still do not know is whether the money is for the civil servant or for consultants to tell us how to operate the programme.  I know the money has not been spent but the reason it has appeared in the Estimates is that the Department has a view that it might need to be spent for this purpose.  It might not be spent but the money will be there.  I hope the figure has not been plucked out of the air.  The Minister has not given an indication of who will be the beneficiary of the &euro;100,000 under the programme.  It is our job to say money should not be spent on a specific area if we believe it is a misuse of public funds.</p></speech>

The outturn for 2013 was &euro;3.5 million, yet the Estimate allowed for this year is &euro;6.5 million.  That seems like a huge amount of money for consultancy and seems even larger and more significant against a background in which the Minister required only half of that in the previous year.  I accept that the Minister allowed for approximately &euro;6.5 million last year and did not spend it, but he is allowing for &euro;6.5 million this year for consultants.  Could he explain that?  Who, precisely, are the consultants?  What are they doing for us and why do we need them?</p></speech>

It is being conducted internally in consultation with NAMA.  It is a requirement under the Act and we will see what it comes up with.  NAMA is subject to an awful lot of criticism and adverse briefing, principally driven by developers and builders who have a vested interest in putting out bad stories about NAMA.  If one examines the situation in NAMA one will see that, contrary to conventional wisdom, it is the most accountable public State agency in the country.  As many members are aware, there are staff from the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office permanently embedded in NAMA examining every transaction that is conducted.  In addition, the valuations it attributed to the loan books it acquired were all cross-checked by the Comptroller and Auditor General, who stated on a number of occasions that this work was conducted properly and that the values attributed were appropriate.  The work of NAMA is also cross-checked by the European Commission, which did another audit on it and came to the same conclusion.  NAMA is always available to come before the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and the Committee of Public Accounts.  It issues quarterly reports as well as annual reports.  No public body in the country has the level of accountability and scrutiny of NAMA, but there is a campaign against NAMA in the vested interests of certain people.  The committee should be aware of that when it is briefed.  It should examine the briefing it gets because much of it is not correct.  NAMA has assured me that it will talk to the committee directly on any occasion when there are any doubts about the processes it conducts.  It is a very big company that deals with valuable assets.  It acts in the interest of the Irish taxpayer and so far it has been quite successful in acting in that regard.  If there is a conflict between the interests of the Irish taxpayer and the interests of an individual developer NAMA will favour the taxpayer, and a lot of people do not like that.</p><p>  On the issue of whether developers would be allowed to buy back their own assets at the discounted rates at which they were acquired by NAMA, as the Deputy is well aware, that is a very controversial issue.  It was controversial when the NAMA legislation was being processed through D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann and Seanad &Eacute;ireann.  At present I have no intention of changing that.  If the NAMA review comes up with a proposal to leave the situation as it is or to change it then we will examine the proposal in due course with all the other recommendations.  I am hands-off in terms of the NAMA review.  I have no idea what will be recommended.  The Deputy will be aware that in other circumstances we allowed buy-backs, but not in NAMA, and it is not my intention to change the legislation.</p></speech>

I have outlined the model.  We supplement the expertise in the Department by retaining consultants.  Much of what we need externally is in terms of legal advice because we deal with intricate legal issues, especially on the property side and the banking side.  I have a note on consultancy and other services, and it refers directly to Deputy Boyd Barrett's point.  An allocation of &euro;6.575 million was provided in the 2013 Estimate driven by the requirement to provide for a wide range of deliverables, including banking sector policy, personal debt, SME lending, financial services reform and costs of the implementation of the national payment plan projects, all of which were being led by the Department.  Significant savings were returned to the Exchequer as a result of a continuing emphasis on cost control and cost sharing.  Notwithstanding this, a similar provision has been allocated in 2014 because of ongoing exposure and demands across all these categories.  While the Department will continue to seek savings where possible, it must be equipped to address issues as they arise.  If we find that we have something in the middle of the year and we do not have the expertise in-house to deal with it, I need to be able to buy it in and if I do not have it in the Estimate, I have to go back through the process of going before the Houses of the Oireachtas looking for supplementary funds.  That is not always dealing with the issues as they need to be dealt with.</p></speech>

It is not satisfactory and it does not satisfactorily explain the allocation of &euro;6.5 million for consultants.  To put it in context, if he were to employ full-time economists at &euro;100,000 a year he could get 65 of them.  He would not need 65; the expertise of many of them would cross over a number of these sub-heads.  When the Minister used the analogy that he would not employ a full-time painter to paint his house he was right but we are not talking about a house.  We are talking about an economy and given the amount of money he finds he now has to allocate for outside expertise to be brought in, the cost of that is so high it is self-evident from the amounts involved that the Minister needs full-time economists employed in the Department, which would be better value for money than what is before us.  I do not see how the Minister could argue anything else.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1138" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014011500011#K00500"><p>I will make two points on the consultancy.  I am glad the Estimate agreed last year was not spent, resulting in significant savings as mentioned earlier but as I did earlier, I again raise concern about the quantum of increase in comparison to the outturn last year.  Across every heading there is an increase for consultancy fees.  Only a few weeks ago the Minister stood up in the Chamber and announced the cuts, along with his colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, yet when it comes to his own Department every category from A to E has an increase for consultancy spend, and that is questionable.</p><p>  In terms of legal fees, and particularly this section B which deals with the banking issue, I understand there is the potential for numerous legal challenges - I refer to NAMA and all the rest - that the Department has to face down.  In terms of last year's outturn and also this year's Estimate, and I know Estimates are "guesstimates", the Minister is guessing how much of it is for legal fees and consultancy.  The Minister mentioned there is a need for consultancy on banking sector policy, personal debt, small and medium enterprises, SME, lending, financial services reform, and cost of implementation of the national payment plan.  All of those areas must be tackled, therefore, we understand the need for that.  I subscribe to the idea that we can have all the expertise within the Department but when we see the amount being spent on consultancy services, the total quantum is &euro;9 million but this year there is a &euro;5.75 million increase in his Department.</p><p>  Regarding the issue of NAMA and the review, I welcome that this is happening.  The Minister will be well aware that I have asked hundreds of parliamentary questions about NAMA, which I know the Minister reads personally and has answered, on staff and whether the right fire-walls are in place.  Rules have been changed in the intermediate period but I agree with the Minister that there is an orchestrated campaign against NAMA and if it is against NAMA, it is against the State also.  I hope NAMA will succeed and out-perform even its own expectations because that means the State will be a beneficiary, but it is as clear as the nose on our faces that certain developers are driving an agenda.  Unfortunately, some people are playing into that agenda but that should not stop us from challenging NAMA where NAMA must be challenged.  The Minister made a case in terms of transparency and accountability but the lack of freedom of information, which was a mistake in the previous Administration, has created huge suspicions in terms of NAMA.  I hope that veil will be lifted and we will get more transparency.  I look forward to the review and engagement with this committee regarding the outcome of that review also.</p></speech>

There are many communications costs in making people aware of these, and they are a great benefit and are well worth doing.  There is also &euro;0.75 million for SME, credit provision, mortgages and all that area, and some of that is communication also.</p><p>  On the banking aspect, I can estimate legal fees on banking where cases are running from 2013 into 2014.  It is not rocket science to estimate that there will be legal costs, and to put a figure on it, but if something happens unexpectedly mid-year and new costs arise, we need a provision for it but it is an estimate.  It may be overspent or underspent but the tendency in Departments is to provision to ensure they do not have overspends because overspends are a black mark; underspends are not a black mark.  These are estimates.  They are not hard figures, especially on the consultancy side, but the variation on them will not be very big.</p><p>  The Deputy is right that there are percentage increases across the consultancy heads this year because we need to buy in a certain amount of expertise for new projects but the overall Estimate for the Department has decreased.  At a time when costs are increasing the overall Estimate has decreased.  The increased funding for consultancy is being funded with savings within the Department and it is not a further draw on the Exchequer.</p></speech>

While I made this point under a previous head, it repeats itself again here and in his response, the Minister did not really address it.  I accept these are important areas and in this case it pertains to corporate tax and agricultural taxes, while the previous examples pertained to small and medium-size enterprises, banking and so on.  Under head D, provision is made for the medium-term economic strategy and the common element here is that economic expertise is being bought in at a significant cost.  The question the Minister has not answered is, how would it not be cheaper - from his perspective and that of the public - to employ a few economists?  I do not see the logic in this regard, because big money is being forked out, including &euro;350,000 with regard the medium-term economic strategy.  One would employ an economist to oversee it for a lot less than that.  Surely activities such as looking into corporate tax or agricultural taxes are not once-off events?  A number of these heads pertain to important areas of policy that should be kept under constant review and should be constantly researched, analysed and looked at.  Would it not be cheaper and better value to employ directly a few people who are expert in these areas to advise the Government, rather than incurring large expenditure on consultants?</p></speech>

Spending for heads C, D and E has gone from &euro;161,000, &euro;101,000 and &euro;101,000, respectively, to &euro;575,000, &euro;630,000 and &euro;490,000, respectively.  This seems like a runaway train.  While I acknowledge these are only Estimates that are being provided for, this does not pertain to legal fees but is policy driven.  I do not believe the same latitude was given to the Department of Health to simply throw in an additional couple of million euro here, there or wherever, or an additional 20% increase.  In some cases provision is being made here for 100% increases, just in case the need arises, and this is not the way in which budgets are done.</p><p>  In respect of committees and commissions, I refer to the disabled drivers medical board of appeal.  I understand that &euro;330,000 has been provided just for that board and it does not relate  to the relief those who avail of the scheme receive.  While the Minister mentioned that fees and salaries have been reduced over the last couple of years, yet it is increasing by approximately &euro;5,000.  However, it would be interesting to get a breakdown of the &euro;330,000 to the board members in respect of their fees and salaries.  I am unsure how many such board members there are.</p><p>  While there is material I could go into in respect of consultants, I understand the Chair wishes to move on.  However, I ask the Minister to focus on subhead D3 and while considering D3, there should be a reference to subhead A3.  This is because under the consultancy and other services heading, there is an increase from &euro;101,000 to &euro;630,000.  The Minister has provided a breakdown of the allocation, the first item of which is &euro;350,000 in respect of the medium-term economic strategy driven from the economics division.  However, when members were provided with a breakdown of the consultancy services under subhead A3, under that category there also is &euro;350,000 for the development and implementation of the medium-term economic strategy.  Why are two different subcategories of the same Department each charging a cost of &euro;350,000 in consultancy or other services for the same strategy?</p><p>  My final question is in respect of appropriations-in aid and concerns the pension levy.  The Department expects a reduced return from the pension levy in 2014.  Can the Minister explain this, given the changes that took place to the levy in the budget, from &euro;1.1 million down to &euro;0.95 million?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014011500012#L00800"><p>First, not all the expertise being sought through consultancy is economic expertise.  It is economic, legal and communications expertise in some respects.  The amounts of money, in their totality, are not huge in comparison with overall budgets.  I have given Deputy Boyd Barrett the explanation previously that the expertise is not available in-house and it is more economic to get it through consultancy than to hire permanent staff.  That is the position.  Were the Deputy correct and were it cheaper to hire in, of course we would try to do so, but that is not the way it works.  If one takes an area like the two big areas of taxation we intend to examine this year, namely, all the reliefs to agriculture and the agrisector, as well as corporate taxation, these are two highly important areas.  While the Department has people who are quite knowledgeable about the tax that applies to these areas, it does not have people within it who deal with farm tax or who deal with the tax of multinational companies.  In other words, we do not have practitioner experience in-house and no one would expect us to do so.  Yet, before one makes far-reaching changes that could have highly serious consequences for the economy, it is important to check the policy here within the Department against the practical experience and expertise outside.  In economics now, as it goes up to the doctorate level, it becomes a very refined art and there are areas of expertise in which people are competent but they are not competent in the next area.  The Department has economists who are expert on aspects of company law but they might not be experts on anything to do with farm taxation.  Similarly, they may have no expertise in corporate tax.  They will have the kind of expertise that generalists have but will not have expert knowledge.  What is needed, many times, is expert knowledge and that is what we seek and is what we must bring in.</p><p>  In respect of those two areas, in particular on the tax side, there is an increase provided for here and it reflects the ongoing commitment to review all key tax categories on a rolling basis.  Key items for the review of 2014 will be the agritax sector and corporation taxes.  It is essential that a review of our corporation tax regime is conducted to ensure that we remain competitive globally, while also preserving and preventing damage to Ireland's reputation.  A comprehensive review of agricultural tax policy, to include income tax, capital taxes, VAT, stamp duty and corporation tax, also is planned to evaluate the costs and benefits of reliefs available to the sector.  We must have expertise to match the sectoral interests, who also will be giving advice on these matters.</p><p>  In fairness, I believe Deputy Boyd Barrett has received reasonable answers as to the reason all expertise is not brought in-house.  Moreover, he must recall there are caps on civil servants' salaries and they have been reduced significantly in recent years.  There have been reductions of between 20% and 25%.  The kind of expertise the Department needs on occasion would not come to the first interview with the kind of salaries that are being offered to senior civil servants.  They would not cross the door of the place to be interviewed for a full-time position because they get salaries vastly in excess of Civil Service rates in the law firms or accountancy firms in which they work.  One then pays for their expertise but thankfully, from an Exchequer point of view, one does not need it for the full year.  One needs it for a week or two or less, on occasions.</p> <p>That is the justification for it.</p><p> On the question from Deputy Doherty on the pension levy, I am advised it is the knock-on reductions from the Haddington Road agreement.  Following the cuts in salaries, the amount goes down.  That has to be allowed for in the Estimate as well.</p><p> I will get an answer for the Deputy on the disabled drivers appeal board.  I am told that there is a circular flow of money to Rehab.  We will get the Deputy all the specific details.  We do not have them on file here.</p></speech>

The strategy which is brought forward will provide the tramlines within which we will operate now that the bailout is over and we do not have the troika providing the similar service.  It is a low cost when one considers the intention.</p></speech>

In a public service which is by its nature generalist, expertise is always required.  Expertise is brought in by getting consultants in and it is cost effective when it is operated properly.  I would argue strongly that there is no waste of money in this respect in the Department of Finance.  If we were to follow Deputy Boyd Barrett's advice, it would be like the example I gave jocosely.  It would be like somebody with a staff running a hotel, for example, who would have painters, electricians and plumbers on permanent staff in-house rather than hiring them in.  It is the same issue.</p></speech>

The matter is dealt with on page 31, context and impact indicator related information.  It compares the targets that the office faced at the end of September, and then the outcome.  It is falling considerably behind on accounts to be certified by the end of September 2013.  It was to be 252 and in practice, it was 204.  The percentage of current year accounts certified was 52% instead of 70%.  Could the Minister example the reason for that?  The staffing levels appear to be quite stable.  Presumably, they are under considerable pressure.  The Minister might comment on that.</p><p>  Second, the Minister indicates that, with the likely transfer of some IBRC assets to NAMA, there will be additional work for the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  At this stage, has he any indication as to the likely scale of that additional work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1167" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014011500013#M01900"><p>I have the same issues.  There is concern that the targets have not been met.  In broad cases, some of them have been exceeded.  The percentage of current year accounts certified was 52% whereas the target was 70%.  The number of accounts to be certified was supposed to be 252 and at the end of September it was 204.  Those are quite large figures that have not been met.  That leads to the question of resourcing within the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  Has there been any request from that office for additional staffing power to carry out the work that is before it?</p><p>  On the new 2014 audit on NAMA in terms of the IBRC transfer of assets, it is mentioned here that the office is examining the resourcing for this office.  Is it the case that the office is raising concerns that it may not have the necessary staff power to conduct the work it has on hand plus this new body of work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1168" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014011500013#M02000"><p>On the arrears, the explanation is that they concentrate on the larger accounts.  If one looks at the percentages, they are high on the larger accounts.  It is the smaller accounts where they are falling behind but that is because of the method of allocating the work.  In value terms, they deal with a very high proportion of them.</p><p>  On the NAMA question, when NAMA commenced it had liabilities of &euro;30 billion, that is, the quantum of public money that is in play.  At the end of the last quarter, however, NAMA fulfilled its first repayment obligation by paying back &euro;7.5 billion.  In the course of 2014, with the cash it has in hand and with foreseeable transactions, NAMA will go close enough to &euro;7 billion again in transactions.  The NAMA portfolio, at the end of 2014, will have reduced substantially.</p><p>  The quantum that is under the control of the special liquidator is approximately &euro;12.6 billion.  On the special liquidator's sale of assets, it looks as if he will sell at least half of that, perhaps more.  That is a rough estimate because one never knows what one will sell until it is bought but the expectation with the level of interest there is that &euro;6 billion of that will be bought before it is transferred to NAMA at all.  When one takes approximately &euro;16 billion and adds another &euro;6 billion to it, one will see that the NAMA portfolio will still be substantially below what it was at its starting point three years ago.</p><p>  Nobody has brought to my attention that there is any particular additional requirement from the Comptroller and Auditor General's office to deal with NAMA but he will get whatever resources he needs because it is important.  I do not deal with the staff or the Estimate.  I am responsible for these Estimates but they are negotiated with Deputy Howlin's Department and he controls staff.  As far as I know, as a near neighbour, I do not think there are issues of staff or resources outstanding with the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  Certainly, they have not been brought to my attention.  The practice would be to give the Comptroller and Auditor General what he needs within reason and, usually, there is not a conflict about these matters.</p></speech>

The Minister will be well aware of Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s call for additional staff to be employed in the Revenue Commissioners.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners itself has said that it could generate additional income for the State if it had the resources.  In fairness, when the local property tax was made the responsibility of the Revenue Commissioners the Government proposed to increase the number of staff.  However, the figures before us today show that the increase never materialised.  In 2012, there were 5,715 staff.  The estimate for 2013 was 5,874 because of the local property tax.  There was an increase of just below 160 proposed but the provisional outturn was 5,756.  Therefore, there were 118 fewer staff in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners than actually approved.  This was at a time when the office was dealing with the local property tax.  There is great admiration for the Revenue Commissioners&rsquo; online system and capability of getting notices out, and forms are issued like clockwork, including to employers.  The local property tax is a different ballgame, however.  There were many errors when it was introduced, and the Revenue Commissioners explained this would happen.  Why were there 118 staff fewer than were approved?  The Minister is saying that 22 staff have been moved to shared financial services but there has been an overall decrease within the Office of the Revenue Commissioners again this year.  The office stated to the Department that an increase of 100 would bring in a quite substantial amount of additional revenue for the State.  Does the Minister not believe this?  Will he deal with this issue in detail?</p><p>  I am an admirer of the online revenue system.  It is outstanding.  Consider the subject of office equipment and external IT services.  One sees that there was a substantial cost associated with running IT services in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners amounting to &euro;49 million.  Some &euro;25 million of this is for external IT systems development and maintenance.  This seems very high.  Can the Minister shed any light on that?  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners is to spend close to &euro;5 million buying new computers.  Is this to replace the entire suite?  Some &euro;14 million is to be spent on maintenance and meeting running costs.  The figures seem very high.  Expenditure on printing, at &euro;1.1 million, seems to be a lot lower.</p><p>  There is another increase pertaining to consultancy costs but it is in respect of specialist X-ray equipment for the Customs and Excise service.  We need to increase capability in the Revenue Commissioners in this regard.  Expenditure on motor vehicles and equipment maintenance, including the maintenance of X-ray scanners and specialist equipment, is actually down by comparison with last year.  It has been shown that if there were proper resources to deal with black market activity, it would be very beneficial to the State.  I am concerned about this area.</p><p>  There is a 30% increase in the amount to be made available to the Revenue Commissioners to meet legal fees.  A large increase pertains to bankruptcy and liquidation.  In addition, there is quite substantial increase in terms of solicitors&rsquo; fees.  This is an issue.</p><p>  Could the Minister state what is happening with the disabled drivers and passengers scheme?  There is no allocation or budget provided for 2014 because it is mentioned that the existing scheme will continue.  I am not clear on this.  I acknowledge that the scheme, which is new, requires European approval but there is no budget for an old scheme.  The only budget was for the board.  Could the Minister shed some light on this?</p></speech>

One of the outputs from 2013 was that risk-based audit and compliance interventions yielded over &euro;550 million.  The targeted output for 2014 points to an increased yield from such interventions.  Clearly, the Revenue Commissioners have had a lot of success in this regard.  Can the Minister outline what areas have been found to be of high risk resulting in such a high yield?  There is not a new initiative but new emphasis on risk-based auditing, which yielded over &euro;0.5 billion in one year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1172" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12014011500014#N00300"><p>I will respond to some general questions first and then I will look for advice on some of the specifics.  Solicitors&rsquo; fees are paid to recover tax.  Far more is recovered than fees paid so that is an advantage.  If we increase activity in this area, we collect more revenue.</p><p>  Deputy Doherty is probably familiar with the background to the disabled drivers grant.  The European Commission took us to the European Court of Justice and the scheme was deemed to be illegal under European law because of our treating one category of people differently from another for excise purposes.  There is a tolerance allowed on the payment of excise but the decision was that disabled drivers would have to operate within the same band, meaning a serious loss in the rebate of excise for disabled drivers.  Having examined this, we decided we would try to allow the same level of recoupment in respect of disabled drivers by way of grant rather than rebate.  The Revenue Commissioners decided, because this was happening so quickly, to take responsibility for that although they normally do not pay out money.  Money was put into the Estimate.  In the final days of the negotiations before Christmas, the European Commission allowed us an extra year in which to get in line.  This has gone on for approximately four years.  We have delayed and delayed in so far as we could because I certainly did not want to take away any rebate that disabled drivers were getting.  However, we are now at the point where we must change what we are doing.  We have been given an extra year.  The lump sum in an allocation for Revenue is now not needed so that will come back as a saving.  I will discuss with officials in my Department and the Department of Social Protection the question of which Department we should allocate the money to if we move to a grant scheme.  This is being operated by four staff of the Revenue Commissioners in Monaghan who receive all the claims.  It is a receipt-based system.  The intention is to maintain the same level of advantage for disabled drivers based on what they spend on fuel, but we will do so in a different way.  We believe this will be legally acceptable.  We have succeeded in getting an extra year in which to put the alternative arrangement in place.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy McGrath's question, the targeted audits seem to be proceeding much better than the general audits.  They are yielding more.  The Deputy asked about the sectors that are yielding more.</p></speech>

The targeted audits concentrate predominantly on sectors most susceptible to the shadow economy and shadow activity.  They maintain a specific focus on cash businesses; the detection of serious sales suppression in pubs and restaurants and the entertainment and hospitality industries; checking the compliance of white-collar professionals, doctors, dentists, veterinarians, solicitors and accountants; and the construction industry.</p> <p>The range of compliance activities deployed includes: risk analysis; covert surveillance; cold calls to businesses and venues and pre-arranged aspect queries on specific issues; intelligence gathering; third-party information; and information exchange with other State agencies.</p><p> In 2013, Revenue carried out unannounced visits to specific areas, towns, streets, market squares and special events with a focus on non-compliance with Revenue obligations including registration for all appropriate taxes, excise and duties and specifically cash businesses.  During these operations it identified and addressed risks and specific sectors such as couriers, security companies and fuel merchants.  In 2014, Revenue will also use the new anti-fraud provisions contained in the Finance (No. 2) Bill 2013.</p></speech>

There is a staffing mix.  There is the equivalent of 130 full-time posts in temporary staff on top of those figures.  There was outsourcing of the call centres in the property tax arrangements, so the Deputy is getting the net full-time staff figures but there are temporary and outsourced staff in addition to that.  There is a trade-off between the movement toward better IT systems and the necessity for staff.  That is also in the mix.</p></speech>

The group comprises a sizeable number of Votes including the following: the Vote for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform; a new Vote for the Office of Government Procurement; the Vote for shared services that was introduced for the first time last year and is now expanding as we produce more shared services; the Votes for a number of offices under the aegis of my Department including the State Laboratory, the Public Appointments Service, the Valuation Office and the Office of the Ombudsman; and, finally, the Votes for superannuation and retired allowances that provides for Civil Service pensions and, everybody's favourite, the Secret Service.  The Vote for the remaining element of the PER group &ndash; the Office of Public Works &ndash; will be taken separately by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Brian Hayes.</p><p>  I wish to draw the attention of the committee to the fact that the 2014 Estimate for my Department has been kept at the 2013 level by savings being driven in certain areas.  This has meant that the additional costs associated with the initial funding of the Office of the National Lottery Regulator, that will come into being this year, could be absorbed within existing resources.  Similarly, employee numbers in the Department have been maintained at 2013 levels while additional services have been delivered, for example, in the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer.</p><p>  The PER Vote comprises two programmes as the name of the Department indicates &ndash; public expenditure and sectoral policy and public service management and reform.  The key outputs of the first programme includes the provision of advice on sustainable current and capital expenditure policy, the promotion of a stronger focus on value for money and performance information and the implementation of policies to reduce public service numbers.</p><p>  Overall net expenditure for 2013 was kept at &euro;43.1 billion which is well within the target of &euro;43.4 billion that we set for the year and represented a net underspend of &euro;321 million for 2013.  Year-on-year net expenditure last year was 4.2% or &euro;1.9 billion lower than in 2012.  This continues the strong trend of expenditure control that we have laid out.</p><p>  Last year I spelt out at some length to the committee what my Department had introduced by way of structural reform of the Estimates process.  These included performance monitoring and reporting, the formulation of a new public spending code and the establishment of the Government economic and evaluation service.  I also made specific reference to the proposed introduction of a multiannual expenditure framework.  I indicated that the objective of the new framework was to allow for sensible, structural planning and prioritisation within each area of public expenditure. </p><p>  In 2013, I introduced the legislation that underpins the new framework and implements the wider fiscal reform measures that have been introduced across EU member states generally.  The legislation puts into operation the expenditure management component of the so-called six pack of five directives and one regulation that introduced, among other things, an expenditure benchmark.  The purpose of the benchmark is to set a multiannual upper limit on general Government expenditure.  It means that states will have to monitor and control public spending developments in line with a realistic potential GDP growth over the medium-term.</p><p>  The expenditure benchmark is the core expenditure rule with which the Government and the State are legally obliged to comply in the annual and multiannual budgetary processes, by virtue of the direct effect of the regulation and the inherent supremacy of EU law.  Under the benchmark the Government expenditure ceiling places a limit on the level of our total annual gross voted expenditure.  That ceiling is then apportioned into individual ministerial expenditure ceilings for both current and capital for the next three years in each Department, as Deputies know.  The ceilings for 2014, 2015 and 2016 were published in the Expenditure Report 2014 on budget day 2013. </p><p>  This is a new top down approach to budgeting.  In the past, expenditure growth was, at times, allowed to outpace the economy&rsquo;s underlying ability to finance it.  The new approach radically changes the Estimates process and introduces a major reform by setting out the Government&rsquo;s medium term budgetary plans and overall spending allocations clearly over time, thereby allowing Departments to plan their budget structure in advance.  In that context, the Government has indicated that in the course of 2014, it will undertake comprehensive reviews of both current and capital expenditure.  As Deputies will remember, we carried out a comprehensive review of expenditure in 2011.  I am interested in talking about, at some length, later in the year on how the committee might involve itself in the process.  </p><p>  The reviews will involve an in depth examination of public expenditure.  They will allow the Government to recalibrate the expenditure ceilings published on budget day in line with changing priorities and informed by evaluations of how public resources are being used.  The focus of the reviews will be on ensuring that public resources are used in an efficient way to deliver effective services.  I must emphasise that the overriding function of the process is to ensure that we spend the resources available to fund services in the best possible way.  Given the fiscal challenges that Ireland continues to face, and in order to meet the pressing targets required to restore the sustainability of the public finances, the Government is required to make difficult choices and enforce prioritisation across all areas.  We want to do so in an as open a manner as possible. </p><p>  In summary, the process of reducing the total level of spending must be complemented with a more nuanced approach to focus on attaining the right balance of expenditure.  The review process will commence over the coming weeks.</p><p>  My Department's second programme is public service management and reform.  Just over two years have passed since the Government&rsquo;s first public service reform plan was published in November 2011.  Substantial progress has been made across a range of areas in terms of reducing costs, delivering better value for money and improving services.   Details of progress are set out on the second progress report on implementation of the plan that I published yesterday and I hope all Deputies will have received same today.  </p><p>  There is a need to constantly update our plans and revise our objectives to ensure that the reform agenda remains ambitious and relevant so that we do not lose momentum.  In this context a new wave of public service reform was also published yesterday in tandem with the progress report.  We will build on progress and set out the Government&rsquo;s ambition for reform over the coming years.  It outlines the key cross-cutting and sectoral reform initiatives that will be implemented over the next three years.  It also looks further forward to address the ambition for reform towards 2020.</p><p>  As well as continuing to drive efficiencies and cost savings across the public service, the new reform plan will have a strengthened focus on achieving better outcomes for service users, that is citizens and businesses.  This will be centred on using alternative models of service delivery and will change the way the public service designs and delivers services.</p><p>  The new plan has placed particular emphasis on making use of digitalisation and open data.  A new Government ICT strategy will be published in the first half of this year.  It will address the use of new and emerging technologies, ensuring that e-Government is designed around real needs and takes steps to improve take-up of digital government.  The plan has also addressed a wide range of other issues.  These include the implementation of shared service models; the evaluation of new business models for the delivery of non-core services; the reform of public procurement; property rationalisation; strengthening leadership; and human resource management reforms.  We do not have the time today to go into the specific detail of the new reform plan.  However, I have already written to the Chairman with an offer to meet the committee, whenever there is a time slot available, in the coming weeks to discuss the reform programme in detail.  </p><p>  The reform and delivery office, RDO, established within my Department is overseeing and driving the reform programme.  It is sometimes necessary to invest in the short-term which will be something that we will deal with when discussing money.  We need to pay upfront in order to make savings into the future.  It is for this reason that the RDO has been allocated &euro;1.8 million in 2014 for the reform agenda fund.  The RDO funding will support a series of reform projects and initiatives, including some of those set out in the new public service reform plan.  Funds will also be used to source necessary technical and expert support, on a temporary basis, as well as increasing programme management and programme delivery capacity and capability. </p><p>  As part of the implementation of the public service reform plan, the RDO has initiated a cross-departmental process to renew and refresh the vision and strategy for the Civil Service in order to ensure that the sector as a whole has the capacity, capability and commitment required to successfully meet the challenges it currently faces and will face in future.  The programme is led by a cross-departmental Civil Service task force that is in the process of refining ideas and proposals.  It will develop final recommendations with a view to publication in the first half of 2014.</p><p>  The Haddington Road agreement sets out a number of equitable and sustainable measures to deliver a further reduction of &euro;1 billion in the public service pay and pensions bill by 2016.  It will enable the delivery of the next stage of the Government&rsquo;s ambitious reform agenda as set out in the reform plan.  The implementation of these measures is well advanced and the agreement is already delivering on its objectives.  As we outlined our target, savings of &euro;300 million were incorporated into the Votes last year and achieved.  It represents a real and tangible reduction in expenditure.</p> <p>While these monetary targets are important, we must also remember some of the other key benefits of the agreement go beyond mere monetary implications.  It provides us with the scope to progress the reform agenda and to deliver unprecedented increases in productivity across the public service, specifically, the provision of an additional 15 million hours across all sectors of the public service.<br />We must make the most of the opportunities which the Haddington Road agreement affords us.  On foot of our successful exit from the EU-IMF programme, the challenge of meeting our fiscal targets will remain.  Managers throughout the public service need to be fully aware that further consolidation is required and in this context make full use of the range of options available to ensure resources are used efficiently and effectively.  This will include the full use of the 15 million additional hours already mentioned.<br />Finally, it would be remiss of me and the Government not to acknowledge that the savings sought and delivered from the public service pay and pensions bill are extremely difficult and challenging for all public servants.  I thank public servants.  Many people said they would not vote for the Haddington Road agreement.  Forty unions have done that for which I compliment them.  However, the reductions achieved and required are a necessary and significant contribution to the fiscal consolidation process to bring our expenditure deficit under control in line with our targets.<br />In addition to progress in public service reform, we have been pursuing a wide-ranging political reform agenda.  This is aimed at delivering open, accountable and ethical government underpinned by a transparent, efficient and effective public system to rebuild trust in government and in the institutions of the State.  Many of the commitments in the area of political reform set out in the programme for Government and in the public service reform plan are now in delivery phase - this committee is involved in many of them - and real progress is being made on several different fronts including, for example the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privileges and Procedures) Act 2013 which was enacted in July and commenced in September 2013, the Protected Disclosures Bill 2013 and the Freedom of Information Bill 2013.<br />The committee has been supplied with detailed background briefing by my Department&rsquo;s officials on the various Votes in the Public Expenditure and Reform group.  I wish, however, to refer specifically to a number of Votes, including Vote 18 (shared services).  A provision of &euro;30.6 million is sought for Vote 18 (shared services), compared to &euro;20.6 million last year.  The increase in the allocation reflects that PeoplePoint, the HR shared service established in 2013, will be in operation for a full year while the payroll shared services centre will be coming onstream during the course of the year.<br />A new Vote, Vote 41 for the Office of Government Procurement is being introduced and a net funding allocation of &euro;12.431 million is sought for 2014.  This represents a transfer of resources from my own Department, and from the Office of Public Works, where the procurement function currently resides of some &euro;7 million, which represents the funding of the National Public Procurement Policy Unit and National Procurement Service.  A further &euro;5.5 million will be required in 2014 for the up-front costs associated with premises<font color="#0000FF">,</font>systems, and for additional staffing.<br />Reform of public procurement is one of the major projects of the reform strategy.  Procurement of supplies and services accounts for around &euro;9 billion of current spending by the State per annum.  This represents a very significant portion of overall spending and it is, therefore, essential that the public service achieves maximum value for money and operational efficiency in its approach to public procurement.  A key element of the public service reform agenda is to reduce costs and achieve better<font color="#0000FF"></font>value for money through reform of public procurement.  To this end, the Government established the Office of Government Procurement under the direction of the chief procurement officer.  This new office is targeted with and has planned for the implementation of centralised procurement services to deliver savings of up to &euro;500 million over the next three years.  A target of &euro;127 million in savings in procurement has been set for 2014.  These savings will be delivered through price reductions, management of specifications and demand management.  This office will work within EU regulations to support the Irish SME sector, which is very important - a point raised by many Deputies - to identify the challenges for SMEs when transacting business with the public service and, most importantly, to come up with practical solutions to these challenges where possible.<br />I thank the Chairman and members for their attention.  I commend the Estimates to the committee.  I will be happy to answer any questions which may arise.</p></speech>

I presume that will allow increases in expenditure ceiling.  Will the deficit targets still remain the same?</p><p>  I have a number of specific questions on the Estimates, which flow from the Department's briefing document.  The Minister has tried to create the impression that things are at the same level, but the provisional outturn last year was &euro;32.9 million whereas the Estimate for this year is &euro;35.9 million, an increase of &euro;3 million or 9%.  There has been a 10% increase in the Department's expenditure.  Where will the savings materialise?  I understand there will be major increases in Vote 18 (Shared Services) and Vote 41 (Office of Public Procurement) but have savings been made somewhere else in the system to compensate or will they arise in three or four years' time? </p><p>  I wish to question the Minister on the grant to the ESRI, which is a registered charity and is covered by the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest, FEMPI, legislation.  The ESRI has a total income of &euro;10.5 million and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform provides funding of &euro;2.6 million or about a quarter of its funding.  What measures has he taken to ensure that the staff of the ESRI do not receive top ups to their salaries from the non-Government money they receive?  Will he outline the details of the staff pension scheme?  I understand that ESRI pension scheme is similar to the public service pension scheme, notwithstanding that only one-quarter of its funding comes from the Minister's Department.  Why would the taxpayer be asked to provide a fully funded pension scheme, the equivalent of a defined benefit scheme for the ESRI, given that a quarter of the funding comes directly from an Oireachtas Vote?</p><p>  I could put the same question to the Minister in respect of the Institute of Public Administration.  The IPA has annual income of the order of &euro;10 million to &euro;11 million, of which one third is funded by the Department, but the taxpayer is underwriting 100% of the staff pensions.  This is akin to what we have seen in some of the other organisations and registered charities in the health sector, where the State provides significant funding but the organisation also has substantial income from other sources.  In light of the recent controversy, what measures has the Minister taken to ensure nobody received top up payments?  I am not suggesting there are top-ups, as I have no basis to do so, but has the Minister taken steps to reassure himself that this is not case?</p> <p>Will he explain why there should be a fully-funded pension scheme for an organisation where, in the case of both organisations, only 25% of their income comes from his Department?</p><p> I have a simple question on the regional assemblies.  The Minister might outline the changes.  How does the change in the regional assembly structure impinge on the Estimate?</p><p> The Minister is setting up a new office of the national lottery regulator for which he is allowing &euro;552,000.  I want him to break this figure down and tell us about the consultancy involved.  I hope the Minister will micro-manage that, unlike his colleague who does not think such new offices or organisations should be micro-managed.  This is taxpayers' money.</p><p> On the Valuation Office, we all will be aware that the country needs to be revalued because many areas were valued at the height of the boom.  The legislation is still in the Seanad and has not yet come to the D&aacute;il.  What are the implications?  Will they be able to speed up the process?  Is there to be a 20-year programme before some counties get revalued?</p><p> With regard to the Ombudsman's office, Vote 19, as the Minister correctly states in the briefing documentation, there are 180 new bodies coming under the Ombudsman's remit, including the new Freedom of Information Bill 2013, whenever the Minister comes back to us on Report Stage and drops his increases in search and retrieval charges.  The Minister also mentions there are new staff required under the regulation of lobbying Bill, but that has not yet even been published.  He might give us a timescale on that.  Given all that extra responsibility for the Ombudsman, there is an increase in the overall Ombudsman's office that covers the Standards in Public Office, SIPO, Commission and all those organisations as well, in the order of &euro;1 million.  It does not seem a great deal for all the extra work the Minister seems to be giving the office.</p></speech>

We stated it would be every three years.  It should be a permanent feature that there should be a review of expenditure.  We conducted the first one in 2011 and I would be anxious to hear the committee's views in its regard.  Ultimately, if the new budgetary system is going to work, it cannot be simply monitoring the expenditure.  It has to be making an input into what the expenditure is intended to do.  We will work with the committee to see how we can model the process of expenditure review over the next few weeks.  We will get it up and running, and see how we can create it.</p><p>  At the end of the day, the deficit targets that we set out in the medium-term economic plan remain unaltered.  Clearly we hope that the evident recovery will be sustained.  There are some good indications, even today, in terms of good consumer confidence - car sales in the first couple of weeks of the year are good.  That might give us additional tax buoyancy and indicate that there will be greater growth than we anticipated because there are more optimistic projections of growth emerging.  We will see what resources the State has and we will engage in dialogue with the committee on what is the appropriate balance of spend, but the deficit targets that we set through the medium-term economic plan must be indicated.</p><p>  The Deputy mentioned the difference between the outturn figures and the Estimate figures.  The net Estimate figure for both divisions of the Department, the public expenditure and sectoral policy, PESP, and public service management and reform, PSMR, we set out at the beginning was &euro;35.737 million.  The outturn was &euro;32.883 million and the new Estimate we propose is &euro;35.898 million.  The increase, compared to the original Estimate, is &euro;161,000, which is a fraction of 1% and keeps the Estimate particularly flat.</p><p>  We did not spend the Estimate in full because we made savings and I will outline them.  Some &euro;1 million of the savings are on the pay bill, driven mainly by staff who left the Department who we have not yet replaced or who are on long-term secondment.  Therefore, there is &euro;1 million in payroll savings.  There is &euro;850,000 on PEACE-INTERREG subhead.  That arises out of uncertainty about the timing of project and the drawdown of funding.  We did not expend &euro;850,000 on PEACE and INTERREG.  There was another &euro;700,000 on the reform agenda unspent last year and approximately &euro;500,000 on surplus appropriations-in-aid.  We got more appropriations-in-aid than had been anticipated.</p><p>  Notwithstanding the increase in the volume of work, particularly in the two areas the Deputy mentioned, specifically the second in regard to the development and expansion of shared services, the development of the Chief Information Officer and the development of the role of the Office of Government Procurement, which have ambitious targets to be met this year, we estimate we will do it for the same money that we allocated at the beginning of last year.</p><p>  On Vote 18, Shared Services, and the Vote on the Office of Government Procurement, Deputy Fleming asks a reasonable question.  If one will have shared services, one is centralising and there is a cost to do so but there will be a saving elsewhere.  The Deputy inquired about that.  We will identify that for him.  It is more manifest in those that we have up and running.  We cannot say in terms of the payroll shared service, because it is not yet up and running, from where staff will migrate and what Departments will second staff into this new department.  There will be payroll savings in the payment Departments that transfer the staff into the new shared service.</p><p>  Deputy Fleming asked a number of specific questions on both the ESRI and the IPA, on some of which I need to come back to him because they involve such level of specificity.  I am told that both pay receipts to my Department, through appropriations-in-aid, of approximately &euro;1.2 million between pension levy deductions and pension deductions.</p><p>  The Deputy asked a question about top-ups.  We wrote to all subsidiary bodies of this Department, as requested by the Committee of Public Accounts, and are compiling our returns.  There is a general regulation that we do not provide for or allow top-ups.  We undertook to come back to the Committee of Public Accounts in that regard.  We will do so and perhaps include the committee, if it is interested, in our findings in that regard.  Both bodies are State agencies for pension purposes and provide public service pensions accordingly.</p><p>  As Deputy Fleming will be aware, under the Act the Office of National Lottery Regulator will be self-funding but it can only start funding itself from the time that the licence becomes operable, which will be towards the latter portion of this year.  I am making a provision now through the Estimate to ensure that it is in place in good time for the establishment of the new national lottery regime.</p><p>  The Deputy asked the total consultancy fees that were paid to Davy, the main consultant on the national lottery sale.  I do not have the figure directly before me.  Someone will correct me if I am wrong, as I am going from memory rather than digging into my own brief here.  As the Deputy will be aware, it was a complex arrangement.  It was of the order of &euro;1.4 million.  When one considers that the sale price that we got was &euro;405 million, to do that well was an important and successful use of the skills-base which was used to supplement the internal departmental skills-base.</p> <p> The Deputy asked two further questions, one of which was on the valuation process that is being rolled out.  The Deputy knows there is a new valuation Bill.  It will provide for a number of processes, including self-valuation. There will have to be a process to verify that.  We want to make the system more efficient.</p><p> With regard to the revaluation process, the big mistake was that there was no revaluation for a very long period.  The areas I have examined in regard to the revaluation demonstrate a 50:50 ratio.  Approximately the same quantum in terms of money is associated with those who have been valued up and those who have been valued down.  Needless to say, those who have been revalued down significantly, often in the hospitality sector, want the revaluation applied immediately.  Those revalued up want a significant delay in application.  All of this has implications for the income level of local authorities, which must proceed in a structured way.  We are rolling out the revaluation and the new legislation will simplify the process and quicken the pace.</p><p> The last question the Deputy asked was on the Office of the Ombudsman.  The new Ombudsman Act has greatly expanded the role of the Ombudsman.  SIPO has expanded its role and we have acknowledged that by apportioning additional staff and allocating the bones of &euro;1 million extra to the Office of the Ombudsman.  We must obviously keep this under review.  We talk to the Ombudsman all the time.  We had very close contact with the previous Ombudsman and her staff in regard to the enactment of the legislation.  She was happy to take it on using existing resources.  We want to make sure the process is efficient and this depends on the quantum of business.  I am sure the committee will want to do this.</p><p> I was asked about particular Bills.  The Freedom of Information Bill is expected to be enacted in this session.  I will be tabling Report Stage amendments.  I have been thinking very deeply about it.  We have done a lot of research on foot of the very good and helpful advices given by Members on Committee Stage.</p><p> The lobbying legislation will be published in this session.  In the D&aacute;il, we must complete the legislation on the reduction in the leader's allowance and the requirement to have the Independents' money vouched.  I want that enacted this session.  It will be the first Bill and it will be dealt with in the House in the next fortnight.  During the following week, it is expected that we will take the lobbying Bill.  I will give the members firm dates for the introduction of the Bills.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for the specifics.  With regard to the ESRI and the IPA, I have no basis for suggesting there are any top-ups or something out of order but I just want confirmation.  It is interesting that the Minister said the Committee of Public Accounts has asked him to engage on this matter.  We should not be asked to vote in the D&aacute;il on the Estimate with unanswered questions.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General produces the audited accounts of the ESRI.  He makes the point that the Financial Measures (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2009 deals with pensions and enables the Minister for Finance to make good any deficiency in the relevant pension scheme if contributions paid by members or the employer are insufficient to meet the obligations of the scheme.  Given that but 25% of the money of the two organisations is provided directly by a Vote of this House, and 75% of funds come from other sources, why would an organisation such as the ESRI have pensions guaranteed in the order of 100% by the Minister for Finance?  These are some of the issues that arise in the health sector.  I refer to the section 38 hospitals and the section 39 agreements.  Organisations in the health sector, which is one of the biggest, do not say that the pension should be guaranteed in the order of 100% by the Minister if only 25% of funding comes directly from an Oireachtas Vote.  I would like the  Minister to revert to us on that.</p><p>  With regard to lottery regulation, the Minister gave me no breakdown on the &euro;552,000.  If he does not have it to hand, we would like him to send it on to us.  The figure did not come out of thin air as it seems to have been calculated for some reason.  There was one case this week of a Minister not micro-managing a new organisation.  We do not want to let this become another one.  The Minister might tell us the position on the sale of the lottery.  Is it completed?</p></speech>

I am advised in respect of the ESRI and IPA that the net contribution they make to the State, which we take in as appropriations-in-aid, is greater than the cost of pensions.  Therefore, there is a net benefit to us in current terms but, obviously, one must account for the actuarial cost.  The ESRI was taken in as part of the academic infrastructure when the universities were dealt with.  The IPA, again a State agency, always had a pension guaranteed by the State.  This has been the case since its inception and remains the case.  Currently, more is being paid than received, with a net benefit to my Department.</p><p>  With regard to the national lottery, I will send the Deputy a specific breakdown on the &euro;500,000 set-up cost.  Under the legislation, once commenced, that is to be funded by the new licensee.  We must make provision such that the arrangement will be in place in advance of the set-up.  The new franchisee or licence holder is expected to be operational towards the end of this year, as I indicated.  The Deputy will remember we said we would take the payment in two moieties.  Both the first &euro;200 million and the second &euro;200 million will now be paid this year.  We will ring-fence the second payment for the National Children's Hospital.  The final contractual work has been done.  As the Deputy will remember, there were some negotiations in the Labour Court on staffing.  A Labour Court recommendation, recommended by the unions, is being voted on.  All matters will be finalised in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

It is the Minister's intention to remove an additional 10,000 workers from the public service between now and 2015.  I wish to know the manner in which that adjustment, consolidation or haemorrhage &ndash; I am trying to avoid loaded language &ndash; is accommodated or accounted for in these figures.</p></speech>

As she knows, there has been very significant downsizing of the public service.  Some 10% of staff, or 30,000, have left.</p> <p>We have made payroll savings from peak to the end of last year of &euro;3.4 billion, a quantum of 17.7%.  There is no other place in Europe that has been as successful in downsizing pay and pensions, as well as numbers, in an atmosphere of industrial calm and peace.  That is a great credit to the public service.</p><p> The improving situation, as we make savings, will allow us to deploy a reform dividend.  For example, the Government agreed to recruit garda&iacute; again.  We will have a significant number of new teachers in place this year, as well as special needs assistants.  The numbers issued will not be necessarily as clear cut.  We have been driving savings through a number of reduction processes.  When we deploy all the available procedures under the Haddington Road agreement, we will be making significant savings of the order of &euro;1 billion.  We want to redeploy some of that to supplement front-line staff such as garda&iacute;, teachers and SNAs.  There may be others in areas where there are critical pressures when we look at it.</p><p> The age profile of the Civil Service and public service is an issue of which we must be mindful.  We need younger people to come into the services in order that we do not have an age deficit in the future.  The superannuation and retirement allowance for the Civil Service will provide for the payment of pensions, lump sums and death gratuities that we envisage during 2014.</p></speech>

If they are net, when one does the maths, the savings do not seem as spectacular.</p><p>  Will the Minister be advancing a programme through the Civil Service and public service which will see the reduction of 10,000 posts between now and 2015?</p></speech>

We are at the stage where there are pressure points which I am relieving in the way I indicated earlier.

However, I want, through rational discussion as we improve our capacity, to look at real pressure points and relieve them.  I am not aware of any chaos in the public service.  Will the Deputy tell me of this chaos of which she has discerned?</p><p>  The outturn numbers for the end of 2013 are 288,840.  The overall target for this year is 287,000.  That is the same target we set for last year.  It means we have some flexibility.  If one looks at the age profile of civil and public servants, because we have not been recruiting, a significant number of people are retiring.  This gives us opportunities to recruit in a structured way.  Towards the end of last year, I asked my Cabinet colleagues to look not only at their own Departments but agencies under their remit to see if there are surplus staff.  There are some areas with surplus staff with other areas under pressure.  This would allow us to offer redeployment, under the terms of the Haddington Road agreement, or voluntary redundancy schemes in those areas where redeployment does not suit.</p><p>  We have had considerable redeployment in many areas.  This morning on radio, I gave the example of where we needed more people working in the Garda vetting unit in Tipperary but there were surplus staff in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine office in the same county.  We transferred staff from the latter to the former on a voluntary basis.  Similarly, we moved surplus public servants from Tralee to a payroll centre in Killarney in order that they could be redeployed in their own county.</p><p>  I have a slightly more relaxed focus on numbers but, obviously, we need to reach our targets in moneys rather than numbers.  Ministers, as well as many Deputies, have repeatedly told me that the crudeness of a recruitment moratorium is often not good policy.  For instance, someone senior who retires could actually be better replaced by two more junior people.  However, that would run foul of the numbers issue but not of the pay savings issue.  That is the flexibility I am trying to manage now.  There is a little more flexibility as we emerge from the critical phase of restoring our public finances.</p></speech>

That represents a significant level of chaos for those concerned.  An example of a chaotic situation, which fortunately was resolved, is the mess created by the centralisation of the medical card service to Finglas.</p><p> I presume the HSE administration is one of the areas in which excess numbers would be seen.  If I picked him up correctly, the Minister stated in an interview prior to Christmas that he will consider using money from the sale of State assets to cover the potential cost of an early retirement scheme or a voluntary redundancy scheme.  I understand his statement was specifically directed at the HSE.  I ask him to clarify whether this is still part of his plans and if he continues to regard the proceeds from the sale of State assets as potentially creating a fund for financing schemes of this nature.  Perhaps I misunderstood him but I do not think I did.</p></speech>

It is a radical and dramatic plan to change the way in which services are delivered.  She touched on some aspects of it.  The old idea was that one throws money or bodies at a problem and things get better.  The process of applying for a medical card should not be much different from applying for an airline ticket or other tasks that can be done online.  We are examining the 20 biggest processes in the public service by volume to make them more accessible to people.  We have rolled out 500,000 public service cards and an additional 900,000 cards will issue during the course of this year.  People should be able to access public services online more easily in future.  That is the way many people access services in the private sphere.  We want to make sure they can do likewise in the public sphere.  Many people who were involved in these processes may not be required.  If the Deputy goes into a bank or an airport, she will not see same quantum of people who were previously doing things that can now be done electronically.  We are anxious to provide for that back level of support.</p><p>  I think we will agree that the HSE was structured in a chaotic fashion whereby a superstructure was put on top of an existing health board structure without any clarity in regard to function.  That resulted in a lack of function and, sometimes, dysfunction.  We need to change that and the Minister for Health is involved in that process.  It is indicated that the quantum of people who work in the HSE and, probably, the Department of Health include people who are surplus to requirement.  They can be redeployed or, where they cannot be redeployed, the HSE will tell me there are specific people for whom there is no job on the administrative side.  Similarly, the Department of Education and Skills may tell me there are surplus people in the rationalised education and training boards.  If we need to provide money for targeted voluntary redundancy schemes, I am willing to investigate where we can fund them.</p></speech>

His big claim for the virtue of selling State assets was the deal he had hatched with the troika to invest in job creation.  It would be something of a turnaround were he to access the money for a voluntary redundancy scheme.  I raise the issue because it is a marked departure from what he has been saying about the use of proceeds from the sale of State assets.  Has the matter been discussed at Cabinet or is it just the Minister's personal view?</p></speech>

We are working through a crisis and I want to see what good ideas can be suggested.  If people are drawing down a permanent salary on the public payroll, even they do not have a job to do, it is better that they move on.  If we need to find the resources that allow them to move on, that would be a good thing.  Let us see where we can find the money, if such people exist and are identified by State agencies.</p><p>  On the Deputy's broader question of the sale of State assets, we have deployed the first &euro;200 million from the National Lottery licence to job creation.  We have allocated additional funds for county roads, retrofitting local authority houses and constructing new schools.  These are the areas in which I want to continue investing but I am open to suggestions on ways to improve not only job creation capacity throughout the country but also the efficiency of the public service and public servants to give us a pool of money that we can deploy in the medium term to improve the services this country needs.</p></speech>

In regard to Vote 17, on the Public Appointments Service and the moratorium on recruitment, I ask about the use of the JobBridge scheme.  I refer specifically to the statute law revision programme, which is led and managed by two legal professionals as project director and manager, who are engaged under contract with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Three researchers took up placements under JobBridge to carry out a very important technical and, perhaps, expert task.  Over 2012 and 2013, the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform took on 21 JobBridge interns to carry out this legal and research work.  I do not have figures for other Departments but I am interested in getting them.  I understand the individuals concerned were taken on to do a piece of work and were then replaced.  I raise the issue because this is clearly a project that needs to be completed and there is a gap in the system for people who are qualified.  I ask the Minister why he opted to use the JobBridge scheme to access these researchers.</p></speech>

We took over the statute law revision programme from the Office of the Attorney General.</p> <p>It was a pilot scheme in the Office of the Attorney General to examine old statute law.  The first two significant bodies of legislation repealing old statute law have been enacted by the Oireachtas.  The final bit is under way and I hope to have it before the Oireachtas this year.  The net question is whether we should do this with full-time staff rather than JobBridge people.  There is no lack of enthusiastic law graduates and researchers who want the experience of working with the Office of the Attorney General and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this project.  It is very valuable experience which is an enabler for them to progress in their career path.  This is what JobBridge is about, to give people a start with something that looks good on their CV and gives them experience in a practical working environment.  People want to do this.</p></speech>

The figure is 65%.  We need to ensure people have opportunities at a time of significant unemployment.  I do not know whether the Deputy is just philosophically opposed to the concept of JobBridge.

There are other ways internships can be offered and give this level of experience to people.  The Minister conceded that downsizing and headcount reduction to achieve savings is a crude policy, and equally the ongoing moratorium in terms of recruitment into the public service and Civil Service is, by definition, a crude instrument.  Crudest of all is the use of a scheme such as this to do work which results in legislation coming before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I am surprised that as a member of the Labour Party the Minister did not look askance at it.  I do not have figures on the use of the scheme in other Departments but it would be interesting to have a look at them.</p></speech>

We need to think outside the box in terms of significant unemployment.  We could allow people to be excluded from work where we could not provide numbers.  The Deputy is correct there was a crudeness about some of what we had to do, such as the moratorium, but these measures were necessary because the very economic survival of the country's depended on us balancing the books.  Where we did not have the money to pay people on a full-time basis we had two options, one of which was not to do the work, and the statute law revision programme is not absolutely essential.  It is the analysis of defunct legislation so we can take it off the Statute Book and make the Statute Book an easier job of work.  It is good and important work.  We have a waiting list of people and a competition for people to get into this.  People want to do it.  It is extraordinarily valuable work.  I have met them and they are enthusiastic about it.  They move on with the fact they worked in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform or with the Office of the Attorney General on their CVs and it is important.  I simply think the Deputy is wrong in feeling people would be better off being excluded or on a make-work scheme where they do not do valuable stuff because it must be paid so they are given makey-uppy work, unreal work or unuseful work and this becomes acceptable.  I do not know which of the two, whether there should be no JobBridge scheme or makey-uppy work JobBridge, is-----</p></speech>

Towards the end of his comments the Minister stated the office will work within EU regulations to support the Irish small and medium enterprise sector to identify challenges for them when transacting business with the public service and, most importantly, to come up with practical solutions to these challenges where possible.  These are very positive statements and are very welcome but will the Minister elaborate on what exactly they mean in practical terms?  I have dealt with any number of SMEs and microbusinesses in respect of the procurement process and some of the large projects, not least the development at Grangegorman.  I am aware that whereas people understand the need for efficiency to save money and to respect EU directives and law there is an anxiety among many people in the sector that they do not get the type of access they need to win work themselves and, as a consequence, to produce more jobs.  Mr. Quinn is familiar and in charge in a practical sense of much of this.  Will the Minister elaborate on what the sentiment in his remarks means practically?</p></speech>

We carried out a comprehensive review to examine procurement and we found extraordinary anomalies whereby various agencies of the State bought the same products from the same companies at different prices.  There were some cosy arrangements at local level.  We need to have value for money for the State.  We want to make these changes and we have ambitious money target savings of &euro;500 million over the next three years, and &euro;127 million this year alone, out of the &euro;9 billion we spend on non-property procurement.  We have examined approximately 60% of this spend which we believe can be targeted and done in a better way.  The Office of Government Procurement is the new co-ordinated State agency to provide pan-governmental procurement on a professional basis.  We are very conscious in doing this to ensure we bring the SME sector with us.  We did not want to create a volume of contracts which would exclude individual SMEs.  We and the Office of Government Procurement have had discussions with the SME organisations.  We must comply with national and EU procurement directives and law.  We have a number of initiatives and discussions including the provision of an e-tender site and alerts to SMEs on goods, services and works that will go to tender.  At present 97,000 suppliers are registered on our e-tender site and we have engaged with them.  We want to reduce the barriers for SMEs to be able to tender.  We want to ensure in every area of work we have standard systems and documentation to reduce red tape.  We have group discussions with the SME sector to ensure this will work.  If the Deputy and Chairman wish, I am happy for Mr. Quinn to elaborate on the specifics because he has been involved in it.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned standardisation.  As we centralise our procurement further, we will have more consistency, since there will be fewer people running procurement processes.  The work will be concentrated in a professional group of procurers.  Making judgments on, for example, turnover and insurance requirements can cause problems for small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, but we will now be able to do this in a more consistent way.</p><p> We are working with bodies such as Enterprise Ireland and InterTrade Ireland to improve education for the SME sector.  We held two events for SMEs in 2013.   Approximately 1,400 SMEs attended each of the Dublin and Belfast sessions.  A key issue for those who attended was their understanding of how public procurement worked.  We need to do more in conjunction with the industry's representative associations, for example, the Small Firms Association, SFA, ISME, IBEC, etc., to improve education for SMEs so that they might understand how public procurement works and how they can engage with it.  This year, we will make new investment through the Vote in new systems capabilities.  We will seek to simplify how SMEs engage with our systems, as it can feel quite bureaucratic.  The more we simplify engagement and make it easier, the more SMEs can compete, participate and, hopefully, be successful.</p><p> Competing in this context is a challenge for SMEs.  However, good work is being done and sponsored by InterTrade Ireland and Enterprise Ireland in supporting SMEs in collaborating and forming consortiums.  These positive actions will roll out in 2014, hopefully to good effect for SMEs in the marketplace.</p></speech>

The Minister alluded to Vote 12 on superannuation and retired allowances in the context of Deputy Fleming's questions.  Perhaps the Minister will avail of this opportunity to reassure us regarding the pension liability that the State is assuming for various agencies and bodies immediately outside of the public service, for example, the IPA, the ESRI and some universities.  Will he confirm that each of these bodies is compliant with public service pay norms and that the pensions being paid are commensurate with the pension liabilities that would arise within public service payscales?  We are still bruising from the HSE's lessons in respect of various hospitals where payments were in excess of public service pay guidelines.  It would be the ultimate irony if we were also to assume a pension liability commensurate with the amounts paid over and above the appropriate public service pay guidelines.  Will the Minister assure the committee that all pensions are in line with public service pension rates and that the agencies involved are paying salaries within the guidelines?</p></speech>

If memory serves correctly, there is a valuation Bill before the Seanad that the Minister has indicated he will accept.  The Government's valuation Bill is long awaited.  Where does it stand?  Is there provision within this Vote for the increased levels of activity that would be expected to arise from a new Bill?  I do not need to go into the issue of rates across the country or state that many companies are dissatisfied with the rate of progress being made on revaluations.  The Valuation Office is critical to the SME sector.  I would appreciate some information in this regard.</p><p>  My third question is on public procurement.  Special consideration of this issue in the committee's work programme could be useful.  Mr. Quinn made an interesting reference to meetings in Dublin and Belfast for SMEs.  There is probably a need for a wider ranging road show than just Dublin and Belfast.  I support the idea of getting the maximum possible efficiencies for the State and I welcome the ambitious targets that have been set, but I have also seen the carnage that an SME can experience, possibly because of its own lack of knowledge, but equally because of the public procurement office's failure to reach out and engage with representative bodies and individual SMEs sufficiently with a view to making them aware of what is happening.</p><p>  Would the regionalisation of tenders be considered?  In the education sector, a contract was awarded in a specific area to a single company.  Like those who are still in the business, I would argue that the company was not in a position to implement that tender nationally.  This damaged many other players in the industry and raised the question of whether it was feasible or desirable to have a regionalised approach to tendering.  The Minister might comment.  It is something that-----</p></speech>

We were conscious of the pensions liability that was accruing.  One of the first actions that we took in government was to introduce the new single public service pension Bill, which became an Act.  That scheme was commenced and has been operable since 1 January 2013.  Obviously, we have not had mass recruitment to the public service in that time, but those who were recruited were so under the scheme's terms, be they judges, local authority workers, teachers or anyone else.  As it will be a career average pension as opposed to an end-of-career pension determination, we estimate that it will save us from 32% to 35% on the pension bill by the middle part of this century.  Taking this measure early was a significant achievement.  It will take the pressure off pensions.</p><p>  The Deputy asked a number of important questions about the way in which academics, for example, have migrated into the pension scheme and whether they did so on the same terms applied to existing career public servants.  We have come across anomalies of people being awarded extra years previously.  All of this was subject to sanction by the Minister for Education and Skills and me, which we are not doing anymore.  There were situations in which people were awarded extra years in the academic institutions without any significant justification objectively.  We need to do away with those situations.</p><p>  The Deputy asked a specific question about whether someone's top-up would be pensionable.  The answer is "No".  Any unsanctioned pay is not pensionable.  That is the simple approach.</p></speech>

We have indicated this across all spheres of the public sector.  We, the Committee of Public Accounts and others have discovered where this policy has not been implemented.

We have had many significant submissions in that regard and we have been involved in discussions.  I hope to get back into Committee Stage in the Seanad with that Bill in the not too distant future.  As I stated previously to Deputy Fleming, it provides a number of new ways for dealing more expeditiously with valuation.  The Deputy also asked if there is enough money.  Considering the Valuation Office Vote 16, the outturn figure for 2013 was &euro;7.42 million and we have allocated &euro;8.9 million for next year.  We expect an acceleration of the national revaluation programme during the course of this year.</p></speech>

With regard to procurement, tenders will make sense for the specific product.  It is a national rather than a local market, so we will not have local procurement in that sense.  One will not travel from Donegal to Wexford, for example, in order to provide a cleaning service in the offices of the Environmental Protection Agency.  There will be a practical local component.  It would be useful at a later date for the director of the procurement office to go through this in some detail, and the committee could even bring in representatives of the small and medium enterprise sector to engage.  It may be something for the work programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1294" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22014011500011#K01000"><p>On a related matter, my contribution relates to general procurement and the e-Government process.  When Ms Josephine Feehily appeared before the committee recently to consider how the local property charge was being paid, it was very evident that over half the people now paying the charge are doing so by means of a debit or credit card payment.  That is a massive success with regard to people engaging with electronic systems, although difficulties arose with how the payment was scheduled.  It showed intent as to how people will engage with Government services.  People would fill in a medical card application if they were to go down that route.</p><p>  The half-year local property charge payment for the 2013 was approximately &euro;250 million, so we are talking about a figure of &euro;500 million next year.  From the discussion with Ms Feehily, it appears the merchant agreement for the credit card payment is 1.25%, which is very high.  Following from this, I wrote a series of parliamentary questions to all Departments, asking them for the merchant agreement sum they have agreed; the lowest rate seems to be 0.5%, with the highest rate in excess of 2.5%.  The sums are different for Departments as some deal with very small credit card costs, whereas others see quite significant sums processed.  The biggest sum - almost on a par with the local property charge - is traditional motor tax and vehicle registration, with almost &euro;500,000 in income there.  The credit card merchant agreement in that case is 0.5%, with a debit card charge of 26 cent per card transaction.  The net sum is &euro;3 million for the Department.  I do not know the percentage of people making payments with cards but the proportion is probably similar to the local property charge, meaning there is another &euro;3 million for the local property tax, etc.</p><p>  Credit card payments are being made to the cost of several million euro and the merchant agreement seems to differ with every Department.  Perhaps that is a legacy issue.  Is there a possibility that we could arrive at one merchant agreement?  Industry representatives have told me that if the public service online payment facility was tendered as a single unit, the rate would be well under 0.5% as there is such a significant sum of money involved.  Could that be considered?  I would be grateful if given an ongoing progress report as to how the issue develops.</p></speech>

I have already circulated a statement to the committee to which I will speak.</p> <p>I confess that, initially, I had some hesitation about speaking at length about the affairs of a Department where I served for most of my career.  However it is now some considerable time since I retired and, as I no longer have any direct connection with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, I speak here entirely as an individual and on my own behalf.  I begin by welcoming the announcement by the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade of a review of Irish foreign policy.  I note that he has said he will take account of a series of other reviews.  A foreign policy review nearly 20 years after the White Paper of the mid-1990s is timely and I hope it will help to build public understanding and support for our foreign policy.  Ireland&rsquo;s foreign policy today is diverse and multifaceted.  It extends well beyond the area of work of my former Department.  Through our membership of the European Union and other bodies, the Taoiseach and other Ministers are deeply involved in foreign policy.  However, I hope members will understand if I focus to a great extent on the area of work of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade and his Department.</p><p> Most books on international relations are written from the viewpoint of larger States.  They discuss the international system in terms of power, such as shifting interests and power relations, the balance of power and deterrence.  I have always thought that smaller countries, especially those with a history such as ours, draw on a very different kind of experience.  We are not necessarily more moral, although we might like to think so, but the concern of smaller countries like ours is less with power or so-called power projection than with stability, order, justice and the rule of law in the international system.  That underlying concern has characterised our foreign relations since the foundation of the State.   The policy of any state will naturally be greatly influenced by its geographic situation, its economy, its history and the character and outlook of its people.  Ireland is a small, independent and democratic state in western Europe and is a committed member of the European Union.  We are an open trading country.  We are not members of an alliance.  We have a particular sense of our own history.  We are situated in a prosperous region and despite the considerable difficulties caused by the severe recession of recent years we remain relatively prosperous by comparison with most other states in the world.  All of this sets the broad background for our approach to international affairs.</p><p> This still leaves a considerable margin for decisions as to the kind of policies we pursue.  By way of a very general summary of my own views, I believe that Irish foreign policy ought to be directed to promoting the interests, concerns and values of our people &ndash; I stress concerns and values as well as interests.  With due regard to our size, population and relative prosperity, Ireland should act responsibly as a State in every way we can whether directly or through organisations such as the United Nations to promote peace, order, justice and human rights in a troubled world.  I do not wish to see Ireland join a military alliance of any kind but I think our membership of the European Union is vital to us and we should be willing to work with other member states towards closer union.  I will develop these points in more detail as I proceed.</p><p> My submission sets out a brief survey of the international scene but, in the interest of brevity, I will simply touch on some of the issues mentioned.  The failure to construct the new order which we had hoped for in the 1990s is regrettable.  War and conflict continue in places like Afghanistan and Iraq and a dreadful civil war is being fought in Syria.  There is something of a split in Islam in the Middle East between Shia and Sunni.  In regard to the Israeli-Palestine problem, it is difficult to be hopeful but we may hope that the US Secretary of State, John Kerry, will make progress.  A more hopeful development has been the cautious movement towards dialogue between the United States and other western countries and Iran.  Members will be aware of this topic given that they have been to Iran in recent days.</p><p> In the Pacific region there is contention between China and Japan over certain islands.  This could be dangerous if the contention was to develop further.  In Africa, there is considerable conflict.  The fall of Gaddafi in Libya has released arms and fighters, who have spread elsewhere.  A worrying growth of Islamic fundamentalism can be observed across Mali, Central African Republic, Southern Sudan and northern Nigeria.  Issues arising at a global level include the continuing growth of world population, pressures on resources, poverty and the dangers and instabilities posed by climate change.  I have not even touched on economic issues or on the current crisis of the international financial system which continues to cause serious problems.</p><p> As to specific issues in our foreign relations I must necessarily be selective.  There are five in particular which I would like to touch on briefly.  The first is Northern Ireland and the related but much broader issue of Anglo-Irish relations.  An unhappy consequence of the settlement of 1921 which led to the foundation of this State was that certain issues were bottled up in Northern Ireland.  These included the relations between Nationalist and Unionist communities and the relationship between the two islands on the narrower ground of Northern Ireland.   Unionists remained fearful about the constitutional status of Northern Ireland and the differences which arose from time to time about how best to respond to the conflict had the effect of holding back and sometimes disrupting what would otherwise be a close, warm and neighbourly Anglo-Irish relationship.  As these issues touched on the security and in some ways on the very identity of the State, they involved the Taoiseach and all Members of Government.  Happily today, the fundamental issues have been resolved.  The conditions for any possible future change have been agreed and institutions have been put in place to promote co-operation between parties within Northern Ireland, between North and South in Ireland and between Britain and Ireland.  Most importantly, the settlement reached has been ratified by the people in simultaneous referenda.  These structures are working and they have been ratified symbolically by the Queen's visit to Ireland and, no doubt, will be given further impetus by the President&rsquo;s visit to London.  This is enormous progress. </p><p> However, outstanding problems include sectarianism and the small number of dissidents who cannot count on deep support but can cause significant trouble.  Those of us who worked for a resolution of the problem of Northern Ireland in different ways and places had always hoped that once the deep causes of conflict had been removed or diminished, the politics of the area would no longer be a zero-sum game and that the political parties in Northern Ireland would find it possible to work together towards a shared future and not just a shared out future.  While I am too far removed from events to speak definitively, there is reason to be disappointed about the slow progress towards this goal thus far.  The competing narratives about the past are still in contention and the Haass-O&rsquo;Sullivan talks have not yet succeeded.  It will be necessary for the two Governments to continue to follow closely what is happening and to contribute in any way they can towards a settlement of outstanding issues. </p><p> The second issue is the European Union, which is of such central importance to us that our EU membership is best seen as the over-arching framework or horizon within which many other foreign and domestic policy choices are now made.  It is regrettable that we have come to associate the Union with austerity as much as with solidarity but we should remind ourselves of what the EU is and why we want to be part of it.  The EU originated in an idea by far sighted European leaders in the 1950s, and the then Taoiseach, Se&aacute;n Lemass, was also far sighted in his decision in 1961 that Ireland should apply for membership.  However, the European Union of today is not just the creation of those early leaders.  It is the work of generations of leaders of different political outlooks, who worked first in western Europe and later in the continent as a whole over more than 60 years.  In the 40 years since we joined in 1973, Ireland has played a full part in the creation of this Union.  It is not something over there; it is our Union which we helped to build.  What has emerged is an organic growth, shaped according to what was politically and economically feasible at various times over more than six decades.  It involves a pooling of sovereignty in specified areas by 28 States based on the principles of democracy, human rights and the rule of law.  The legal order it has established applies to citizens as well as to member states.  This Union of states and peoples is something quite new in international life.   It is a structure which accommodates a creative tension between the direct national interests which member states naturally pursue and the more generous ideal which the very concept of the Union represents.</p><p> I am aware that what I have been saying may appear rhetorical or idealistic.  It has been difficult to detect much vision in the response of the Union to the economic and financial crisis of recent times.  What we now see too often is apparent disarray and lack of solidarity and in Ireland we tend to see the troika as imposing austerity rather than as a body through which EU institutions were fully represented and which was prepared to help us with funding when we could not raise funds elsewhere.  At this time of low morale in the Union, it is important to remind ourselves of what it is we have created together in Europe.  In June 2014 it will be 100 years since two shots fired in Sarajevo started a chain of events which included the carnage of two World Wars and the frozen hostilities of nearly half a century of Cold War.  I do not know whether the European Union, as distinct from individual member states, is planning to commemorate this event but I suggest that we need an EU event of particular significance in this centenary year to remind us of our dark past and to point out the contrast between a millennium or more of warfare and the Europe of today, a continent which, notwithstanding its economic and financial difficulties, is democratic, committed to human rights and at peace with itself for the first time in its history.</p> <p>I am not saying we should be starry-eyed in our approach.  There will be a tension at times between our national policies and EU commitments.  We should argue our case forcefully and always work for agreement, because if there is agreement the EU can carry great weight in international negotiations.  We have generally found that member states are flexible and willing to accommodate national positions where vital interests are at stake.</p><p> These are likely to be testing times for the EU.  There has been progress about the financial and banking crisis but the result and effects of what we have gone through have tended to divide the union and weakened the solidarity that was characteristic of an earlier time and from which we have benefited.  The concept of free movement is being questioned in some countries because of migration from eastern European countries.  New parties have taken an essentially disruptive approach and they could do well in the European Parliament elections.  There is the significant issue of what the UK will do regarding its membership of the EU.  Even the lead-up to the proposed referendum there could cause difficulties because of the need to negotiate and the question of how far we should go to accommodate the UK's remaining in the EU and worries that we might diminish the fabric we have created in the Union.</p><p> While Oireachtas committees have done a great deal of good, we probably need better scrutiny of European legislation.  I sometimes wonder if the Seanad, which we have voted to retain, might not have a role.  Perhaps there could also be a revision of the system of election and nomination and something done to bring in expertise.  We seem to always need to have referenda because of decisions of the Supreme Court.  That is difficult when dealing with a treaty which can be necessarily complex.  It is healthy too that people have a feeling of ownership of our Constitution and that they are asked to discuss and debate our membership every so often.  If and when there is a new treaty I would like there to be a clear explanatory memorandum, of the kind that we get with Irish draft legislation, drafted by the secretariat of the Council, the legal services, and perhaps even approved by the European Court, which would have authority to say in plainer language what the treaty means.</p><p> On security and defence, I do not wish Ireland to join NATO or any military alliance.  If that is what neutrality means, I am all for it.  However it would be healthy if we had more of a debate about the content and meaning of neutrality.  It is not helpful to understand neutrality solely in terms of the Hague Convention of 1907, although some aspects are relevant.  We have commitments under the UN Charter.  We have to impose sanctions if the Security Council so decides and, in principle, we could be called on to provide troops if the Security Council decided on enforcement action.  That has not happened in practice and is unlikely but is there as a principle.  In 1946 Eamon de Valera, in proposing to the D&aacute;il that we join the UN, brought out very clearly what we were committing ourselves to.  We have also the commitment to the common foreign and security policy of the EU, which has been endorsed in successive referenda.  The Irish people are proud of what the Irish Defence Forces have done in so many peacekeeing operations under the aegis of the EU and otherwise and would want it to continue.  I doubt if all these activities would be seen by the old-fashioned statesmen of the late 19th century as compatible with the kind of neutrality they were talking about in 1907.</p><p> I understand the triple lock, I sympathise with it and it is important to have the legitimacy of the UN mandate, but I sometimes wonder if the way we have tied ourselves into that might not be loosened just a little.  It is possible to imagine that where there is a block in the Security Council, but where everybody here thinks a contribution to an EU peacekeeping operation would be desirable, we could have a rule that it would require a two-thirds majority in the D&aacute;il.  A two-thirds majority would be substantial.  Without being facetious, Article 28.3.1o seems to envisage that a simple majority in the D&aacute;il could allow the State to declare war. God forbid that we should ever come to that.</p><p> There is strong public support for the United Nations.  The UN is a product of a war time alliance and was originally intended to maintain the alliance and enforce the peace in the post-war years.  The record is very patchy because the Security Council was divided for nearly half a century.  The UN has grown into something very different.  It is now a universal organisation of states, the first in history.  It brings some degree of order and is the nearest thing we have to an international authority in a world which would otherwise be anarchic.  We have a network of specialised agencies around the UN.  We have conventions and agreements on human rights which the member states which have ratified them regard as binding.  We have UN peacekeeping operations.  Above all we have the UN Charter, a core document of international law, a code of conduct for relations between states, which they all accept even if they do not always observe.</p><p> Ireland has always been committed to that kind of international organisation.  On 11 April 1919, before the League of Nations was established, the first D&aacute;il passed a resolution declaring Ireland&rsquo;s readiness to enter a world League of Nations and accept the responsibilities that went with it.  We have played our part in the Security Council, the Human Rights Council and through our Defence Forces.</p><p> We have a review of Irish aid and international development from last year and it is very important.  The T&aacute;naiste has said he will take account of that in the review of foreign policy.  It might be asked why, at a time when Ireland has to borrow to fund a deficit, we should run a development aid programme at all.  There are several answers one might give.  By comparison with much of the world we are still quite prosperous.  When we were poorer, in the 1950s and earlier, the altruism and emotional sympathy of the Irish public was channelled into missionary and educational effort across the world.  That same kind of feeling finds an outlet in voluntary aid agencies and our Government's international development programme.  The public wants that to continue.  We have chosen not to end the deficit all in one go but to try to carry on the normal functions of government such as welfare, education and so on.  We should also try to maintain our attempts to try to alleviate the absolute poverty in certain areas.  I do not need to dwell on all this because it is dealt with in this document, One World, One Future, which I highly commend.</p><p> I refer to our embassies, foreign services and economic interests.  Although I am no longer connected with foreign affairs, I am slightly biased because I spent my career there, so I was glad to hear members of the committee and the T&aacute;naiste say nice things about some of our embassies.  The name of the Department of Foreign Affairs and this committee have been extended to include trade, and that is right and good and I hope a good deal is being done in that area.  However, our economic interests go beyond trade and our embassies can do much more in other economic areas.  Our embassy in Washington will always be very active if issues arise on Capitol Hill, taxation or otherwise, which affect our interests.  From personal experience I know our embassies provide facilities and status sometimes for events hosted by the IDA or exporters.  That is a broader aspect.</p><p> Our embassies do work in the EU countries in following events, economic developments and positions of governments in their countries and reporting home, which all goes into helping our Ministers when they come to the Council where those same governments are represented.  Our embassies have done much to restore Ireland's reputation over the past few years.  It has been quiet work under the direction of the Government in their respective countries.  The detailed work of an embassy will depend on the nature and character of the state to which it is accredited.  In an authoritarian country with a very state-directed system it may be necessary to use the embassy as such.  In a country such as the UK or the US, exporters often prefer to do their own thing but can get encouragement from the embassy.</p> <p> I should like to conclude because I have gone a little over time but I would like to give some general reflections since this is a year when we look back to events in 1914 which, first, ended an era and second, after two world wars and a prolonged cold war, led to the very different world we live in today.  Before 1914 a small number of European powers, through their colonies, ruled a large part of the world &ndash; by one estimate more than half its surface area and half its population.  The principle of self-determination worked out through the 20th century has turned this into a world of approximately 200 territorial states, each insisting on its own sovereignty.  We have a network of relatively weak international institutions designed to promote co-operation but no overall authority which might impose peace, justice and order. </p><p> This century differs from any previous era in one respect.  We have become conscious of the limits of our globe.  We live on a small planet - the only place that we know of in the universe where life exists.  Its living species are interconnected, we are changing its climate in ways we cannot foresee, and the global population has increased to approximately 7 billion, almost three times what it was in 1950, and it continues to increase.  In this world, states such as Ireland will naturally continue to advance the interests of their people but there is a new requirement on all of us, which was well put by Kofi Annan in the millennium year 2000.  He stated: "In addition to the separate responsibilities each state bears towards its own society, states are, collectively, the custodians of our common life on this planet".  I hope this will not sound too high flown but I hope that in its foreign policy, Ireland, small as it is, will always show some awareness that we too share in this new responsibility for "planetary management&rsquo;".</p></speech>

I also thank Deputy Smith for giving way.</p><p>  I am grateful to Mr. Dorr for his contribution.  I would like to hone in on two areas, the first of which is Northern Ireland.  I have always felt that partition was a blight on this country and the people who were most adversely affected by it were Unionists.  It has made them insular and they feel under threat as a result of which they are defensive.  I do not say that sectarianism is a product of partition but it is maintained by it.  For those of us who subscribe to the reunification of Ireland, should that be a central part of our policy?  It tends to be left in the background.  I have reservations about aspects of the Good Friday Agreement.  I acknowledge it was a compromise and like all compromises, it was not perfect but the construction of an all-Ireland economy, to which we aspire, would benefit people in the North and in the Republic.  I was struck over the years engaging with Unionist politicians, particularly DUP members, who conceded privately that in many economic areas their interests lay in merging with us rather than being attached to England.  They dare not say that in public obviously because politically it would not have been prudent from their point of view.  Should it be part of policy?  What should we do to achieve that?</p><p>  My experience is that by speaking openly with people as to where I come from politically I am respected more than if I give a different impression.  I recall a number of Unionists saying to me in the 1980s that they had much more respect for Charlie Haughey who stated clearly his position than for Garret FitzGerald who they felt shared the same objective but had a different approach.  I spent two or three hours in Glasgow one night with one of the current Northern Ireland DUP Ministers.  He knew where I was coming from politically and at the end of the night he said, "Look, Jim, I'd have much more in common talking to you tonight than I would with somebody from any part of England."  There is an opportunity to build in this regard without, at the same time, putting Unionists in a position where they feel a great threat.  How we deal with that threat is an issue.</p><p>  I am a member of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly and currently we are examining the issues the Haass report tried to deal with, including the parades.  We met people from both communities to deal with the flags and so on.  There are great concerns about what is going on with the UVF in east Belfast and the UDA in County Antrim.  There is a failure of political leadership to put the interests of Northern Ireland ahead of the interest of political party promotion.  I acknowledge the same could be said of the politics in the Republic as well.  How do we get beyond that to break down these artificial barriers in an inclusive way?</p><p>  The second area is the EU.  Mr. Dorr mentioned the vision of Jean Monnet, Robert Schuman and Se&aacute;n Lemass.  I was a strongly committed supporter of the Union.  I was chairman of the south east European movement committee many years ago and I supported every European referendum but, like many people, I am reappraising my position in light of the troika.  The IMF was far more empathetic to the concerns and challenges Irish people faced as a consequence of this depression.  The same empathy was not shared by the European Commission or the ECB.  If there is no deal on the banking debt, for example, which was a consequence of both domestic and European regulatory failures and policy deficiencies, and if the burden is not shared and a small population such as ours has to bear the full brunt of that without the Community acknowledging its part in the downturn and making a tangible acknowledgment of that through sharing the burden imposed on the people------</p></speech>

I liked his comments about Kofi Annan's vision and his own vision of Ireland in the context of planetary matters.  We are a small country and our history and so on are significant positives no matter where one travels in the world.  When we met the Iranians, I pointed out that as a small state we do not have a hidden agenda like many other states.  Whether it is in Asia, Africa or elsewhere, people accept that Ireland does not have the same agenda as other countries.</p> <p>I think people accept that Ireland does not have the same agenda as many other countries.  We are not trying to dominate or undermine their system of government and we are certainly not trying to exploit their people, which is a major positive factor in the area of trade.  The Department used to just cover foreign affairs and human rights and so on, but it is now covering the whole trade aspect of it.  Is that a positive development?  People have concerns that the paths instead of crossing often go in opposite directions.</p><p> One of the witnesses mentioned the slow progress in the North.  Earlier I was asking the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade questions on the failure of the Haass talks which ended with a document on which all the parties had to compromise.  Unfortunately the Unionists did not feel they could step up to the plate in that regard.  Part of the difficulty is that rather than working towards a shared future - the witness is right about sectarianism - there does not seem to be any agreement between parties in the North on basic things such as tackling poverty, bad housing and inequality.  There is no agreement on the past and there is certainly no agreement on how we tackle the future.  There seems to be a lack of vision there.  One of the difficulties seems to be the insecurity of Unionists and their future on this island.  They seem to be more interested in the politics of the next election.</p><p> Am I going on too long?</p></speech>

However, I encourage members not to get involved in specific areas.  We are discussing a general review of foreign policy.  Mr. Dorr does not have to answer questions on specific items on Northern Ireland or wherever.  We are dealing with general foreign policy.  I would prefer if members did not ask on specific areas because Mr. Dorr does not work for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade now.</p></speech>

If anything will kill the potential of what came out of those agreements, it is slow progress.</p><p>  I have some disagreements with the witnesses' assessment of EU developments.  Many key EU personnel, most recently Viviane Reding, the vice-president of the Commission talked about a true political union and creating a united states of Europe.  That is a big issue coming out of Europe and how we are moving forward.  Like many Irish people, I believe there was a lack of solidarity within Europe in this regard.  I believe that many people in Greece, Cyprus and Portugal would have a similar view.</p><p>  I welcome what the witnesses said about Ireland's neutrality and not joining NATO.  However, it is worrying that a recent European Council meeting solely discussed defence and security issues.  I would conclude that the EU is moving increasingly towards creating a European army to work alongside and co-operate with NATO.</p><p>  The witness spoke about the referendums.  Many of us have a view on what was promised in the referendums.  What came out in the documentation was at odds with that.  I agree with the witness on European scrutiny.  I believe there is broad agreement across the committee.  I believe there should be a greater role for the Seanad in that.  How can that be developed?  Should that scrutiny role be taken from this committee?  If we are not talking in terms of reforming the Seanad, we will have much of the same and I do not know how we can implement that greater scrutiny role.</p><p>  Even on the First World War issue, there is disagreement on whether the shots fired in Sarajevo were the trigger.  They were fired a couple of months before the outbreak.  Even on huge issues like that, historians, politicians and people who are fond of history can have difficulties.</p><p>  One of the key signals that people are stepping back from Europe is shown in a recent survey of European parliamentarians.  It found that a tiny proportion of people recognise their own Member of the European Parliament and did not even know who they were.  That in itself shows how people are disengaging from the European process, which is of concern.  In free news sheets one sees articles about the activities of individual MEPs.  How can we increase the acknowledgement of the work MEPs are doing?</p><p>  I apologise for going on for so long.</p></speech>

We have known each other for a long time.  As always he has interesting and provocative views, which is  no harm.  I welcome the changes in foreign policy.  I believe they will involve all Departments at all times and through the embassies the Department will feel a greater responsibility for ensuring that they are playing in the national interest throughout the world on a full-time basis in a way that was not expected of them before because they were restricted totally to diplomatic issues.  Now they are involved in the trade area also, which is important.  Does Mr. Dorr agree with that?</p><p>  The international scene has changed considerably.  Mr. Dorr mentioned that the world population had increased threefold since the 1950s and our population has almost doubled since the 1950s when it stood at approximately 2.56 million.  This is a worldwide phenomenon and we will need to make changes.  Does Mr. Dorr believe we have the capacity to change and adopt new policies capable of dealing with the emerging situation of worldwide strife, starvation and international aid?  Have we developed the skills to be able to deliver in a precise way and do so quickly?</p><p>  Northern Ireland and Anglo-Irish relations are important and it is no harm to mention them in this context.</p> <p>I do not agree it should be part and parcel of our daily bread and we should spend our time moaning about what we have not done.  We spent 800 years moaning about what was happening and about our relationship with our neighbours.  A great deal has been achieved.  It is true everybody should continue to work on what has been achieved and try to develop it further.  To what extent does Mr. Dorr think all avenues are being explored at present with a view to bringing the agreement and peace to a new level, taking into account the need for the Governments in the UK and here and the respective parties in Northern Ireland to recognise the importance of the achievements so far, the need to ensure there is continuity and follow up, and that the island as a whole needs to benefit, as it is doing to my mind, from the agreement already reached?  This does not in any way minimise or belittle what has been achieved because it has been colossal.  We amended our Constitution to facilitate the structures now in place.</p><p> I would love to see a debate on neutrality in the modern context.  As Mr. Dorr pointed out, neutrality does not mean the same thing it did in 1939.  Some refer to Ireland's neutrality as the traditional position, but there was no traditional position until 1939 when, to my mind, it was the right decision for good tactical reasons.  I am sure the former leader of Fianna F&aacute;il will forgive me for agreeing with them in this context.  Traditionally Irish people had been involved in wars throughout the world, in this continent and in others.  It was nothing new to the nation to be involved in what one might now call peacekeeping.</p><p> Another issue is emerging, and I particularly ask that it be dealt with.  Since the 1950s we have developed unique skills in the area of peacekeeping in a way very few other countries have.  We have done it successfully and our Defence Forces have achieved a huge degree of respect throughout the world for themselves and the nation.  They have done things which would not have been expected of us 25 or 30 years ago.  They have always stood their ground honourably and have earned a great deal of respect for this.  To what extent can we expect to use our diplomatic and peacekeeping influence in the emerging world of today, whether in Europe, wider Europe or worldwide?  Should we move to a second level?</p><p> NATO has been mentioned and I have long been of the opinion the UN has done a good job but it has limited capabilities in terms of deployment, logistics and the rapid delivery of heavy armaments when required, a case in point being the war in the Balkans when the UN was unable to deploy quickly and effectively in a supportive way which was necessary at the time.  Lessons must be learned from this and perhaps some consideration should be given to a means of trying to ensure whether it is sufficient for a country in Europe to be neutral and to state in the event of an outbreak of hostilities that it will remain neutral and will not get involved.  What happens in the event of such a country being attacked itself?</p><p> I will not mention Irish Aid other than to state I believe we have done a very good job and the Irish people have shown over many years their commitment and concern.  They have led by example in a way which other nationalities could follow.</p></speech>

What is Mr. Dorr's opinion on how we can reconcile human rights and trade?  Must we forget about human rights when it comes to trade?  Can we be a voice to insist that workers' rights are included in economic trade agreements?</p><p>  How effective or ineffective is the UN when we consider the world in which we live?  It was stated we would never again see what happened in Bosnia and Rwanda but we are seeing it again and seeing it increasingly.  How can countries have confidence in the work of the UN when there are so many glaring failures in its ability to bring about resolution?  The latest is what is happening in the Sudan.</p><p>  My next point is with regard to coherence in our foreign policy.  Ireland contributes to eliminating hunger and Irish Aid does an amount of work on this issue.  While it is doing this on the one hand, on the other hand Irish policy is not progressive enough when it comes to the issue of biofuels.  We give aid to eliminate hunger but we contribute to productive land being taken away from people to satisfy the biofuel needs of the developed world.</p><p>  What is Mr. Dorr's opinion on our current leaders when it comes to foreign policy?  Whether he agrees or disagrees with the politics of Frank Aiken, Conor Cruise O'Brien or Harry Boland, does he see a more cautious approach now when it comes Irish foreign policy?</p></speech>

What changes do we want?  I agree 100% with most of what is in Mr. Dorr's paper but I am not quite sure how the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade will take on board what we will speak about as a change of policy.</p><p>  I must confess I feel slightly embarrassed as an Irish European when I see terrorist organisations running campaigns and destabilising parts of Africa such as Mali, Mauritania and northern Nigeria.  There is also the lawlessness and ruthlessness of those who kidnap for ransom human beings and ships on the high seas.  I am embarrassed to see the French going in after the terrorists ostensibly to protect human life and possibly governments.  We are happy for others do the dirty work while we as Europeans fall back on the easy soft bed of roses of our neutrality.  The paper is provocative in so far as Mr. Dorr mentions he does not want to see Ireland join any military alliance but he also discusses the triple lock and argues for a less rigid interpretation of our neutrality.  How does he argue we would create this balance between loosening up the definition of neutrality while avoiding breaching our constitutionality?</p><p>  Having spent quite a while abroad I must state the Irish police force and Irish Army are phenomenal in whatever country they enter in a peacekeeping or peace enforcement role.</p> <p>Irish troops and citizens in aid organisations are held in high esteem.  Should we not be proud that when some troops were pulled out of the Golan Heights or the Sinai Desert, Irish troops went in?  Consider the Lebanese villages where Irish troops are warmly welcomed as peacekeepers when other troops would not be.  How do we build on this situation?  I am not sure what element of foreign policy we must change so as to engage further in world conflicts, particularly in Africa.  We should be proud that the Army is playing a leading role in Somalia.  How do we become greater participants in the human struggle for fairness without conflicting with the Constitution and the neutrality clause?</p><p> I agree with Mr. Dorr in many respects.  I will conclude by saying that the British and their media were outrageous.  There is a strong anti-European slant, as mentioned in this paper.  The Romanians and Bulgarians were highlighted as people who would swamp Great Britain, notwithstanding the fact that when Ireland allowed the free flow of labour 12 months or two years ago, there was no flood or conflict.  Those who came here are happily settling in.  How can foreign policy change nations' negativity, which is basically racism?  For this reason, I agree that the EU is a phenomenal club of nations working collectively as best they can.</p><p> I will tease out a final matter.  The negative developments - in Mali, the Central African Republic, southern Sudan, parts of northern Nigeria and so on - were mentioned, but while there has been retrenchment in some areas, we should applaud what has been achieved elsewhere - for example, economic growth in many African countries.  Someone mentioned trade.  The African ambassadors, who sit as a collective of seven in Ireland, argue forcibly for trade, not charity.  From their point of view, there are benefits to developing trade links.</p><p> I will be provocative about Northern Ireland.  It is a sectarian state, notwithstanding the Good Friday Agreement.  There seems to have been a terrible divvying out of power to two sectarian forces, the Unionists and the republicans.  People in the middle are being squeezed.  For example, can one imagine recruiting to a police force on the basis of religion or needing to declare one's self a Catholic?  Where does this leave the dissenter, the middle ground and normal, healthy democracy?  Having spoken to some former paramilitaries in the North, I know they feel betrayed by the Unionists.  On the Nationalist side, funding drawn down from Europe, Britain and Ireland is being dispersed throughout the Nationalist community.  Does this not reinforce the divisions that created problems previously?</p><p> Could we evolve a new formula for engagement?  Ukraine, Moldova, Georgia and Armenia are the Union's peripheral countries.  We were led up the garden path and told that everything would go smoothly in Ukraine and that it would sign agreements with the EU.  What sort of intelligence units are operating in the EU that could get the situation so badly wrong?  Armenia had already pulled out of the relationship, yet there was no early warning sign.  In terms of the EU, with Baroness Ashton and so on, can Ireland as an independent nation in the Union make bilateral forays into these conflict areas with a view to intervening diplomatically in support of ordinary people in Ukraine, Moldova or Georgia?</p></speech>

He stated that most books on international relations were written from the viewpoint of larger states.  Many of our higher education colleges and universities provide courses in international relations.  Professor Tonra will address the committee later.  Is Mr. Dorr familiar with the courses provided in our universities?  Are they framed from a similar point of view?</p><p>  I am broadly supportive of Turkish accession, but we occasionally receive correspondence outlining people's concerns about it and EU enlargement in general.</p><p>  The architecture of the UN has not been changed in many decades and does not take account of the changing status of many countries, particularly in Asia.  Does Mr. Dorr foresee any change in that architecture, particularly the membership of the Security Council?</p><p>  I wish to put an issue regarding Northern Ireland on the record.  Considerable progress has been made.  The peace process is relatively new and we must maximise the potential of the Good Friday Agreement.  As to Deputy Byrne's comments, policing is one of the success stories of Northern Ireland.  Chris Patten devised a good, ambitious programme.  Thankfully and importantly, both communities have bought into it.</p><p>  If possible, will Mr. Dorr comment on a concern of mine regarding the Haass-O'Sullivan proposals?  Good work was done and I welcome the fact that the Alliance Party, the SDLP and Sinn F&eacute;in have taken a positive approach, unlike the two Unionist parties, which is unfortunate.  In every major breakthrough that brought a new dispensation to Northern Ireland the two sovereign governments were active participants in the talks, not bystanders.  I hope that the Haass-O'Sullivan talks will be brought to a successful conclusion, but the two sovereign governments need to be involved.  The Downing Street declaration, the Anglo-Irish Agreement and the St. Andrews Agreement were driven by the two sovereigns with the co-operation and support of the political parties in Northern Ireland.</p><p>  Mr. Dorr mentioned climate change.  It does not get the attention it deserves in foreign policy.  Will he comment in this regard?</p><p>  I hope that Britain will not leave the EU.  We in this country are not exercised enough about the matter.  Any change in Britain's EU status would cause us significant difficulties.</p><p>  The Department's name was changed, but it was given relatively little additional responsibility.  Mr. Dorr rightly pointed out that the Irish Embassy network works in all of the country's interests, not just foreign relations and trade.  Ireland's lead Minister at the World Trade Organisation talks is the Minister for Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.  Should the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade be the lead Department?  A world trade deal that is ambitious and balanced is badly needed, particularly for poorer countries.</p><p>  Chancellor Kohl and President Mitterrand provided leadership in the 1980s when changes were occurring in eastern Europe.  In particular, Chancellor Kohl provided a great air of authority, vision and commitment to all of Europe.  Should such leadership be provided at Commission President or European Council President level?  As Mr. Dorr mentioned, vision and leadership have not been offered to the EU in recent years.</p> <p>With regard to the Middle East, the US Secretary of State John Kerry has been doing Trojan work in trying to achieve a framework agreement but the Israelis have announced the construction of 1,400 new homes in Jewish settlements in the West Bank and east Jerusalem.  Is Mr. Dorr concerned about the two-state solution?  Some make the point - although I do not share it - that it is impossible.  I had hoped that Mr. Kerry's initiatives earlier this month would prove fruitful.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1335" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Noel Dorr" time="17:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014011500010#J00300"><p>It would be conventional to say I am happy to respond, and I am.  I would be happy to engage in longer discussion but it would be hard to fit it all in.  I am not sure I have captured all of the questions.  If I miss anything, please forgive me.  Senator Walsh spoke about low morale, and there is low morale in the European Union.  He spoke about the troika and I agree with those comments.  I harked back to 1914 to try to lift our eyes a bit, as we can contrast the Europe of today with the Europe of history, and particularly the horrors of the 20th century.  In the paper I wanted to try to lift us from the understandable disarray or bad feeling we might have about certain things to a larger level, and I hope that will happen.</p><p>  Senator Walsh spoke about the question of unity and attitudes to it.  Of course we would all like to see a united Ireland agreed in peace where we would work together.  During my time as an official in the Department dealing with foreign affairs, I was at the Sunningdale conference and I was also there when the then Taoiseach met Mrs. Thatcher for the first time.  I was involved in the negotiations for the Anglo-Irish Agreement of 1985, I attended the talks under Sir Patrick Mayhew at the beginning of the 1990s and I was there for the framework document of the Downing Street declaration.  I had retired before the Good Friday Agreement was made.  All the time there was a question of consent from the Unionists.  As I tried to indicate in the paper, the old Irish question had two complex aspects which interacted, the question of relations between Unionism and Nationalism on the island and, in turn, the relations between the two islands.  These matters interacted and in a way that was bottled in the narrower ground of Northern Ireland, where it was left as a subject of contention, which it still is to a degree.  The question was how to agree, and eventually Ireland and Britain, with the parties and people concerned, reached the 1998 Good Friday Agreement.  We ratified it, including conditions for change, and we put it into the Constitution.  The power of two referendums, North and South, was very great, and we hope that has given scope to the aspirations to persuade each other and stop the contention between the two agendas.  Although there is hope for the future, the other point I tried to bring out was that we wanted the people of Northern Ireland to feel they had a shared future, and that if they worked together the institutions for co-operation would gradually produce a positive effect.  It would be great if one day we could reach unity in Ireland but I am not sure how helpful it would be to emphasise right now.</p><p>  I am not directly involved so I cannot really judge either with respect to Northern Ireland or with respect to what is happening, but I have the feeling that for Unionists the old fear of Dublin is now much less and they seem to be willing to come to Dublin to attend events and so on.  There is still the question of relations between the two communities in Northern Ireland, or the shared-out future.  I hope and believe that we in this State are not seen as a threat any longer, and over time we hope and aspire.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe spoke about the Haass talks and the fact that Unionists did not compromise.  I am dependent on press reports and that seems to have been the point.  He indicated that there was no agreement on basic issues such as the economy, the narrative and so on.  That is sad and true.  We had all hoped that normal politics on normal political issues would begin to work in Northern Ireland but there is still an underlying tension and competing narratives, and progress has been slow.</p><p>  The Deputy spoke about Europe and possible political union in a united states of Europe.  I have always thought it wrong to think of Europe in those terms.  The argument I tried to make in the paper and which I strongly believe is that something new is emerging in Europe, which is a union of states and people.  It amounts to more than any international organisation we had before, as those organisations have regard to state relations to each other.  This reaches to the public and the system of law that the European Union establishes.  It should not aim to be a federal state, as the phrase "a union of states and of peoples" is important.  The Lisbon treaty brings out the point that the people have the power to elect the Parliament, with the states represented in the council.</p><p>  There was a point about the lack of solidarity, and again I indicate that I was trying to lift our eyes to the larger picture over the past century since what happened in Sarajevo.  It is true that we focus on the shots fired by Gavrilo Princip on 28 June 1914, as it is a nice symbolic event to mention.  The events that followed changed the world, not the shots.  We are commemorating the centenary this year, which is why I referred to it.</p><p>  I was also asked about the Seanad and how my suggestion in that regard might develop.  It is not for me to tell parliamentarians what kind of reforms they should make in their structures.  My idea is a basic argument that the Seanad could be put to good use, and that would clearly be part of some kind of larger reform.  Perhaps some thought could be given to the system of election and the ways in which expertise is brought into the Seanad.  I would not like to try to prescribe that in detail, as it was simply a suggestion.</p><p>  The Deputy indicated that MEPs are not recognised, which is true.  The European Parliament has been given a very important role in recent treaties, particularly the Lisbon treaty, as there is now a role of co-decision with the Council.  It is a joint legislator in that regard in matters of European law that deeply affect all our lives and go right down to the individual in the State and not just the relations between governments.  It is understandable in a very large constituency that there may be more focus on the smaller national constituencies and it is a pity there is not a greater understanding of the role the European Parliament can and should play.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan mentioned changes in foreign policy and how they are to be implemented.  He spoke of embassies following and promoting the national interest, which they do and should do.  It is not a matter of a luxury to have a diplomatic service; it is meant to work for the nation, which it does.  It is not holding a state to an emphasis on trade and so on, although that was always part of the process when I was in the area; I can remember that vividly from when I was the ambassador in London.  As I indicated in the paper, business people may prefer to do their business in London without the embassy being there but it may be different in a country such as China, as the embassy could be necessary from the perspective of local authorities.  In London we had regular dinners at the behest of IDA Ireland in order to bring in people who were interested in investing in Ireland.  We also had receptions for An Bord Bia and so on, with an effort to co-operate with Irish State agencies and individual exporters.  That was in the 1980s, and I hope our embassies will always continue to do that.</p><p>  Deputy Durkan also asked if we are capable of adopting wholly new policies to deal with world problems.  The big question is whether the world will be able to handle that.  I have used the term "planetary management" and although it may sound a bit rhetorical, it is becoming more literally true.  We are one world, which we have realised over the past 30 to 40 years, and this was greatly symbolised for us in the famous photograph taken of the earth from the moon.</p> <p>We suddenly realise that this is the only place we have, the only place where life exists as far as we know.  Now, we have reached a type of limit.  People used to talk in the old American west about the closing of the frontier.  If one wishes to use that type of language, the global frontier has closed now.  We see the limits of resources, climate and so forth all interconnected.  It is a huge problem and whether our institutions and the UN, weak as it is, will be capable of handling it is the big question.  While we talk all the time about our national interests, and rightly so, we must also have that other thing in mind.  That was the reason I ended as I did, by raising larger questions.</p><p> I have talked about Northern Ireland.  The Deputy asked about neutrality and said that Irish people had fought in wars all over the world.  He talked about new peacekeeping skills and whether we could use them.  I was very impressed with our Defence Forces, when I had contact with them from time to time in the past, and, from speaking to people in the Curragh and so forth, with the way they have developed and adapted their approach to peacekeeping.  We all are very proud of what they do.  Certainly, the questions the Deputy raised are precisely the questions I would hope we would debate when we talk about neutrality.  What worries me is that when it came to each EU treaty, it was almost like a pantomime with people saying, "Oh yes it is" and "Oh no it is not".  It was always that type of debate about neutrality.  What we must do is talk about what exactly we are doing and what we mean by it.</p><p> In some of the debates on referenda there was a tendency to say, "Hello EU, goodbye UN".  That is not the case at all.  My experience was that the UN was anxious for the European Union to try to help and provide peacekeeping facilities and so forth.  At the broader level, that is the reason we are co-operating with our partners and joining in the joint training and the like.  After all, the other three main neutral states we always mention in Europe - Finland, Sweden and Austria - find it possible to take part fully.  We can co-operate with them.</p><p> Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised four questions.  One was about human rights and trade.  That is a vexed and difficult question.  The United Nations is universal and there are all types of governments there, some we like and some we very much would not like.  If one reduces it to the people we would like, it becomes more like an alliance or the European Union.  In the world we have today we need a universal organisation.  At the same time there is the issue of commitments to human rights and how we recognise the two.  The Deputy is right to raise the problem.</p><p> On the specific matter she mentioned, trade agreements and workers' rights, we could certainly do things in that area, but on the general question of Ministers visiting other countries to promote trade and the like, that is always a difficult matter.  There might be some countries, such as South Africa in former times under apartheid, that we just did not want to deal with, but generally we deal with the world as it is and our Ministers go on trade missions.  It is right that they should express the Irish concern when there are concerns to be expressed on human rights, not to an extent which is found offensive but to an extent where people will listen and be influenced.  I have been with Irish Ministers and, as an official, one was working on the type of thing a Minister might say which expressed something with some integrity but at the same time was not offensive and was listened to.  It is very hard to prescribe that in general, but that is what I believe our Ministers should do.  We cannot just come to the country and say, "We are better than you and this is it".  It is not that type of thing.  We carry a certain influence and people will listen sometimes, but it must be done carefully and properly.</p><p> The Deputy asked how effective the UN is.  She talked about Bosnia, Rwanda and so forth and asked how we can have confidence.  We cannot.  The UN mirrors the world.  It is a universal organisation and it is the world reflected in a certain way.  All we can do is hope to make it more effective.  It is ineffectual in some respects but if it did not exist, I believe it would be necessary to reinvent it, and it would be almost impossible to reinvent it in today's world.  I emphasise that it has changed its character.  It is not terribly effective on what it was supposed to do from the beginning, which is enforce the peace.  That was the alliance idea.  However, it has developed a network of relationships around the world which civilise the world a little and make it a little better.  We can hope to change it over time, but we cannot really have confidence.  That is the challenge ahead.  It has lasted for nearly 70 years, and that is significant.</p><p> The Deputy talked about coherence in our foreign policy.  I worked for a long time in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and in the beginning of my presentation I tried to say that foreign policy is very diverse.  What has the Minister for Finance or the Minister with responsibility for trade been doing?  They are all involved in foreign policy.  There is a phrase used in the international development aid paper I talked about, "One World, One Future", which was published last year, about whole-of-government action.  In a way, foreign policy is whole-of-government policy.  Obviously the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has a lead role, along with the Minister of State, Deputy Joe Costello, but it has to involve coherence as far as possible on the part of the Government.</p><p> I think the Deputy asked my opinion on the current leaders, but I would prefer to give an opinion on Frank Aiken and Conor Cruise O'Brien rather than on the current leadership.  However, I will make a general point.  As a very junior diplomat, I was at the UN with Frank Aiken and I worked under Conor Cruise O'Brien.  I admire and respect them and, indeed, have written a little about them.  However, the Ireland of that time was an individual, isolated, small state.  It was not admitted to the UN until 1955, although we had applied in 1946.  When we spoke in the UN, what we said was respected but, to a degree, we were small and seen as small and not connected with anything.  In today's world, we are part of the European Union which is, in a way, the largest and most coherent and effective area.  I will not compare it with other areas, but it certainly plays a role at the United Nations in concert on its foreign policy.  It cannot always agree but when it does, it plays quite a powerful role.</p><p> Ireland is respected as a member state of the EU and, of course, we speak for the European Union when we hold the Presidency.  That gives weight to what we are saying.  On the other hand, it is inclined to inhibit the degree to which we make ringing speeches.  If one takes the effort to get agreement into the pre-meeting concertation among the EU member states, where one might persuade the EU to go softer on something or to do something, one's speech might have to be tempered a little to the common position at that point.  There is a certain tension there, but I believe we carry very considerable weight as a member state of the European Union.  Of course, we are small and I do not wish to exaggerate our role, but we are respected at the UN.  I served for three years as the Irish representative there.</p></speech>

I will respond to Deputy Eric Byrne's question about how we change foreign policy.  It is a big question.  As I just said, there is the whole-of-government aspect.  There is also the role of this committee.  I am sure the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Minister will listen to what is said here in this review; I hope they will.</p><p>  The Deputy talked about other European nations doing things in Mali and so forth and referred to what I said about the triple lock and how I interpret it.  I am suggesting that we open a debate on all of these issues.  I tentatively put forward the idea about the triple lock.  It is our own decision how we restrict our participation and there might be an argument for making a super majority in the D&aacute;il the deciding factor in certain matters.  It will not happen often.  I believe it is a matter for debate, and that is my best answer to that.</p><p>  The Deputy talked about Irish troops and how they are welcomed.  I believe that is true.</p><p>  The Deputy also referred to migration from eastern Europe and, again, talked about Africa.  He is right that Africa is developing.  It is no longer, perhaps, the poorer continent.  There is much promise there and also a great deal of conflict.</p> <p>The question of fundamentalism across the whole centre of Africa, spreading from the overthrow of Gaddafi, is quite dangerous.  I attended and was involved directly in a conference last year on the changing face of Africa where ambassadors spoke.  I was very impressed by what I heard and I participated in the conference.</p><p> I wish to comment on two final points made by the Deputy and then I will finish.  One point he made was on the UK and the EU.  That is a very serious matter ahead for us.  It would be a really serious issue for us if the UK was to leave as we would have serious choices to make.  Even in the negotiation - the UK wants a renegotiation of aspects of the European Union - the question is how far it would fray the fabric of the Union to get the UK to stay.  These are very serious issues.</p><p> The Deputy talked about who should lead the World Trade Organization.  I will return to the point that I would hate to see contention between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation or any of that and would always emphasise a holistic approach to government.  I do not want to see interdepartmental trade being bounced between Departments or something like that.  I do not know where it would lead and it would depend on a decision by Government at the time, but I would hope that all Departments would co-operate.</p><p> The Deputy spoke about the two state solution in the Middle East which has been a long-term aim.  Many Israelis saw its importance because as population grows, they may have to face a terrible dilemma for them, between the character of Israel and a growing population of Palestinians who would have to live in a repressed state.  It is an issue for Israelis.  The late Ariel Sharon may have seen some of it when he decided to pull out of the Gaza Strip after all of the other things that he was involved in that I shall not go into in detail.  It is getting harder to see the two state solution as the settlements continue, and that is a serious issue.  All I can say is that we hope Secretary of State Kerry will produce something but it is very difficult to be hopeful.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

I also thank the committee staff for their courtesy.</p><p>  I have supplied a written statement and I will not go into it in any detail in the ten minutes allotted to me.  If any member wishes me to respond bilaterally at any stage, I would be more than happy to have any kind of dialogue they like on some of the issues I will raise.</p><p>  I will outline two quick points of context before examining six issues that are worthy of analysis and that the committee will perhaps raise in the context of this contribution to the review.  The first point is the notion of Ireland as a small state.  There is no doubt that we all agree that Ireland is a small state and that its smallness has implications for what we can and cannot do.  The second point of context is the international context within which we are operating that is, oddly enough, very facilitative and positive for states such as Ireland.  Lastly, I will examine some specific issues.</p><p>  In terms of small states like Ireland, let us bear in mind that most states are small in the international system.  As somebody has said, the academy tends to focus on larger states and that does not benefit or lead to an understanding of how international relations work.  There has been a lot of debate on what defines a small country.  My favourite definition of a small state is that the notion of a small country seems to be reserved for large countries with small populations, small countries with large populations, small countries with small populations and, sometimes, small countries that just mind their own business.</p><p>  Smallness is relative because, regardless of its definition, small does not mean insignificant because there are things about small countries that often give them greater power than they possibly even think they have.  In my paper I go into some detail and talk about areas where I think Ireland has additional power.  In the field of international relations we talk about soft power, that is, the power to attract and persuade.  There are areas, as I say in my paper, that I have examined such as the diaspora, Irish culture, Irish history, the power of attraction of our ideas and the values that underpin Irish foreign policy from history.  All those elements cumulatively give us potential and possibility, and we have seen this done successfully in the past.  I will use the clich&eacute; that Ireland can punch above its weight in certain sectors in certain areas at certain times, and there is great potential.</p><p>  The second point of context is the examination of where small states fit in the international arena.  It may seem slightly counter-intuitive and odd to say that the international system has never been better for small states.  We have never had as much potential for small state action in the international system in history as we have today.  International law, multilateral institutions and norms of international behaviour all contribute to the possibility of small states making a significant contribution.</p><p>  Nowadays we also have much less violence internationally than we have ever had before.  A number of serious analyses have been published in the past four or five years that examined the hard numbers.  Even in the post-war environment there is less conflict, violence and war today than there has been since the end of the Second World War but, as Members will be aware, we had a huge spike in the early 1990s.</p><p>  The international system, in a sense, is very positive for and conducive to small states wishing to make a contribution.  That has led to a reappraisal of security or foreign policy for security.  We talk in academic terms about human security, critical security, development and gender.  We talk about things now, in the context of security, that we have never talked about before.  We have concepts like responsibility to protect, which challenges some very old fashioned notions of what state sovereignty is about.</p><p>  There is great potential in the international system and academics talk about international security in a very different manner, but there is a proviso.  It is very easy in a European context to make the argument and talk in that way.  However, if one is in a central African republic, China and many other parts of Asia, security is still very much red in tooth and claw and war still matters.  Many people would argue that, in a European context, we live in a bubble and that the security bubble in Europe is paid for by others.  Many would argue that the United States and the NATO alliance allow us in Europe to talk about security in a new way.  All I am saying is that there is an argument about the matter.  If one accepts the argument that international security has changed, that the world is changing and that small states have greater potential in this world, then Ireland is ideally placed.  There are things about Ireland's foreign policy that place us in pole position to make the kind of contribution to the kind of international system we think is out there.</p><p>  In terms of Irish foreign policy - which I outlined in detail in my paper - we privilege the force of law over the law of force, we are committed to the UN as a central structure and we are comfortable with ideas of shared or pooled sovereignty.  Ireland has had a very difficult history but it has grappled successfully with issues of conflicted identities, peace processes and resolutions that are not finished, and we have experience we can share.  Ireland also has a great record in supporting development in the global south.  It is for all those reasons Ireland is well placed, in principle, as a small state and, in practice, in terms of where we are both in Europe and the world.</p><p>  I would like to put six things on the committee's agenda in terms of its contribution to the White Paper.  That was a Freudian slip and I meant to say the strategic review.</p> <p>The first is about communications and the way diplomacy must communicate in a different way.  Social media is an obvious one.  We see lots of foreign ministers using social media, including Twitter, in an effective way but it requires thought and appreciation and one cannot use Twitter like a fax machine to issue press releases.  People who are good at it are good at it for a reason so one needs a strategy behind it.</p><p> We also need diplomats to communicate more effectively with civil society.  My paper also details the idea of a virtual embassy.  This is not a shop window but something with real functionality for people to get services and consular help through the window of the embassy.  Another option is a consular app on a mobile phone.  If someone is in trouble overseas, one can push a button and be in contact with someone in Dublin or be directed to services in the country the person is in.  We should think more imaginatively about the way in which technology can help us to communicate.</p><p> Another item on the agenda is the use of languages.  We suffer from the benefit and the curse of being native speakers of English.  It can make us lazy in terms of our diplomacy because lots of other people speak English as a second or third language but we lose things if we are speaking to someone's second or third language.  The capacity and the ability of our diplomats to learn languages must be thought about carefully.</p><p> The political and economic reporting from Irish embassies is the added value of Irish diplomacy.  Nothing can replace a good diplomat in post who can give one a feel for the conversation in the country, the arguments in the country and what its policies are.  We need to think about the nature and extent of our diplomatic network.  It is extraordinarily small.  The size of our missions is extraordinarily small and it is not good enough to say that we are under-represented in Asia so we can close a few embassies in Europe and open them in Asia.  As long as there are votes in the European Council of Ministers, we need people in every European capital providing intelligence and information on what is going on and the nuances and sophistication of arguments in those countries.  We need to think about the diplomatic network in a more serious way than we have to date.</p><p> We can be more imaginative about staffing our missions.  We can use secondment and short-term contracts and we can be more imaginative about who we send out to our embassies overseas.  We must address the fundamental question of the ridiculously small size of our diplomatic network.  We can also use the diaspora in more imaginative ways.  One of the examples to which I refer is the attempt to set up a virtual network of foreign policy experts.  I know 30 people working overseas, in the UN, in think tanks and in universities, who would love to be part of a network that can contribute to Irish policy development and foreign policy dissemination.  We could do that simply through an existing social media platform without having conferences or expenses.  We must also think about the European External Action Service.  It has not had a good couple of years and has been slow in development.  When it was being set up, we talked about sharing premises and resources and piggybacking on the European External Action Service.  We should think about that again, despite the weaknesses, difficulties and problems that have been raised frequently.  We must think more imaginatively and invest in the human capital of Irish diplomacy over the bricks and mortar of Irish diplomacy.</p><p> The fifth item I talk about is peacekeeping.  There has been a Green Paper and there will be a White Paper on defence tackling this issue directly.  Peacekeeping has given real muscle to Irish diplomacy.  Credibility comes with commitment and the commitment we have shown through peacekeeping has given Irish diplomacy and Irish foreign policy an international credibility it would not otherwise have.  We must think about it and about its deployment more seriously.  Mr. Noel Dorr talked about the triple lock and I make the point in my paper.  We never talked to one another about our respective contributions.  We need some kind of a fail-safe, not just in the case where there is overwhelming international consensus that the peacekeeping force needs to be there but one permanent member of the Security Council selfishly goes against it and vetoes an operation, which is a real possibility rather than a theoretical one.  What if Irish citizens abroad are in difficulty, there needs to be a military mission to protect them and someone says "No" or the UN is unable to make a decision in that respect?  Are we seriously saying that we would refuse to participate because the Chinese ambassador at the UN Security Council raised a well-manicured hand and vetoed the operation?  We need the fail-safe of a two-thirds D&aacute;il majority or some other mechanism.</p><p> Finally I refer to thematic policy, which has been mentioned over and over again.  We have a real profile in certain areas of foreign policy.  I would not overstate it or over-egg it but we have a profile in development, human rights and, increasingly, gender, politics and disarmament.  We have been strong individually but I am asking about putting it together in some way and providing a theme or a name.  I hesitate to use the word "brand" but we need some identification of what Irish foreign policy is all about.  We need some phrase that encapsulates our approach to the world within which these niche areas can be situated so that they can speak to one another and we can be more constructive and coherent about the way we present these issues to the rest of the world.</p><p> I would like to conclude quickly because I would love a deeper conversation about this.  The presentation does not offer a map for the contribution of the committee to the White Paper.  I am asking the committee members to think more creatively, imaginatively and bravely about how Ireland can contribute to the world.  We can make a contribution.</p></speech>

Mr. Dorr mentioned that most books on international relations are written from the viewpoint of larger states.  I hope the courses in our universities and third level colleges are not framed from that point of view.  I hope there is the independence needed in providing courses and curricula.</p><p>  With regard to the architecture of the United Nations, I do not know what adjustments are made in respect of different committees since its establishment decades ago.  The membership of the UN Security Council has not changed and does not take account of the changed world we have, particularly over the past decade or two.  What importance does the OSCE have and why was there a need to establish it when we had United Nations as the body with constituent members from most sovereign states?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1347" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ben Tonra" time="17:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014011500013#M00400"><p>Mr. Noel Dorr and I and two others edited the first book on Irish foreign policy.  It is used in many Irish universities and we had contributors from universities across the island of Ireland.  Within the university sphere and in my school, the focus on states other than the large states is a clear view of what we do and how we do research.</p><p>  In terms of the UN architecture, we have had a debate about the composition of UN Security Council.  It was a creature of the winning combination at the end of the Second World War.  We have had many debates, panel reports and discussions about amending and extending its membership but one can see no prospect of that occurring.  The attributes of the UN Security Council, as it is, are that it has the kind of credibility and authority that Mr. Dorr was talking about.  However, that credibility and authority ebbs away as we see how unbalanced the UN Security Council is but I see no prospect of the political deal to change that in the short or medium term.</p><p>  The question about the OSCE is very good.  It comes down to the fact that the OSCE is an early warning network.  If people do not hear about it, it is working well.  It is the prevention side of diplomacy for states around a table to raise questions about security, to have diplomatic missions and to have negotiations in a more low-key framework.  The OSCE has a role and it comes out of the Cold War but it has a contemporary role.  We see an enormous amount of activity on the part of the OSCE in central and eastern Europe and elsewhere.  Its value is less well-known than it should be, even though when security gets very difficult we turn off into the United Nations, NATO or the European Union.</p></speech>

We pay lip-service to the diaspora.  The Gathering was one thing but I mentioned my embarrassment at having to rely on the French to go in and do humanitarian work in Africa.</p> <p>I mention my embarrassment as an OSCE short-term oberver - as a citizen and not as a politician - seeing countries which this committee is forever condemning, such as the Ukraine or Albania, being able to facilitate their citizens, through their embassies, in voting in elections.  We pride ourselves on having such a large diaspora but perhaps our embassies would not be capable of handling that.  Perhaps the resources of the embassies would be insufficient to cater for areas in which there is a large concentration of the Irish diaspora.  However, we must make a start.  If we are to change anything about our foreign policy, it must be our attitude to the role and involvement of the Irish diaspora.  </p><p> War was mentioned and I ask Professor Tonra to express his opinion on whether my interpretation of something is correct.  I may be biased, having just returned from Iran, but it seems to me that most of the wars currently being waged are largely in the Islamic world.  The major international conflicts are among those seeking power and influence over a region, be it Iran or Saudi Arabia.  Both countries have conflicting religious bases, namely, Shi'ite Islam in Iran and Sunni Islam in Saudi Arabia, and that is having a ripple effect across the Muslim world.  It has consequences for world peace as well as for Christians in Nigeria, Sudan and other areas where the borders of the Christian and Muslim worlds meet.  If all these areas are in conflict - I mention the slaughter in countries such as Syria - and they centre on the power bases of Saudi Arabia and Iran, does Professor Tonra see a role for Ireland in any of this, given that we are based in the West and are a Christian country?  Is there any way we could evolve our foreign policy to allow us to engage in a progressive and constructive way?</p><p> I will conclude by posing a question similar to the one I posed to Mr. Dorr earlier.  I am fascinated by the Ukraine, a huge country which is enormously important to world peace.  To see it split 50:50 between those who have a western inclination and those who have an eastern inclination is worrying.  Does Professor Tonra think Ireland can play an independent role in the diplomatic field and engage with countries like the Ukraine?  Sometimes the West sees the Ukraine as a highly divided country with something like apartheid.  I am amazed at how wrong the EU's interpretation of the Ukraine is.  How can Ireland, tiny as it is, extend its influence into these strange and wonderful Islamic countries?  Do we have the requisite respect to be able to do that?</p><p> I will conclude by saying that I agree that our diplomatic corps is absolutely first class.  However, the problem is that we have had to close several embassies on economic grounds.  Will we ever have the economic wherewithal to support a further expansion into these new emerging markets all over the world?  Will we be able to expand into China, with its growing middle class, and into Latin America and South America?  How can we invest in the diplomatic corps to achieve the desired outcome?</p></speech>

Professor Tonra emphasised the importance of the diaspora.  The diaspora is very important, given that there are 70 million people of Irish origin worldwide.  How important does he believe the role of the Global Economic Forum is?  As Deputy Byrne asked, are we making best use of our diaspora abroad?  One should look at Israel, a small country similar to Ireland, and the use it makes of its diaspora, in particular in regard to attracting foreign direct investment into its country.  It has a minister for the diaspora.  Could we do more in that area?</p><p>  Professor Tonra spoke about the embassies and the important role they play.  Deputy Byrne referred to the lack of resources and the fact we have had to close some embassies.  Hopefully, we will be able to change that in the near future after this review.  We talk about Ireland being small but so many of our embassy networks abroad are small also.  They are one-man operations with maybe one local staff member.  Is it better to have presence in a country rather than have no presence?  I am thinking of the success of our consulate general's office in Atlanta, which is a one-man operation with one local staff member.  We have three embassies in South America.  Maybe we should have an embassy in Chile and in other countries in South America.  Should we have a more extensive network in these areas also?</p><p>  Professor Tonra mentioned the important role of honorary counsels.  I have travelled a bit and made use of honorary counsels.  For instance, the committee was in Jordan earlier this year where we have an honorary consul, Mr. Ramsey Khoury, who has done tremendous work for Ireland.  It was as if he was Irish given the importance he attaches to his role of honorary consul.  Professor Tonra spoke about giving them extra resources.  Would a way around the resource issue be to give more resources to the honorary consuls to play an important role?  Social media should be used more also.  They are some ideas on how we can use the network abroad.  We are looking at Indonesia, a place where there are tremendous opportunities for Irish companies, but we have no embassy there.  Should we be more focused?  Should we follow trade?  Should we have a more extensive network like Denmark, for example?  It has a huge network of embassies all over the world and it is a small country also.  Obviously, that has a major effect on its industries, in particular the dairy industry.  We have a thriving food industry.  </p><p>  We talk about the Ireland House concept.  We should have one in Japan and in other countries, as we do in New York.  Is this the way we should be going forward, making better use of resources and the non-governmental agencies, and working together to build up that network and to be able to compete with the big countries like Germany and France which have extensive networks?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1353" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Ben Tonra" time="17:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014011500014#N00300"><p>I will start with Deputy Byrne's questions.  I agree there has been a lot of hot air expressed about the diaspora but as a product of two diasporas - my father emigrated in the 1950s and I emigrated in the 1980s and managed to get back - the formal rights, such as allowing them to vote in D&aacute;il or presidential elections, miss the point because very often all one is looking for when one is abroad is a link to have some kind of acknowledgement one is there.  The idea of virtual networks, embassies or the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade promoting those kinds of networks to make those linkages between Irish people in different places and capitals in different countries would be a huge benefit and would cost very little.  I appreciate the logistics of having some kind of a central repository is a lot to ask but much can be done informally using social media and technologies, which were not available to us before.  That can be formalised.  We could have a Minister for the diaspora, as in Israel or in France.  That is a sort of higher level political engagement which is possible but, in practical terms, it is much more difficult to achieve.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne asked about where Ireland can make a contribution and he spoke about the Middle East and the Ukraine.  We have to keep our powder dry.  Small countries need to be focused.  We need to have a very clear idea of the core values and core issues we need to pursue.</p> <p>We cannot do everything and cannot be all things to all men and all women.  We cannot contribute to the resolution of every problem in the world.  However, through our membership of the European Union, we are in a very privileged position.  The recent bilateral agreement between the EU and the Ukraine has brought to the fore the fact that Putin is playing an entirely new geo-strategic game in Europe.  The European Union is very much on the back foot with respect to that.  We have access to levers of power and influence that most other small countries in the world would give their right and left arm to have and we could use that much more effectively and dynamically.  Through the UN, the OSCE and the profiles we can develop in niche areas, we can exert an influence that would not be otherwise possible.  We must stay focused but there are mechanisms through which we can exert influence.</p><p> Regarding the Chairman's question on the global forum, it is very expensive and logistically difficult to run but it is like a brand leader.  It signifies the fact, in a very serious way, that the State is at least interested, if not entirely serious about, engaging with the diaspora.  That must be leveraged in a smart and intelligent way.  It does not mean replicating the model every six months or across different policy sectors.  It shows that the State is interested, is willing to engage with the diaspora and is open to ideas from the diaspora.  Israel is very different.  The State of Israel faces an existential crisis.  If one is Jewish and-or Israeli, that takes pre-eminence in one's mind.  There is nothing comparable with the Irish case in that regard.  However, we can look at how the Israelis, the French and others have engaged with their diasporas and learn lessons from that.</p><p> In terms of the embassies and our diplomatic network-----</p></speech>

We have only consular general offices in Boston, New York, Atlanta, San Francisco and Chicago.  It is quite difficult to cover an area like the US with the small network we have there.  Should we expand and open up more consular general offices in places like Texas, which is the size of France?  We have no presence in Texas.  It is difficult for a consul general to cover that kind of ground.</p></speech>

We have to think smarter.  We can use, for example, honorary consuls and secondments or short-term contracts to increase the size of our missions.  We can use social media and the idea of a virtual embassy to do much more with less.  Expansion does not have to mean building consulates and staffing them with full-time diplomats.  There is a danger here, though, in that we do not want Irish diplomacy to be run by amateurs.  However, as long as we have the network well-constructed, with clear lines of responsibility, we can be more creative and imaginative in terms of how we staff our missions and increase their overall number.  We could use the European External Action Service, EEAS, as a platform on which to build a network overseas.  We could open an office in an EEAS building somewhere in the first instance, and if it takes off, we could open a separate office or embassy.  It is about being smarter, thinking more imaginatively and taking advantage of technology and other opportunities we have not had the time or the chance to develop yet.</p></speech>

I do not know whether we should create a ministerial post.  We could consider an office of an ombudsman for diaspora affairs, linked to the current Ombudsman's office so that we are not creating a new quango.  We could have a small team of people who liaise with our embassies and honorary consuls.  They could do a lot of the travelling that is necessary to engage with the diaspora.  As someone who has worked overseas for many years, I know that just to be asked and acknowledged is enormously important for those who have had to leave their native country.</p></speech>

However, there are logistical difficulties with that, according to the Secretary General of the Department.  On a very basic level, a lot of the buildings would simply be too small.  We would need purpose-built accommodation so the EEAS is a non-runner as I understand it.  I do not want to be negative about this but we must move forward.  I ask Professor Tonra to elaborate on his point about new ways of doing things.</p></speech>

One must approach issues from the other direction and ask what is possible, likely or doable.  One must be more imaginative.  In terms of the use of the embassies, we could have two or three person embassies with one or two other members of staff who are not full-time diplomats but are on secondment for two years from think-tanks, the IFA, Government Departments or other organisations.  We could have the leadership of the formal diplomatic service with other people there to engage, do work and make a contribution to the mission without incurring the long-run costs of pensions, career development and so forth.

Reference was made earlier to British politicians and the media waiting at airports for the first flights of 2014 from Romania.  That was an obscene situation to witness and some of the commentary has been grossly offensive and bordering on racist.  However, it exemplifies the fact that there is an antipathy towards immigration and EU enlargement, also evident in the rise in populist parties in many parts of Europe.  I am a big supporter of enlargement to include Turkey.  We may have missed the window on that because the political dynamic in Turkey is shifting in a fundamental way now.  We may have missed that boat but I would still be very positive and supportive of Turkey joining the EU.  It is important, in the context of Turkey, to recall the basis for the European project.  The European project came from a reconciliation between France and Germany, an historic continental reconciliation which laid the foundations for two generations of peace and security.  If we are talking about resolving the problems in the Middle East or making a contribution to their resolution, having a predominantly Islamic country in the European Union would blow out of the water the entire idea of the EU being part of a crusade, being part of Christendom or being oppositional to the principles of Islam.  To have a large secular Islamic country within the European Union would blow those arguments out of the water and could contribute to a fundamental change in the dynamic of conflicts within the Middle East.</p></speech>

We had an afternoon of near-continuous votes in the Seanad so I missed his presentation.  Since my arrival, the professor has been talking about our embassy network and the number of Irish missions.  Looking at where we have our embassies at present, if Professor Tonra was advising the Government on how to address gaps in our diplomatic network, where would he suggest we look at most urgently?</p></speech>

I also welcome the Minister and his officials and the people in the gallery who have come to observe the proceedings.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Anne Ferris.  I remind members to turn off their mobile phones and not to leave them in silent mode, or else they should place them a good distance from the microphone in order that they do not interfere with the sound system as it is not fair on the officials who listen in, monitor and record what we say.  It is best that members turn off their mobile phones completely.</p><p>  I propose that we sit from 10 a.m. to 1 p.m., take a break and resume at 2.30 p.m. and continue until 6 p.m.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I ask members to make their observations and put their questions through the Chair.  I also ask them to keep their interventions on the amendments and sections as concise, precise and focused as possible.  They should try not to ramble into other areas.  I will be as helpful as I possibly can in reminding them what we are about and to focus on the amendments and sections with which we are dealing.</p><p>  The debate is being resumed on section 10.  Amendments Nos. 36 and 37 are related and will be discussed together.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 37 is pragmatic and has been designed to ensure the authority will not become hamstrung by an inability to ensure there is always a majority of lay members at every meeting.  It provides for a better balance than the original provision which required a lay majority of three at every meeting.</p></speech>

They reflect the standard architecture for other bodies in the legislation that existed when the original Bill was being drafted.  It was never the Government's intention that this would be a body controlled in any shape or form by the Minister of the day.  As members will be aware, there were concerns that such a perception had developed.  The amendments delete references to the authority requiring a variety of what are clearly unnecessary ministerial consents, which gave rise to the wrong perception.</p></speech>

I am, however, opposed to this amendment.  While I am happy to consider any concerns the Deputy may have about aspects of section 15 of the Bill as published, I am still considering this section, along with section 17, in response to concerns that have been expressed by the Law Society.  I will, therefore, revert to the committee on this matter on Report Stage and will be guided by the views of advisory counsel.  It is likely that we will be amending the section on Report Stage.  I am advised by Parliamentary Counsel that the proposed Government amendment No. 45 is an appropriate amendment to the section by way of comprehending the applicable ethics in public office legislation.  I assure Deputy Collins that we will revisit sections 15 and 17.  It is important that information relating to clients has the appropriate privilege extended to it and that matters which should not be disclosed are not disclosed.  However, other issues arise in respect of the section which need to be considered.</p></speech>

This section was included in the initial Bill and it deals with client confidentiality, which is at the core of the relationship between the legal fraternity and the justice system, but it has not yet been dealt with.  It is a cause of concern and, despite the Minister's assurance that it may be addressed on Report Stage, it is frustrating that something that is staring us in the face has not yet been amended two years down the road.  I hope Deputy Niall Collins presses the amendment and I will support him in doing so.</p></speech>

The purpose of Committee Stage is to tease out issues arising in the legislation.  In the framing of amendments, we have had particular regard to submissions received from various groups and organisations.  Technical issues arise in respect of sections 15 and 17 and Parliamentary Counsel required further time to deal with them.  I was anxious that we would progress Committee Stage.  This Bill has been unduly delayed as a consequence of the pressures on the Attorney General's office arising from the legislative programme prescribed by the troika and the need to enact the insolvency legislation.  I would have preferred to have taken Committee Stage on this Bill at least 12 months ago but that did not prove possible.</p><p>  As we go through Committee Stage I will be putting down markers to members on issues we have not yet finalised on a technical level and to which we will be reverting on Report Stage.  This is one such issue.  Certain of the issues have been raised some time ago but the reality was that the necessary technical work could only be undertaken in recent months, not only because the insolvency legislation has been completed but also because of issues arising in regard to the additional rules and regulations that had to be made in respect of the legislation and to fulfil a promise I made at the time of its enactment.  It was an enormous piece of legislation and it was inevitable once it was up and running that certain issues would arise in practice that could create technical difficulties.  As members will be aware, we have moved with great speed to address any issue that arose in the workings of the legislation.  That, of course, has taken up the time of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I am personally frustrated this legislation has not been fully enacted and enforced by now and I empathise with Deputy Mac Lochlainn's frustration.</p> <p>The Deputy knows well from dealing with me that if I say we will come back to an issue and address it, we do so.  The focus is on having legislation completed, with any changes required to ensure we have the best possible legislation and to iron out any glitches or issues that need it.  That is my purpose in saying we will come back to this and to section 17 on Report Stage.</p></speech>

While I understand the technical problems the Minister and the Department have, it is important the issue is addressed.  The Minister said it may be addressed but we should look for a serious commitment from the Minister to deal with the issue.  Despite our political differences on the Legal Services Regulation Bill, we all support the idea of independent regulation and we want improved access and competition.  We all want to make legal costs transparent and we want to deal with the consumer complaints issue.  We do not want ifs, buts or maybes.  The Minister should give a commitment today that the section will be dealt with.</p></speech>

The thrust of the entire section is to prohibit unauthorised disclosure of information but it is important to retain certain instances relating to the commission of indictable offences.  Deputy Niall Collins has raised the issue in good faith to allow us to tease it out and I am sure it was not his intention to delete the entirety of the section.  Section 15(1) states that, save as otherwise provided by law etc., a person shall not make information available.  One of the areas in which information can currently be made available is in cases of money-laundering.  There are strict obligations in respect of money-laundering with regard to informing the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There are strict obligations to allow matters to be investigated.  These are some of the exceptions in circumstances where the privacy of a solicitor's offices may be invaded and an investigation conducted.  There are exceptions to the rule of privilege and they must be taken account of.  I am sure members of the committee agree this is the case.  In the context of reasonable concerns that have been expressed that the manner in which some aspect of the section is framed could give rise to concerns that it goes further than intended, it must be reframed.  This must be done carefully to ensure that where indictable offences are being committed, such as by a member of the legal profession, the matter can be fully and properly investigated.  The sad reality is that we have had indictable offences committed by some members of the legal profession and some have been convicted and imprisoned for committing such offences.  The section is designed and intended to be a protection for clients while ensuring that, where there is serious criminality, it can be properly investigated.  There is an issue of examining the section and the Parliamentary counsel is already doing so.  We were not in a position to have the appropriate amendment circulated in time for these meetings.  We will come back to it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The earliest possible publication of his proposal on Report Stage would be very helpful because it is important.  We must get the balance right.  I hear the Minister's point about money-laundering and trying to strike a balance between privileging confidentiality and obligations under money-laundering to try to root out criminality.  Perhaps we can have the proposal as early as possible because it will be both contentious and sensitive.</p></speech>

The amendment is in the spirit of the earlier amendments tabled by the Minister that try to demonstrate the independence of the authority.

It is accountable specifically to this committee or to any other committee that might replace it.</p></speech>

The body will report to the Oireachtas joint committee, not the Minister in the manner as it was originally framed in the Bill.  I come back to the point that there are all sorts of interesting and exciting motives attached to the way we approached this originally.  The way we approached it was based on the precedent of similar bodies.  The Deputy knows that there was concern that I, or some future Minister with responsibility for justice, might in a fit of insanity want to control the entirety of the legal profession.  This is designed to ensure the message goes out, based on the principles already enunciated and specified in the Bill from day one, that the independence of the legal professions are important.  The body must be independent and must be accountable to somebody.  It cannot be free-floating and not accountable to anyone.  It is accountable to the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality in the context of reporting to it on issues of concern.  The committee can engage with the authority but not in any shape or form to impact on the independence of the legal professions, nor on the important principles prescribed in the Bill, which underwrite the approach to be taken by the regulatory authorities.</p></speech>

Two important issues arise within the amendment, including the three-year strategic plan.  The wording of the objectives, outputs and related strategies of the authority is important.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) includes the &quot;efficient use of the Authority&rsquo;s resources&quot;.  These are key sections within the amendment that, in light of the use of public money and the debate in the past week or so, make them important amendments.  I strongly support amendment No. 46.</p></speech>

It is purely about having the body accountable to the Oireachtas.

In subsection (2), the annual report will now be in such form and include information in respect of such matters as the authority considers appropriate.

The Bill was prepared with extraordinary speed; Deputies will recall that the Government was formed on 9 March 2011 and operated under an agreement entered into by the previous Government with the troika.  The legislation was supposed to be published by the end of September 2011 and when I came to the Department, no work had been done on it of any great significance.  As a result of the complexity and breadth of the issues which arose, it was inevitable that a considerable amount of fine-tuning would be required following a consultative process on the Bill.  In different circumstances it would have been preferable to publish - as I do with the majority of legislation coming from the Department - a draft Bill for public consultation.  The timeframe for meeting the troika's requirements rendered that wish completely impossible.</p><p>  I am anxious to emphasise that it was never intended for this authority to operate in any manner other than independently.  These are important amendments and there should be no perception otherwise.  I know Deputy Niall Collins wanted to make a bit of a splash on the water issue.</p></speech>

At a conference in 2012 he stated it was his intention that professional bodies would continue to set their rules, regulations and practices and codes of conduct for their members.  We considered that section 18 ran counter to his stated intention.  We have framed the amendment in consultation with the Bar Council and the Law Society.</p></speech>

It would not be acceptable for the Minister to be perceived to have control of codes of practice and other such matters.  The separation of powers comes to mind.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties has expressed concern about the matter.  I assume that in the spirit of the amendments the Minister has made to date he will accept there is a need to change this section to reflect clearly that it is the authority, in consultation with the various representative groups of the legal fraternity, that will agree on codes of practice rather than the Minister signing off on them.</p></speech>

The adoption and taking on board of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment would result in the deletion of section 18 as it now stands.  I cannot agree to the deletion of section 18 and its substitution with the proposed amendment, but I am certainly interested in revisiting this provision.  I will return to the section on Report Stage with further enhancements following detailed consideration of it by advisory counsel in the Office of the Attorney General.  The reconfigured text had not been settled to the satisfaction of the Parliamentary Counsel in time for us to deal with the issue when we tabled this group of amendments last July.  It was too late for me to table an amendment to it in the context of where we stood.  Work has been done, but, as previously stated, I will bring forward a specific amendment to the section to remove ministerial consents.  Issues arise in that regard, but there are also other matters that we are considering in regard to codes of practice.</p><p>  In the context of the Deputy&rsquo;s amendment, it is inconceivable that codes of practice issued by an independent regulatory authority would be, in essence, subservient to the professional bodies which it seeks to regulate.  Obviously, there would be consultative engagement that would be important in regard to codes of practice.  Again, that is a matter I intend to revisit.  I am not happy with the manner in which the amendment tabled by the Deputies is framed.  If they are agreeable, I invite them not to press the amendment today but to retable it on Report Stage.  We will bring forward amendments on Report Stage, at which time we can revisit the matter.</p></speech>

Let me put it this way: there are issues about the manner in which the amendment is framed and we want to give careful consideration to the matter.  Careful consideration has been given to looking at this section, but the Parliamentary Counsel is not entirely happy with what has been submitted.  While it is important that there be engagements by the legal services regulatory authority with the professional bodies and others deemed appropriate by it on codes of practice, it is also important that we very carefully ensure there are no unnecessary constraints on the authority.  I merely suggest to the Deputies that the matter be put back and that we will revisit it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

Will the Minister assure us that in advance of Report Stage we will have sight of his amendments in advance of the deadline to submit amendments?  We will have to resubmit the amendment on Report Stage, but if we had advance notice of the Minister&rsquo;s changes &ndash; the previous one and the one under discussion &ndash; it would assist us in our work.  I can only speak for myself.  The Minister is asking me to hold back the amendment for now on the clear understanding that the matter will be addressed at a later stage.  Will he give an assurance that we will receive an advance copy of the amendment before Report Stage so we will not have to go through this rigmarole again?  That is all I ask.</p></speech>

It clearly provides for a consultative process and ultimately facilitates the legal services regulatory authority in prescribing a code of practice deemed appropriate based on the principles of the legislation but some other issues must be considered in the context of the section.  It was always my intention and hope which I articulated to Deputies that the various amendments published last week would be made available to Deputies immediately prior to the Christmas break.  It proved impossible to achieve this because of the technical work being done and pressures on the Attorney General&rsquo;s office.  I appreciate that the timeframe I envisaged in early December for making the amendments available - the amendments we are discussing were tabled in July 2013 &ndash; was not fulfilled.  It is reasonable that amendments are furnished in order to give Deputies adequate time to furnish amendments to amendments if they wish to do so.  All I can say to the Deputies is that I will do my best to ensure an adequate period of time will be available for them to consider Report Stage amendments and facilitate any work that needs to be done on them.</p></speech>

First, in terms of legal services, codes of practice and professionalism, it is appropriate to deal with the Law Society and its administration staff.  I refer to a group of people who are highly skilled in a situation where there is no room for administrative errors.  Does the Minister have a concern about staff of the Law Society being made redundant?  I feel strongly that one needs people with the highest standards working in this area and it is important that we highlight the issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/978" speakername="David Stanton" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014011500006#E01400"><p>The Deputy is stretching things a little, but I will allow it.</p></speech>

Ultimately, the legal service regulatory authority will deal with allegations of misconduct.  As the Deputy will note from the amendments tabled, we are also making extensive provision for consumer complaints to be dealt with in a mediated fashion, without the necessity to invoke the full disciplinary panoply of the legislation in circumstances where there are no allegations of misconduct but what could be described as a consumer complaint.  We are giving thought to and have been engaged in discussions with the Law Society on the position of its staff.  I understand approximately 16 members of staff will be affected by the changes, but I do want to go into all of the issues publicly.  I am genuinely interested in the views of members of the committee on this issue and invite their comments.  It is very important that this body, when established, be seen to operate independently of the legal professions.  The purpose of providing for a legal services regulatory authority is to ensure, among its variety of functions, disciplinary issues and allegations of misconduct made against members of the legal profession will be dealt with by a body not connected directly with the professional bodies which represent either branch of the profession.  It is to be a body that is clearly independent of the branches of the profession and to be perceived to be independent by the public.  The difficulty is that despite much of the good work done by both professional bodies, there is still public doubt about the independence of the process.  I am very conscious that both bodies assert that where there are allegations of misconduct, they investigate them independently and properly.  I know, for example, that the Law Society could point to cases taken by it which resulted in members of the legal profession being struck off.  We are now trying to establish a body about which there can be no perception other than that it will be independent.</p><p>  There are two particular issues relating to staff within the Law Society.  They clearly have substantial expertise in this area-----</p></speech>

The new provisions in regard to the process of appointment of the chief executive of the authority will, if accepted, be similar to those for the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.

This is consistent with the architecture we discussed.  <br />It is only right that the new regulatory authority, as an independent entity, will appoint its own staff and not have its human resources determined or in any way fettered by a Minister.  This further enhances and protects the independence of the body on an ongoing basis, while not compromising on the need to control regulatory costs.  However, I will maintain continued consultation with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform on the HR and other aspects of the establishment of the new authority.<br />I am opposed to amendment No. 65.  As the authority is being established as an independent body, it is not within my remit as a member of the Government to predetermine its decisions on the configuration and recruitment of staff in order to perform its statutory functions effectively.</p> <p>It will be open to the existing staff of the legal professional bodies who possess the relevant skills to apply for positions advertised by the legal services regulatory authority.  Of course it will be open to the existing staff, based on the Bill as it is currently framed, to apply for positions, but I wish to refer to concerns raised in this area.  First, I recognise the substantial expertise within the Law Society among a group of individuals who have been dealing with conveyance in relation to misconduct.  When these matters are ultimately taken over by the legal services regulatory authority, those individuals will cease to have a role.  It has been suggested that they should be transferred from the Law Society to the legal services regulatory authority.  However, provisions are not usually put in place to facilitate the transfer of staff from a private body to a public body.  There are certain legal complications around that issue.  As I said already, it is open to members of the Law Society who are working in these areas to apply to the legal services regulatory authority when it advertises positions.  Quite clearly, such people would have an advantage in the context of the experience and expertise that they have.  From a human perspective, I can appreciate that it would be very helpful to the individuals concerned if they could be recruited to the body without the matter being unduly complicated, not to mention the practical perspective of the body benefiting from their experience.  However, there is an issue surrounding this which I am quite happy to air publicly and which should be publicly aired.  It is not simply an issue of protecting the jobs of 16 individuals.  There is the wider public issue relating to the independence of the regulatory authority.  We have just gone through a range of amendments which seek to ensure that there can be no perception of any ministerial control over the authority.  The purpose of the legislation is to provide for an independent authority which is not merely independent of the Minister of the day but also of the professional bodies.  There are two or three issues at play here.  If arrangements were to be put in place which facilitated this, by some legislative mechanism and with the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, itself an uncertainty, would it create a risk that the public would perceive the body to be less than independent because a proportion of the existing staff of the Law Society have simply been transferred to the authority as opposed to going through a recruitment process open to many individuals who would be independently assessed and interviewed?</p><p> When the legislation was published, had I included a provision in it for the transfer of all of the existing Law Society staff who deal with these issues to the new body, I would have been open to the accusation that it would not be an independent body and that we were just recreating the Law Society's disciplinary process under a different name.  Deputy McGrath would probably have been one of the first out of the hatches in suggesting that.  People certainly did not lose any time in suggesting that because we reflected the structure of other similar bodies in requiring ministerial consents in certain areas, I was deliberately setting out to undermine the independence of those bodies.  I am interested in the views of the Deputies on this.  Would those present be supportive of an arrangement which would facilitate such a staff transfer?  Would they not see it as undermining the independence of the authority?  Would they be supportive of this and would they regard it as being within the objectives of the legislation to allow for such a transfer?  Should members of the staff of the Law Society - I do not like talking about individuals publicly but there is no point in avoiding the complexity of this - not be in the same position as others, whereby if they wish to work for the authority, they apply for the positions available?  I am very interested in the views of Members on this, taking into account the complexities of it as opposed to simply representing a concern, although it is a perfectly legitimate one which has been expressed to me very forcibly and understandably by the Law Society on behalf of its staff.  However, I must ensure I do nothing that undermines the public perception that this is an independent body.  Having said all of that, I am happy to listen to what Deputies have to say on the matter.  This is not something that I can resolve as Minister for Justice and Equality because it also involves the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  Furthermore, there are certain legal complexities around this that I do not want to publicly air that would be relevant to the staff members individually, to the Law Society and to the authority.  There is also the fact that one cannot transfer staff from a private to a public body without all of the staff within the private body wanting to be so transferred.  Whether all of them would wish to be so transferred is a matter for their individual decision.  I am conscious of the fact that there are various issues involved here and am very interested in the views of the Deputies on this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1511" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014011500008#G00200"><p>One of the issues that have been debated here is the public perception that under the current system, the Law Society or the Bar Council, in investigating complaints through their respective structures, are essentially investigating themselves.  However, if one actually examines in an honest way the structures of the Law Society and the Bar Council, one will see that they were very robust and fair.  Indeed, within the Law Society structures, the option exists of going to an independent party if one is not happy with the decision of the society.  However, there was a public perception and the allegation was made many times that the systems amounted to the legal fraternity investigating the legal fraternity, especially if an outcome was reached with which an individual was not happy.</p><p>  In Britain the regulatory authority allows the various law fraternities to continue to investigate cases.  The various fraternities continue to have their own investigative structures which are under the supervision of the authority.  The authority does not carry out investigations directly.  That is the system that operates in Britain.  The Law Society here has accepted that there is a negative public perception and has supported the concept being put forward by the Minister of an independent regulatory authority.  Clearly, there is going to be a change.  The reality is that the staff who are working there at the moment are dealing with very complex matters which require people of substantial expertise.  The staff have many years of experience in dealing with these cases.  There is precedent here in terms of changes and new structures being put in place under which the existing staff who work in the area, as a matter of natural justice, continue on in the new structure.  In that way, the new structure takes all of that expertise and hits the ground running.  It would be very helpful to have a new authority that is clearly independent, that is strengthened in many regards by this legislation and that has a core element of staff who have the expertise and knowledge needed so that the authority starts in the best way possible.  </p><p>  If we allow this legislation to progress as it is, all of the staff to whom we refer will be made redundant.  Then the authority will incur advertising and hiring costs.  There will be a cost - not just to the Law Society, which will be making a substantial contribution to the new regulatory authority anyway, but also to the taxpayer - due to hiring and re-hiring.  I understand the concerns expressed by the Minister and he has invited the Opposition to express its view.  I believe that the transfer of the staff who have worked in this area and have significant expertise would not undermine the independence of the new authority.</p> <p>They would bring that level of expertise over.</p><p> I do not assume we will resolve this today in this committee session, but I ask the Minister to consider our points and engage with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, the Law Society and the other interested parties to see what kind of solution can be found.  We have had representations from the trade unions on this matter.  They have expressed concern that we have a new body that performs the same work that these 16 staff perform.  There is no question mark over the 16 staff and their independence, professionalism and fairness and how they have carried out their work.  I am not aware that they have ever been castigated or found not to have carried out their work with professional and independent diligence.  I appreciate that there was a perception that the legal fraternity was investigating the legal fraternity but there is no question mark over them and no wrongdoing has ever been found.  We would be creating a new independent authority that the Law Society has chosen to support, but we would be punishing the staff and creating all sorts of difficulties.</p><p> A solution is here to be found if everybody approaches it with a will.  The Minister has asked for the view and maybe the comfort of the Opposition's perspective.  I will not attack the Minister.  I have made clear my position that there is a natural justice issue with regard to transferring the staff over and putting in place whatever criteria or protections are needed.  I appreciate that the Minister will not take 16 staff and directly put them into new positions.  He may want to put in place protections.  There is a way of transferring these staff and taking advantage of their expertise while protecting the independence and the perception of the independence of the new authority.  It has happened.  There are precedents.  The Minister may not support this amendment.  It is a very safe amendment.  It just allows the authority to appoint these people; it does not say it will or shall, but merely allows the option.  Would the Minister consider examining this before Report Stage and engaging with the various interested parties to see if there is some solution that can address all of our concerns?</p></speech>

There is no question that these individuals are competent, experienced and professional individuals who, perhaps, are exactly what the new authority will require in terms of their experience.  I accept what the Minister is saying about the need for independence but he has alluded to it by referring to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin and discussions with this committee and himself regarding an exception being made on this occasion.</p><p>  Taking on board his point about the requirement for independence and the perception of independence and the prerequisite of experience, I imagine any individual applying for a role in the new regulatory authority will go through some form of Public Appointments Service-type interview process and the skills and experience gained while working for the Law Society are going to be of great benefit to those applicants.  That does not necessarily give any comfort to those 16 individuals.  This should be teased out with further discussions, particularly with the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  In any normal scenario when we are considering the establishment of a new authority and bringing in competent individuals I would assume these individuals are the type we seek.  I understand the Minister's predicament but further discussions are required.  I am in favour of a reasonable approach regarding the future employment of these individuals.</p></speech>

He thinks some of us will be running onto the plinth denouncing him over this amendment.  We all had representations from the Law Society and Mandate trade union.  It is their democratic right to lobby us as Members of the Oireachtas to protect their jobs and their terms and conditions, and good luck to them.  I stand up for them today and make no apologies for it.  It is very important that the Minister does not get carried away with the independence issue.  I have heard it from my colleagues here.  There will be standards and procedures when one applies for these positions, but these experienced staff have great skills that might not necessarily be out there in the broader society among other people applying for the positions.  They are a highly skilled group of people and should be transferred to the authority.</p><p>  In case the Minister is still feeling ethical and is really worried about undermining the independence of the authority, I offer the example of my previous job as a primary school teacher.  Many teachers become inspectors in the Department of Education and Science and they go around assessing primary and secondary school teachers.  Some even go on to become members of the Teaching Council.  There are examples of this.  It is time for the Minister to get real.  This is about administrative staff who are highly skilled people, and I strongly support the transfer of these 16 positions to the authority.  These people should be given the option to fill the positions and not be made redundant.  The Minister does not have to worry.  I will not be pirouetting around the plinth in the next couple of days on this issue.</p></speech>

We cannot deal with it simply on the basis that we must make a particular decision because representations have been made.  We must make a decision in the public interest while also being conscious of the position of these individuals.  I certainly recognise they are people with expertise who would be of value to the body when established.  I do not know personally whether all 20 individuals who make up the 16 full-time equivalent positions would wish to be employed by the body.  I am sure it is information which is readily ascertainable.  We have been engaged in discussions with the Law Society and received its submissions on the issue.</p><p>  The amendment tabled by Deputy Mac Lochlainn, which has been a useful focal point for discussing the issue, would not achieve his objective.  His objective is that individuals be transferred to the body.  His amendment states the Minister may permit the authority to appoint members of the Law Society's and the Bar Council's administrative staff with the requisite qualifications and whose positions would be displaced with the commencement of the authority.  At present nothing prevents the authority recruiting or employing a member of the Law Society who does this work.  I will come back to where I started on this; this would facilitate or ensure no barrier existed to an individual working in the Law Society in this area at present applying for a job and there would be no barrier to him or her being given the job, based on what the Deputy proposes, but what the Deputy proposes does not achieve what he is speaking about, which is providing for positions for all 20 individuals, if we assume all 20 would like them, within the body.  It merely states there would be no barrier to them being recruited but does not provide for their recruitment.  It does not achieve this objective.</p><p>  This is an issue of complexity because from a human position we would all like to see individuals who do their job carefully retain their employment.  There are complexities in this, which is we still have public service constraints in the context of new bodies coming into being.  We are trying to reduce the number of bodies we have.  It has been necessary to create a new body here.  One means of staffing is through transfers from other parts of the public service where there are individuals with the relevant expertise who can be so transferred, and this keeps down expenditure which is important.  Quite clearly this body will have to recruit some individuals of experience and expertise, and we do not have within the public service individuals who have worked in this particular area to any significant degree.  This is an important issue. </p><p>  I thank Deputies for allowing me to be able to go back to the Government and state there is support across all sides represented in the House for what is being proposed in this context.  I am afraid it does not necessarily mean I will get sanction for it, but I will enter into further discussions with the Law Society on it.  There are issues of importance to the individuals concerned to which Deputies have not adverted.  These include issues relating to pensions.  I do not have the detail of the pension positions with regard to their current employment, but quite clearly if they are party to private pension schemes these could not be continued when in the public service.  This is an issue of complexity.</p><p>  There are also issues with regard to redundancy legislation, in the context of what is being proposed.  With regard to individuals employed at present by the Law Society, it is not like the takeover of a private company by another company.  They could not be compelled to work for the legal services regulatory authority if they did not wish to do so.  In circumstances in which their employment was terminated they would have certain redundancy entitlements.  There is much complexity in this and it is not as simple, even if it were feasible in principle, as the Minister, Deputy Howlin, simply making a decision and it being effected, because it brings into play pension issues, redundancy legislation and the rights of each of the individuals concerned.</p><p>  This has been a very helpful discussion in our continuing to see how we address the issue and I genuinely thank members for the discussion and for what they stated.  I know I seem to do this with some regularity, but I invite Deputy Mac Lochlainn not to press his amendment because it would not achieve the objective he set out to achieve.  It has achieved the objective of facilitating an important discussion on the issue.  I will report back to the House on Report Stage.  I cannot make a commitment that the legal services regulatory authority will take all of the individuals if they all wish to be taken.  The commitment I can make is that I will further engage with the Law Society and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the issues and on some of the complex matters we have not discussed which I mentioned.</p></speech>

There is no doubt about the independence of the new body because when it is finalised the legislation will enshrine it clearly in the public eye. The Minister knows better than most the issues the staff in the new authority will deal with are complex matters and will require people of considerable expertise from the get go.  A request, yet to be acceded to, is that on the day the new regulatory authority commences it will take all cases, ongoing and new, so there would be a fresh start and not two parallel processes running simultaneously.  I share the hope we will have a fresh start with a new regulatory authority with all cases coming under its umbrella.</p><p>  The concern, to which the Minister alluded, is there would be a temptation to transfer civil servants to the new authority, but with all due respect it would be very difficult to find the range of staff required.  It may solve a numbers exercise in the overall public service and it may be tempting for the Minister, Deputy Howlin, to do so, but it would not be a good outcome for the public in terms of resolving matters.  We want this regulatory authority to be a fresh start and to win the hearts and minds of the public from the get go.  We want it to have capacity and capability.  The Minister knows the staff already working in the field would make a huge contribution to making this happen, rather than transferring people for a numbers exercise from other Departments.</p><p>  I appreciate the Minister's commitment.  I accept the amendment I tabled is not world class and does not achieve what I want, but I wanted to have a discussion on this matter today.  Another amendment was ruled out of order-----</p></speech>

It was quite clear from an early stage that the Law Society had a concern about its staff.  By the time it had expressed support for the new independent system which was being put in place to deal with disciplinary matters, it would have raised the issue well before the trade union dealt with or raised it.  I will not get into trade union negotiations on this matter.  There are technical legal issues that remain of concern and there are certain practical matters that will need to be addressed with the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin's Department.  Frankly, there is not an issue that would require engagement with the Mandate trade union.  There is an issue that does require each individual being clear on what he or she would like to do if it proves possible that we can develop this.  I want to keep on emphasising this because I do not want to be accused of misleading anyone in using the phrase &quot;if it proves possible&quot;.  There are difficulties in this area and I do not want to suggest they are ones that would be made by my ministerial colleague.  I do not know to what extent issues relating to pensions and redundancy rights and legislation have been factored in to the considerations.  That is something we will discuss directly with the Law Society.  If the Bar Council has a similar issue, we will discuss it with it.<br />On the issue raised by Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac<b></b>Lochlainn, this is about trying to provide for a new start and ensure there will be no perception on the public's part that when allegations of misconduct are made, they will be investigated by anything other than an independent body.  In an ideal world a seamless transition whereby outstanding issues would be taken over by this body has a lot to commend it.  That is a matter to which consideration is being given, but there are very substantial legal issues to which careful consideration has to be given.  One could not have a situation where a serious allegation was made against a member of the legal profession whose alleged conduct had detrimentally impacted on a member or members of the public, where that matter was in the course of being addressed within the current structure and legislation was enacted that would ultimately have an effect whereby the current structure would be instantly dismantled and there was a legal barrier to the matter being progressed under the new structure.  I will not go into the technical legal issues, but I do think there is a difficultly with the transitional proposal that has been made to me being implemented in the context of the legal and constitutional rights of individuals who are in the course of having an issue, for example, adjudicated upon under the existing structure.  These are issues on which we are going to have to be very careful in dealing with and matters at which we are looking further very carefully in order that there will not be unintended consequences contrary to the public interest in our seeking to provide for that type of transitional measure.</p></speech>

Will it be possible for the Minister to make available to us the amendments before Report Stage?  Obviously, I will withdraw my amendment, but I ask for good faith and obviously reserve the right to table a stronger amendment on Report Stage.  I hope I will receive something from the Minister on this and other matters before Report Stage that will assist me in this process.  This is not typical legislation on which one can table amendments and work away.  The topic is heavy and we could do with advance notice of amendments because it would help us in drafting amendments before Report Stage.  I do not have a full Department at my disposal.</p></speech>

On a personal level, I do not see why the chief executive of this body, if he or she has some critical opinion to express about the merits of some Government policy, should not be free to express it.  It does not make a heap of sense and, in the context of reasserting the independence of the body, I cannot see a merit in necessarily retaining the section.  Given that it was a last minute amendment and that there is a procedure I normally go through in advising colleagues of amendments I am accepting, I ask both Deputies to hold this amendment for Report Stage.  On a personal level, I think it is an appropriate amendment to make, but I would like to do it in a manner where I would inform colleagues intending to travel this route.  The technical answer is that the Attorney General would like a little more time to consider it, I suspect, but I do not see the purpose of this provision in the Bill at this stage.  I think it replicates provisions put in place where State bodies are reporting to Ministers, as opposed to State bodies that are clearly independent of Ministers.</p></speech>

Obviously I read from the wrong subsection.  It is an important matter and I appreciate the Minister's response.  Section 23(2) reads:<blockquote><br />In giving evidence to the Committee under this section, the chief executive shall not question or express an opinion on the merits of any policy of the Government or a Minister of the Government or on the merits of the objectives of such a policy.</blockquote>Section 24(2) reads, &quot;In giving evidence to the Committee the chief executive shall not question...&quot;.  That deals with the same point.  Obviously, when a Secretary General of a Department appears before a committee, he or she will not question Government policy.  However, this section undermines the independence of the authority.  It is an important amendment and I appreciate that the Minister acknowledges this.  Is he saying he will support such an amendment on Report Stage?</p></speech>

Section 29(4) reads: &quot;As soon as practicable after receiving a report under this section, the Minister shall cause a copy of the report to be laid before each House of the Oireachtas&quot;.  Section 29(5) reads: &quot;Following compliance with <i>subsection (4)</i>, the Authority shall arrange for the publication of the report in such form and manner as it considers appropriate and for it to be sent to the Law Society,...&quot;.  This, therefore, is not about the Minister interfering in anything.  What the section is doing is ensuring important information which may impact on public policies is made available.  Effectively, it provides for an annual report on the admission policies of legal professions to be prepared by the authority and submitted to the Minister who has no role in interfering with the report.  The Minister's only role is to, in a formal way, place it before both Houses.  It is the mechanism for placing a report before both Houses to enable Members of the D&aacute;il and the Seanad to access it.  I cannot agree, therefore, to the deletion of the section as proposed.  <br />It is important in the regulation of legal services in the State that the authority know exactly the numbers of solicitors and barristers admitted to practice each year.  It is also important for it to assess the demand for the services of practising barristers and solicitors and the need to ensure an adequate standard of education for persons admitted to practice and to ensure the numbers of persons admitted to practise as solicitors and barristers in that year are consistent with the public interest in ensuring the availability of such services at a reasonable cost.  It is reasonable that a report of this nature be furnished to the Minister.  I see no reason it should not be furnished and it is reasonable that it be placed before both Houses in order that all Members, not just members of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, can access it.  I do not see anything offensive in the section.  It is a practical provision which will ensure certain information is collated annually and made available such that the Minister who is ultimately responsible for legislation relating to the legal profession may, at some stage, in the future wish to amend the legislation - my successor may wish to amend it or if I am around long enough, I may want to do so - if some provisions are not working.  The section is purely to ensure important information is made available to the Minister and Members of the Oireachtas.  Frankly, I do not see a problem with it.</p></speech>

Section 29(1) provides that the authority shall prepare and submit to the Minister a report.  The way to deal with our concerns would to be to delete the words "to the Minister" and substitute "directly to the Houses of the Oireachtas".  There must be no perception that the authority is under the control or within the remit of the Minister.  Previous amendments sought to ensure this.  Again, it would remove any perception that the authority was not independent.</p> <p>I accept that the deletion of the section would not be desirable, but a change to include the relevant committee or the Houses of the Oireachtas is the objective.</p></speech>

The new Part, entitled &quot;HOLDING OF CLIENTS&rsquo; MONEYS BY LEGAL PRACTITIONERS&quot;, would therefore contain only one section.  That section, section 33, provides that only solicitor legal practitioners may hold the moneys of clients.  This obviously reflects and does not alter the current situation whereby solicitors, and not barristers, may hold clients' funds.  It is important to note that the Part is linked to Part 7, which will also fall to be considered on Committee Stage and which will provide for public consultation on whether the restrictions on barristers holding the moneys of clients should be retained, and whether the restriction on a barrister receiving instructions in a contentious matter, as defined by the Bill, directly from a person who is not a solicitor should be retained.<br />The new Part 3, with its sole section, has been designed to facilitate amending legislation if it is decided through the future consultation process that barristers ought to be permitted to hold clients' moneys and to deal directly with clients on a broader range of matters than they are currently allowed to.  The deletion of Part 3 as it stands in the published Bill is a reflection of the policy decision that the Law Society will retain its regulatory remit with regard to the oversight of solicitors' accounts as they pertain to the solicitors' compensation fund.  The basis of the decision was my belief that the society is best placed to incentivise compliance by solicitors because it is the solicitors' profession itself which is liable for claims on the fund.<br />Before an annually renewable practice certificate can be issued to a solicitor, the solicitor in question must have paid an annual contribution to the compensation fund, currently set at around &euro;760 per solicitor per annum.  I am told that the net assets of the solicitors' compensation fund were valued at approximately &euro;18 million in 2013.  Approximately 400 accounts inspections were carried out by the Law Society last year, providing an important protection against acts of fraud and dishonesty by solicitors in the handling of clients' moneys.  The fund has been relied upon in a number of high-profile cases in recent times.  Since 2008, the fund has paid out nearly &euro;20 million in claims.  However, I wish to make it clear that disciplinary procedures in relation to acts of fraud and dishonesty, or the misappropriation of funds, will be conducted under the new and independent professional conduct regime established in the Bill.  The provisions which I propose to be deleted are ones that mirror certain provisions already found in the Solicitors Acts 1954 to 2013.  They should remain untouched in the Solicitors Acts in respect of the Law Society.  Under Part 4 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994, the society is responsible for the protection of clients, which includes an obligation on the society to maintain and administer the solicitors' compensation fund.  Where it is proved to the satisfaction of the Law Society that any client of a solicitor has sustained loss in direct consequence of fraud or dishonesty on the part of that solicitor, or his or her clerk or servant, then, subject to the relevant provisions, the society is required to make a grant to that client out of the fund.  So the position will remain.<br />It is not desirable in any circumstances that the State should assume responsibility or potential future liability for a breach of financial regulations by practising solicitors.  This would involve the State's assuming a very substantial burden that would, in the process, lessen the very serious incentive for compliance that currently exists.  Under the compensation fund structures provided for under the Solicitors' Acts, and to be maintained under the Bill, the Law Society is able to respond immediately to serious financial complaints and has the right to carry out investigations without notification where justified by the circumstances.  The Law Society is, under the Criminal Justice (Money Laundering and Terrorist Financing) Act 2010, required to investigate compliance with anti-laundering regulations.  As I have said, any matters of professional conduct or discipline that may arise from cases of fraud or dishonesty by solicitors will be dealt with independently by the authority or the legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal, as the case may be.<br />Opposition amendments Nos. 77 to 82, inclusive, tabled by Deputies Mac Lochlainn and Collins to sections 33 and 34, seek to restrict the application of Part 3 to solicitors only, presumably because the Deputies have been persuaded by the arguments of the Bar Council that barristers should in no circumstances be permitted to hold the moneys of clients.  As I have already stated in regard to amendment No. 76, I intend to continue with the restriction on barristers holding clients' funds, at least until the outcome of the relevant consultation process in which the new legal services regulatory authority is to engage is known.  Therefore, I propose instead to delete sections 33 and 34 and insert the revised section 33 that I have tabled.</p></speech>

This is an area of understandable concern for the Law Society.  It has made a detailed submission to the Minister and the committee members on this.  It is a reasonable point they make.  The Minister has stated that the State and the taxpayer would not want to take on the financial burden of compensating clients for the dishonesty of all, if, as has occurred, it materialised where there is a requirement for a compensation fund.  What is happening here is the legal fraternity have, through a levy, put together and insured a fund that would protect the small number of clients who have been victims of corrupt behaviour.  That is a good development and we need that to continue.</p><p>  The issue that the Law Society raises is that the society needs to have teeth.  There is a compensation fund which is backed up by insurers but the insurers need to see that the Law Society can move quickly and enforce the disciplinary issues that arise.  Also, sometimes one may have to seek a High Court injunction or try to freeze money, try to have control, in other words, one has set up a compensation fund, one has levied solicitors, one has an insurance interest in that and to keep that at an affordable level for solicitors, one needs to be able to demonstrate clearly that one has the enforcement capacity.</p><p>  In fairness, from my reading of the Law Society's submission in this regard, the society is not arguing that it retains full enforcement.  They are arguing for some type of a co-operation with the new regulatory authority.  I am sure the Minister can appreciate the dilemma here is that it has fragmented what is being proposed.  On the one hand, the financial fiscal responsibility for the dishonesty of some individual solicitors still rests with the Law Society but the society does not have any role in the enforcement and, indeed, what is being outlined is quite a cumbersome process.</p><p>  I reserve the right to bring forward amendments on Report Stage but I ask the Minister to engage with the Law Society - I am not sure whether this applies to the Bar Council also - to address the concerns.  The concerns they raised are legitimate.  It is in the public interest that a compensation fund be retained and it is also in the public interest that the independent regulatory authority co-operates and oversees the process.  I hope some halfway house can be found to address the understandable concerns that have been outlined to us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1620" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014011500014#N00300"><p>Let us deal with a number of issues first.  This Bill, as the Deputies will recall, made provision, as was necessary and appropriate in the public interest, that the Law Society would continue to administer the compensation fund.  The legislation in place in that regard was largely unaffected.  The Bill envisaged that the financial inspectorate, currently attached to the Law Society that conducts the type of inspections that I detailed earlier, would transfer to the legal services regulatory authority as well as the function of investigating allegations of misconduct.  There was a substantial case made that the compensation fund and the inspectorate should not be separated in the sense that the inspectorate has substantial experience in inspecting the accounts of solicitors, that as solicitors fund the compensation fund and, annually, the amount they have to pay into it may be determined by the liquidity of that fund, it creates a pressure on the Law Society.  I am not suggesting it would not otherwise do the job but the council of the Law Society must be concerned about the position of its members to ensure that the inspectorate fully fulfils its functions.  It was argued that the inspectorate should remain with the Law Society and we gave further consideration to legal issues in that context.  I had a concern that, in fact, if the inspectorate came within the legal services regulatory authority, it could create a situation whereby, even when the inspectorate performed to the Nth degree and engaged in its job with absolute professionalism, any time there was a loss of moneys by a client because the solicitor had defrauded him or her, there would be an incentive on the part of somebody within the legal profession to recommend to his or her client that he or she now sue the State and as well as looking for compensation from the compensation fund, the State could become a mark.  It was important that did not happen.</p><p>  The amendments we have tabled today are designed to enable the Law Society, as, indeed, the society sought, to retain the inspectorate.  I made that decision, not because I was lobbied on the issue but because, on reflection with regard to the legal difficulties that could arise in the context of the inspectorate being part of a State body, I considered it was advisable that the Law Society retain that function, that where there are allegations of fraud the inspectorate be asked to investigate accounts and that the Law Society continues to perform the important function it performs, which is, to do spot-check audits on a specific number of solicitors' firms on an annualised basis in circumstances where there are no allegations of fraud or misconduct but to ensure that the appropriate accounting rules are being complied with, client accounts and office accounts are being appropriately maintained, clients' moneys are not being improperly used, and there is not, in so far as it can be ever policed, a repetition of the type of instances that we have seen which have resulted in prosecutions being successfully taken against some solicitors.</p><p>  As a consequence of the changes, the Law Society will retain the inspectorate.  I expect that such function will be fully fulfilled by the Law Society in accordance with its statutory obligations and that the inspectorate will do its work in a manner that is appropriate to protect in the public interest clients of the legal profession, to ensure that solicitors' accounts regulations are fully complied with and to ensure that compensation is not unnecessarily having to be paid because the inspectorate functions in a negligent manner - I am not suggesting that the inspectorate is doing so.  I do not want to be misinterpreted.  I am merely saying I could see there is a synergy between the Law Society maintaining the compensation fund and retaining the inspectorate function but that is where it stops.</p><p>  What is interesting now, in the context of some of the material that has been made available to me, is what I would describe as "mission creep".  We are going from a position where there is a good case for the inspectorate being retained to special pleading that some of the disciplinary functions should now be retained also by the Law Society, and I fundamentally disagree with that.  I want to be clear on that.  Under this legislation, we will have in the public interest an independent disciplinary and regulatory regime.</p> <p>That effectively means that where there is misconduct alleged or discovered with regard to the manner in which a member of the legal profession, be he or she a solicitor or a barrister, conducts him or herself, this misconduct issue will be addressed through the appropriate structures of the legal services regulatory authority.  To come back to Deputy Mac Lochlainn's case, there is no public perception of any description that the body dealing with this is anything other than independent.</p><p> The case that has been made pertains to what happens if something comes to the notice of the Law Society's inspectorate that requires immediate intervention, that is, that requires an emergency court case, for example, to freeze a solicitor's accounts, in some shape or form.  As I understand it, what would happen now is that the information that comes to the Law Society would result in an application being made to the courts, presumably, except in highly exceptional circumstances, on foot of an affidavit that is sworn detailing the circumstances as to why a court order should be made.  Where one has an independent regulatory regime or structure under the new legal services regulatory authority, with statutory provisions that the Law Society retains the inspectorate function, there is absolutely no reason a mechanism could not be in place that ensures that where there is a need for an emergency court application to be made, it is made by the legal services regulatory authority on foot of information the Law Society furnishes.  That does not mean it is furnished and it then takes people weeks to deliberate on what has been furnished where there is an emergency.  The same judgments can be made as are currently made and it ensures that the disciplinary function and the regulatory function are separated from the inspectorate function.</p><p> If, in the context of that issue, any further amendments are required to be made to the Bill on Report Stage, they can be made.  There is no particular reason there could not be, for example, a memorandum of understanding put in place between the legal services regulatory authority and the Law Society with regard to ensuring the speed with which these matters are addressed.  Consequently, there are various ways of dealing with this.  I very much welcomed the support the Law Society has given for having an independent disciplinary structure dealing with allegations of misconduct.  It would not be appropriate to have some issues of this nature now retained by the Law Society and then other pieces of it being dealt with by the legal services regulatory authority.  It is not beyond human initiative to ensure that these matters can be dealt with seamlessly and efficiently by absolute co-operation, where it is necessary, between the inspectorate that identifies something about which to be concerned communicating this immediately, followed by an immediate response and appropriate, if need be, court application made.</p><p> I appreciate that what the Deputy has raised is on foot of submissions he has received on this issue.  It is an issue that has only arisen because of the changes that are being made to the legislation.  I of course am open to ensuring that anything additional that needs to be inserted in the Bill as it passes through both Houses is inserted, to ensure that such matters can be dealt with seamlessly and in a manner that is in the public interest.  However, I do not wish to create now a separate piece of regulatory or disciplinary process that is similarly retained by the Law Society, not for any reason other than there should be a readily identifiable and simple structure.  The inspectorate undertakes a particular function, the regulatory authority undertakes the other functions and I consider this to be entirely workable.</p></speech>

The Minister intends to engage with the Law Society on the issue of staffing and when he does so, I ask him also to consider this issue with its representatives.  I hear his fundamental objections to the suggestion that the Law Society will continue to have the powers of discipline and enforcement.  However, from reading the Law Society's presentation, over which I am glancing again, and from the Minister's comments, there may be some way of addressing the core issue, which is that the insurers can be assured that this fund is protected.  As for the concerns about duplication or that bureaucracy might slow down a swift response to a crisis that would have an impact on the fund, it would be helpful were a way to be found to demonstrate clearly to the insurers that this will be a highly fluid, fast-moving and co-operative process.  Obviously, there are no amendments pertaining to this debate but I ask the Minister to deal with this matter when he meets the Law Society.  From reading its presentation, this is a genuine concern.  The fund is in the public interest and everyone wants to protect it and to make sure it works effectively.  Consequently, I believe there is room for manoeuvre and negotiation to make this stronger and better.</p></speech>

I have absolutely no difficulty and already have communicated to the Law Society that we are quite happy to engage with it on this and a number of issues from the public interest perspective.  It of course is in the public interest that nothing be done to undermine a capacity for a swift response, should something untoward be identified that requires a swift response to protect the public, to protect a client or clients of the legal profession and of course, to ensure that moneys are not misappropriated.  I am very happy that we would work through that.  It is an issue that arises out of the changes we are now implementing and I have no doubt that should there be need for further amendments to the Bill in this context, members will come to them on Report Stage.</p></speech>

In those circumstances, if one has direct access to members of the Bar for contentious matters, it means one will not be filtering one's legal problems through solicitors.  That is a matter of interesting discussion.  I do not wish to prejudge the consultative process that will take place in which the legal services regulatory authority will engage and the report it will publish.  I acknowledge that in the legal profession, that is a matter of some controversy.  The legal profession in Ireland exists as it does because we inherited the historical developments of the legal profession in Britain from the 17th to the 19th centuries and it has remained unchanged since then.  The legal profession, as practised in other jurisdictions, including some common law jurisdictions, is structured differently from the manner in which it is structured in this country.  This issue only will arise should, as a result of the consultative process and when a report is published, it then be considered by the Government and should the Government make further changes for further reform.  Consequently, it is premature at the moment to deal with this issue.  I have no doubt that like many other reforms that are under discussion when it comes to both professions, they are a matter of difficulty and controversy and people have concerns about change.  I think it is an issue to be addressed substantially by looking at what is in the public interest, what gives people access to appropriate legal assistance when they require it in a manner that does not generate unnecessarily excessive legal costs.  They are highly important principles as to what gives access to lawyers with the necessary expertise to address particular issues.  There are areas of highly complex law in which I have no doubt but that in certain circumstances in which people find themselves in litigation, they need the assistance of more than one lawyer, be they solicitors, barristers or both.  There are other circumstances in which people have legal problems of a relatively straightforward nature where, if a lawyer has particular expertise, one does not necessarily need more than one lawyer.</p> <p>These are all interesting issues to be teased out in the public interest and I will not prejudge them.</p><p> The issue of whether barristers should hold funds is directly related to direct access for members of the public to barristers for contentious matters, without barristers being instructed through solicitors.  Normally, it is the solicitor who holds funds, which is the reason there are detailed and substantial rules, regulations and provisions in place concerning what are known as client and office accounts in the context of funds received by solicitors and the holding of moneys on deposit by solicitors.  Currently, moneys that barristers receive are substantially paid by them through solicitors as opposed to directly, except in some very narrow circumstances.  This may be an issue for another day, long after the legislation has been enacted and many of the reforms prescribed by it have been brought into operation.</p></speech>

The Government amendments Nos. 86 and 87 are minor amendments to remove ministerial consent for the making of regulations by the authority.  I have made clear that I wish to remove as many references to &quot;the Minister&quot; as possible to ensure the new bodies created by the Bill are as independent as possible from government interference or any perception of such interference.   <br />As regards Deputy Collins' amendment No. 88, I am grateful to him for tabling it as it was always my intention and the intention of my officials to substitute the reference to &quot;Minister&quot; in this subsection with a reference to the &quot;Authority&quot;, as can clearly be seen with my deletion of the many other references to the &quot;Minister&quot; in the Bill thus far, including in today's amendment No. 87 to the same section.  The reference here appears to have slipped through the net and for this reason, I am pleased to support the Deputy's amendment.  It is my intention that the authority will continue to set the minimum levels of insurance required by legal practitioners so as to ensure that any liability incurred is fully covered in the public interest, while the Law Society will continue to administer the relevant insurance schemes.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 91 creates a new Part 5 to deal with the informal resolution of complaints relating to inadequate legal services and charging of excessive fees, but not grossly excessive ones.  The Law Society, the lay members of the complaints committee of the Law Society and other commentators have pointed out the need to provide a framework for dealing with this type of complaint, which in essence would not amount to misconduct.  The published Bill was silent on how the authority would deal with the substantial number of complaints which tend not to amount to misconduct.  The amended Bill will provide a detailed and formal resolution process for complaints relating to inadequate legal services and the charging of excessive fees.  The charging of grossly excessive fees will now come within the definition of misconduct under a separate provision.<br />Under this Part, section 47, a client of a legal practitioner may make a complaint where the client considers that (a) the legal services provided to him or her are or were of inadequate standard; or (b) the bill of costs issued by the legal practitioner was excessive.  The new section 45 will provide that a legal practitioner will be considered to have provided inadequate legal services where, by act or omission, the legal services provided were not of a standard that is reasonable to expect from a legal practitioner as a solicitor or a barrister.<br />Government amendment No. 92, which introduces new section 46, deals with admissibility of complaints and mirrors provisions which were previously contained in the Bill as published.  A complaint under this Part would not be considered by the authority if in the opinion of the authority it is deemed to be (a) frivolous or vexatious; or (b) is without substance or foundation, or does not satisfy the other criteria set out in the section.  Where the authority determines that it will not consider a complaint, the authority, where appropriate, will have to notify the complainant in writing to set out the reasons.  It will also have to notify the legal practitioner, if appropriate.<br />Amendment No. 93, new section 47, provides that a client of a legal practitioner may now make a complaint where the client considers that (a) the legal services provided to him or her are or were of inadequate standard; or (b) the bill of costs issued by the legal practitioner is excessive.<br />Amendment No. 94, new section 48, provides that the authority will carry out a preliminary review with regard to a complaint of inadequate legal services or excessive fees.  The preliminary review allows the authority to determine whether the complaint should be dealt with under these structures for less serious complaints or should be dealt with under the formal misconduct provisions.  In making that assessment, the authority shall have regard to the extent that the standard of the legal services provided to the client fell short of the standard reasonably expected from a legal practitioner in the provision of those services.  Section 48(2) provides that where having completed the preliminary review process, the authority considers the complaints to be admissible and appropriate, it will notify the legal practitioner concerned to set out the alleged complaint and request him or her to respond within the time period specified in the notification.  Section 48(3) provides that the authority, following receipt of the reply, may admit the complaint and enter into further consideration of the complaint under this part; determine that the complaint is unfounded; or request further information regarding the matter of the complaint.  If the authority, having concluded the preliminary review and having considered any further response it has received, is of the opinion that the complaint, if it were substantiated, could constitute misconduct, it is open to it to decide the complaint should be dealt with under the more formal misconduct provisions and it will so inform the complainant.  That is under section 48(4).<br />Under amendment No. 95, the authority can facilitate the resolution of complaints relating to inadequate services in new section 49.  If the authority is of the opinion that the complaint is capable of resolution, it may invite the client and the legal practitioner concerned to make efforts to resolve it.  Under section 49(2), the authority may itself facilitate the resolution of the matters which are the subject of the complaint in an informal manner by (a) offering its assistance to resolve the matter; or (b) by identifying other persons to the legal practitioner and the client who are willing to assist in resolving the matter.  This facilitation of resolution may include the referral of the dispute to mediation or another appropriate form of legal resolution.  Having allowed the client and the legal practitioner a reasonable period of time to resolve the matter, if the authority considers that an agreement or resolution between the parties is unlikely it may give notice in writing to the client and legal practitioner that it proposes to conclude the dispute resolution process.  The authority cannot conclude the dispute resolution process earlier than 30 days after the giving of notice under section 49(4) and on concluding the dispute resolution process, it is obliged to invite the client and the legal practitioner to furnish it with a statement under section 49(5).  Under section 49(6), the authority would then consider the statements and, where it considers that the legal services provided by the practitioner have fallen short of the standard reasonably expected from a legal practitioner, it may direct the legal practitioner to do one or more of the following: secure rectification at the legal practitioner's own expense or at the expense of his or her firm of any error, omission or other deficiency arising in connection with the legal services concerned; take, at his or her own expense or at the expense of his or her firm, such other action as the authority may specify; transfer any documents relating to the subject matter of the complaint to another legal practitioner or firm nominated by the client, subject to such terms and conditions as the authority may consider appropriate, having regard to the existence of any right to possession or retention of any of the documents concerned vested in the legal practitioner; or pay to the client a sum not exceeding &euro;3,000 as compensation for any financial or other loss suffered by the client in consequence of the legal services provided by the legal practitioner having fallen short of the standard reasonably expected of a legal practitioner in the provision of those services.<br />Under amendment No. 96, new section 50, it will be possible for the client or the practitioner concerned to seek a review of the authority's directions or its failure to make a direction.  This will be done by a review committee of three persons, two of whom will be lay persons and the third will be a legal practitioner.  An application for the review of the authority's direction must be made in writing not more than 30 days after the authority has notified the parties to the complaint of its decision and furnish a statement as to why the decision was either incorrect or unjust.  The review committee will be able to confirm the decision of the authority, make a finding that the complaint is not well founded or issue one or more of the directions to the practitioner which the authority is authorised to issue under section 49(6).</p> <p>They are the different directives I listed a moment ago.</p><p> Government amendment No. 97 creates a distinct new section 51, under which the authority will be enabled to facilitate resolution of those complaints relating to excessive costs where the main substance of the complaint is that the amount or any part of the amount of costs claimed by a practitioner in a bill of costs is excessive in a material respect and the authority is of the opinion that the subject matter of the complaint is capable of being resolved.  The authority may invite the complainant and the practitioner concerned to make efforts to resolve the matter that has been complained about.  The authority may offer assistance in resolving the matter or identify other persons willing to assist in its resolution.  It is a similar approach to the one previously mentioned.  </p><p> The amended section 51(3) provides that the period beginning on the making of a complaint to the authority and ending two months after the complaint is determined can be disregarded in relation to the making of an application for adjudication of a bill of costs under Part 9.  It will still be open to the client of a legal practitioner to submit a bill of costs to the legal costs adjudicator if he or she cannot resolve the matter under this informal resolution process.  However, where a dispute regarding a bill of costs is resolved between the client and a legal practitioner under this section, pursuant to this process, the client would not be entitled to seek the adjudication of the bill of costs under Part 9 unless such adjudication forms part of the resolution.  In other words, we are providing for a procedure to facilitate an amicable agreement being reached or an agreement being reached with the assistance, for example, of a mediator in a cost-disputed case without the parties having to go through the full costs adjudication process with the legal costs adjudicator, while at the same time not creating any barrier to someone deciding to go through the legal costs adjudicator should he or she so wish.  Of course, it is possible, where there is an attempt at an informal resolution, that people would simply agree to disagree and would agree to put the matter to the legal costs adjudicator any way.  This is just an extra provision to try to facilitate the speedy resolution of issues where there is a complaint about costs but not costs that are grossly excessive.</p><p> Under section 51(5) the authority will also be able to conclude, on notice to the parties, the disputes resolution process if it considers that an agreement or resolution of the complaint is unlikely to be reached.  This is in the context of a costs complaint.  It is worth adding that our objective here is to ensure that consumer complaints - as opposed to complaints of misconduct - that is, complaints about over-charging which is not of a major nature, can be resolved in a speedier way.  There is a very successful complaints process of this nature being used in New South Wales in Australia.  In the course of our preparatory work on the Bill, we engaged with the individual who is in charge of the legal services regulatory functions in New South Wales, who introduced this informal complaints system or what could be more correctly described as the consumer complaints system.  It has had two effects in New South Wales.  It has produced a far speedier and less bureaucratic structure for dealing with consumer complaints than previously existed.  I am also told that because of the existence of this facility for some years in New South Wales, solicitors are now more efficient in their dealings with clients.  It was expected that the number of cost complaints would increase over time and that was the case in the early years.  Now, however, the number of complaints is decreasing because of the approach that has been taken to dealing with complaints.  Many cases of disagreement between solicitors and their clients are now resolved without even the need to use the complaints process in place there.  </p><p> We aim to ensure that complaints of a serious nature will be dealt with in the formal regulatory structure but consumer complaints will have the possibility of being dealt with otherwise but in dealing with cost issues, the availability of the costs adjudicator in relation to any issue in dispute on costs is not in any way impeded.  No access barricade is created.  There will continue to be full access but this will readily provide a mechanism to facilitate a resolution where it is possible without the need for an individual to resort to the legal costs adjudicator, unless he or she chooses to do so.</p></speech>

The Bill already prescribes a three year time limit for making application to the legal costs adjudicator.  Having paid a bill, there is a three year time limit within which one can make a complaint thereafter.  It is important to have consistency in the legislation.  Three years after someone has discovered there is a reason to complain is sufficient time, rather than five years, to allow for the making of complaints.  However, we must also be careful.  There are circumstances that can arise where an individual may not know that their legal issues have not been dealt with appropriately.  Let us say, for example, that I go to a solicitor and buy a house.  I  pay my mortgage on that house and 15 years later I decide I want to sell it.  I then discover, unknown to me, that the solicitor has the house registered in his or her own name.  That is not very far away from certain difficulties we have recently seen.  We cannot have a situation where someone could not, 15 years later upon discovering that, make a complaint.  We are looking at how best to frame this.  The cost complaints issue is very straightforward but for other complaints, there is a need to take care.  I do not believe it is right to have an open-ended situation whereby 30 years or 50 years after someone has completed legal work for a client, that client can make a complaint.  That is not reasonable either.  I am aware of members of the legal profession who 20 or 30 years after they completed work for individuals have had complaints made against them that have proved to be spurious but the Law Society was in a position where it had to deal with those complaints in good faith.  We must provide the appropriate balance to ensure that if someone who has no way of knowing that their affairs have not been dealt with appropriately makes such a discovery, he or she can make a complaint but that there is a prescribed time frame.  We will come back to that issue on report stage.</p></speech>

Is there flexibility in these sections to anticipate the new processes that will be provided for in the forthcoming mediation Bill?  The mediation Bill, in the context of cost issues and resolving matters, could be as important for the citizens as this Bill.  So much of what happens in family law and civil law could be resolved at an early stage with a robust mediation process.  We have had some dialogue in the Chamber about this and I ask the Minister to give us his thoughts on the matter.</p></speech>

We are going to have another look at one or two aspects of this in order to ensure that they are in sync.  The Bill on mediation is complementary to what we are doing here.</p> <p>In certain circumstances it creates the possibility that the legal services regulatory authority may propose, where there is a consumer complaint which the parties themselves are not able to resolve through the offices of the legal services regulatory authority itself, that the parties go to mediation rather than making the issue more long, drawn-out and expensive than may be necessary.  We will not put in the Bill provisions which will be included in the mediation Bill to deal with access to mediation issues and the principles of mediation on which we are working.

Amendment No. 98 makes several amendments to section 45, which sets out the types of acts or omissions of a legal practitioner that may be considered as misconduct.  Most notably, misconduct now comprehends a bill of cost which is grossly excessive.  In determining whether the bill of cost is grossly excessive, the authority, the divisional committee, the disciplinary tribunal or the High Court may have regard to the following:<blockquote><blockquote>(<i>a</i>) the amount by which or the extent to which the amount claimed in the bill of costs was found to be excessive;<br />(<i>b</i>) whether in the particular circumstances of the legal services performed the amount of the bill of costs appears to be unconscionable; and<br />(<i>c</i>) whether or not a Legal Costs Adjudicator has found the costs charged to be grossly excessive.</blockquote></blockquote>Other amendments to this section provide that the failure of a managing legal practitioner of a multidisciplinary practice to comply with his or her obligations under the Act may constitute misconduct.<br />We have also included a subsection under which, in the case of solicitors, an act or omission that constitutes a material breach of the solicitors' accounts regulations may now amount to misconduct.  In addition, if an act or omission consists of an offence under the Bill, it may constitute misconduct.<br />Finally, we have also inserted a new subsection (<i>m</i>): &quot;the act consists of a contravention of <i>section 118(1)</i>.&quot;  Where a legal practitioner who has accepted instructions to appear in court on behalf of a client who is in custody withdraws from the client's case without obtaining permission from the court before which the client is next scheduled to appear, this may now constitute misconduct.<br />I would like to turn to Opposition amendments Nos. 99, 102, 108, 110 and 112, if the Chair would permit me to group these together with the solicitors' group.  All of these amendments, from my reading of them, are taken from the Bar Council's submission of March 2012.  I am opposing these amendments, which have previously been considered, as they were included in the Bar Council's submissions and were so considered.  In essence, the amendments seek to provide for supervised self-regulation and run counter to current Government policy as expressed in the Bill and its provisions for independent regulation of the legal profession, including a regime to deal with professional conduct and discipline.  Essentially, these amendments hark back to the era when it was proposed that a legal services ombudsman was all that was required and that there would be oversight, but that the professional bodies would continue to self-regulate rather than be subject to independent regulation.  It is the independence that is important.<br />Turning to Opposition amendment No. 100, which relates to legal executives, the Bill does not make any provision regarding the role or status of legal executives, nor is any such provision envisaged.  While I recognise that there may be additional benefits and efficiencies to be found for consumers and for the legal services sector in a more developed role for legal executives, such matters will need to be considered separately on their own merits while others may come to be considered in due course by the new legal services regulatory authority.  The Bill deals with solicitors and barristers as legal practitioners and will not be extended beyond that in its scope.<br />Regarding Government amendment No. 101, section 46 provides that misconduct complaints on or after the coming into operation of this part will be made to the authority.  Subsection (3) provides that the period beginning on the making of a complaint to the authority and ending two months after the complaint is determined shall be disregarded in reckoning any period of time for the purpose of any limitation period in respect of the making of an application for adjudication on a bill of costs under Part 9.<br />Concerning Government amendment No. 103, section 47 provides that the authority may make regulations regarding the making of complaints to the authority under this Act and the procedures to be followed by the authority and the complaints committee in investigating complaints.<br />I now want to refer to Opposition amendment No. 104, which was also contained in the Bar Council's March 2012 submission.  I am opposing this amendment.  In essence, the Government's amendments set out detailed provisions regarding how complaints regarding inadequate services, excessive fees and misconduct will be processed and investigated by the new legal services regulatory authority, the complaints committee and the legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal.</p> <p>On amendment No. 105, section 48 provides that the authority may make regulations prescribing the fee, if any, payable in respect of making a complaint.  I assure Deputies that it is not intended that any such fee be a disincentive to the public in their making of complaints.  </p><p> I am unable to accept amendment No. 106, in the name of Deputy Finian McGrath, on the grounds that it represents a watering down of the authority's power to expect and enforce co-operation and compliance by legal practitioners with the authority and essentially shifts that regulatory oversight power to the High Court in a way that I cannot accept.  </p><p> Amendments Nos. 107 and 108 relate to section 47, which sets out the criteria for the admissibility of complaints of misconduct.  It has been slightly amended from the admissibility of complaints section which was in the published Bill by the admissibility of complaints regarding inadequate services.  A complaint under this Part will not be considered by the authority if, in the opinion of the authority, it is deemed to be frivolous or vexatious or if it is without substance or foundation or does not satisfy the other criteria prescribed in the section.  Where the authority determines that it will not consider a complaint, it will have to notify the complainant in writing setting out the reasons and also notify the legal practitioner.  On determining under this section that it will consider a complaint, the authority shall proceed to investigate the complaint subject to the resolution and complaints provisions that we discussed earlier.  </p><p> Amendment No. 109 provides for the creation, along with the admissibility procedures, of a new preliminary review of complaints section, namely, section 50, which will enable the authority to conduct a preliminary review of the complaint to determine whether or not the complaint is admissible and whether it is an appropriate complaint to be dealt with by the authority offering assistance in resolving the matter - section 51 - or whether the complaint should be sent to the complaints committee. </p><p> I hope I have explained all the amendments that I have proposed and responded to the amendments tabled in the names of Opposition members.</p></speech>

While I do not necessarily agree with every amendment proposed, it is important that they be put forward during Committee Stage consideration of the Bill.</p></speech>

It is important to note that the act or omission which is the subject of the complaint cannot relate to fraud or dishonesty, which is to be dealt with separately under the conduct regime.  The agreement by the complainant and the legal practitioner to make efforts to resolve the matter does not prevent the authority continuing its consideration or investigation of the complaint.  I refer members to section 51(2) in that context.  However, if the complaints committee of the disciplinary tribunal of the High Court is satisfied that an act or omission of a complaint has been resolved by the legal practitioner or that proper effort was made by him or her to resolve the matter, then, in determining the appropriate sanction, due regard must be had to the efforts made to resolve the matter.<br />On amendment No. 113, section 52 provides that no answer or statement by the complainant or legal practitioner in the course of attempting to resolve a complaint under section 51 may be used in any disciplinary, civil or criminal proceedings or communicated to any other person.<br />On amendment No. 114, which relates to section 53, which provides that the agreement by the legal practitioner to participate in the resolution of the matter under section 51 shall not be treated as an admission of liability.  This is to encourage a resolution of a matter, if possible.  It is then left to the authority to determine how matters should be dealt with thereafter if a resolution is effected.<br />On amendment No. 116, section 55 provides that the authority shall prepare and publish guidelines in relation to the resolution of complaints by mediation or informal means.  The guidelines may set out the process whereby a determination can be made in respect of whether a complaint can be resolved by mediation or informal means.  This allows the authority to give some indication of the approach to be taken by way of guidelines in respect of mediating complaints or their being informally resolved.</p></speech>

Section 54 deals with complaints relating to fraud and dishonesty and is thus very important.  It enables such fraud and dishonesty complaints to be dealt with expeditiously in their own right and in the public interest.<br />Government amendment No. 117 deals with the complaints committee.  The cluster of amendments relating to a new Chapter 2 deals with the consideration of complaints for the complaints committee.  As such, it develops many of the sections dealing with the complaints procedures currently in the Bill as published.  Section 56 provides that the authority will establish a committee, to be known as the complaints committee, for the purpose of considering and investigating complaints referred to by the authority.  A key change from the published Bill is that the requirement for the approval of the Minister for the appointment of members of the committee has been removed.<br />Another key change is an increase in membership of the committee from 16 to 27 members so as to prevent any backlog of complaints developing, and so there is not an undue pressure or amount of work imposed on a small number of members.  The Law Society would nominate eight members where it would previously have nominated three members, and the Bar Council would nominate four members where it would previously have nominated three members.  The greater increase in the Law Society nominations reflects the reality that there are significantly more solicitors than barristers in the State, at a ratio of five to one.<br />It is also envisaged that the complaints committee may act in divisions of five members as well as divisions of three members.  Each divisional committee will have a majority of lay members, one of whom will be the chairperson.  Where a complaint relates to a solicitor, the divisional committee comprises three members, with one member being a solicitor.  Where a complaint relates to a solicitor and a divisional committee comprises five members, two of the members will be a solicitor.  Where the complaint relates to a barrister the same ratio will apply regarding barrister composition of the divisional committees.<br />We have made a slight amendment to section 56(4), dealing with the appointment of the lay members of the complaints committee.  The lay members will be persons independent of the legal practitioners' professional bodies and will have an expertise in or knowledge of the provision of legal services; the maintenance of standards in a profession, including those regulated by a statutory body; the investigation and consideration of complaints relating to services; and the interests of consumers of legal services.<br />Government amendment No. 118 develops section 57, dealing with the investigation of complaints.  When referring a complaint to a divisional committee, the authority will now prepare a summary of the complaint which will be furnished to the divisional committee.  The divisional committee will also furnish the legal practitioner with a copy of the complaint and request his or her response unless the legal practitioner has already been furnished with a copy of the complaint.  Where the divisional committee receives an explanation from the legal practitioner concerned indicating that the act or omission did not constitute misconduct, it must furnish a copy of the explanation to the complainant, inviting the complainant to furnish his or her observations on the explanation of the legal practitioner.  Where the response of the legal practitioner does not satisfy the divisional committee that the act or omission did not constitute misconduct and where the legal practitioner does not furnish a response within the period specified in the notice, the divisional committee will take such steps as it considers appropriate to investigate the complaint.<br />Section 57(6) deals with investigating a complaint.  The divisional committee will have regard to information furnished to it by the authority and may by notice in writing to the complainant do one or more of the following: require the complainant to verify, by affidavit or otherwise, anything contained in the complaint; request the complainant to supply to the committee such information or documents relating to the complaint as it may require; and require the legal practitioner, the subject of the complaint, to supply the committee with such information or documents as it may require.<br />The divisional committee may now require the complainant and the legal practitioner to appear before the committee for the purpose of investigating the complaint.  The complainant and the legal practitioner may be represented by a person of their choice before the divisional committee.  The costs of such representation will be borne by the person who requested it.  Another new feature contained in section 57(11) is that if a complaint is withdrawn when it is being investigated by the divisional committee, the committee may decide that no further action be taken or may proceed as if the complaint had not been withdrawn.  Like section 51(4) of the published Bill, the amendments of section 57(12) provide that where the divisional committee determines that the act or omission does not constitute misconduct it shall advise the complainant and the legal practitioner in writing, setting out the reasons for its determination.<br />Government amendment No. 119 is next.  As in the published Bill, if the divisional committee determines that the act or omission which is the subject of the complaint constitutes misconduct but that such conduct is not of a kind that needs to be referred to the legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal, the divisional committee can issue a direction to the legal practitioner under section 58.  We have extended the number of sanctions that the committee may specify, taking account of the existing regime and submissions received.  For example, there may be a direction that the legal practitioner take such other action in the interest of the client as the committee may specify; or a direction to the legal practitioner to pay a sum not exceeding &euro;5,000 as compensation for any financial or other loss suffered by the client in consequence of any such inadequacy in the legal services provided or purported to be provided by the legal practitioner, provided that any such payment made in compliance with the direction shall be without prejudice to any legal right of the client.<br />It is now open to the complaints committee to issue one or more of the measures contained in section 58(5)(<i>a</i>) to (<i>i</i>).  Where the legal practitioner complies with each such direction the complaint shall be considered determined.  It is also open to the complaints committee under section 58(6)(<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) to caution, admonish or reprimand the legal practitioner in respect of the act or omission the subject of the complaint, or direct the Law Society, in the case of a solicitor, to impose a specified restriction or condition on the practising certificate of the legal practitioner concerned.  In the case of a barrister, the divisional committee may direct the chief executive of the authority to impose a specified restriction or condition on the legal practitioner concerned in respect of his or practice as a barrister.<br />It is now provided that the legal practitioner must consent to the sanction in writing on the advices of the Office of the Attorney General.  A recent case involving the disciplining of a medical practitioner by the Medical Council held that the High Court would be the only body empowered to issue such a sanction.  The divisional committee will therefore notify the legal practitioner of the precise measure it proposes to take.  The notification will indicate that unless the legal practitioner concerned furnishes to the divisional committee his or her consent in writing to the imposition of the specified measures within 21 days of the notice, the divisional committee will apply to the legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal for the holding of an inquiry into the complaint by the tribunal under this part.  Where the divisional committee does not receive the written consent within 21 days, it shall apply to the legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal for the holding of an inquiry by it into the complaint in so far as the committee has not found that the complaints are unfounded or that the act or omission concerned does not constitute misconduct.</p> <p>Where the divisional committee considers that the act or omission, the subject of the complaint, constitutes misconduct of a kind that is more appropriate for consideration by the legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal, it has the discretion to make an application to it in respect of the matter for the holding of an inquiry under section 60.  In determining whether it would be more appropriate for the complaint to be considered by the tribunal, the complaints committee shall have regard to the extent of the misconduct which was disclosed and the cost of the investigation of the complaint by the complaints committee.</p><p> I appreciate that there is a substantial amount of information in that, but I considered it appropriate to go through the detail of what is proposed and the modalities or mechanics of how the new architecture will operate in practice.  The time has been used well to flesh out in greater detail matters that were originally dealt with in more brevity in the original Bill and to address any issues of concern that arose from the submissions we received.</p></speech>

Fraud and dishonesty are huge issues in society.  We have seen in recent years how greed and dishonesty among a group of members of the legal profession, particularly during the Celtic tiger years, led to major damage.  It is not just in the legal profession; we have also seen it in politics, business and the church.  We need amendments such as this to ensure there is public confidence in the professions, and in this case in the legal profession.  Recently, many senior citizens in particular have expressed concern to me about the issue and whether they can have trust and confidence in the legal profession after some of the cases that have arisen.  It is important when discussing amendment No. 115 that we also send a broader message to the legal profession with regard to the people who have let it down in the past.  There had been very few negative or bad cases for 40 or 50 years but recently there has been a string of cases.  My point is that the legal profession - the amendment adds to this - must earn the trust and respect of the population.  One does not just get respect; one must earn it.  Subsections (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) and (<i>c</i>) deal with these issues.<br />Action must be taken to deal with this, because we all suffer the consequences.  All citizens want a legal profession that is up-front, professional and impartial.  Happily, the majority of people in the profession are doing an excellent job, but we must ensure that cases to which amendment No. 115 relates are dealt with in a professional, independent and impartial way.</p></speech>

It has been said to me on numerous occasions that if a member of the public has a complaint against a member of the legal profession, be it a solicitor or barrister, when he or she approaches other members of the legal profession to assist in making the complaint, he or she might be told that the legal practitioner does not wish to get involved by taking the case or assisting the person.  Often the person can be left in a situation in which it is not possible to get legal assistance, but he or she has no legal background.  The question of how somebody can get assistance if he or she finds all the doors are shut might be worth considering.  We cannot compel solicitors to take cases but perhaps there might be some avenue or approach whereby somebody can get assistance if he or she is totally frustrated and intimidated by the legal process.  It is a point the Minister and the various societies might consider taking on board and addressing in some way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1753" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014011500023#W00600"><p>Perhaps I could respond to two issues.  Deputy Finian McGrath referred to a professional, independent and impartial system to adjudicate on allegations of misconduct and emphasised the importance of such a system being in place in which there can be public confidence to deal with fraud or dishonesty.  That matter has been at the heart of this Bill since it was published - that is, to have a system in which there is public confidence and in which there can be no doubt of any description about the independence of the body dealing with adjudication matters.  The body must not be perceived to be an arm of the legal profession, whether it is fair or unfair to so describe it, but must be seen to be independent, and it must have a series of principles prescribed which it must apply in dealing with allegations of fraud, misconduct or other types of misbehaviour.  The philosophy behind the Bill sets out that objective from the start and in these provisions the time we have had has allowed us to tease out to a greater extent aspects of the architecture which I consider to be important.</p><p>  That feeds in also to answering your question, Chairman.  When this body is established, an individual who believes or alleges that he or she has been a victim of misconduct by a solicitor or barrister can, without requiring legal advice, make the complaint to the legal services regulatory authority and the authority will have an obligation to assess the matter in the manner detailed in the very extensive provisions we have been discussing this afternoon.  He or she should not be intimidated.  It is not a question of having to make a phone call to the Law Society or the Bar Council to make a complaint about somebody who is a member of either of those bodies.  It is about contacting a body that is independent of each of the representative bodies of the two arms of the legal profession.  I hope that at a very early stage in its life this body will be seen to be independent and will establish both its credibility and fairness by the manner in which it deals with complaints received.  Its fairness in dealing with complaints, both to the complainant and the person who is the subject of the complaint, mean the proper procedures will apply.  It will receive everything from spurious complaints to very serious and valid ones.  We are trying to provide as detailed an architecture as possible to enable that to happen.</p></speech>

I will, in any event, be returning to this Part for further amendment on Report Stage.

Another key change has been the removal of the role of the Government in nominating the lay persons to the tribunal.  The Minister must now ensure that the lay persons nominated to be members of the disciplinary tribunal are persons who are independent of the Government and the professional bodies and have knowledge and expertise as set out in the subsection - for example, in the provision of legal services, the interests of consumers, etc.  The amendment also provides that the disciplinary tribunal can act in divisions of three and five members.  At present each division is to have a majority of lay members, one of whom will be the chairperson, but I may be returning to this on Report Stage to ensure the effective chairing of the disciplinary tribunal.<br />I want to say that we are anxious to ensure that there is lay involvement.  In the context of technical legal matters that could arise we are reconsidering whether the chairperson, in this instance, should in fact be one of the lawyer members, if I could put it that way, as opposed to a lay member.  We will come back to that issue.<br />Government amendments Nos. 124 and 125 are minor technical amendments which I am told by the Parliamentary Counsel are necessary.<br />Government amendment No. 126 provides for the appointment of the chairperson of the disciplinary tribunal.  The person appointed as chairperson may either be a legal practitioner who has practised for not less than ten years or, where the person is not a legal practitioner, have knowledge and expertise in one of the areas set out in the subsection.   The chairperson shall be appointed by the President of the High Court from the persons nominated by the Minister for membership of the tribunal.</p></speech>

The word &ldquo;legally&rdquo; in &ldquo;legally required&rdquo; and &ldquo;may legally require&rdquo; has been deleted.<b></b>Amendment No 130 provides that the inquiry by the disciplinary tribunal will be conducted by way of oral hearing and will be in public.  It also provides that the disciplinary tribunal may direct that the hearing of the inquiry or any part thereof be held otherwise than in public where it is satisfied that it is necessary to do so in the interests of justice.  Amendment No. 131 substitutes &ldquo;Authority&rdquo; for &ldquo;complainant&rdquo;.  Amendment No. 132 provides that the tribunal may appoint an expert if it requires the advice or assistance of an expert in respect of any matter.  Amendment No. 133 provides for a requirement to notify the parties of a determination and the reasons for that determination.  Amendment No. 134 deletes the word &ldquo;client&rdquo; and substitutes &ldquo;complainant&rdquo;, as &quot;complainant&quot; is a more appropriate description in this instance.  With regard to Government amendment No. 135, we have inserted a provision that the legal practitioners' disciplinary tribunal may direct that the legal practitioner pay a sum, not exceeding &euro;15,000 as restitution, or part restitution, to any aggrieved party.  The section is based on section 7(9) of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1960 and will strengthen the sanctions available to the disciplinary tribunal.<br />By way of clarification, I wish to confirm that<b></b>I will be returning to the remaining provisions dealing with the legal disciplinary tribunal on Report Stage, when the remainder of the amendments have been finalised by the Office of the Parliamentary Counsel.  I referred to that a short time ago and said that there are some additional amendments that the Parliamentary Counsel is still working on which are of relevance to this particular part of the Bill.</p></speech>

There is a broad range of other individuals engaged in matters of some relevance, directly or indirectly, to legal services such as notaries public, legal cost accountants, legal executives and others.  I could go on in the context of the manner in which people describe themselves and their engagements.  I am not in any way being critical of their engagements.  There is an increasing number of legal executives doing a particular type of work but there is an important discussion that needs to take place in a public context.  Legal executives are looking for rights of audience in the District Court and Circuit Court.  Other issues involve training, legal expertise and the limits to which different individuals should engage in the legal profession without being fully trained as lawyers.</p><p>  These are public interest issues and it is not about preserving anyone's patch.  I am an enthusiast of the provision of legal services through alternative business mechanisms to make the legal profession more competitive and to give lawyers other business options through which to provide legal advice as well as giving the general public an opportunity to access legal advice.  In the context of the Bill, we have a substantial agenda.  I appreciate the role played by legal executives and others but that is for another day and requires a different discussion than incorporating it at this stage within the Bill or providing for their regulation through the legal services regulatory authority.  In the public interest, we must enact this Bill, establish the legal services regulatory authority and have the new measures in place.</p><p>  At a later date,  we can deal with other bodies engaged in aspects of law and for whom there may be a need, in the public interest, for some form of regulation.  One of the issues is to ensure that people do not claim to have expertise they do not have.  As a consequence, members of the public may not always be well served.  Issues must be considered and addressed and they transcend this Bill.  The Bill is a comprehensive and complex introduction of substantial public interest reforms.  It is not practical or appropriate to extend it at this time.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1845" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014011500025#Y03400"><p>No, I said it requires a far broader debate.  I did not say I intended to bring forward legislation.  If there were to be legislation, before any Government or Minister makes a decision, there is a need for a wider debate on the roles of legal executives, the outer limits of the roles and what education system should be put in place to ensure consistency of knowledge and education.  We should also consider the extent to which legal executives have grown around the legal profession.  There may be a number of individuals who are very competent in the work they do, styled as legal executives, and they may exclusively work on, for example, conveyancing and may have no expertise outside that, which they do very well and efficiently.  Another individual may know something about law and the personal injuries area but, outside that, has no knowledge of expertise but acts as a legal executive in that area and works under the supervision of a solicitor.  It is not simply a question of deciding to have legislation and then trying to search out what the legislation should prescribe.  Public policy issues must be addressed including the diversity of roles legal executives currently play, whether it is in the public interest or not that they be regulated in a particular way, if they were to be regulated what should be the nature of the regulation and in what way could regulation ensure it worked appropriately and, to use that awful word I used earlier, seamlessly in its interaction with the legal professions as they operate.</p> <p>How does one ensure a member of the public, if he or she approaches someone who is a legal executive rather than a barrister or a solicitor, has knowledge of the level of expertise of the individual with whom he or she is dealing?  These are issues.  I can tell the Deputy that, as a practising lawyer for many years, these are issues around which I have some concerns.  There are some very good people working in confined areas as legal executives while there are some others who are legal executives but who may or may not have the qualifications to work in the areas in which they are working.  A whole range of public interest issues need to be considered.  I am not making a commitment to legislate but am saying that before we even get to that point, there is a whole range of policy issues which need to be considered in the context of the public interest.  When some reasonable decisions are made on those, there is then the question as to whether there is or is not a need for legislation.  The legislative provisions will not be contained in this particular Bill because of the need for us to bring to completion the legislative process in an area which is already as complex as it need be and which is providing for very substantial reform.  </p><p> It is worth mentioning the legal profession as it is in this State and as it developed to 1922.  Members might like to read the history of how the legal profession developed in England and Ireland, or how it evolved through the 17th, 18th and 19th centuries.  It is in the form it is in more by accident than design for a whole range of reasons into which I will not go.  The legal profession has not evolved or changed since 1922, as it has in other countries.  This legislation provides the architecture for the possibility of evolution and change in the public interest and in the interests of those who are qualified lawyers and who have skills which can be utilised to generate income for them and skills which they can use in the interests of the public.  The Bill provides for how that can be done in ways which reflect the way it is currently done in other ways while we completely update our provisions in regard to regulatory and disciplinary matters and deal with a broad range of legal cost issues in a manner which gives statutory expression to very important principles, some of which have been there for some time but which have not formed the part of our statute law.  We have enough to deal with in this Bill without trying to extend its scope to an entirely different group of individuals.</p></speech>

in <i>subparagraphs (i)</i>and <i>(ii)</i>of <i>subsection (4)(a)</i>,<br />(<i>c</i>) the proportion, calculated under <i>subsection (4)(b)</i>, of the expenses referred to in <i>subsection (4)(a)(i)</i>that was incurred in the consideration and investigation of&mdash;<br />(i) complaints in respect of solicitors,<br />(ii) complaints in respect of barristers who are members of the Law Library, and<br />(iii) complaints in respect of barristers who are not members of the Law Library,<br />(<i>d</i>) the expenses of the Disciplinary Tribunal in respect of the preceding financial year,<br />(<i>e</i>) the proportion, calculated under <i>subsection (5)</i>, of the expenses of the Disciplinary Tribunal that was incurred in the consideration of applications brought before it concerning&mdash;<br />(i) complaints in respect of solicitors,<br />(ii) complaints in respect of barristers who are members of the Law Library, and<br />(iii) complaints in respect of barristers who

(f)</i>is not paid by the date referred to in <i>paragraph (g)</i>.</blockquote>(11) The levy received under <i>subsection (1)</i>shall be paid into or disposed of for the benefit of the Exchequer in such manner as the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform directs.<br />(12) For the purposes of this section&mdash;<blockquote>(<i>a</i>) a reference to the number of barristers whose names are on the roll of practising barristers shall be construed as a reference to the number of barristers whose names are on that roll during the financial year to which the expenses concerned relate, less the number of such barristers to whom <i>section 71</i>applies, and<br />(<i>b</i>) a reference to the number of solicitors on the roll of solicitors is a reference to the number of solicitors on that roll in the financial year to which the expenses concerned relate, less the number of such solicitors to whom <i>section 71</i>applies.</blockquote>(13) In this Part&mdash;&quot;barrister who is not a member of the Law Library&quot; means a barrister whose name, in the financial year to which the expenses concerned relate, is on the roll of practising barristers, where the entry concerned specifies that he or she is not a member of the Law Library, and &quot;barrister who is a member of the Law Library&quot; shall be construed accordingly;<br />&quot;superannuation benefits&quot; means pensions, gratuities and other allowances payable on resignation, retirement or death.&quot;.</blockquote>I should say at the outset of these amendments dealing with Part 6 of the Bill why I must oppose, just for the time being, Opposition amendments Nos. 144 and 145 which relate to a matter the Law Society very recently put to me in written correspondence.  I assure the Deputy that I will consider a reference to a register rather than a roll of practising solicitors and I will table such an amendment on Report Stage if, or when, I am satisfied it would represent a fairer calculation of the levy in regard to solicitors.  However,  I am afraid I cannot support the Deputy's attempt to protect the Bar Council from suit in the event that it refuses to pay a due levy and so I must oppose Opposition amendment No. 149.  <br />Turning to the remaining Government amendments Nos. 138 and 150 to 152, inclusive, Part 6 of the Bill, as published, consists of two sections, namely, sections 69 and 70.  I propose the deletion of both sections and their substitution with four new sections to provide in detail for a fair and equitable calculation and payment of a levy on legal practitioners in order to fund the operational expenses of both the legal services regulatory authority and the legal practitioners disciplinary tribunal.  The original provision sought to achieve the same goal.  However, the need for certain amendments came to light in the intervening period of time since publication in 2011.  The new configuration of this Part reflects certain representations made by the Law Society and the Bar Council, in particular, and I believe their concerns that the levy terms should be balanced and fair will be allayed.<br />I will take the committee through the proposed new sections in sequence.  The first is new section 69.  This reflects a broadening of the traditional model of the provision of legal services by barristers and comprehends those barristers who choose to practise outside the Law Library.  While barristers may continue to operate from the Law Library as sole traders, other persons who have been called to the Bar should, therefore, be permitted to offer their services outside that structure, including as employees.  That is why section 69 now makes a distinction that there will be, for the propose of calculating the levy, three categories of practising legal practitioners, namely, solicitors, barristers who are members of the Law Library and barristers who are not members of the Law Library.<br />Subsection (1) provides that the Law Society will be responsible for paying to the authority the levy amount on behalf of solicitors.  The Bar Council will be responsible for paying the levy on behalf of its members.  Those barristers who are not members of the Law Library will be individually responsible for paying the levy directly to the authority.  I will refine the practising status of these categories of legal practitioners for Report Stage.  <br />Subsections (2) and (3) are essentially carried over from the published Bill and provide that the authority shall determine its and the tribunal's operating costs and administrative expenses at the end of the financial year.  These costs are standard remuneration and accommodation costs found in many instances throughout the Statute Book.  <br />Subsection (4) provides that these expenses shall be divided equitably between the three categories of legal practitioners.  It is important to note here that the levy calculations are based on the proportions of the expenses incurred by the authority in the consideration and investigation of complaints in regard to three categories of legal practitioner and not an accrued calculation based on the proportion of complaints received in regard to each.  This is an important distinction which reflects the fact that some investigations would be more complex and lengthy than others and it would be unfair to burden one category of legal practitioner with costs associated with a different category of practitioner.  <br />Subsection (5) sets out that the authority, in consultation with the tribunal, will every year calculate how the expenses of the tribunal will be apportioned between the Law Society, the Bar Council and non-Law Library member barristers.  Subsection (6) simply provides that the sum total of the levy payable will constitute the expenses of both disciplinary bodies, that is, the authority and the tribunal.<br />Subsection (7) is a detailed and somewhat technically complex provision to provide for the method of calculation in regard to the levy to be imposed on legal practitioners.  This has been worked out in conjunction with Parliamentary Counsel and it takes cognisance of written representations made to me by various interested parties that the levy calculation in the Bill, as published, was in need of some finessing.  The subsection is subdivided into three paragraphs.  Paragraph (<i>a</i>) deals with the authority's expenses incurred in fulfilling its remit as a complaints handling disciplinary body.  Paragraph (<i>b</i>) deals with the authority's expenses incurred in fulfilling its other non-complaints related functions as set out in section 9, which deals with the authority's functions.  Paragraph (<i>c</i>) deals with the tribunal's expenses.</p> <p>The calculation ratio is that 10% of the expenses incurred by the authority and the tribunal in their disciplinary related functions will be apportioned to the Law Society, 10% to all practising barristers, where they are not members of the Law Library, while the remaining 80% will be apportioned in proportion to the expenses incurred in the consideration and investigation of complaints in respect of three categories of legal practitioner.  The expenses incurred by the authority in fulfilling its functions other than those relating to complaints will be apportioned <i>pro rata</i>between the three groups.<br />Subsections (9) and (10) provide that a levy assessment notice shall be sent at the end of each financial year to the relevant professional bodies or individuals, as the case may be, specifying the total due to be paid and the detailed breakdown of the final tally.  The initial set-up costs for the new bodies will be paid for by the Exchequer on a recoupable basis via the levy.  Subsection (11) sets out that the levy is to be paid to the Exchequer.  The remaining subsections (12) and (13) are standard provisions to clarify terminology and references in this part of the Bill.<br />Section 70 is a commonsense provision to ensure the authority has sufficient power to compel payment of the levy by the relevant persons within a reasonable three month timeframe.  Failure to pay the levy may result in an individual legal practitioner being prevented from providing legal services or may result in the authority suing the Law Society or Bar Council until payment is made.  Section 71 provides for an exemption from payment of the levy for legal practitioners who are in the full-time service of the State.  I will return to this particular provision again on Report Stage as it is intrinsically linked to the definitions of practising solicitor and practising barrister to which, as I flagged during the July 2013 Committee Stage hearing, I will be returning.  This is due to the fact that those definitions had not been settled to the satisfaction of Parliamentary Counsel.  Section 72 is a standard regulation-making provision that is to be found in the original Bill as published.</p></speech>

Both representative organisations want to ensure the levy is as fair as possible, based on the level of complaints against the legal practitioners they represent.  I am disappointed at the register of solicitors.  It is valid to point out that a register of solicitors would be much larger than any register of "practising" solicitors.  The register should reflect those who are practising.  I note that the Minister has indicated that he may address that issue on Report Stage.  In my view, it is extremely important to address that issue.  In fairness to the Law Society and the Bar Council, they are paying and have no problem with that.  They have never indicated in their representations that they had a problem with paying and accept that they should pay for this new authority.  However, they want the burden to be distributed fairly.</p><p>  I ask that the Minister adds this to the agenda for his meeting with the Law Society to deal with their concerns around "practising" solicitors.  The Bar Council has similar concerns.  It is frustrating because we tried to table amendments that were ruled out of order because of a potential charge to the Exchequer.  This issue does not involve any potential charge to the Exchequer.  We are trying to engage with amendments to stimulate a discussion on these issues but our amendments are not being permitted.  That is fair enough and we must accept Standing Orders as they are.  It is reasonable that the bodies who are paying for this authority and are making it happen would be consulted on the question of making it as fair as possible.  That is the purpose of the amendments that were ruled out of order and those that are still on the list. </p></speech>

We have also had regard to any submissions we received.  I would agree that any levy should apply to practising solicitors.  We cannot levy the Law Society for retired, struck-off or deceased solicitors.  No one is suggesting that we should do so.  Indeed, there are one or two solicitors who are in prison and are no longer practising.  We will engage appropriately on this issue and I can assure the Deputies that there has been extensive engagement, of a practical nature, to ensure the workings of this Bill are fair, both to those engaged in the professions and to the public, and that the public interest is protected.  These are very important matters of concern.  We must also ensure the Bill is fair to taxpayers in order that the public who are paying their taxes do not have to fund the system.  There are nuances within the professions between practising solicitors, barristers who are members of the Law Library and barristers who are not members of the Law Library but who are practising.  There are issues as to how these should be levied and there will have to be fairness in that context too in order that individuals, for example, are not required to pay for something from which they do not benefit or with which they do not engage.  There are issues here that require further consideration.  Submissions were made to us very recently on these matters to which I have given very detailed consideration.  I will come back to any outstanding matters that need to be addressed on Report Stage.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1859" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014011500027#AA00400"><p>At the outset I should state that I am a barrister, although I am on leave from the Law Library for the duration of this D&aacute;il.  While I welcome the Minister's amendment, I wish to express a reservation in respect of one part of it.  I welcome the distinction and differentiation between barristers who are members of the Law Library and those who are not.  The Minister discussed the fact that there are practising barristers who are not members of the Law Library.  It is not as revolutionary as some will no doubt claim it is.  The constitution of the General Council of the Bar of Ireland states that<blockquote><br />The Council shall maintain a register of all practicing barristers and that register shall be maintained under the control of the Council by the Director of the Council and shall be in two parts consisting of respectively;<br />(a) All members of the Law Library; and<br />(b) All other persons who submit to the jurisdiction of the Council in accordance with the regulations in force from time to time.</blockquote>Notwithstanding that and to use a legal term, the Bar Council has failed, refused or neglected to maintain a register of practising barristers who are not members of the Law Library.  There has been a lot of discussion about the rule of law in the context of this Bill and potential damage to the rule of law, but one of the most basic tenets of the rule of law is that every organisation, even a ping-pong club, adheres to its own rules.  Notwithstanding the fact that the Bar Council does not maintain a register of practising barristers who are not members of the Law Library, I am aware of a number of barristers who practise, particularly in the southern and south-western circuits, who are not registered.  There is no mechanism by which they can be registered.  While they are not doing anything unlawful in any way because there is no legal requirement for a barrister to have a practising certificate issued by anybody and the practice of issuing practising certificates is relatively new, they are not susceptible to any disciplinary mechanism or regulation by anybody.  They could, of course, be subscribing members of the Law Library and it must be said there are two categories of subscribing members of the Law Library at present: those who are based in or near Dublin and those who are considered to be country members who are based further away from Dublin and would have less use for the Law Library.  There are a number of barristers who, for whatever reason, do not see the Law Library as being of any benefit to them so they do not subscribe to it.  The Law Library is undoubtedly of benefit to many barristers but that is a choice they make because there is a cost involved in subscribing to the Law Library.  That cost, like all costs involved in the provision of any service, is eventually passed on to the consumer.  One of the purposes of this Bill is to drive down legal costs and to bring at least a certain degree of transparency to them.<br />Notwithstanding all that, my concern is that there are three categories listed as being liable to pay a share, namely the Bar Council, the Law Society and barristers who are not members of the Law Library.  However, barristers who are not members of the Law Library will still have to be on a roll of barristers somewhere.</p> <p>That is not dealt with in the amendments.</p><p> Section 76 in Part 8 provides that the Bar Council shall maintain a roll.  There is nothing wrong with that and it is not in conflict with what the Minister is introducing.  My concern is that the Bar Council might seek to introduce a provision, whereby barristers who are not members of the Law Library may have to pay a contribution towards the regulatory costs as part of their practising fee or as a condition of the practising fee have to pay some of the cost of maintaining the Law Library, which would defeat the purpose of the Bill.  I flag this as an issue which must be teased out in subsequent amendments.  However, one of the great benefits of the Law Library is that it gives a fair degree of access to the profession of barrister and in theory at least, while the practice may be different, everybody gets an equal crack of the whip.  There must be a system, similar to the solicitor's apprentice, whereby newly qualified barristers do a pupillage or devilling as it was referred to until quite recently.  Clearly barristers will not be able to develop in their profession as in-house barristers with the banks or even as in-house counsel in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  </p><p> In the Bar in Britain, there are sole practitioners who are on the roll of barristers held by the Bar Council of Britain but all barristers must undertake a pupillage and that is always done in chambers.  I would like to see amendments to the Bill address the conditions that the Bar Council will be able to lay down to issue a practising certificate.  For the first time in Irish law it will become unlawful for a barrister to practise without a practising certificate.  We must consider the charges the Bar Council will be allowed to levy the practising barristers in Cork and the south west who are not members of the Law Library.  Will they suddenly have to pay for the Law Library through the back door?  Such a charge would defeat the purpose of the Bill.</p><p> This is an important issue.  This is dealt with in section 51 of the UK Legal Services Act 2007 which provides that the payment of a fee which is a prerequisite to obtaining a practising certificate shall have to be approved by the regulatory body.  That section sets out the permitted purposes for which the practising fee may be diverted towards and purposes for which the fee cannot be diverted towards.  The fee can be diverted towards the promotion of the rule of law, human rights, interaction on behalf of the body and education.  I have no doubt that some barristers will work in-house for banks, others will be sole practitioners and some will set up chambers.  Some will frown on it.  Some will say the Law Library is a bastion that must not change and that the profession must remain fossilised as it was in 1922, but there are others who will set up chambers.  What is important is that all barristers contribute to the development of the profession and ensuring that there is equality of access to the profession and that one does not have a situation where 120 to 150 barristers come out of the King's Inns and only 30 of them get a pupillage.  If one keeps the numbers very low, there are anti-competitive issues but there must be a degree of control over the practising fee and the purposes to which the practising fee can be diverted.  We must ensure one of the purposes is to maintain access to the Bar and a training mechanism for the graduates of the King's Inns.</p></speech>

The Deputy has raised an issue that is a little bit previous as this is dealt with in Part 8 and we will deal with it when we come to that Part.  I do not want to go into the issue at this point in any great detail but consideration has been given to some of the issues he has raised.  I will be tabling an amendment to deal with the levy that will arise in respect of practising barristers who are not members of the Law Library on the basis of that levy being paid to the legal services regulatory authority.  The legal services regulatory authority will maintain the roll of barristers who are not members of the Law Library.  There will be effectively a roll of barristers who are not members of the Law Library, which I understand does not exist at present.</p><p>  The Deputy has raised an interesting issue with regard to members of the Bar who do not utilise the facilities of the Law Library and if they are practising barristers, presumably they have other expenditure on office outgoings and accessing legal journals or court judgments.  We may need to give additional thought to that aspect but some of the issues the Deputy has raised will be dealt with when we come to Part 8 and circulate the next list of amendments.  We will have an opportunity to further tease out those aspects of the matter.  As I said earlier we will then have the opportunity on Report Stage to address issues that do not prove possible to address between now and the next Committee Stage debate.</p></speech>

That is not the way it works.  Clearly there will be a start-up year and the State will have to deal with the cost of the start-up year.  It is envisaged that the sums payable by the professions will be retrospective to a degree.  I want to have another look at the modalities of the start up year and how the funding will work.  I think there is a need for a transitional arrangement.  Expenditure will be incurred and will be allocated in the manner prescribed in the Bill.  The moneys that go back to the State will be to reimburse the State for expenditure the State has had to incur in relation to the functioning of the legal services regulatory authority and the Disciplinary Tribunal.  There are issues of a transitional nature that we will be coming back to.</p></speech>

We note there has been a real lack of public debate on this matter.  While there has been much debate at this committee and its predecessors, there has been a lack of public debate outside of this forum on national or urban public service transport provision among the public, communities and local elected representatives.  While the NTA has gone through the normal consultation process on this proposal, it has been very narrow and its consequences have not been fully thought through, the implications of which are potentially grave.  We are pleased the NTA came to the decision that, based on economic interests, it made complete sense to continue with the direct award model, giving Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus 90% of contracts for another five years.  However, we do not understand why 10% would be tendered out beyond the direct award model.  It does not seem to make any economic sense or logic.</p> <p>We believe the process is flawed.  Essentially, the NTA, with the support of the Government, seems to be looking at what is potentially a very dangerous experiment which could have much wider consequences.  Our concern is that this initial 10% offering could be the thin end of the wedge.  </p><p> There are a number of areas where the NTA's stated objectives have not been fulfilled by the decision it took in December 2013.  The first area is that of value for money for the Exchequer, something that is of importance to all of us - the committee as elected representatives of the people and the likes of us as a trade union that represents up to 2,000 people and the largest civic society organisation in the country.  We believe the NTA's decision mixes up and conflicts cheapness with value for money.  There are a number of criteria we look at.  The Deloitte report, which was discussed in this and other forums in 2009, looked at the efficiency and cost of Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus to the Exchequer.  It came to the clear conclusion that the subvention and PSO obligation offering received by Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann is low in comparison with many European counterparts.  That was in 2009.  Since 2009, year on year, we have seen the subvention being cut for each of the three CIE companies.  We estimate that the subvention for Dublin Bus has been cut by in excess of &euro;20 million over that period.  There is no magic formula as to why the decision to cut the subvention has come about.  There is no criterion or formula laid down that deals with the subvention.  If it was value for money in 2009 and we have had five years of cuts, it is certainly value for money for the Exchequer in 2014.  There is another cut this year.</p><p> It should be noted that while the two bus companies have been dealing with the recession like all entities, falling passenger numbers during that period which obviously affected revenue and the reduction in the subvention, they have restructured on two occasions.  The staff in both companies represented by us and other unions have done not just one restructuring agreement but two.  The first one in 2009 was very comprehensive and saved &euro;34 million in Dublin Bus.  The second one was in 2013.  It was well documented that there were two disputes in both companies.  Very difficult and comprehensive negotiations took place.  Workers who felt that they had already given were being asked to give more.  Given that workers came to the conclusion that they were prepared to make personal and financial sacrifices for a second time in four years to support the viability of their company, the timing of this NTA decision is seriously problematic.  People have tightened their belts and made sacrifices and now they have been told that 10% of the routes they operate might go out to tender.  </p><p> Keeping it very simple, if one looks at what is required to operate an urban and national bus system, one sees that there are a couple of entities involved in costs such as fleets, fuel and logistics that are fairly static and the same all around regardless of whether it is public or private.  The significant variable where there is potentially a huge difference is labour costs.  Our concern is that the logic seems to be that we will outsource 10% on this occasion to the private sector as a guinea pig and save money.  This is a black and white view of the world that private will be cheaper than public and that it is the way to go at all costs.  </p><p> Our concern is that what could be hit are labour costs.  We make no apologies.  We have two interests here.  We represent our members and want to advocate and protect their terms and conditions of employment but we also have a dual interest in trying to protect what we believe is an important element of core public transport for the travelling public for its social and economic dividends.  There is an issue of the transfer of undertakings legislation that has been referenced in many documents relevant to this.  The EU directive led to the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008 talks about the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment), TUPE, Regulations 2006.  Ernst &amp;amp; Young was asked to put together technical documents as part of the consultation talk about the TUPE issue.  Clearly, the NTA document where it decided on this course of action in December 2013 made it clear that transfer of undertakings would apply.  What that effectively means is that if Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann are not successful in tendering with other competitors for the 10% of routes and operator A or B gets them, the workers affected in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann would transfer under their terms and conditions of employment, excluding pensions.  Pensions are regrettably not covered under the legislation.</p><p> If one takes that to its logical conclusion and if the incoming operators who also inherit collective bargaining, collective agreements and the two unions were to honour the letter of the law, the rates of pay should be protected so there is no saving on labour costs.  Even the Ernst &amp;amp; Young document makes it very clear that in the short term, there is very little potential in savings by taking this course of action.  What are the savings?  Where is this extra value for money?  When the Ernst &amp;amp; Young document talks about the economic analysis, it makes it very clear that public transport is a spur for economic activity and very important for social and economic ends.  We appreciate that there is a finite amount of resources.  Our argument would be that in a time of economic retrenchment and crisis, the Government and the political elite should be looking at subventions going up rather than down as a spur and boost to public transport and to build confidence into this system.  </p><p> The second area that the NTA is making clear is a fundamental objective is compliance with contracts.  I am sure it is something we would all agree with.  Contractors must comply with the regulator's requirements.  It is a key objective.  One could understand if the two incumbents were reckless or were not hitting or exceeding their targets, some might suggest this is the road to consider.  Even a cursory look at the data that is out there, which is NTA rather than Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus data, shows that on nearly all indicators, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann hit and exceed targets.  The target percentages are usually between 95% and 98%.  Here you have two operators that are hitting and exceeding their targets notwithstanding the challenges they and their staff have been through.  </p><p> A third area of importance is that of improved customer experience.  The committee will be aware that with the co-operation of their staff, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann have done quite a lot in conjunction with the regulator to try to improve the customer experience be it real-time passenger information, the development of IT with apps, the journey planner, working on the Leap card process or making sure that 100% of the buses are fully accessible.  I note the National Disability Authority highlights that in its performance for Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann and raises concerns and questions as to whether that would be the case if private operators came into the market as is potentially intended.  In the Behaviour &amp;amp; Attitudes studies, it seems to be coming through that the customer experience for both entities has improved as well.  </p><p> I know people will say that we are not adopting the British model as it is 10% but we see this potentially evolving where it is 10% for five years and potentially 20% and 30% subsequently.  If one looks at the British experience of deregulation, one can see that there has been a drop in usage, confidence and satisfaction for customers when it comes to their overall experience.  There are problems in Newcastle where there is a row between the private operators and the incumbents over ticketing and integration.  In places like Sheffield, there has been a 40% drop in usage while there has been a 30% drop in usage in places like Manchester.  Consumer confidence has not given its seal of approval in Great Britain and we need to learn from the mistakes of our nearest neighbour and act accordingly.</p></speech>

My last point is the real red herring.  We are told by everybody that we must do this to comply with the EU directive and the Dublin Transport Authority Act 2008.  It is quite clear that we do not have to do it.  There is an economic interest argument which it seems the NTA was 90% persuaded by.</p> <p>This allows them to continue with the direct award model.  Our view is that they should do that.  We are, hopefully, getting out of the economic crisis and all of the stakeholders should consider this over the coming five years.  We need a wider and more comprehensive debate, which should include those who use the service, about what kind of public transport system we want.  We should revert to the direct award model.</p></speech>

The NBRU represents more than 2,500 staff in both bus companies.  This responsibility is not borne lightly and we deem it to be our duty to convey to the decision-makers the folly of pursuing an ideologically based agenda to the detriment of staff and public alike.  This committee is in a position to influence the decision-makers with regard to this ill-thought out move to privatise public transport provision.  It is only six short months since staff at both companies suffered significant reductions in take-home pay, which was the second time in three years that our members suffered a reduction to their terms and conditions.  Those cuts came as a direct result of the Government decision to reduce subvention to both companies.</p><p>  I would like to set out a number of areas where we in the NBRU feel this initiative is fraught with major difficulties.  The number of direct job losses involved is akin to closing a factory employing more than 430 people.  Dublin Bus directly employs in excess of 340 people on the routes targeted for privatisation and Bus &Eacute;ireann employs approximately 90 staff on the affected services.  If a factory of this size were to close anywhere in the country, there would be an outcry by all and sundry, quickly followed by the establishment of a task force.</p><p>  I am aware the committee has received presentations from the National Transport Authority and the representative body from the private coach sector, the CTTC.  The representative from the CTTC was unambiguous in his assessment of the future employability of displaced Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann staff.  His contention was that a transfer of undertakings would not apply.  It is, perhaps, an indication of the thought process with regard to how staff will be treated by the private coach industry.  The same representative also said that if tendering were introduced, it would inevitably lead to job losses among bus staff because private operators would not employ the same number of staff and if they did, they would be on lower wages.</p><p>  The insertion of social clauses in public procurement contracts is becoming an increasing feature across the EU.  They vary from a minimum employment standard to a model which incorporates the industry norm as the benchmark.  Furthermore, transfers of undertakings do not confer any entitlements in relation to occupational pensions.  All staff employed by the companies are members of the CIE pension schemes.  It is also important that the committee should understand that a number of the affected employees hold letters of comfort relating back to the break-up of CIE and the establishment of three separate companies under the umbrella of the holding company.  Those letters of comfort effectively bestow the right of the holder to redeployment back to CIE.  Another issue for concern would be the ability of both companies to remain economically viable and competitive should they be compelled to sustain the employment of surplus staff.</p><p>  I note that the composition of the committee is diverse in terms of the geographical spread of representation.  This observation is advanced as recognition that all politics is local and any impact on a social service inevitably draws the ire of those constituents directly affected by removal or a diminution of their service.  Recent campaigns in Elphin, Dromod, Rooskey, Abbeyleix, Durrow, Johnstown and Urlingford in north Kilkenny are reflective of how people will mobilise in such circumstances.  Committee members will be aware that these areas were deprived of a service because Bus &Eacute;ireann felt it had to withdraw from those towns to compete with competitors that were awarded commercial licences along the new motorway network.  The irony is that the NTA has had to award PSO contracts to operators to provide a social service through the towns between Portlaoise and Cashel which had previously been served by Bus &Eacute;ireann on a cost-neutral basis.  It does not take a stretch of the imagination to envisage a scenario where Bus &Eacute;ireann, under financial duress, replicates such decisions throughout the network.  This will inevitably lead to a plethora of PSO contracts being awarded at considerable cost to the taxpayer.</p><p>  Fragmenting the network of both companies on an ideological whim is surely no basis for formulating a public transport policy.  The taxpayer is entitled to transparency with regard to what benefits are to be derived from such an approach.  It took a number of generations to build those networks, and to dispense with the parish, village, town and community based relationships which are almost exclusive to public service provision would be yet another attack on the social fabric of this country.  The NBRU has consistently advocated a return to the position of 2005 and 2006, when discussions took place around the future involvement of private operators in public bus transport.  Those discussions were centred on the premise that the existing activities of Dublin Bus - extended to Bus &Eacute;ireann - would continue.  All new routes would subsequently be open for tender to all operators, including both bus companies.  Such a model would be multi-purpose.  It would protect the existing PSO service for public transport users, reduce the financial impact on the Exchequer and maintain sustainable employment within both bus companies.  We also sought and were given assurances during these discussions that the impending legislation, then the Dublin Transport Authority Bill 2008, would enable Dublin Bus to retain is current activities.  We firmly believe that a direct award by a competent authority, in this case the NTA, to Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann in relation to their current activities is entirely compatible with EU Regulation 1370(2007).  I again thank the committee for affording us the opportunity to address it with regard to the concerns of our members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1907" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="11:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014011500005#H00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations and share their concerns.  Notwithstanding that the previous Government established the NTA and began the implementation of the EU directive, I have always been an advocate of the direct award model.  Based on the advice I have received, I believe it meets the spirit of the EU directive while at the same time protecting the important integrated network that has been established by the bus and rail companies over many generations.  It is right and fitting we protect this network to the greatest extent possible.</p><p>  I have some concern about the notion that it may be economically advantageous to introduce competition.  I am not against competition but I am concerned about the economies of scale.  The bus companies operate well at their current size and scale, which allow them to achieve a reduced cost base.  If we allow a number of bus companies to compete with each other, they will not be able to spread the costs over the entire network, with the result that costs could ultimately rise.  As Mr. Reidy rightly pointed out, the transfer of undertakings legislation puts a strong encumbrance on other companies to take up the slack that would arise for the State companies if there is a change in the way contracts are awarded.  He rightly identified the issue of pensions.  How confident is he that other terms and conditions of employment will have to be preserved by any new entity?</p><p>  SIPTU is an affiliated member of the Labour Party, or at least it has close links with it.  I understand SIPTU's president sits on the national executive of the Labour Party.  Is Mr. Reidy disappointed that the Labour Party in Government is opening the door to privatisation of our bus network with the decision to allow the NTA to proceed with this partial privatisation of the routes?</p><p>  Mr. O'Leary correctly identified the issues that face Bus &Eacute;ireann in particular on the rural network.  For far too long, the NTA has taken a hands-off approach which has disenfranchised many of the rural villages and towns that depended on the bus network.  It has provided licences to independent operators to allow them to compete with Bus &Eacute;ireann, thereby eliminating the latter's capacity to provide the services it delivered over many generations.  Rural and minor towns are effectively being bypassed.</p> <p>An integrated public bus network is a vital component of our rural life, not just to service local needs but as an integral part of our tourism offering.  I am familiar with County Clare, where I come from, and I see how the bus network takes people from many parts of the country to places such as Doolin, Lahinch and Kilkee as part of their travels as tourists.  A diminution of that would impact negatively on the way we are seen internationally and I hope that does not happen.  I thank the witnesses for their helpful and thoughtful presentation, which I hope will help us in our communications with the NTA.</p></speech>

Experience has shown that.  In the Waterford area, for example, a decision has been taken to tender out all the routes.  Bus &Eacute;ireann employees in Waterford will not want to move.  We met the Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and he said he did not want people to be moved forcibly.  If people do not want to move, does that mean Bus &Eacute;ireann must carry extra staff?  Does it pay a severance?  Where will it get the money for that?  None of these questions has been thought through.</p><p>  I have read the Labour Party and Fine Gael manifestos.  The Fine Gael manifesto in this area is to privatise the lot.  Some 10% is up for grabs.  I want the situation to be different, but I must respect the fact that 60% of citizens vote for centre-right parties who are interested in deregulation and the points Deputy Dooley has made, which he says Fianna F&aacute;il is not interested in.  That is interesting.  If people voted for a left-led government or for the parties of the left to be in government, I doubt we would be in this situation.  That is not the way it is.  There is still an opportunity for the regulator and the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport to examine this more carefully, commit to the direct award model for another five years and allow much more comprehensive and public debate among the users of public transport as well as those who work in the companies and deliver the service.</p></speech>

As Mr. Reidy said, people chose to vote as they did.  No matter what party a person represents, people have mobilised already and have used the offices of various Deputies across the political spectrum to voice their disapproval of Bus &Eacute;ireann's willy-nilly decisions, based on the NTA awarding licences.  There was no plan.  Mr. Reidy and I are at one regarding this.  There was a rush to satisfy some lobby group by privatising 10%.  The CEO of the NTA was before the committee in October 2012 and under questioning from the Deputies admitted that as little as 5% savings could be derived from this model and went on to say that this 5% could be subsumed or lost in administration costs.  I am back to the point I made at the outset, that this is an illogical decision by the main party in government.  It is ill-thought out and has no concern for either the staff or the public.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1911" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1021" speakername="Se&aacute;n Kenny" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014011500006#J00400"><p>I welcome Mr. Reidy from SIPTU and Mr. O'Leary from the NBRU.  I agree with what Mr. Reidy said about the need for a public debate on public transport and we have not had one.  Since I was elected to the D&aacute;il in 2011, this is the first meeting where we have had a serious debate around public transport, its role in the economy and its importance.  I agree that direct award is the better model.  We have seen the performance targets that have been set.  I am talking about Dublin Bus in particular, as that is the company with which I am more familiar.  Dublin Bus is hitting performance targets of 95% to 98%.  If something is working well, why change it?  If it is working, do not break it.  One would question the need to do that.  Deputy Dooley has suddenly left, but it goes back to the 2009 legislation which established the NTA.  Under that legislation the NTA proposes to put out for tender 10% of the routes.  In theory the bus companies can tender for that, although I do not know how that works in practice.  As has been pointed out, there is a body of opinion, which neither Mr. Reidy nor I share, that more than 10% should go out to tender.  We must recognise the political reality.</p><p>  I agree with Mr. Reidy's idea for a public debate and would like to hear his views on how we could continue that.  He made a point on the possible effects of putting the routes out to tender and whether the new operators would provide the same level of service to the travelling public.  He mentioned wheelchair accessibility and that is a key point.  When the Minister was present at a meeting of this committee, I raised the fact that the Aircoach services to Dublin Airport, a subsidiary of First Group, does not provide wheelchair services.  The Minister and Department have asked Aircoach a number of times to do that.  If Aircoach can get away with it, other operators might do the same.  It is all about the fact that a wheelchair space takes up the space of three able passengers, so economics are at play.  People who have asked Aircoach if it could take a wheelchair passenger were told to go to Dublin Bus, that it would carry them.  We need a level playing field.  Clearly there is not a level playing field regarding services to the public in that area.  It will be 2015 before the tendering process is completed and 2016 before the new operators come into play, so we have some time to monitor that carefully and watch how it develops.  I would be interested in the witnesses' views on how we should all approach that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1912" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Willie Noone" time="11:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014011500006#J00500"><p>I welcome the Deputy's view that the direct award model should be used.  The level playing field is the nub of the problem we face.  I represent workers in the private bus companies as well and we should not forget that fact.  When a contract goes out to tender, the incumbent companies have pension liabilities to their employees.  Everything being equal, they cannot compete, because the prices of buses, fuel, etc. should be the same.  They are not starting at the same place.  We are concerned that the NTA is taking a dangerous gamble because, as Deputy Dooley alluded to, economies of scale come into play.</p> <p>The big private bus companies will have the propensity to get the majority of these routes as time goes forward.  That will rule out smaller bus companies competing and we could end up in the future with a monopoly of private bus companies.  All evidence to date shows that when that happens, standards, customer service and usage fall.  That is where we are.</p><p> The Deputy's final comment referred to a better approach.  Our view is more time needs to be given to this, more debate needs to be had and more consultation should take place because this gamble is taking place at the expense of the taxpayer, the consumer and our members and workers.  If contracts are changed on a regular and ongoing basis, and even the NTA says in its own proposal that if Bus &Eacute;ireann does not get a number of these contracts, voluntary severance and TUPE will have to apply, both of which will end job security for workers and reduce driver standards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1914" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bill McCamley" time="12:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014011500007#K00200"><p>The big problem with this is that we have never, as a State or as a parliamentary system, got down to discussing what a national transport plan should be.  It has always been <i>ad hoc</i>.  Reference has been made to ideological ailments in the context of the current proposals but we must remember that CIE was established for pragmatic reasons.  Trade union colleagues and I prefer to look at this from a purely pragmatic point of view.  Although I could present a social democratic view, I prefer a pragmatic one.<br />Deputy Kenny is correct that there could have been more if Fine Gael had been in a right-wing coalition, but we are where we are.  What has not been addressed is that there is no business plan to justify what is being done.  We cannot say that the taxpayer and the State will benefit from it and we cannot say how this will affect national strategic aims regarding the regions, inter-urban travel and rural isolation because there are unintended consequences to these proposals which have not been considered.<br />Until now, the commercial services of Bus &Eacute;ireann subvented the public service obligation services because they were under-funded.  The way licences were distributed in recent years affected the company's bottom line.  It has been reduced to pulling out of villages and hamlets as a consequence, and this will occur again because nobody knows what will happen once elements and components of the network are removed.  When we talk about public transport provision, we forget two factors.  Anybody can make money on a bus service from A to B if he or she has the right corridor.  The other factor is much more sophisticated and socially desirable, which is a network.  Bus &Eacute;ireann provides a national, integrated network.  If one starts taking out bits and pieces, one does not know where that will end.  That could have an effect because of the economies of scale being attacked.  Services may have to be taken out which were never intended to be removed.<br />I am conscious the Deputy is from Dublin.  Nobody is making allowance for the fact that the Dublin Bus may have its own particular problems relating to TUPE, pensions and the letter of comfort, which is there as a consequence of the Transport Act 1986.  Leaving that aside, it would be unfair if the changes in the Dublin area were not financially neutral in regard to Dublin Bus.  The company should have the right and should be given every opportunity to expand its services.  It has retrenched because of the recession but it needs to be able to provide capacity for its customers going into the future.  We are not sure about that.<br />What has been forgotten regarding Bus &Eacute;ireann is that once one removes the economies of scale, administration and so on, the social dividend the company has provided in isolated villages and so on will also go and the State will have to pick that up.  We have to be able to compete on a level playing ground for commercial services on Expressway routes with the private operators.  When we do that, areas will be left out, which will then become subject to PSOs in their own right.  Once again, the State will pick them up.  These are hidden costs that are never discussed.  There is no like-for-like judgment and the cost of tendering, administering and monitoring the tendering process  is never quantified.  Nothing is said about the areas that will be left behind or about the overall policy of integration, sustainability of services and so on.  All that is forgotten in the rush to fulfil a simple ideological aim.</p></speech>

From the trade union side, we favour a return to the situation where we were in discussions to facilitate the entry of private operators into the market.  Unfortunately, time has long since passed.  A decision is a decision.  Evidence from some European countries is that the initial tender is competitive and, of course, it would be.  My colleague, Mr. Noone, referred to the simple fact that a pension liability attaches to both Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann, which does not attach to a private company bidding or tendering for routes.  Inevitably, the cost increases in the second and subsequent tenders for bus routes across Europe.</p></speech>

It will work out at a 20% loss of jobs in the Waterford depot if we do not win the contract, for which we are allowed to tender.  As sure as night follows day, the lowest tender will get the contract.  That applies in almost every walk of life.  When the city services are awarded and we lose that number of employees, we will be left with the commercial Expressway service, with which we have no problem.  There are two other bus companies, which have been there for years, competing on the city services, which is no problem at all.  Competition is also not a problem on the Expressway route but we do not have a level playing field.  I am sure it has come to the attention of Deputies, Senators and councillors that lately private companies have not been accepting free bus passes on non-stop bus services, some of which go to airports and bypass small towns.  I have met the companies myself.  I go on Eirebus and the other company is not taking bus passes.</p></speech>

While, as I have said, I have no problem with competition, it will impact on our Expressway services.  We have no problem at all carrying passengers, including disabled passengers, and one does not need to have a wheelchair to be disabled.  We are very courteous in bringing passengers around the country and have done so for years.  However, passengers can now get on the bus in Cork with cash and get off in Dublin Airport.  They cannot get on the private bus with a bus pass.  That should have been highlighted by the transport committee years ago.</p></speech>

I apologise for the absence of my party colleague, Deputy Ellis, who had to attend another meeting.  I normally cover communications, energy and natural resources issues, but am covering transport for Deputy Ellis today.<br />I am totally confused and I do not believe it is just because I do not normally deal with transport.  I do not know why we are having this discussion today, as it should have been held two years ago.  Our discussion at this stage should be with the Minister and not with the unions.  I do not have any questions for the unions.  I agree with practically everything the witnesses have said.  I do not know why the Minister made this decision.  Is it to comply with an EU directive?  Why is it 10%?  Will it stay at 10%?  No, it will not because if one stands still one will die so that 10% will have to grow.  Are we looking at the beginning of the total privatisation of public transport services?  Why pick these routes?  What did the people down in Waterford do to the Minister, Deputy Varadkar?  They must have done something very bad to him.<br />What will be the impact on Bus &Eacute;ireann and the public transport network?  What will be the impact on the income of the existing public services?  Are all employees of private bus operators unionised?  I very much doubt they are.  Somebody mentioned the Dromod and Roosky bypass.  I do not believe the Minister, the Department, the NTA or even the union head offices are too concerned about people living in Dromod or Roosky, but I know who they are.  I know the Maggie Anns of this world who used always to travel that route.  However, now because the Bus &Eacute;ireann bus has to compete with a private bus service, the Bus &Eacute;ireann bus no longer goes through these two villages and instead goes on the bypass, thus reducing the number of people on the bus and making it a faster although not more efficient service.<br />Mr. McCamley put his finger on it.  I believe the reason I am confused is that there is no national strategy.  In the absence of strategy we have an <i>ad hoc</i>situation.  This bears all the hallmarks of an <i>ad hoc</i>decision.  My primary question is to the committee.  Is there any way to put this on ice and encourage the Minister to come up with a coherent strategy and set of policies regarding transport?<br />I have a question for the union representatives.  Has this tendering process started anywhere yet?  Will the tendering process require the tendering companies' staff to be unionised and paid an acceptable wage?</p></speech>

Regarding the contracts insisting on employees taking over the employment conditions, that is not the case.  TUPE is supposed to apply.  We believe it applies.  It is now in documentation that it will apply.  We have members in some private companies.  Those companies have said publicly they do not want to employ these people because of the concerns and problems they would bring with them because they would invariably be on better conditions than the employees the companies currently have so they do not want those employees.  Our members in Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann have indicated to us that they have no intention to transfer into a private bus company.</p></speech>

Those of us in this trade union's head office do care and we have a concern.  As I said in my opening remarks, the people I represent have built up relationships over many years servicing those little towns and villages.  The concerns initially come from our members and then the public mobilise to contact their elected representatives.  We do care as shown by how our members react to such situations.</p></speech>

Their contribution has been very helpful and informative.  We accept the case put forward by both unions.  There has been much mention of politics and ideologies.  We represent people, the community, the taxpayer and the citizen, and we have an obligation to them.  Regardless of whether we represent rural or urban constituencies, we must ensure our policies provide for the most efficient and best value for money service for the citizen, consumer and taxpayer.  The one thing worse than a public monopoly is a private monopoly and both should be avoided.</p><p>  It is clear from the presentations that there are many constants.  There are standards through the regulatory NTA process that will be constant both to Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, and to private operators.  They will have to comply with the contracts.  The differences come down to the pensions of the employees if they are going to transfer or wish to transfer from either Dublin Bus or Bus &Eacute;ireann.  They can remain with Bus &Eacute;ireann or Dublin Bus if they so wish.  There are implications to what I would call letters of comfort.  I know they are difficult to deal with.  The witnesses mentioned level playing fields in a narrow sense.  In a broader sense we do not have a level playing field and these letters of comfort and such issues make it very complicated.</p><p>  It was mentioned that some elements of Bus &Eacute;ireann were subventing PSO routes in other areas.  That could be broadened out to cover the implication of the school transport service subventing some other public transport services.  In this debate we should tease out those issues much further.  What is the taxpayer ultimately paying for?  Mr. McCamley mentioned the ultimate objective of developing not just bus routes but a transport network, and we take the point.  That is a very legitimate argument that we rarely go into.  In the years I have been on this committee, we have not discussed it.  That debate should be opened.  In that context I very much welcome the unions' submissions to the committee.  Those genuinely held views should be accepted.</p></speech>

At present, I am dealing with a very difficult school transport issue and I would love to see much more debate take place.  In his submission Mr. Reidy stated we certainly need a national debate on how transport is delivered and the issues which have been raised at the meeting are valid.  We need public debate and the communities must have a say.  They deserve to be listened to because they are the people who use the service.  With regard to Mr. McCamley's contribution, I was involved in the campaigns along Abbeyleix, Durrow, Johnstown and Urlingford and eventually a public service order must be introduced to make it attractive.  As Mr. McCamley stated, the State must pick it up anyway.  All of the concerns which have been raised are valid.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1931" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1157" speakername="Sean Barrett" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014011500009#M00400"><p>With regard to Deputy Harrington's point, according to the annual accounts of Dublin Bus last year it received &euro;69 million through public service obligation, PSO, services, &euro;13 million in capital grants and &euro;5.3 million in emergency funds.  It received &euro;107 million to carry 115 million passengers.  Of course the Minister had to question this.  Over a five year period Bus &Eacute;ireann received &euro;292 million in subventions and capital grants and the number of passengers decreased by 51 million.  At present, 58 buses a day go between Dublin and Galway but there was only one bus a day when there was a monopoly.  This proves the benefit of competition and we now have 57 or 58 more drivers.  Young people in particular travel in this way.  Such routes are also developing from Dublin to Belfast, Cork and Wexford.  Mr. Matthews commutes from Dundalk to Dublin.  Given that the Minister was faced with more and more public money being spent, with vast amounts of it not accounted for, I am amazed he stopped at 90% being given to the people here today.  The market is going elsewhere and the services are good.</p><p>  When they came before a committee yesterday, representatives of Irish Water stated every contract worth more than &euro;400,000 must be open to competitive tendering.  I am glad they did not have a direct award contract or they would have given the entire &euro;85 million in an unaccountable way.  We must have competitive tendering.  We must examine what is happening in transport.  Some of what I heard was like what Aer Lingus used to argue against competition.  It held back the country for years.  To put out 10% of the routes in five years will mean it will be 50 years before we have a competitive bus service.  This is what is holding it back as far as I concerned.  The Competition Authority has questioned this and it is not obvious on the NTA website how it selected the routes.  Why were the commuter routes west of Dublin substituted?  No information was available to potential tenderers about the expected levels of subsidy on the routes.  I do not believe what the Minister has done is competitive enough.</p></speech>

In fairness, he has been very consistent over many years in his attacks on public transport workers.  I have long given up apologising for representing working people.  They provide a service.  Listening to the likes of Senator Barrett, one would think these people do not pay any taxes.  Our members are PAYE workers.  They draw a pension of &euro;130, &euro;120 or &euro;115 after 40 or 45 years' service.  We are pragmatic and not one-dimensional like some people.  We are not afraid of competition.  We want a national debate and a plan put in place.  We want recognition of people's service and the network which has been built up over many years.  I expect nothing else from the Competition Authority, which has a monopoly on views on competition and if that is not a contradiction, I do not know what is.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-15a.1933" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Murphy" time="12:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014011500009#M00600"><p>I wish to respond to several issues raised by Senator Barrett.  He listed the subvention and capital investment in CIE companies in recent years.  He did not mention that, excluding the cost-saving measures implemented in 2013 in Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus, &euro;170 million has been taken out of the three companies in efficiencies over the past ten years.  Of this more than &euro;65 million has come out of Dublin Bus.  Government-commissioned reports by experts and consultants, which is not a great word at present, have been glowing but various Governments have ignored them.  They show Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann are efficient and work in the right way.  There is a need for open debate.  I attended the NTA's workshop consultation two years ago with some of my colleagues.  Some of the comments from vested interests were scary.  They stated the Ryanair model should be used with competition on profitable routes and that we should ignore the public service.  This is a public service.  It is not a profit-making organisation.  The companies are not allowed to make profit at present as if they even look like they are making profits, the subvention is cut.  We will have private monopolies on profit-making routes.  There are only two ways to fund a public service, which are either through public money subvention or passenger fares.  If the subvention is reduced, it will automatically increase the fares.  This message needs to go out to the people dependent on the service not only for going to work, but for social welfare needs, hospitals and disability.  It should be part of the debate.</p></speech>

Fares increase but a profit is never made by any CIE company.  We believe if it got to that stage, the subvention would be cut.  I was involved in the process which removed more than &euro;11 million from Dublin Bus in the past year just to try to break even.  There will be projected subvention payments and contractual obligations.  The company keeps coming back, stating its hands are tied because the subvention has been cut and it needs efficiencies and cost savings.  This is then done by the workforce.  We will not make an apology here; we try to protect the terms and conditions.</p></speech>

He should represent workers' rights and should not apologise.  If it looks like the company will achieve an element of profitability the threat is the subvention will be cut.</p></speech>

On its own website, the National Transport Authority, NTA, states that it cut &euro;2 million off the subvention to Bus &Eacute;ireann specifically because the latter had made &euro;2 million extra in profits the previous year.  That is as clear as evidence can get.</p></speech>

Senator Barrett's comments implied that we had a problem with private operators.  He referred to the money given to Bus &Eacute;ireann, but he did not mention that &euro;110 million per year of that goes to private contractors.  In terms of the school bus service, the ratio between private contractors and direct labour is 80:20.  It is easy to make a profit on a straight line, but we should be in this for some other purpose than simply getting from A to B and privatising whatever profits are made on a line.</p><p>  Regarding Mr. Murphy's comments, Bus &Eacute;ireann has done everything it can to take the cuts applied by the State while still providing the State with value for money.  This is despite the fact that, the tendering issue aside for a moment, the licences being distributed on corridors where commercial expressway services operate are breaking the guidelines.  Most recently, J. J. Kavanagh &amp;amp; Sons has been operating outside the guidelines ten minutes ahead of the Bus &Eacute;ireann service.  This is not fair.  We are seeking a level playing field.  If we are to compete, let us do so on the same basis as private operators.  The last licence distributed, which was in Ennis, is costing Bus &Eacute;ireann &euro;200,000.  Every time we scramble to get back to the break-even point, the services that we are trying to develop to provide a social dividend to areas outside the main corridors are pulled away from us.  We must ask whether this is a deliberate policy by elements in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport or the NTA to reduce Bus &Eacute;ireann to a rump bus company.  This issue must be closely examined.</p></speech>
