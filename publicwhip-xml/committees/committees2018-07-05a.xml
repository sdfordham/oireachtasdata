He is joined by Ruth Foley, deputy director of audit.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Pat Deering.  We are dealing with the Department of Health and the HSE under the Department of Health appropriation accounts, Vote 38 for 2016 and the HSE financial statements 2017.  However, the committee decided to provide up to one hour at the beginning of the meeting to deal specifically with the cervical cancer crisis issue.  We will proceed with our examination of the financial statements after that.  We will take the routine business of the committee in the afternoon.</p><p>There are a number of items relevant to this morning's meeting in correspondence which I am putting on the record so they can be discussed in detail in public.  The first is Nos. 1452 A and 1457 providing briefing documentation for today&rsquo;s meeting  from the HSE.  We will note and publish that.</p><p><b></b>Correspondence No. 1453<b></b>from Mr. Connaghan is his opening statement for today&rsquo;s meeting.  We will note and publish it.  Correspondence Nos. 1458 and 1459<b></b>from Mr. Derek Finnegan of the Department of Health are providing briefing documents and a note on the Scally report.  We note and publish them.  Next is correspondence No. 1460<b></b>from Mr Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health, providing his opening statement.  It is noted and published.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1427<b></b>from Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Breen, director of the State Claims Agency, dated 25 June 2018, provides information on the management of legal costs and open disclosure as requested by the committee on 14 June 2018.  Mr. Breen's correspondence deals with the State Claims Agency management approach to CervicalCheck cancer misdiagnosis litigation; and details including the status of screening and non-screening cancer misdiagnosis claims for cervical cancer, bowel cancer and breast cancer.  We note and publish this.</p><p><b></b>Correspondence No. 1432<b></b>from Mr. Ray Mitchell of the HSE is in respect of Dr. Scally&rsquo;s access to CervicalCheck records.  It is noted and published.  Correspondence No. 1438 from Mr. Ray Mitchell, dated 29 June 2018, is in respect of the attendance of particular officials at today&rsquo;s meeting.  We have a relevant note on the screen.  We are not having a discussion; it is just by way of information.  It states in respect of the point about CervicalCheck attendees that at this point it is important to advise the committee that Charles O'Hanlon is on sick leave and certified unwell and, therefore, will not be in a position to attend the committee.</p><p>In respect of Dr. Gr&aacute;inne Flannelly, she is employed by Holles Street and indicated that she is no longer with the HSE.  Since our meeting last week we have written to Dr. Flannelly in her course of employment and she sent an email back to the committee, reference 1451, which we note and publish.  Dr. Flannelly was the clinical director of CervicalCheck.  In her email, she thanks the committee for the invitation to appear before it on a voluntary witness basis to address the issues regarding the CervicalCheck programme.  She states that she is at present preparing to meet with Dr. Scally as part of his investigation next week, and that she is currently in the UK where she has work commitments until the middle of next week.  That is now this week.  She goes on to state that she would value the opportunity to help our committee by attending as per our request on a voluntary basis but in view of the above she requests that this be rearranged to a different date.  She states that she will liaise with the clerk in respect of rescheduling it.</p><p>I want to put on record that while she is not here today, Dr. Flannelly has given a definite commitment that she is happy to meet with us at a more suitable time.  I think we will have to come back to that.  We will discuss the timing of our meetings as part of our work programme in the afternoon.  We will not set the time now.</p></speech>

One is on certified sick leave and the other will come on another date.</p><p>Correspondence No. 1439<b></b>provides follow up information from the HSE in respect of the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF.  Correspondence Nos. 1440 and 1441 are from an individual making inquiries about HSE circulars not circulated or implemented and HSE employees who did not make the criteria for the first round of the Haddington Road regularisation process.  All those items of correspondence are relevant to our discussion this morning, which is why I referenced them in advance.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.13" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>Mr. John Connaghan (Director General, Health Service Executive) and Mr. Jim Breslin (Secretary General, Department of Health)called and examined.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#C01000"><p>For this session we are joined by the HSE director general, Mr. John Connaghan; Dr. Peter McKenna, acting clinical director of CervicalCheck; Mr. Ray Mitchell; and from the Department of Health, we are joined by Mr Jim Breslin, Secretary General and Ms Tracey Conroy, assistant secretary, acute hospitals division.  I remind members, witness and those in the Public Gallery to switch off their mobile phones or put them into airplane mode as they interfere with the recording system when merely switched to silent.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provision under Standing Orders that they shall refrain from inquiring into the merits or policies of a Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives or such policies.</p><p>While we expect witnesses to answer questions put to them by the committee clearly and with candour, witnesses can and should expect to be treated fairly and with respect and considerations at all times in accordance with the witness protocol.  We are allocating up to one hour for this session so there will be five minute slots.  I think people will understand that the topic might come up again as part of the general discussion with the HSE over the course of the afternoon. </p><p>I will put one question to Mr. Connaghan before the clock starts for this hour.  He got a request from us for information but I do not see the response.  Perhaps he can point it out to me.  We asked specifically for a note in advance of today's meeting regarding the three CervicalCheck laboratories and who signed off on the forms when they were returned to the HSE.  We asked for details of whether the person or persons were administrative or medical staff with relevant medical qualifications and we asked for the HSE to provide a sample of such forms, redacted as appropriate, and to explain what sign-off process was involved.  Can Mr. Connaghan tell us those details? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#C01100"><p>I think we have sent in what the process is, including a flow chart, for the receipt and sign-off of samples that go to the collection point in Ireland and are then transmitted to the laboratories and what happens thereafter.  It might be better if I ask Dr. McKenna to take the committee through that.  The correspondence and flow chart that we gave the committee contain the answer to that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#C01200"><p>Time is tight and I am being generous, so the hour will only start after I have finished my bit, in fairness to the other members.  That flow chart, which is now up on the screen, does not answer the question.  It starts talking about the GP surgery and the whole way along, the forms going out and coming back.  All we want to know is when the laboratories that were contracted by the HSE to work for CervicalCheck sent results back to CervicalCheck and who signed off on them on behalf of CervicalCheck to confirm the HSE was happy with the work the contractors did.  Can Mr. Connaghan show me the spot where that is shown on the flow chart?</p><p>He understands my simple and straightforward question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00200"><p>Yes, I understand the question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00300"><p>We do not need to know of the process before that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00400"><p>There might be a simple misunderstanding here.  Once the samples are read and the reports are available, they are directly sent back by electronic means or by post to the doctor or clinician who requested them.  That is detailed on the flowchart.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter McKenna" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00500"><p>It is entirely possible that a smear could be taken and the report returned a medical practitioner having direct sight of it.  Smears are read by laboratory technicians and may be taken by a practice nurse.  If the reading is normal, the result is returned to the programme and the woman informed without any input from a medical practitioner.  That is the system which is in place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00600"><p>That is exactly my point.  For those who cannot see the chart, it details that women participating in cervical screening go to the general practitioner, GP, clinics and the laboratory has a collection system involving a pre-addressed envelope being sent to the laboratory for processing.  The laboratory reports are then sent to the GPs or clinics.  Are the witnesses saying that when the work comes back from the three laboratories, which are essentially contractors to the HSE, nobody in CervicalCheck looks at the results from a medical point of view?  Do I understand that correctly?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter McKenna" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00700"><p>If the results are normal, they would not, no.</p></speech>

Are the witnesses stating that smears went from a doctor to the laboratory and back and CervicalCheck had no medical involvement in the results?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter McKenna" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D00900"><p>If a result is normal, there might be no input from a medical practitioner between the taking of the smear and the result being filed.</p></speech>

Nobody in a public organisation for which a contractor is doing a job accepts that the work is done satisfactorily on the basis of the contractor sending back a report.  Rather, the results of the work are checked.  I am putting it as simply as I can.  The witnesses are stating that the contracted laboratories did the work but no check on that work was carried out by the HSE.</p></speech>

I do not wish to waste time.  The witnesses were asked a very specific question.  I am dealing solely with a question asked on the previous occasion the witnesses were before the committee and also submitted in writing.  The witnesses stated that it is possible that no medical staff may be involved in the process.  The committee asked for the sample of forms sent back to CervicalCheck by the laboratory rather than a summary report on the number of tests carried out.  Does CervicalCheck get a copy of results which are sent to doctors?  Is the laboratory report for each patient sent to CervicalCheck?  Does anybody in CervicalCheck review the forms sent back by the contracted laboratories from a medical point of view?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.31" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter McKenna" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D01500"><p>Almost certainly not.  Some 250,000 tests came into CervicalCheck, the majority of which are reported as normal.  As part of the quality assurance an agreed sample of, for example, one in 50 or 100 cases are sent to another laboratory, which would be sufficient.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.32" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D01600"><p>The patient results sent to CervicalCheck are not usually checked by a medical professional in the HSE, which writes the cheque for the work to be done on behalf of the individual  patients.  That is my understanding of the situation and it is part of the problem.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-07-05a.33" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://debatesarchive.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018070500002#D01700"><p>The Chair is correct.  However, there are accredited quality assurance checks in place on a quarterly basis which look at overall quality.  The Chair is correct in regard to individual cases but such cases are sent back to the doctor or practising clinician who requested the samples in the first place.</p></speech>

As of 9 o'clock this morning, how many women have been identified as having been affected?  That figure was at 209.</p> <p>  It has been reported that the independent review of the cases of 3,000 women will not be completed on schedule and is only commencing now.  What is the reason for that?  Why has it taken so long?  If there were 300,000 slides per year and it takes five minutes to review each, a team of ten people could carry out the analysis in a few weeks even if each slide is surveyed twice and the women's slide history examined.  Why was there a commitment to complete the review within a timeframe which has not been followed?  Why was information on the delay not made public?  Why is the review only starting now?  It will not be possible for it to form part of the Scally review, which must be completed by the end of August.  The Minister for Health, stated that the final Scally review must be completed by the end of August.  However, these 3,000 slides will not be part of it because of the delay.  Stephen Teap and Vicky Phelan, who gave evidence to the committee, are extremely disappointed and upset this morning that the review of the slides will not form part of the Scally review.  Why was the review committed to on the basis of an unrealistic timeframe?  When will it be completed?  How in the name of God can we have a situation where Dr. Scally must report by the end of August to ensure credibility but this review will not form part of his report because of the delay?  How will his review be complete without that information?  How in the name of God did we end up in this situation?  Who committed to those unrealistic timelines?</p> <p>  I have a third question which I had better ask before the Chair cuts me off.  It relates to the legal cases, of which I understand there is a significant number.  I remind the witnesses that the State Claims Agency, SCA, will appear before the committee next week.  As I understand it, the HSE hired a legal firm, the identity of which I know, to draft a protocol for how cytology slides are given to the women affected.  That protocol has been in use for several weeks.  Solicitors for several affected women have gone to court to seek the release of the slides and in such cases the HSE has handed them over without the protocol being followed.  These are urgent cases.  All present know what that means: the women are in difficult health situations.  Why is a protocol needed for the release of slides to which the women are entitled?  Why is it taking so long?  Why can the protocol be bypassed when a woman goes to court and takes on CervicalCheck and it or the SCA is so embarrassed that it hands over the slides?  Some 80 to 90 women have sought their files from CervicalCheck and some have received access thereto.</p><p>When it comes to getting their slides they are being blocked by a protocol, which I doubt anyone has heard of up to now.  Given what the Taoiseach and the Minister, Deputy Harris, said in the D&aacute;il and the evidence given to this committee and the Joint Committee on Health, of which I am also a member, why is this protocol necessary?  What is its purpose?  If it can be bypassed in urgent cases why can it not be bypassed in this instance and these slides given to the women and their solicitors immediately?  As I understand it, Quest Diagnostics is releasing the slides but Clinical Pathology Laboratories, CPL and MedLab Pathology Limited are in discussions in that regard in light of this protocol.  According to the laboratories, the HSE, through the SCA, and this legal protocol, is holding up the provision of information to which these women are entitled.  </p></speech>

It was never intended that the RCOG review would be completed in advance of the Scally review.

RCOG will review all of the diagnoses of cervical cancer since the programme was established in 2008, including the 1,482 cases that were notified to CervicalCheck since then and the further 1,630 registered by the National Cancer Registry which had not been notified to CervicalCheck.  The review will examine the women within this cohort who were screened by the programme, which is approximately 1,856 women from within the total but that is subject to final validation within the review.  The review will examine the cases of women who developed cancer and were screened by CervicalCheck.  All of their screening histories will be examined.  This involves reviewing all of the smears.  The panel will have an algorithm for examining the smears and it will identify the number of cases in which there are discordant results.  A report in each case will be provided to the women involved.  The panel has its own quality assurance system and it wants to work systematically so that it can stand over this process.  We have been engaging with RCOG on a daily basis since it agreed to come on board with this review.</p></speech>

As for where this might leave us when this sorry saga is eventually complete and when every woman gets the justice she deserves, I note 28 cases are potentially before the courts and 209 women were not informed of the results.  If it is the case that the HSE has accepted liability for not informing Ms Mhic Mhath&uacute;na of her incorrect smear test, as Dr. McKenna put it, does that admission of liability apply to all 209 women?  As for those women who are not before the courts, how will they be compensated by the HSE?  I am asking a straight question, that is, was the acceptance of liability only in the case of this individual or was it in respect of all the women?  In answering that question, I want Dr. McKenna to bear in mind that when Mr. Gleeson, who was one of those people with responsibility for overseeing the process of informing or not informing the women, appeared before this committee, he did not and still to this day does not accept any mistake was made but yet in court, the HSE accepted liability that a mistake was made.  There are two parts to my question.  First, does the admission of liability apply only to this individual or does it apply to all 209 women?  In the latter case, how will they be compensated given there is no class action opportunity in this State?  Second, given that the individual who was responsible for the failure does not accept there was any failure, how will Mr. Connaghan, as the director general, deal with that problem?</p></speech>

If that is the case, 209 women were not informed.  Is the HSE accepting liability that it was a mistake, in respect of all 209 women, that they were not informed?  If that is the case, how will they be compensated?  Notwithstanding the other 209 cases, which Dr. McKenna can address shortly, there was an acceptance of liability in this case.  The person with responsibility for this process in the HSE, however, is still to this day saying he does not accept any failure on his part, which means there was no failure on the part of the HSE.

What would often happen in mediation would be that the process itself would be confidential so people could try to reach an agreement and offer positions that would allow that to happen.  What can happen at the end of that, particularly where dependents are involved, is that the outcome would be registered in the court so the actual outcome would be a public outcome.  The State Claims Agency, which has claims delegated to it and handles all the mediation and court processes, will be able to work this through with the committee next week in full detail.</p></speech>

The confidentiality aspect of a plaintiff is really that the individual does not want his or her name out there but details of the settlement could be out there without divulging the person's identity.  That is the person's right.  It is not something the State would impose.  The principle of open disclosure requires us not to push confidentiality agreements.

What happened though was that 221 women did not benefit from that.  It was quite the opposite.  What I am trying to get here is that the system accepted the results of the smear tests coming from the labs and now there is a serious question over the quality assurance and the checking of that.  Is that right?  There has to be a serious question on quality control with 221 women affected and more going to come to light.  Am I using the wrong language?</p></speech>

We are talking about the women affected.  Despite everything Mr. Connaghan talked about and despite the quarterly reports, something has happened here that this has failed.  That was not picked up by CervicalCheck nor by the HSE.  It came to our attention as a result of Ms Vicky Phelan speaking out and more women then coming forward.  Is that not right?

The first is the service specification, the second is the preparation of tender documentation and the third part is, after tender, mobilisation.  Those are three things on the critical path.  I am not able at this stage to tell Deputy O'Brien the time elements of each of those.  There are some things in play which we are going to try to deploy to speed things up.  Regarding tendering, there is a possibility that we can go for a negotiated contract which would truncate the tendering process.  We are considering that right now.</p> <p>  We need to tidy up the service specification and the tender documentation needs high level clinical input, so we need to have a clinical director for the CervicalCheck part.  We are working on that and we might have some news next week.  If that is the case, once we get that clinical input, authority, accountability and responsibility, it will allow us swiftly to close off the position in the service specification and to tender.  If we can go to a negotiated contract, then that might be the best way forward in getting HPV testing in place quickly.  There is also an element here of the capacity of each of the labs.  On what we want in respect of resilience, I have already given advice in response to a question raised by Deputy Catherine Connolly earlier.  My view is that we should have at least three or four.</p></speech>

I think my colleague, Deputy David Cullinane, asked if the HSE had accepted liability for any part or role in respect of those 209 women, outside of Ms Vicky Phelan and Ms Emma Mhic Mhath&uacute;na.

My advice to Deputy Cullinane was that I know that the HSE has accepted liability for not providing the audit results.  Dr. McKenna has got further advice that there may be a clinical element to that and I would need to study all of the judgments to be able to give Deputy O'Brien a proper answer to that question.</p></speech>

She was also asked to sign a confidentiality agreement.  That was in March 2017.  One person I have met personally has told me that.  It is my information that there are a number of other women in similar situations.  I have yet to meet them but I am in the process of meeting with them.  If we are giving out information then we need to be 100% sure that it is accurate because I am sure Deputy Alan Kelly also has information that some of those 209 women have settled previously, before Ms Vicky Phelan's case became public knowledge, and have also been asked to sign confidentiality agreements.</p> <p>  I know that at least in one instance, the woman that I met, a case has been taken against the HSE for failings in CervicalCheck in not being referred to a gynaecologist and then developing cancer.  She is now, thankfully, in remission but she took a case, settled in March 2017 and signed a confidentiality agreement.  Perhaps the witnesses could come back with some additional information on those 209 women as regards exactly how many of them have taken cases against the HSE previously and been awarded settlements?  Those are the only questions I have at the moment.  </p></speech>

I find it unbelievable that the witnesses cannot provide the information relating to this protocol today.</p><p>Why is the protocol being pushed legally, particularly when it is preventing women from getting their slides?  Why can some solicitors representing women go into court and get the slides, thereby bypassing this protocol?  I do not understand how Mr. Connaghan cannot provide that information.</p><p> I understand what Ms Conroy is saying regarding the review of the 3,000 cases.  That is fine.  These are the words of Vicky Phelan and Stephen Teap this morning.  They are surprised and disappointed and they were not aware of this.  It is not me or any other member of the committee saying this.  Whatever is going on, it had been expected that this would be completed by the end of May and would form part of the Scally inquiry.  It was not completed by the end of May.  When will it commence?  We now know that it is not part of the Scally inquiry.  Scally is already incomplete and a large chunk of the inquiry will be irrelevant.</p><p> On the previous occasion he was here, Mr. Connaghan said that he had to catch up with and meet Dr. Scally.  I presume he has done so on numerous occasions.  Has he visited Limerick?  Will Mr. Connaghan confirm that when Dr. Scally reports, he will not say that one reason he could not complete his report - which he will not be able to do - is because he was not provided some information by the HSE?  I want Mr. Connaghan to guarantee that Dr. Scally's review will not be able to say that at the end of August and that the HSE will have provided everything.</p><p> On the admission of liability in respect of non-disclosure of information, we know from Emma Nic Mhath&uacute;na's case that this has been admitted.  Will that be the standard for all other cases?</p><p> Given what was said by a previous speaker, my next question is very important.  The State Claims Agency's clinical risk advisers met CervicalCheck in March 2017.  Why did the HSE not reveal the risk of this audit at that point?</p></speech>

Everything we have in our remit or within the HSE will be provided to the Scally inquiry.  The Deputy may not be aware that we sought and received agreement from the Minister that we will deploy section 40(c) of an Act, the name of which I have forgotten at this moment, that will allow us to send everything to Dr. Scally on an unredacted basis, save matters covered by patient confidentiality.  I have recently advised Dr. Scally of that.  The answer to the first question is that we will not hold anything back.</p> <p>  Will the Deputy remind me of the second question?</p></speech>

In the case of Emma Nic Mhath&uacute;na, however, Mr. Connaghan clarified and accepted that there is liability on the part of the HSE and that an element of what happened was due, perhaps, to medical negligence - he does not have full details in that regard - and that another aspect involved her not being informed of the result of her smear test on foot of non-disclosure.  A monetary value was attributed in respect of the latter in court.  How many of the other 221 women were not informed of the results of their smear tests?</p></speech>

The Deputy is quite right, that there is a sequence, but we need to be careful not to get to the end before we work through all of the issues with the State Claims Agency.  We have one case and it was last week.  We have to stand back, consider and assess it and then come to conclusions.  Doing it in the rapid way that might across the floor here could lead to us ending up in a place where none of us would want to be.</p></speech>

I have a further question on this matter and I will then finish.  I have no difficulty in stepping back, evaluating and learning from the court judgment in this case, but the committee has to consider the potential cost of an accepted failure by the HSE.  Can a note be given to the committee to help us understand it?  My question is valid and obvious.  If a monetary value is attached to non-disclosure in at least one case, it may also be attached in others.  That is my point.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Breslin-----</p></speech>

The legitimacy of the Deputy's question is plain to me.  The only risk is in doing it in real time.  Being fully apprised of the matter, having a clear understanding of the liabilities and where they fall between the laboratory and the State - the State Claims Agency will be part of it - and then accounting to the committee is the right thing to do.  However, if we do it in real time, we risk misstepping.</p></speech>

They separated two elements, telling us that the medical files were one matter, while the slides were another.  I have examined the contracts with Quest Diagnostics and MedLab Pathology.  They are similar, if not identical.  Under the heading of "Storage and Disaster Recovery" on page 12, the contractor shall at the request of the national screening service forward eligible samples stored by the contractor or on the contractor's behalf to the national screening service or any third party specified by the service in a manner prescribed by it within three working days.  It seems clear from this that the national screening service is in control and ownership of the slides.  Why is there any question of a delay when the contract is clear about the contractors' obligations and the service's rights?</p> <p>  On radio in the past half hour, the solicitor for Vicky Phelan stated the HSE was holding up the protocol to agree to the release of slides and that, until this occurred, they could not be reviewed by clinical cytologists.  Is the HSE holding it up and, if so, why?  </p> <p>  Someone made reference to an apology, but an apology is hollow if it is not followed through with actions that will give it meaning.  We are being given the runaround on some of our questions.  The contract is clear, but we are not being given clear answers about the protocol.  If it is being held up, any claim about dealing sincerely with people who may have been harmed by the State is hollow.  Will the witnesses answer my question on the protocol?</p></speech>

As a process, we dragged out the three memorandums that existed.  Thanks to Ms Vicky Phelan and the other brave women who came forward, things are emerging.  Now we are quoting a solicitor.  It does not build confidence.  When Mr. Connaghan was before us a few weeks ago, I made this point to him.  It is not helpful.  Moreover, Dr. Scally had to come forward publicly and state he was not getting co-operation and he was not getting the information.  Bit by bit is the way this is proceeding.</p> <p>  My specific question is on the audit.  I am trying to tease this out.  Is the audit process now suspended?</p></speech>

Notwithstanding those difficulties, those memorandums are totally unacceptable.  At the time, I asked Mr. Connaghan had he read them.</p> <p>  I will stick with the audit.  Is it correct that the HSE is suspending an audit process that discovered problems because the protocol around who should talk to the patients has not been agreed?</p></speech>

But the patient is diagnosed with cancer.</p></speech>
