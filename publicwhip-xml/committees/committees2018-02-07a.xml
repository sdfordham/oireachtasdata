    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#C00200"><p>The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00041/17 on the reinstatement of the early childhood care and education, ECCE, scheme overage exemption for children with special needs.  It is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P0003/18, which proposes, to use the words of the petitioner, "to bring Irish hospitals up to an acceptable European standard".  The decision of the committee is to deem the petition inadmissible and close the petition under Standing Order 111C(2)(a).  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p> <p>  The next petition for consideration is Petition No. P00044/17 on ending the Irish arms trade with Israel.  The reply from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade addresses the issues raised by the petitioner.  It states that Ireland does not have an arms industry and is not an exporter weapons to any country.  The purchase of arms, it continues, is subject to a tendering process, the principal criterion being the best equipment that can be obtained for the protection and operational effectiveness of Irish troops.  In that regard, it is proposed to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1362" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#C00300"><p>I support the petition.  The fact that 23,000 people signed it demonstrates considerable public concern about this issue.  Deputies from all political parties and none have also raised the issue on the floor of the House.  The fact that the Israeli arms industry may tender for contracts in the European Union does not mean we should accept such tenders.  As a small state, Ireland can take a principled stance on issues such as this and send a clear message that we will not be involved in the arms trade with Israel while it illegally occupies Palestine.  I register my support for the petition.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#C00400"><p>This is a very important petition.  It is also important that we reaffirm that Ireland does not have an arms industry.  We must not tie the hands of the Department of Defence.  Notwithstanding the position taken by Deputy Mitchell, the issue is one of ensuring that the State procures and provides the best available equipment for our troops to give them operational effectiveness.  We have a process in place for doing business, as the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade noted.  The committee should, therefore, support the proposal made by the Chairman.  We should allow the Government to interact with whatever State it wishes to interact with.  It is important also to reaffirm that we do not have an arms industry.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1237" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#C00500"><p>I agree with my colleague, Senator Buttimer.  If the committee were to accept the petition, it would somehow suggest that Ireland has an arms industry, which is not the case.  I am acutely aware of the importance of ensuring that the best equipment is available to our troops on peacekeeping duties in order to keep them safe and allow them to perform those duties.  Such equipment is not used in an aggressive manner but for peacekeeping purposes and self-protection.  On that basis, I agree with the Chairman's proposal.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#C00600"><p>The proposal is to forward a copy of the response from the Department to the petitioner.  In doing so, the committee recognises and respects the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The final petition for consideration has been the subject of some public discourse in the past 48 hours.  Petition No. P00026/17 from Ms Aideen Darmody seeks the removal of the statue of Prince Albert from the grounds of Leinster House on the basis that it pays tribute to a monarch whose values are in opposition to those of the Irish Republic.  The petitioner suggests that the statue be auctioned and the proceeds donated to a homeless charity.</p><p>We have received correspondence from the Superintendent of the Houses of the Oireachtas stating that the Houses do not own the statue of Prince Albert and that information on its ownership can be supplied by the Office of Public Works art management unit.  The physical implications and potential cost of removing the statue would also be best answered by the OPW.  The statue dates back to the Royal Dublin Society's ownership of Leinster House.  It is worth noting that the sculpture was done by John H. Foley, who was a renowned sculptor.</p><p> The proposal before us is to deem the petition inadmissible under Standing Order 111C(1)(a) because it is asking the D&aacute;il to do something that it does not have the power to do.  When we discussed this in private session, the view was that the committee does not wish to have the statue removed, that it should remain but that it would be pertinent to seek clarification from the OPW or the powers that be as to who owns the statue.  However, I wish to have a discussion and will seek members' views.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1237" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#D00200"><p>I agree with the recommendation.  Obviously, the petition is inadmissible because it is not within our remit to deal with it.  However, it is right to seek clarification from the OPW on the matter.  The Chairman mentioned John H. Foley who was a renowned Irish sculptor.  His other famous works include the statue of Daniel O'Connell on O'Connell Street and that of Edmund Burke outside Trinity College.  The statue of Prince Albert has been on the Merrion Square side of Leinster House since 1923.  That gives the historical context.  Whatever the political dimensions at that time, it is now part of the folklore of this House and of the history that has made the country what it is today.  Rather than try to knock such emblems and pretend the history did not happen, we should recognise that it is part of our past.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1362" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#D00300"><p>It is an interesting petition.  Not being disrespectful to anybody or the statue, I did not even know where it was located.  I walked down and looked at it.  It is hidden in the corner of the car park and there is hedge growing up on its sides.  It is not visible to the public passing by.  The text of the petition is slightly tongue-in-cheek.  I want to see a united Ireland and part of that will involve agreements on decisive issues such as symbols and emblems.  We have to take a position on the recommendation before us.  There is no harm in finding out who owns the statue and, obviously, we must have respectful debates on these issues in the future.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1391" speakername="Jerry Buttimer" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#D00400"><p>The Chairman and Senator Leyden referred to John H. Foley.  It is fitting that we will commemorate the 200th anniversary of his birth in May.  Like Deputy Mitchell, I agree with the Chairman's recommendation and I believe we should find out who owns the statue.  The statue was moved to facilitate the creation of the obelisk commemorating Collins, Griffith and O'Higgins which, quite rightly, has a place of pre-eminence in the primary location.  The petition is inadmissible but, in conjunction with the OPW and the Houses of the Oireachtas, could we consider perhaps relocating the statue?  From my historical research, and I thank Senator Norris in this regard, Prince Albert was a progressive social reformer.  Like Deputy Mitchell, I am a proud republican nationalist but Prince Albert strongly opposed slavery and child labour.  He wanted to increase the working age.  He was present at the Great Industrial Exhibition of 1853 in the grounds of Leinster House, which was owned by the RDS at the time.  While some people might think the debate we are having is frivolous, it is appropriate on the 200th anniversary of the birth of John H. Foley to consider where we could put the statue.  I accept that some might find memorials to the past difficult to understand and to appreciate, but we cannot ignore our past.  We should embrace it and move forward.  I support the Chairman.  We have given the petition a very fair hearing and I commend the Chairman on allowing that to happen.  Equally, perhaps as a side issue and bearing in mind what Deputy Mitchell said, we could look at how we could relocate the statute as part of the refurbishment of the House.  Deputy Mitchell is right that it is not visible from the gate on Merrion Square so perhaps we should consider relocating it as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1342" speakername="Eugene Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#D00500"><p>There has been much talk about this in the public arena in the past 48 hours.  I thank Senator Norris for sending us a very informative email.  Mr. Foley obviously was quite an interesting character and did some amazing sculpture.  With regard to Prince Albert, the statue is there and is part of history.  When one reads about him, one finds he was a man who took a strong stand on certain issues.  I agree with the recommendation and with what the other members said.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2018020700002#D00600"><p>I thank the members for sharing their views.  It is the view of the committee that the statue should remain.  From a technical point of view the petition is deemed inadmissible because it is asking us to do something we do not have the power to do.  However, it is an interesting one.  Deputy Mitchell is right.  Sometimes there is an eclectic range of petitions before us and we are respectful to the petitioners but there is a clear view in this case that, as the emeritus professor of history at University College Cork, John A. Murphy, said when quoting from George Santayana, a philosopher poet, a civilised people does not tear out the pages of history, it simply turns them over.  We acknowledge the presence of the statue and that it is symbolic.  However, the artistic merit attributed to the statue given that it is the work of John H. Foley probably supersedes the statue's subject.  We are clear on our position and I thank the petitioner for-----</p></speech>

I accept that it is not in our remit.</p></speech>

Perhaps we could conduct a consultation in respect of the matter.</p></speech>

One passes the statue by and does not take much notice of it, to be honest.  Like the Deputy, I had to go out the other day to take a look at it to see who it was and so forth.  It took me a while to find it.  It is quite an imposing structure but it is hidden by the hedge.  I would not necessarily opt for relocating it.</p><p>If, however, some treatment can be done in or around the location of the statue by the OPW or the internal management of the Houses, that might be the way to proceed.  I thank the members for their agreement on this issue and I again thank the petitioner.  A decision has been made.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p> As there is no further business, the meeting is adjourned until 1.30 p.m. on Wednesday, 21 February 2017.</p></speech>

We are joined by Ms Lauren Reynolds, Ms Muireann Whelan, Ms Serena Devereux and Ms Isabel Seacy from Newbridge College and Ms Tara Trevaskis Hoskin, Ms Jade O'Hagan, Ms Jody Whelan and Mr. Fearghal Burke from Wicklow and Clare Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  I thank them for attending the meeting this morning.  The committee is very interested in hearing the views of young people and we are grateful to you for not only accepting our invitation but also making yourselves available and coming here from various places.  It is important to note how significant your role is in our hearings on cybersafety in general.  Heretofore we have met with representatives of Snapchat, we have received contributions from Facebook and a submission from Snap Inc. and we have had conversations with people from academia, among others.  Now it is important to hear from the users of these services about their experience, and I hope you can inform us on how improvements could be made.  I do not want you to feel this environment is too formal.  Feel free to make a contribution and let me know if you wish to contribute.  It is not quite a l&aacute;mha suas but make sure you get my attention and I will call you.  However, I am required to read a formal notice, so you can tune out for this bit.</p><p>Before we commence and in accordance with procedure I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, you should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>I ask everybody in the room to switch off their mobile telephones.  Mute is not sufficient so turn them off or put them into flight mode.  Otherwise it will affect our proceedings and your counterparts in Newbridge, Wicklow and Clare will be unable to hear you on television.  I wish to advise you that any submissions or opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after the meeting has concluded.  The witnesses will make a short presentation, followed by questions from members of the committee.  I invite Ms Reynolds to commence.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.35" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lauren Reynolds" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018020700002#G00300"><p>As a young person I wish to discuss the online safety issues that I believe affect us most.  I will discuss sexting and inappropriate content, the social media sites that affect us most and the issues relating to them.</p> <p>  The definition of a sext is a sexually explicit photograph or message sent via mobile telephone.  It is very much a taboo subject, which people shy away from discussing, but it must be addressed.  Many of the teenagers engaging in these activities are not informed of the dangers or the legalities relating to the sharing of intimate images.  This issue was raised recently when stories surfaced in the news, leaving parents concerned and raising the need for awareness among young people.  Sending an image to the person one plans to see it and trusts may appear harmless but can have disastrous consequences if it gets into the wrong hands.  The sender of the photograph has no ability to prevent the image being shared with a wider audience than initially intended.  It is important to take this into consideration when intending to send a risky image, even if it is to somebody with whom one is in a close or trusting relationship, as factors such as peer pressure or a break up might mean that the images stay in their possession.  What would a future employer think of a resurfaced intimate image?  It is important to consider the emotional stress of having pictures of oneself distributed to an audience.  Under data protection and copyright law a person has the legal right to have the images taken off the Internet and if they are brought to the school's or the Garda's attention leaked images can be dealt with.  This should be stressed to young people so they may become aware of the damaging and psychological effects of sexting.</p> <p>  Not only is sexting dangerous, it can also have serious possible legal consequences.  Very few teenagers are aware of the legalities surrounding nude images, which can also be classified as child exploitation material.  The Child Trafficking and Pornography Act 1998 makes no allowance or distinction regarding underage sexting.  Child pornography incorporates a person under 17 years of age engaging in an explicit sexual activity or visual representation.  Even the case of a suggestive provocative image that may suggest an explicit sexual representation of a part of the body may still come within the definition of child pornography.  Offences include creation, distribution or possession of child pornography and the penalty can be up to 14 years imprisonment.  The age of consent for sexual intercourse in Ireland is 17 years but while sexual activities under the age of 17 years are legal their recording is illegal and an offence.  I believe this issue is getting out of control and becoming a popular trend due to the lack of education and information provided to young people.  We can help prevent and tackle this by raising awareness and being taught the dangers of sexting in school as part of the social, personal and health education, SPHE, curriculum or the relationships and sexuality education, RSE, module.</p> <p>  Another concern with children using the Internet is how easily and instantly they can access inappropriate content, such as violent or sexually explicit images online, with or without the intention of doing so.  Reports suggest that 25% of children have come across harmful content online and 11% have seen or received sexual content.  The reports also found that less than 20% of parents are supervising their children's online activity.  Parents can prevent this by monitoring their child's online usage, setting up safety mode within the settings of their YouTube account to filter out inappropriate content, setting up Google SafeSearch filters to filter out explicit material, setting up web filters and becoming aware of the apps their child is using.</p> <p>  Instagram is a free mobile app that can be downloaded to telephones, tablets, iPods and so forth.  It is a form of social media that allows the user to upload photographs and videos to their profile page while allowing the person to direct message, follow, comment, view, tag in or like posts.  It is a way to see what one's friends and favourite celebrities are up to, but can hold the risk of over-sharing personal details and information.  It can be easy to feel one knows somebody from talking to the person online or seeing what seems like every minor detail of the person's life, but how easy is it to base one's opinion on somebody one has never actually met?  The leaking or distribution of personal or banking details can also leave a person vulnerable to scams and hackers.</p> <p>  The Instagirl aesthetic envisages an unrealistic reality, an idealistic image of a perfect world that does not exist.  With filters, exotic locations and a faultless lifestyle, this creates a false illusion of these glamorised fantasies.  Feeds filled with airbrushed photoshopped flawless figures can lead to extreme self esteem and confidence issues in young girls who aspire to look and live like this new generation of role models.  Unrealistic and unhealthy portrayals of female sexuality can lead young girls to feel insecure about their bodies, provoke fears of them being unattractive and lead to extreme dieting.  Young people and celebrities are known for only posting the good and happiness in their lives on the media.</p><p>While a constant burst of a positive online influence may seem ideal, it can give young people an untrue perception of life, making them feel alienated for not constantly feeling the everyday optimism shared by these online influences.  The messages that should be put across to teenagers are how it is okay not to be okay and that everyone has bad or off days.  This should be highlighted through social media and should be used to promote the importance of mental health rather than damage it.</p><p> Public profiles on Instagram can be viewed by anyone, enabling access to any user to leave hateful or unkind comments.  Privacy settings are in place to give the option for accounts to be on private, allowing the user to accept or deny follow requests.  The age to own an account on Instagram is 13 years, but many children break this rule using false years of birth.  Parents who are concerned by their children having accounts should implement their own rules, for example, having access to the account or controlling their child's online activity.</p><p> Snapchat is a photo and video messaging application that allows a person to send an image for a select amount of time.  Snaps can be sent to anyone on a person's friends list.  Snapchat lets a person draw on and add captions or text to his or her snaps.  It also has a feature called stories where a person can post for his or her whole contact friend list to see and that lasts 24 hours.  As well as this, it has a form of messaging known as blue chat.  Here the chats will disappear if not tapped and saved.  Snapchat is popular for sexting due to the users believing it will disappear once opened without considering the threat of a screenshot being taken of the image or the image being screen recorded.  The age to activate an account is 13 years.  There is a child-friendly version called "Snap kids" which allows a person to take pictures and save them to the camera roll without the option of friends and stories.</p><p> Snapchat launched a feature, snap maps, in June 2017 which outraged many people and was the subject of concern and alarm for parents.  The feature allowed users to appear on a map for all their friends to see and pinpoint their location.  This is highly dangerous and may cause serious threat to a child's location privacy.  There is an option to turn off this feature - ghost mode - disabling access to the location.</p><p> Many of these problems can be easily prevented.  The Internet is not a truly bad and dangerous place and, when used in a safe and responsible way, like many things, can be positive and beneficial.  How do we tackle these issues?  While there will always be negative and dangerous sources online, the right guidelines on children and young people, implemented with the assistance of teachers and parents, can help us young people remain safer on the web.  Raising awareness is key.  We need to get these issues talked about.  There is much schools and parents can do to help.  Safer Internet Day was yesterday, 6 February, with 100,000 teachers and students throughout the country taking part in activities relating to how to be safe when online.</p><p> Teachers addressing these issues through a range of subjects can help educate young people who are otherwise the most vulnerable to the dangers they may encounter online.  Information evenings in schools or communities should be in place to inform parents and get them talking about the importance of safety online too.  There are various helpful websites and organisations that provide information and help to people of all ages.  With the right attitudes and resources and by addressing these issues, we can make a change and make the Internet a better and safer environment for the children and young people of Ireland.</p></speech>

Our work with Wicklow started when we began the Great Wicklow Youth Survey.  This was given to 1,000 young people in Wicklow.  This is really important to us because it represents the voices of young people around Wicklow.  This helped us decide what issue we were to work on.  As the survey results came back, cyberbullying was shown to be one of the most important issues, along with mental health and youth homelessness.  This helped us and we started to work on cyberbullying.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.44" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Tara Trevaskis Hoskin" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018020700002#H00900"><p>More than 1,000 people identified cyberbullying as a major issue for them and among young people.  However, we wanted to find out more about this issue.  As I am sure the committee will agree, it is quite difficult to find information on it and to understand the problems that come from this and how these could be solved.</p> <p>  We held cyberbullying consultations online and received a good response from people all over Wicklow.  First, we conducted a survey online where people could make submissions.  It was helpful as well to get a personal response because it could be anonymous.  People were happy to share.  More than 220 young people took part in that.  Then we hosted some workshops around the county to discuss the results of the survey with people.  This was really helpful as well.  We conducted walk-in debates where people told us their opinions on it, which helped us gain a greater understanding of the issue.  The overwhelming feedback was that we should develop a charter which speaks to all of the relevant people within the picture of cyberbullying.  The message was that there was more information needed on cyberbullying and that it was not only to be told to those who are being cyberbullied or to cyberbullies.  It is more important to include everyone who is involved.  We started work on the charter then.</p> <p>  Through a serious amount of work within our comhairle and among us after we had gathered all the information, and supported by the steering group, we developed a cyberbullying charter, copies of which are available to the committee if the committee members want some.  What makes it so powerful and unique in our view is that it carries messages to all of the stakeholders because we feel that we are all stakeholders when it comes to cyberbullying.  We believe everyone has a part to play, from those who are bullied to bullies, to the bystanders, to those in authority and to all young people.  If we really want this to change, everyone needs to be a part of the change.</p> <p>  It is our intention to share the charter poster within Wicklow and beyond, if there is interest.  A good aspect of the charter is it is not specific to Wicklow.  It can be shared nationwide, even universally, because it applies to all young people.  We are really proud of it.  It took a lot of work to put the charter together but we believe that it will help change people's perspective and maybe help open up the issue a bit more.  We believe it will help reduce the prevalence of cyberbullying because more people will be involved in fixing the issue rather than merely putting it on one person or group.</p></speech>

I will start off with the context and motivation.</p> <p>  Clare Comhairle na n&Oacute;g takes its work plan directly from topics and suggestions put forward by young people in Clare.  The main source is the comhairle AGM held in October.  Additional input comes from Clare youth service, CYS, surveys and focus groups run by youth workers and Younger Voices.  At the end of 2014, the issue of cybersafety was evident from feedback at the comhairle AGM in our discussion groups and through focus groups facilitated by CYS.  Cybersafety became part of the Clare comhairle work plans in 2015, 2016 and 2017.  In 2015 and 2016, we made a short film which included aspects of inappropriate sharing and ran a consultation which examined attitudes to oversharing online.</p></speech>

Each group delivered workshops to the other on areas of common interest, including positive mental health and cybersafety.  The young people from Samf&eacute;s had developed and run a sexting peer education workshop in 2016 and they translated it into English for us.  It was a good experience which led to lively and interesting debate.  We now have formatted this sexting workshop, which could be adapted to the Irish context.  We are looking for funding to run the programme itself.</p></speech>

In response to young people looking for some direction and education in this rapidly changing environment, we made links with McAfee which had developed a cybersafety programme as part of its corporate social responsibility, CSR, project.  The programme was piloted with 49 young people at the 2015 comhairle AGM and the results were fed back to McAfee.  Clare youth service decided to deliver this programme with funding from the Clare local development company, and during 2016 and 2017, 752 young people, mainly first years, took part in the programme in schools across Clare.  McAfee has adapted the programme according to the feedback from the young people involved.</p></speech>

In late 2017,  ten members travelled to Cork to train as peer education mentors to enable us to deliver the programmes ourselves.  We did this with McAfee, a leading cybersafety company.  Yesterday, the programme was launched worldwide.  It had been run only in Ireland until yesterday.  The first stages are completed and in recent days, we found out the second programme of the workshop will be held in the coming weeks.  We have been invited to NUI Galway to teach teachers because we believe it is better coming from young people.  We thank the committee for listening.</p></speech>

We are involved in the process of examining this issue.  Very often we hear voices from academia and industry but the most important voices of all are those of the witnesses.  What they have done today is to articulate a clear vision of what they want to achieve, and they have done so with such clarity that I want to get copies of their submissions.  They have distilled the issues with such clarity that it has given me, as a member of the committee, a clear sense of what we need to achieve now.  I express our gratitude to the witnesses.</p> <p>  I have a few questions arising from the submissions.  My first question is for Ms Reynolds on the role of parents.  We are trying hard to grapple with where parents come into the equation.  Do the witnesses think the vast majority of parents have the confidence to monitor, as Ms Reynolds said, the activity of their children online so they can make the Internet safe for their children?</p></speech>

Parents are very much in the dark because media have come on so much in our generation, which means we were thrown into the deep end.  When growing up one is taught and given guidelines on everything.  Someone is not given a bike and just told to cycle it.  He or she is taught how to do so.  One is taught languages and subjects but with social media, we have had to learn for ourselves.  It is very important that parents become educated on the workings of the sites in which their children are involved.  There is so much in the news that parents get concerned because they see the negatives when there are many benefits.  We could have workshops and information evenings for parents, even given by students, informing them on how these sites work.</p></speech>

If I asked Ms Reynolds to design a workshop or programme to educate or help parents would she do it in the school community or in the sporting community?  If I gave her &euro;1 million to design a programme for the country, what would be her vision and how would she do it?  Would it be done during school time or out of school time?  Parents are looking for programmes they can grab onto in their communities so they can educate themselves.  Mr. Burke spoke about peer to peer programmes and young people teaching young people but there is a big gap in adults' minds on this issue.  Will Ms Reynolds give me a sense of this?  It might help in the devising of schemes here also.</p></speech>

I am an early adopter of technology but I am probably in the minority.  The majority of people do not feel confident about trying to reach in and understand what their children are doing.  Where is Comhairle na n&Oacute;g on this?  It has its charter.  How do we implement the charter?  How do we get it to a point where every citizen in the country, young and old, has a sense we are designing a safe place for people to inhabit when they use the Internet?

Do the witnesses believe there is a cut-off point with regard to children and young adults?  Smartphones have been spoken about quite a bit recently, and people are saying children under the age of 12 or 16 should not have access to a smartphone.  What is the view of the witnesses on this?  Ms Muireann Whelan wants to answer it.</p></speech>

The Internet can be such an amazing thing for everyone but the problem is how to monitor it.  That is up to parents.  If parents give their children under the age of 14, for example, a smartphone and they get into trouble sexting, it is the parents' choice.</p></speech>

We have had some engagement with the Department of Education and Skills and with parents about the role of teachers.  What I am picking up from the witnesses is that it depends on what school someone goes to.  Some teachers are very confident with technology and some are not.  Should we start rolling out programmes at undergraduate level for teachers in training so they do a compulsory module on Internet safety?  They would then be able to roll out programmes in their classes through RSE and other programmes.</p></speech>

I was very struck by the submission from Ms Reynolds on mental health.  I am a member of the committee on mental health and I do a lot of campaigning and work in this area.  A number of years ago, the social media trends which the witnesses are articulating with regard to younger people and teenagers were happening for adults, with regard to pressure to look and be the best and the manifestation of a perfect lifestyle on social media.  This was kicking in for adults in 2011 and 2012.  I do not know whether it is still happening because we are maturing as users of social media.</p><p>It was probably also happening at that time for younger people but I am basing that on my own anecdotal experience.  As I have said at this committee, social media holds dangers for young people, as does life offline, but there are also huge benefits to social media, in particular in regard to community.  Anything in which I am involved in the area of the arts, in particular with community-led organisations, involves social media.  Organisations such as Comhairle na n&Oacute;g probably use Facebook groups to say when something is on and who is going or interested, which is an example of the benefits of social media.  The witnesses have said that they are here to articulate their concerns, which the committee is taking on board.  What are their views on the point raised by Deputy Sherlock regarding the restriction and use of social media?  Should certain sites or activities be unavailable or banned for children under a certain age or, rather, should we continue to educate and make people aware of potential dangers?  It would be interesting to hear the views of people of the witnesses' age group on the issue.</p></speech>

If we start to educate people on this issue at a younger age then by the time they reach their teens, they will know what is and is not safe.  It would also be useful for parents to monitor and be involved in children's online activities.</p></speech>

I agree that social media can be amazing but there are also downfalls for younger people in terms of how it is consuming their lives.  It is media, not social media.  Much attention is focused on how amazing a should person look all of the time.</p></speech>

It is as though we are living our lives through the lens of a camera rather than in the moment.  There are age restrictions and rules in place on social media sites but they are not being followed.  Children of eight use websites that have a minimum age guideline of 13.  In certain cases, it is down to parents controlling their child's online activity and ensuring these rules are implemented.</p></speech>

My generation did not have social media when we were children and only began using it as adults.  Have teachers and education in schools evolved over that period or are they still hugely behind?  Is more support needed in that regard?  Are people stepping in or are teachers more clued in on the issue?  Through no fault of their own, teachers are under the same pressure as all adults in terms of trying to keep up with technology.  As a culture, we must constantly try to keep up with technology because it is evolving so quickly.  Have the witnesses seen a progression in that regard in recent years and, in particular, over the past two or three years?</p></speech>

The way such teachers use social media is amazing, in particular as regards Edmodo and so on.  In terms of geography, a full significant relevant point, SRP, resource was placed online whereby one can access Christmas tests, special notes and so on.  That side of using technology in school is hugely beneficial.</p></speech>

Through social media, one can have a group chat or one's maths teacher can put up a video of him or her doing a maths equation on YouTube in a special group such that only one's class can see and students can comment or ask for it to be redone.  That is an example of how technology in schools can move in a positive direction.</p></speech>

Were such dangers present two or three years ago?  That might be a difficult question which the witnesses cannot answer.  Was the same volume of dangers present, has it increased or are we discussing it more and bringing it into the limelight?</p></speech>

Older people such as teachers and so on often do not have a clue what to do or say.  It would be preferable for them to be given more supports and information and for young people to be asked how the issue should be dealt with.  It is not that people do not think it is an issue but, rather, they do not know how to deal with it because is it is so new.</p></speech>

It is our Internet and we should know what to do with it.  It is a danger that is being faced by young people and we should control it now before it gets too far.  The dangers are increasing year by year.  It is very fast-moving and something must be done before it gets out of control.</p></speech>

Taking into account all that the witnesses have said, improving the educational level and awareness is key to this issue.  In particular, parents need to be better informed as to what is going on because the witnesses have been familiar with social media from a relatively young age.  I have a six year old and a four year old whose online activity is limited to a highly supervised 30 minutes on the children's version of YouTube but they know how to unlock phones and probably also know the settings.  The prevalence of screen time is quite alarming.  A considerable research has shown how negative screen time can be in terms of the physical manifestation of being glued to a phone six inches from one's face, which cannot be good for a person, rather than the content or social aspect thereof.  That said, there are many positive applications for social media, as referenced in the witnesses' contributions.  There are several ways we could enhance the experience of younger and older people in terms of social media if there were proper broadband in certain communities around the country, which is currently a very topical issue.  If proper broadband were available, issues such as rural isolation could be addressed through social media platforms such as Facebook, YouTube, Skype and so on.  That access is taken for granted in urban environments because we have decent broadband and mobile phone coverage but in many places that is not available.  It would be welcome for people in rural communities to be able to use social media to the best of its intended use.</p> <p>  Mobile phones were recently completely banned from schools in France, rather than just during class time, when one is not supposed to use them anyway.  A student may not bring a mobile phone to school unless he or she is over 14 and even then, while one is allowed to have it in one's possession, it may not be turned on.</p><p>What are Ms Devereux's or Ms Seacy's views on this?  What would they make of somebody telling a person that they cannot even have a phone in their bag?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.86" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Serena Devereux" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018020700002#L00200"><p>Last year, I did an exchange in France and I saw how they banned phones for students between the ages of 12 to 14 years.  That is their middle school equivalent.  As soon as they get home, however, they want what they cannot have and banning it will not make a difference.  As soon as people get their hands on their phones, it is almost like an addiction because they have missed out on so much.  We hear a great deal on the radio about the issue and it is like getting more attracted to the idea of it.  Due to the lack of information for parents, it is almost as though they are blaming the platform itself rather than the problem, namely, how people use it.  We need more information evenings, as Ms Reynolds and Ms Whelan said, held in the school by students.  When it is held by students, then we know the problem is real and not just a concerned teacher trying to make it sound like it is a problem.  It would be coming from students who know and deal with it every day.  We did a workshop yesterday for Safer Internet Day.  It included issues such as sexting, Internet safety and not talking to strangers online.  We showed an information video on Webwise that was all about the consequences of sexting or sending a nude image.  Afterwards, we discussed the legalities involved with the first and second years.  We took them in groups of 12.  Not one of the students knew of the legalities.  It was a shock to them.  These are young people.  If young people are shocked, then we can only imagine what parents' reactions would be.  It needs to be dealt with in a more serious manner.</p></speech>

It referenced the survey, the statistics from which are quite alarming.  I cannot put my finger on a specific statistic but I certainly saw them.  For example, 20% of parents supervise their children's online usage, 25% of children have come across harmful material and 11% have received sexual content.  Were these percentages out of 200 or thereabouts, or am I referencing a different survey?  I believe it was in Lauren's opening remarks.  I am sorry I will not put her on the spot.  The point is that I would really love to see statistics because this is how I base my opinions on what works best.  I am not the sort of person to think that it is a good thing to take something away from an environment where it could be helpful.  I would not be in favour of banning mobile phones completely, but, as Ms Devereux has rightly pointed out, there is an absolute necessity for education, even for the little things.  I would not expect there would be very much sexting going on in the schoolyard at break time, but that is not to say that something might not be shared, which can be very damaging to the individual involved.  However, I am not sure about banning phones.  I tend to concur with Ms Devereux's observation about the use of phones by students in France.  I thank her for that.</p></speech>

There are things that people are too embarrassed to admit.  Also, it has all become such a casual thing and not just among first and second years.  Older students, such as our fifth years, are also not aware of the legalities.  It is about raising awareness of the legalities and how serious it is.  This will help to prevent it happening and stop it.</p></speech>

It is very clear that if we can make any recommendations as part of our report to the Houses of the Oireachtas on cybersecurity, it would be to improve the educational standard and teachings that have been provided, not just to students but also to teachers.  A module within our universities would be very welcome.  The Department of Education and Skills could also look seriously at campaigns in schools, co-ordinating with the likes of CyberSafeIreland or Webwise, or whichever is the most relevant and available organisation within a particular area, and by funding that and giving it purpose.  Internet Safety Month is terrific and Safer Internet Day was very helpful.  I did some radio interviews on the subject yesterday, as did several other Members of the Oireachtas.</p> <p>  With regard to bringing the matter to the attention of people, in the course of these hearings I distributed a booklet on cyber safety to parents and guardians, of which many members would be aware and which they would also have distributed.  I shall give an indication of the take-up in respect of the booklet.  There are 52 primary and second-level schools in my constituency.  I received more than 7,000 requests for the booklet.  I had originally only printed 200.  The schools could not get enough of them.  The most important aspect from my perspective, as Chairman of this committee, was that we were in the middle of these hearings looking at the Office for Internet Safety, about which nobody knows but which does terrific work.  Deputy Rabbitte and I have commented on the fact that the office produced four booklets but that only 40,000 copies were printed, which was pretty useless.</p> <p>  Focusing in on what has been the best practice in the experience of the Comhairle na n&Oacute;g, with, for example, the Newbridge College online tutorials, what would be the level of take-up in respect of this sort of initiative?  If CyberSafeIreland was to put up a web video tutorial on the rights and law regarding cybersecurity for young people and what they are doing with their boyfriends, girlfriends or friends, how do we promote this to a young person?  I do not necessarily mean young people the age of the witnesses, perhaps it would be for those who are a little younger at the age of 12 or 13.  How might they engage with that type of communication?</p></speech>

From our first Wicklow survey to find out the problems, we started off by giving the survey to each person by hand.  We did not get even half the responses as when we did it online, where we received more than 1,000 responses.  It is a much easier way of sharing information.  It is important that if one makes video tutorials, they should speak on the young person's level.  It should not be someone lecturing; it needs to be more open and conversational.  This would make the message more accessible.  If it is for young people, it should be made by young people or incorporating young people.</p></speech>

While we do peer mentoring, this tutorial could also be used for parents.  There could be days when parents come and we would present this to them.  The workshop we did was very interactive.  We spoke about personal experiences and things we had heard, so we were able to relate this to each other.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It was very interesting to hear their well-articulated viewpoints and to hear about the research they have done.  As a representative for Kildare , I am especially interested to see Newbridge College represented in force and, of course, our neighbours from Wicklow.  I visited Clare and Ennis for the &Eacute;amon De Valera commemoration with my colleague, Deputy Dooley, last summer.  The witnesses have all done their schools and counties proud today.</p> <p>  I shall now turn to the points articulated in the presentations.  Reference was made to the anti-social media.  What was said is so true.  We see it so many times in the context of conversations when younger or older people are in a family room, such as around the dinner table or watching TV.  When one looks around the room, not a single person is talking because everyone is actually on his or her phone.  We see this happening so often these days.  This particularly live point has been articulated here.</p><p>People are tuning out of real conversations in order to talk online.  They are not actually talking to each other.  I understand some of the social media platforms are starting to build in a little endorphin hit.  Refreshing and scrolling to see how many likes or comments one has attracted becomes addictive.  One keeps going back to the well to see what is there.  That is by design rather than accident.<br/><br/>The points regarding Instagram were quite interesting.  There is the ideal Instagirl and, indeed, the ideal Instaboy.  This has always been an issue.  People always talked about glossy magazines before the Internet and about how they presented the idealised human form and depicted happy, glamorous lifestyles to which people aspire but which they can never quite attain.  Social media has made this trend even more prevalent and difficult because it affects people one knows and individuals in one's circle.  It is difficult to rationalise why others seem to be more happy and successful and to be living more exciting lives but, of course, one does not know what is really going on behind the facade.  People of every age struggle with these issues.  The witnesses identified young people in this context.  They may be even more aware of the issue because they are tuned in to the pitfalls as well as the pluses.  Perhaps they are even ahead of the pack on that one.<br/><br/>A number of delegates have made the point already that the Internet is a really powerful force for good.  It is a revolutionary technology and it is has changed the world.  With regard to education, I am old enough to remember my parents buying the <i>Encyclopaedia Britannica</i>, which comprised 24 volumes.  It took pride of place in the sitting-room.  It probably seems anathema to the delegation to go out and buy 24 books that would sit there and be the source of knowledge for all time.  They were great when I was doing my junior certificate and leaving certificate examinations.  These days, however, one finds all the information on one's mobile phone.  The Internet has changed the way education works.  In my school days, it was all about rote learning and doing three hours involving reading, writing and arithmetic, in addition to learning off all the tables and statistics.  One does not really need to do that anymore because is all about how one analyses information.  The mind should now be trained how to analyse a set of facts and how to rationalise and validate information rather than just retrieving it.  Again, the Internet is responsible for this need because, in any circumstances, required information can be pulled up in minutes.  There is great potential for good.<br/><br/>On the school's theme, I have a question that has arisen many times previously.  I am actually chairman of the board of management of a school that has a lot of technology.  It uses iPads instead of books.  Naas community college is the school.  It has been asked many times here and elsewhere whether we should ban phones or have no network connection in schools.  Should we put a blocker in a school zone so a signal cannot be obtained anymore, meaning no Internet access?  This results in pitfalls were a school is trying to promote gaining access to information or even Schoology or some of the other educational resources.  Should there be a limited local network and a bar on the outside world?  These are the kinds of questions that need to be asked.  I will be interested in hearing the delegates' views.  I will ask a batch of questions, if that is acceptable, rather than going to and fro.  I acknowledge that we are against the clock.<br/><br/>Questions on parental control were already asked and I accept it is really difficult to answer.  I understand and am taking away the really helpful notes on parental filters and what parents can do to be more active in their children's lives.  I am a father and my children are active online.  I am not sure, however, that they always want their parents looking at what they are doing or seeing what they are saying.  I am sure that I, no more than the delegates, recognise a privacy concern.  How do we balance the desire for privacy with the need for protection?  Should parents be able to log on to see what their children are posting on Instagram or Snapchat or saying in various conversations?  They probably should not.  There probably needs to be a certain degree of respect, dignity and privacy.  On the other hand, there is the question of what happens if something that should not be happening is happening, or if somebody is being abused, manipulated, bullied, harassed or subjected to other such nasty behaviour.  I am not quite sure what is the answer.  I would be really interested in hearing the delegates' views on that.  What is the correct balance?  How do we get it right?  What kinds of protections are appropriate or otherwise?<br/><br/>The age of digital consent has been touched on in the discussion.  One of the delegates said a youth has to be 13 to go on Snapchat but everybody can just fake the age.  A child could be ten, 11 or 12.  Is there such a thing as a right age?  Does it depend on maturity or parental control?  Is it a question of going a bit younger with parental permission?  That is a question we struggle with here.<br/><br/>Those are my thoughts and questions.  Should the signal in schools be blocked?  If not, how do we get around the problem?  How do we strike a balance between privacy and protection?  I would be really interested in hearing all the delegates' views on those issues.</p></speech>

In our school, we are allowed phones during breaks but every connection to social media is cut off.  Therefore, we cannot get Snapchat or anything like that.  On the computers we work with for certain classes, the user cannot get YouTube.  Unless one is a teacher, one cannot access Facebook, Snapchat, Instagram or anything of that nature.  That helps, for our school in any case.</p></speech>

If the rules are too strict, people will break them.  They will want to go against them.  One cannot be too lenient either.  We were talking yesterday about all aspects of life.

Teenagers have to be trusted to a certain level but it is really important to inform them beforehand so they will know they will have supports in place if something goes wrong, and that they will have been given the tools to be safe online rather than having to look over their shoulder.</p></speech>

This gave the kids the ability to remain as kids.  They do not have the stress of someone taking a photo or video of them.  There is another school locally that banned phones altogether.  In this regard, there was more of a problem with the parents than the students themselves because the parents asked what would happen if they needed to contact their children.  I believe that the blocking of smartphones was very beneficial but not the blocking of phones in general.  A phone that is not a smartphone can still be used to make contact with someone although it has no access to social media or the Internet.</p></speech>

A young person will almost second-guess herself if she believes her mother or, perhaps, nanny will see what is being posted.  She will be more respectful towards herself and others because she will be monitored.  A great balance could be struck between both elements.</p></speech>

Parents might not get all the children's Snapchat posts individually.  There are many Snapchat stories with pictures of people who do not want to be filmed or photographed.  A parent could see such a story and tell her child to take it down because she does not want to see her child bullying someone.  A youth would be more respectful if his or her parents were on the same page.  I refer to where parents understand technology and are able to socialise with their children on social media.  It is beneficial for parents to see what their children are up to and to know they can trust them even if they are not with them.</p></speech>

If they would be mortified, there is probably a reason and this should indicate to them that they probably should not be posting or sending the picture in the first place.  Perhaps knowing what one's parents would think if they saw the picture would draw attention to the fact that it might not be so appropriate.</p></speech>

There are ways around it so they can never see anything one posts.  Therefore, it is really important to give children and young people the tools to know what they are doing will hurt someone else's feelings or that a post might be dangerous.  It is more important for us to have those tools and know the position in our own heads because, in all fairness, if there is something one does not want someone to see, it is not that hard to hide it.</p></speech>

We produced a movie on this.  I believe it was called "A Mile in Shoes" but I cannot remember the exact title.  It examines various aspects of society and it puts people who bully others because they have certain features or qualities into the others' shoes so they will see what it is like for them.  After that, nothing else happens to the victims and there is no more bullying.  Other people's perspectives should be considered before doing something.  It is a matter of thinking about what they would think.</p></speech>

I was really impressed to see them on television last night.  As they did an excellent job, I had better pull up my socks, as it seems that there is competition coming down the track.  <br/><br/>I was delayed in getting here because I was on the <i>Today with Sean O'Rourke</i>radio programme to speak about broadband, or rather the lack of it, in rural areas.  These issues are intermixed in the development of technologies and providing access to high speed broadband.  What the delegates have provided for us is very helpful.  We are charged with responsibility for making laws that will attempt to regulate how technologies are rolled out and people behave when using them and it is a struggle for us.  We are used to dealing with the old issues of law and order, physical evidence, transport, etc.  As all of this is dealt with in a cyber environment, it is much harder to understand.  <br/><br/>From the presentation I see that the delegates, as a group, are developing and creating an environment in which responsible behaviour will be the guide, rather than attempting to create laws to try to regulate activities.  Just because one can do certain things with technology does not mean that one should do them.  Someone can drive a car at 150 mph along a road, but he or she should not do so because it would put lives in danger.  We should have that mindset in the use of technology.  I liked what the delegates said about not necessarily restricting access to phones in school but ensuring there was a responsible approach to what one could do with one.  It is a tool.  Parents may need to contact their children, or they may need to obtain information.  There should, however, be some restrictions in accessing social media, which would be very good.  <br/><br/>I compliment the delegates on the approach they are taking.  It is very clear that if tech companies or social media platforms were forced to provide access for parents or the authorities, as sure as night follows day, two kids in a garage would create another app and model to which everybody would migrate.  The ways around technology far surpass that approach.  Whatever we do has to empower social responsibility, which was previously taught in school.  It is now harder because of all of the technologies available.  My daughter is in transition year and has just been involved in a project to make a video on online bullying.  It concerns overweight children and how their images can be doctored which can lead to them being laughed at and they can end up isolated as a result.  My daughter's project is using technology in a positive way.  She texted me recently to ask me to share it.  This shows how technology can be used in a good way, in this case by showing how someone's behaviour, even if he or she is being jocose, can have a profound affect on the life of the person being bullied.  <br/><br/>I have listened very carefully to what the delegates said.  It should be helpful to us in addressing the big issue.  <br/><br/>The digital age of consent should be explored further.  We can put much greater pressure on the big social media platforms in that regard.  There are apps for communication, but the operators of big social media apps have vast amounts of money.  They are tracking everything a person does online, with the aim of eventually marketing to them directly at a later stage.  If they capture a person at 12 or 13 years of age, they hope to track everything he or she will do for his or her entire life and sell things to him or her along the way.  The aim is not to facilitate chats with friends.  From a regulatory point of view, we have to look at ways in which we can force them to make it harder for people who wish to use these platforms for nefarious purposes or reasons.  It is not in any way to inhibit the normal banter that goes on between young people.</p></speech>

One of the most important tools is compassion.  In the delegates' presentation it was mentioned that the subject could be incorporated into social, personal and health education, SPHE, classes.  As legislators, we want to bring what we hear to a meaningful level in order that it can be introduced in law.  That might mean that we have to discuss the issue at the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs or with the Department of Education and Skills to see if it should be part of the curriculum and have a platform.  I very much advocate for the appointment of a digital safety commissioner who would help to protect everybody online.  However, we might be waiting some time for that measure to be enforced.  Perhaps, based on how Deputy Timmy Dooley is approaching the issue, it might not take too long, but sometimes things take a long time to come to fruition.  However, as we cannot afford to wait around, we have to find ways to empower schools and young people.  The delegates are a classic example that empowerment.  They are also empowering the younger classes coming through and creating a forum in which to have a conversation and provide knowledge.  They are leaders for many others who are watching the proceedings of the committee this morning, showing how it can be done.  Everyone can take ownership and control within his or her own school.  The report was carried out by Comhairle na n&Oacute;g.  I really liked how it carried out its surveys by going out and interviewing people.  That helps to provide the database we, as politicians, need to support the necessary changes.</p> <p>  The maturity of the content and the professional quality of the presentations are on a par with those made by everyone else who has come before us in the past few weeks.  They are professionals and this is what they do.  The delegates are students and they reached that high level.  The presentations were excellent and will be up on the Oireachtas website later when people will be able to see them.  The Irish Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Children, ISPCC, has already been tweeting about the presentations we have heard.  What the delegates are doing has been noticed and is invaluable and I have to praise them for it.  If they were in our position, what would they ask us to do, as legislators?  I am hung up on the idea of having a digital safety commissioner, but what would they suggest?  Does Ms Reynolds have suggestions for me, for example, on monitoring and how students are supported in education?  Some 40,000 books were provided, but the delegates probably did not get them in their schools.  They are fantastic books, but 40,000 is not enough to have one for everyone in the audience.  I received one and it is fabulous.  Everybody, particularly in first year, should get one at school.  What would the delegates suggest?</p></speech>

Ms Whelan and I are involved with an organisation which provides kits in SPHE classes.  They are really beneficial, but reaching out to every school and getting them in place across the country, rather than in just a select few, is important.  This issue does not affect just a select few; it affects everyone.  They should be brought to the Department of Education and Skills in order that the issue can be incorporated into SPHE classes.  Children should be taught how to use them properly from a young age.  If someone is informed from the start, it will prevent problems in the future.</p></speech>

I am no different from all of the other speakers.  Believe it or not, but I have three teenagers - one in transition year, one in second year and one in sixth class - and have been really hit by this issue.  I keep hearing the word "trust" and it is correct.  I always hear the phrase, "Trust me mam."  How do we bring parents on board?</p></speech>

In a different generation parents had to deal with the advent of drink, drugs and other issues that had the potential to impact negatively on children.  It is still a battle to address the issue of alcohol as some have the view that drugs are bad and drink is good.  At what age do young people start to drink?  The law indicates that a person must be 18 years, but there is scarcely a child who reaches 18 before he or she has had some interaction with drink.  There is an ongoing debate between parents and kids.  We must almost use the same channels and methodologies in dealing with this matter.  Is a young person allowed to go to a house party?  His or her parents might not be sure as they do not know the other parents.  Will they be in the house and who else is going to the party?  These are all issues, but we have managed to reach some compromise between parents and kids.  We almost need to use the same common sense approach in dealing with this issue.</p></speech>

We have received formal apologies from Deputy Colm Brophy and from Deputy Mattie McGrath who has let us know that he may be late.  I ask that mobile phones be put on silent or turned off.  I am delighted to be able to engage today with Mr. Michael Russell, MSP and Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland's Place in Europe.  I warmly welcome him, Ms Kirsty Hamilton and Mr. John Webster to our committee.  We are delighted that they have taken time out of their busy schedule to be with us.  It is not every day that we have a Scottish Minister join us.  We appreciate the opportunity to engage with him.</p><p>The UK's vote to leave the EU is something that I very much regret but respect.  As a committee, we have made an effort to track the negotiations, to engage with our own Minister, the European Commission, the European Parliament and committees from other parliaments, including Westminster and Mr. Russell's own parliament.  Only two weeks ago, we met a delegation from the Committee on Culture, Tourism, Europe and External Relations of the Scottish Parliament.  We also met ambassadors from EU member states.  The British ambassador has also engaged with us.  All of this has been helpful on all sides.  It must be quite a challenge for devolved administrations so we are particularly pleased that the witnesses have been able to join us today to share their insights with us.  While the move in December from phase 1 to phase 2 of the negotiations was extremely welcome, there is still much ground to cover and very little time in which to do it.  From where we stand, we have to respect the decisions and stated wishes of the British Government to leave the customs union and-or the Single Market, but there are circles to be squared which are linked to all of these decisions.  They are not without serious consequences.  For our engagement today, I ask Mr. Russell to make an opening statement and we will then take questions from our members.</p><p>Before that, I have to say a word on privilege.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that members should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Before Mr. Russell commences, I welcome everybody in the Public Gallery, including our ambassador from Georgia.  I remind our members of the good taste that Mr. Russell has.  As Senator Coghlan knows, he had the good sense, a couple of weeks ago, to attend a very important conference in the tourism capital of the world, Killarney in County Kerry.</p></speech>

One thing that struck me about the minister was his long experience in politics, his lifetime of dedication to public service, the fact that he represents a primarily rural area, including many islands.  I found him fascinating to speak to.  The only problem I had was that I did not get to speak to him for long enough which is why I knew that members of the committee would be grateful and appreciative of the fact that he could come here, which is why I asked him on that night.  We welcome Mr. Russell and we appreciate and respect that he took time to come here in a politically busy time for him at home.  I ask Mr. Russell to give us his thoughts.</p></speech>

Ann an litreachas clasaigeach na h-&Egrave;ireann, tha an duan &ldquo;Deirdre a&rsquo; F&agrave;gail na h-Albann&rdquo; a&rsquo; sealltainn an ceangal eadar an d&agrave; dh&ugrave;thaich againn a tha a&rsquo; dol air ais c&ograve;rr is mìle bliadhna.  San rann seo, tha Deirdre ag r&agrave;dh mu dheidhinn gleann s&ograve;nraichte:</p><blockquote>Gleann Da-Ruail, Gleann Da-Ruail,<br /><br />Mo chean do gach fear dar dual,<br /><br />Is binn guth cuthaige,<br /><br />Air craobh chrom,<br /><br />Air am binn os Gleann Da-Ruail.</blockquote> <p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to give evidence today.  As I have just said in Scottish Gaelic, a classic of Irish literature is Deirdre's Farewell to Scotland.  In that work, which links the ancient cultures of our two countries, she remarks on a particular Scottish glen, in my own constituency, Glendaruel, and says of it</p><blockquote>Glendaruadh, Glendaruadh,<br /><br />My delight in every man who belongs to it.<br /><br />Sweet is the voice of the cuckoo<br /><br />On the bending tree,<br /><br />Sweet it is above Glendaruadh. </blockquote> <p>I not only represent that glen but have lived in it for 25 years, and I represent a constituency which includes the Mull of Kintyre, the closest spot in Scotland to the island of Ireland.  Therefore, I feel close in every sense and deeply honoured to be, I think, the first Scottish Minister to give evidence to a committee of this Parliament.<br/><br/>The Scottish Government recognises Ireland's unique position in this Brexit debate and on the wider European scene.  Ireland's close links with the UK were reiterated by the T&aacute;naiste in his speech at Chatham House last week, and its full and wholehearted membership of the EU were delineated well by the Taoiseach in the European Parliament last month.  Scotland is therefore particularly pleased that Ireland is our closest international partner as it stands in a position of both great knowledge and great influence.  Our countries have had strong links for generations and these links touch all of us in many different ways.  For my part, I was honoured in 2013, as a member for Argyll and Bute, to welcome Ireland's President to Iona, Eilean Idhe, as part of the 1,450th celebrations of the landing of another Irishman on that island, Colum Kille.  I spent a considerable part of my time when I was much younger in this city building the Celtic Media Festival, now in its 40th year, which I founded on the island of Benbecula in 1980 and which had as its first chairman Muiris Mac Conghail, then controller of RT&Eacute; 1.<br/><br/>Those cultural exchanges thrive to this day.  I do not need to tell the Chairman, with his deep knowledge of traditional music, that Ireland is a country of honour at this year's 25th Celtic Connections Festival which finished in Glasgow last weekend.  I recall being in Kerry to give a lecture at the Blasket Centre some years ago, drawing on my own work on photographers of the Scottish islands.  Our links, rooted in a shared and collaborative past, are robust.  They continue to grow despite the difficult present, as is evidenced by the resources we have put into and the importance we attach to our innovation and investment hub in Dublin, led by Mr. John Webster.  Such links will be of great importance for our future.<br/><br/>I will address the subject in hand, Brexit, and the questions of where we are, how we got here, and where are we going.  The committee will no doubt be aware that Scotland voted overwhelmingly to remain in the EU.  Current polls indicate that there would be an even bigger majority were the referendum to be held again today.  Like our Irish neighbours, we have been placed into an unwanted situation not of our own making.  There are two interconnected sets of negotiations.  One is the UK-EU negotiations on the UK's exit and the other, probably less well-known to the committee, is the intra-UK negotiations on a joined-up UK approach to the key exit issues and on the implications of Brexit for the devolved settlements.  We welcome that the principles of phase 1 of the negotiations were agreed in December.  We have always been very careful to say and do nothing that would impede such an outcome.  We are particularly mindful of the importance of ensuring that the progress to peace made in the North is not jeopardised in any way by either governmental action or careless talk.  We regret the ambiguity from the UK Government on many of these matters and the constant appeasement of the hard right, ideological Brexiteers.  We welcome the UK Government's guarantee that there will be no hard border in Ireland.  That must be delivered and therefore we will watch with interest to see how that happens, especially after the Downing Street pronouncement on the customs union this week.</p><p>It is imperative that the UK's exit not undermine the progress we have seen over the past 20 years.<br/><br/>Looking ahead to phase 2, the risks associated with negative outcomes are even greater.  From a Scottish perspective, we have closely analysed the potential impact.  Just last month, we published Scotland's Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment, which presents the potential implications for Scotland's economy if the UK finally exits the EU.  It sets out the cost to Scotland of exiting the EU by considering three scenarios: staying in the Single Market and customs union; reverting to WTO rules; and the middle ground of some sort of Canadian-style free trade agreement.  The evidence clearly demonstrates that, in any scenario short of full EU membership, Brexit will significantly weaken the Scottish economy and result in slower economic growth and lower incomes compared with remaining in the EU.  For example, we estimate that a hard, WTO rules, Brexit could lead to a loss of 8.5% of GDP in Scotland by 2030, equivalent to &pound;2,300 per individual.<br/><br/>Every committee member has a copy of the document and I would be pleased to elaborate on it.  It concludes that the only acceptable alternative to EU membership is membership of the Single Market and customs union, although that would also result in some economic damage.  Nothing less will do, which is a conclusion that we believe the UK Government's own internal analysis has also reached.  In that regard, we are in full agreement with what the T&aacute;naiste said today in County Louth, urging the UK to stay in the Single Market and customs union.  He stated: &quot;The closest possible customs and regulatory partnership is in the best interests of everybody ... across these islands, and indeed in the best interests of the European Union and its future also.&quot;<br/><br/>We are committed to working with the UK Government as constructively as we can as negotiations and preparations progress.  However, we have concerns around how it has managed this process to date and the impact that will have on the devolution settlement.  I will address that matter briefly now.<br/><br/>We continue to press the UK Government to agree a means by which the Scottish Government can play a direct and representative role within the UK's negotiation with the EU.  As made clear by the terms of reference of the Joint Ministerial Committee (EU Negotiations), JMC (EN), of which I am the Scottish member, all four UK governments should have oversight of the negotiations to ensure as far as possible that agreed outcomes are secured.  The deeply regrettable lack of a functioning Assembly in Northern Ireland has caused difficulties, but that is no excuse for the way the JMC (EN) has functioned or, rather, failed to function.<br/><br/>The next phase will be significantly tougher.  It is therefore essential that all governments across the UK be fully involved in the negotiations on the UK's future relationship with the EU, something that has not happened in the past.  We also need to be fully engaged in agreeing on the endpoint, something that was again promised in the terms of the reference of the JMC (EN) but has not yet been delivered.  This matter has been the subject of correspondence this week between the First Minister, Ms Nicola Sturgeon, and the Prime Minister.<br/><br/>The introduction of the European Union (Withdrawal) Bill in the UK Parliament represents a considerable problem for us, as it is clearly a power grab, reserving to Westminster responsibilities for matters currently covered by EU law in devolved areas.  The Bill is the main vehicle for a legal withdrawal.  <i>Inter alia</i>, however, it empowers UK Ministers to make changes in devolved policy areas without the involvement of the Scottish Government and Scottish Parliament.  It also takes straight back to Westminster all the areas of devolved competence currently shared with Europe.  Concerns about this approach are shared by all parties in the Scottish Parliament, including the Conservatives.  The parties agree that the Bill is incompatible with devolution.  The Welsh Government has similar concerns and worked with us to publish amendments, which would have enabled us to recommend consent to the Scottish Parliament.<br/><br/>Now that the Bill is in the House of Lords, in which the SNP does not participate because we believe that election is a pre-requisite for legislators, the disquiet has intensified.  Lord Hope, the former distinguished Scottish judge and leader of the crossbenchers, said in the Second Reading debate on the Bill said last week: &quot;I am astonished by this Bill's failure to respect [the devolution] settlement in its formulation of the regulation-making powers given to Ministers.&quot;<br/><br/>Unless there are significant changes to the Bill, we will not recommend that the Scottish Parliament should give its consent.  The Welsh Government is providing the same recommendation to the Welsh Assembly.  Such consent, though a constitutional convention, has never been refused in such circumstances.  Discussions continue on the potential for amendments to be made, and the UK Government has expressed an intention to table amendments in the House of Lords.  However, it has still not agreed to correct the key defects of the Bill or provided the wording of those amendments for agreement with the devolved administrations.<br/><br/>I am happy to give further information on the structures that exist and the difficulties that we are experiencing, but let me first make a couple of final points that may give us a little hope for the future.<br/><br/>Ireland is Scotland's sixth largest export market and there are already more than 100 Irish companies invested in Scotland.  These companies employ approximately 6,300 people across the country and contribute turnover to the Scottish economy of &pound;3 billion.  During her visit to Ireland last year, our First Minister spoke of the opportunities ahead for Ireland and Scotland to move forward with a sense of shared self-interest.  We believe that there is limitless potential for the economies of Ireland, the North and Scotland to become even more closely bound along what might be called a Celtic business corridor and to deepen our relationship in that way.<br/><br/>Just this morning, I was impressed by the ABP Food Group plant in Cahir, County Tipperary.  ABP has a major plant in Perth, Scotland.  The great brands of Irish and Scottish beef are building a global market together, but Brexit is a useless and unforeseen impediment to making that relationship grow and flourish.<br/><br/>We have much in common and much to discuss.  Scotland needs to mitigate the undoubted damage that may be wrought on our economy and our society by Brexit.  No matter how difficult, we need to find positive solutions.  In passing, let me commend the Irish Government's approach in the matter of supporting SMEs to address the Brexit issues facing them, something that we are looking to emulate.<br/><br/>Brexit continues to cloud our horizon.  As the UK and the EU 27 turn to phase 2 of the negotiations, Scotland not only continues to strive to establish a constructive relationship with the UK that allows us to offer compromises and to co-operate, but also wants to be heard by the 27 so that there is an understanding of our unique position, our need for differentiation and our desire, if it is at all possible, not to lose our European citizenship and the closest of links with a European ideal that has helped to deliver peace and prosperity on our Continent for half a century.  In short, we must be heard, and we intend to be heard.<br/><br/>For those who want to drag us out of Europe against our will, their triumph can only come if there is, in the words of that great Kerry poet, Brendan Kennelly, the &quot;Supremacy of silence&quot;.  We will not be silent.  Of course, we will continue to be steadfast in our support of an outcome that recognises the particular needs of this island.  We will continue to forge a positive future partnership between us, recognising not just our shared interests, but also our shared identities, which will not change.  M&ograve;ran taing.</p></speech>

As he said, we have a great deal in common.  Unfortunately, people decided over our heads that they would go in a different direction.  It was not a wise decision.  Mr. Farage was in Ireland last week.  At the time of the referendum, he illustrated to people the massive benefits that would accrue from leaving the EU.  I have not seen them manifest since, but they amounted to multiples of billions of pounds.  It is sad that people voted on the basis of what was at best misinformation.  The Minister's assessment of it was correct.</p> <p>  On the other side of the coin, there are considerable benefits to being in a market of 500 million people.  Regardless of what anyone says or the attitudes to be found within that market, this is especially the case for exporting countries like Scotland and Ireland.</p> <p>  Regarding the Minister's assessment of the Northern Ireland situation, we cannot move from that position.  We are committed to it, given that we are joint sponsors of the Good Friday Agreement alongside the UK, the US and the EU, all of whom signed up to it.  It would be a catastrophe if we moved even an inch away from it.  As everyone knows, if we move at all, that becomes the starting point and we eventually end up heading in that direction.</p> <p>  The odd disconsolate word comes from within the EU.</p><p>Every household has that problem from time to time and we do not worry about it.  We have to deal with it in the ordinary course of the day's political and economic events.  That is part and parcel of what we do.  I agree with the Chairman that the best thing that could happen would be a reconsideration.  That is still a possibility.  I cannot see what the benefits of non-membership of the European Union could be for 65 million people.  The suggestion is that it will enable Britain to open up new markets.  The world is a different place from what it was 40 years ago and it is changing every day.  The market beside us is the one we most treasure, the same is true for Scotland and the UK.  We are all each other's best partners in trade.  When it comes to football and rugby we differ slightly, otherwise we have many common interests.  <br/><br/>Mr. Russell's use of Irish poets is interesting.  I mentioned John Donne's poem &quot;No Man is an Island&quot; to Bill Cash when he was here.  The opening lines are very important: </p><blockquote>No man is an island entire of itself; every man <br /><br />is a piece of the continent, a part of the main; <br /><br />if a clod be washed away by the sea, Europe <br /><br />is the less, . . .</blockquote><p>So are those who leave.  It ends with: &quot;And therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls; It tolls for thee.&quot;  It is very pertinent.  Although it was written hundreds of years ago it identifies precisely what could happen in this situation and it is happening in front of our eyes.<br/><br/>I hope reason will prevail.  I do not know whether it will but as long as there are people trying to point out the advantages of being outside the Single Market and its 500 million people I do not see any way for progress.  The expectation in some quarters in the UK is that there will be a change, the situation will be watered down and we will return to having borders.  That will not happen.  It would be a travesty.  It would be unbelievable for the political reality in this country, as the witnesses know.  We hope that Scotland's views will prevail.  As a member of the EU we will do our best to be a positive influence on the inside, to hold out the hand of friendship and to maintain the contacts that have been established with those who wish to maintain them in the coming years.</p></speech>

They are extremely welcome.  I welcome him to this meeting and commend the work of the Scottish Office in Dublin on all it has been doing over the past few trying months in this area, and in developing other positive areas.</p> <p>  Mr. Russell mentioned the idea of a Celtic arc and one of his colleagues has imaginatively discussed a bridge from Scotland to Northern Ireland.  That is well and good as something to aspire to but there is already obvious common ground between our two countries, in financial services, the arts, higher education and sport, that goes beyond the historical and cultural ties.  I say that as a proud Ulster Scot of the Graham clan.  How do we develop this post-Brexit?  How does Mr. Russell view the end point, March 2019, when this delightful event comes to pass?  What exactly does the lack of consent mean in respect of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly?  I know it is a matter of course and is usually taken for granted but what would its impact be?  Has the Scottish Government received any direct response to the First Minister's letter to Prime Minister May?  </p> <p>  Brexit is an absolute disaster.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit, for Ireland, Scotland, the EU or the UK as a whole.  Senator Feighan has a great expression, the UK has gone and shot itself in Ireland's foot.  My sympathies are with the Scottish people, because the English managed to get both of their feet and maybe a knee.  The noise coming from Westminster is increasingly frustrating and the accusations being made of the Irish Government, the Irish people and the European negotiating team are scandalous.  The hardline ideological Brexiteers who will not be materially affected by Brexit are stirring things up beyond their remit and making them worse for their constituents.  If the UK leaves without a deal and the economy comes crashing down they will remain personally comfortable but their constituents will see factories close, foodstuffs rotting in the ground and animals stuck in ports.  Every time we listen to British media and hear that noise coming from the extreme wing of certain parties it makes us blue in the face.</p> <p>  The European Commission and the Irish Government, which is Europe in this matter, take in absolute good faith, and want to proceed with, what was agreed twice in December, despite what happened in the week between.  The lack of detail coming from the British Government, the sheer confusion and offensive language from supporters of that Government within the British Parliament make it extremely difficult for everyone to continue in a rational, reasonable way.  We did not ask for Brexit.  We do not want it.  We cannot be expected to tell the British Government how it can develop its policy or how the Border will be enforced.  The best situation is for the UK to remain within the EU.  After that it is for the UK to remain within the customs union and the Single Market, and to maintain as close a relationship as possible.  The Irish Government and the European negotiating team are desperate for a level of detail and understanding from the British Government that have not been forthcoming at any stage in the process.  This was first requested back in July.  A deadline was missed in October and in November, and a deal was made in December that will define the rest of the negotiations.  I appeal to the Scottish Government and members of Mr. Russell's party in Westminster to keep the pressure up, be that within Westminster or at the committee Mr. Russell sits on.  A deal has to happen.  I do not mean to be dramatic but if there is no deal the sky will metaphorically fall in.</p></speech>

Mr. Russell's talk was as good and positive as the one he gave at our recent Brexit conference in Killarney.  What he says about the Scottish stance and that Scotland will not be silent is heartening.  It is inconceivable that the British Government would countenance proceeding without the agreement of the Scottish Parliament and the Welsh Assembly.  That would mean that the United Kingdom would no longer be united.</p> <p>  Britain will not walk away from a market of 500 million people, no matter what the hard Brexiteers say or wish to do.  It will want the benefit of the Single Market and the customs union which it wants to leave, whatever the formula at the end of the day and no matter what it is called.  That will be for the wordsmiths.  It did a good job, even if there was a bit of fudge in phase one.  I hope it will do as good a job in phase two which is going on at the moment.  We all know that the British Cabinet and the Conservative Party are divided.  As the negotiation proceeds, it has already been somewhat flexible.</p><p>They are prepared to pay more money.  They want to stay as part of the EU schemes and they know they will have to pay more.  Maybe I am only hoping, but I think that in the give and take, this is what they will strive for.  Despite all the smog, at the finish they will have to get the detail of the wording legally right.  That will ensure that we have the North-South and east-west arrangement as is.</p><p> I am keen to hear what Mr. Russell thinks is going on.  I know we all have to put on our thinking caps and that we do not know.  The UK Government is sending out somewhat different signals.  What does Mr. Russell think is really going on in the negotiations that are proceeding in Brussels these days?</p></speech>

Mr. Russell put forward a positive approach in his submission to the committee.  I thank him for his commitment to Irish culture and Scottish culture over the years.  Mr. Russell has produced a document, Scotland's Place in Europe: People, Jobs and Investment.  It is worthwhile research into the effects of Brexit, where Scotland places itself and the role of the Sottish Parliament and Scottish Government.</p> <p>  It is particularly regrettable that there is no power-sharing in Northern Ireland at the moment and that we do not have Ministers from the North coming to our committee.  We have Scottish Ministers, people from Wales and people from the House of Commons and the House of Lords.  However, we have no Ministers coming from the North coming to our committee for a combined effort to have a united approach.</p> <p>  I appeal again today to both the major parties in Northern Ireland to put every difference aside.  Brexit must be the priority now.  Whatever differences they have - it can be a serious matter to implement agreements made in the past - in the circumstances they should take an example from the Scottish and Welsh Governments.  They are studying and are concerned about the future.  They can play a vital role especially in respect of the Border and what the Border means.  It runs to 499 km with 300 crossings that channel vast volumes of trade and the movement of people.  It would be inconceivable that there would be border posts or controls whatever the outcome.  A Northern Ireland Administration, Ministers and so forth would bring about a united approach from the island of Ireland as well.  I have not much more to say.  I appeal genuinely to all the negotiators to come together and to come up with the type of approach taken by Mr. Russell and his colleagues in Scotland.</p> <p>  From a cultural point of view, I note that Mr. Russell represents Argyll.  I have been to the castle of Argyll.  Mr. Russell might know about a lady from Roscommon called Elizabeth Gunning.  She had the good fortune to marry the Duke of Hamilton and then she went on to marry the Duke of Argyll.  I was in the castle in Argyll.  It is a stunning location and a great tourist attraction.  I hope that we could form some alignment between Roscommon and Argyll.  We could form some sort of documentary on the extraordinary events taking place at the time.  Her sister married and became a duchess as well.  They were an amazing family.  My mother was born in Glasgow but I toured that area.  It is stunning and I know that tourism is vital for the area.  I congratulate Mr. Russell on the work that he has done on the cultural side.  Maria, the sister, married the Earl of Coventry.  There are many connections between our county and the area of Argyll.  I hope we can develop that in future and that we can work together.  There is an extraordinary relationship between both countries.</p> <p>  I was disappointed that Scotland did not support the bid for the Rugby World Cup.  That was deeply disappointing.</p></speech>

Years ago, I visited Glasgow when it was European capital of culture.  Mr. Russell has whetted our appetite to visit some of the more rural areas, including his constituency.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Russell for his briefing on the situation as he sees it.  We appreciate his support for the position of the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland.  Mr. Russell mentioned that we need to see the Good Friday Agreement provisions implemented and that there should be no hard border and so on.  That support is greatly appreciated.</p> <p>  I had the pleasure of meeting the Scottish First Minister when she visited these Houses last year.  She addressed the Seanad at the time and she made a big impression.  It is great to see that Mr. Russell is following up her visit now as things progress.</p> <p>  There is a view that the agreement reached was perhaps something of a fudge in phase one of the negotiations.  I note that new negotiating directives have been agreed and those involved are going to try to put legal text on that agreement.  That would be welcome.  I imagine Mr. Russell would agree with that.</p> <p>  I note what Mr. Russell had to say in respect of membership of the customs union and the Single Market to the effect that these outcomes represent the next-best scenario.  I wonder what is going on in the Conservative Party and the internal dynamics of that party at this time.  Things are developing as we speak this week.  Perhaps Mr. Russell could comment, unless he believes it would be undiplomatic, in which case I would understand.  There is concern about what is going on internally in the Conservative Party with all of this.</p> <p>  I have two questions.  Mr. Russell referenced the EU-UK negotiations that everyone knows about.  He also mentioned the intra-UK negotiations but not a great deal is known about these.  Are these real and meaningful negotiations within the UK?  Does Mr. Russell believe he is getting a fair hearing?  I note the position of the Conservative Party traditionally in respect of these matters.  I am keen to know how those intra-UK negotiations are going.</p> <p>  My second question relates to the Scottish independence generally.  Scotland held a referendum.  What are the prospects for another referendum for Scottish independence in due course?  What are the dynamics leading into that?  I am keen to know what Mr. Russell has to say about that issue as well.</p></speech>

I will do my best to try to address most of them.  They fall into natural groupings.  I will say something about UK Government and its function.  I will say something about the processes, including intra-UK and legislative consent processes.  I realise the detail will not be completely familiar to committee members.  I will try to address some of the other issues, especially those relating to the Single Market and the customs union.</p> <p>  I will start with a quotation from the French Ambassador to the USA.  We are swapping quotations this afternoon which is no great harm.  He pointed out rather pithily that he could not understand how the cause of free trade was being furthered by the UK Government if it was abandoning the biggest free trade bloc in the work and 53 free trade agreements.  There is no sense to this.  Anyone who tries to struggle with it on the basis of reason will have to give up.  There is no sense to this.</p> <p>  There has been a long-term campaign, by a small number of people to start with, to leave the EU.  They hanker after a past that never existed.  That campaign has continued to grow.  It has been fed, often by the tabloid newspapers, and in certain parts of the UK it has been successful, although not in all the parts.  In Scotland, 62% voted to remain compared to 38% who voted to leave.  I think the remain percentage would be certainly in the high 60s now.  I have no wish to play it down, but in some areas and sectors there were genuine complaints about the EU.</p><p>For example, I represent many fishing communities.  There was a very strong feeling that the Common Fisheries Policy had failed those communities and I agree with them.  It had failed those communities and it is not a policy that we could accept with equanimity.  It would have to change very substantially in the future.  However, there are many other policies that work particularly well and the general purpose of the EU has succeeded.  It is important to remember when the UK joined the EU in the 1970s, it had two failed applications.  When it joined at the third attempt, it did so out of economic necessity because it was almost an economic basket case.  If we look at the figures, we can see that productivity and GDP grew.  This was overwhelmingly a good thing for the UK economy.  By extension, one would have to say that leaving must overwhelmingly be a bad thing.  <br/><br/>In respect of the first question addressed by Deputy Durkan in terms of what the benefits of this are, they are entirely illusory.  There are people who will go around telling us that there will be all these wonderful free trade agreements that will be possible and that this is not true in the EU.  If this was true, why would Germany be one of the most successful trading nations in the world?  There is no such restraint nor are all these countries queuing up to do these trade deals.  India is a very good example.  The argument has always been that India does not have a trade agreement with the EU and has, therefore, been held back in some way by the EU and the UK will do one.  The holding back has been the UK's problem, not the EU's problem.  It is the UK that has been the difficulty in securing that.<br/><br/>When the Prime Minister went to India last year, she went on the basis that she would find some pot of gold.  She came away empty handed because the Indian deal will be dependent on an increase in migration.  Migration is the <i>ide&eacute; fixe</i>of the Tory Party.  It cannot accept migration so that deal cannot be done.  We find again and again that this is the situation.  This is why one of the more worrying aspects of this is the attempt to take powers to Westminster that should rightly be in Scotland and Wales because they will require things to trade away.  They will require agriculture to trade away.  The issues relating to access by Brazilian beef are issues that they will attempt to trade away in order to get advantage so this is a really serious set of circumstances.  So on the issue of advantages, I must say there are no great advantages.  This will not be a beneficial process.  Senator Richmond was right.  There is no such thing as a good Brexit.  The Prime Minister uses the term all the time.  It does not exist.  <br/><br/>When one starts with that position, one must begin to go into some detail about what the alternatives are.  I think we are all agreed that the only acceptable next step, which is not as good, would be Single Market and customs union membership.  I do not believe rationality will kick in any time soon.  Senator Coghlan is hopeful but I do not see that happening because this is an ideological battle.  This is a battle for the soul of the Conservative Party, the most successful governing party in the world.  No other party has held government longer.  It is about the survival of the Conservative Party and in those circumstances, it cannot survive if it splits completely on this so there will be a fudge - a continuing fudge.  This fudge will go on.  I do not expect there to be much clarity about the final deal from the UK Government.  I know it is very frustrating for the governments of the 27 member states to negotiate with people who will not say what they want because if they say what they want, they will automatically alienate half of their own people.  <br/><br/>We suffer the same problem.  We are negotiating.  I come to intra-UK negotiations.  We are negotiating with a UK Government that does not know what it wants.  It knows what it does not want.  I was very intrigued to see that this was apparently the summation of Michel Barnier's conversations with my opposite number in the UK Government, David Davis, this week, which was that when he sat down, he heard a great deal about what it did not want but when he got up, he still did not know what it did want.  That is what we are facing so we have a serious set of difficulties.  <br/><br/>Deputy Haughey asked about the relationship in negotiation.  It is very poor.  We endeavour to build it.  We have been endeavouring to build it for the past 18 months.  We have not really got very far and the reason is because the main vehicle is the Joint Ministerial Committee (EU Negotiations).  I will not go into the full detail of the joint ministerial structure.  Suffice to say that it was established at the time of devolution in 1999 to make sure devolved administrations had some sort of formal contact and context with the UK Government.  By and large, it has been a complete failure.  Lots of parliamentary committees and academics have examined it.  It has no great strengths.  It has no dispute resolution procedure, or none worth having.  The UK Government decides the dispute resolution procedures but as the dispute is usually with the UK Government, it is scarcely fair.  I think any of its committees have only met twice since 1999 outside London.  It is always chaired by a Minister from the UK Government.  I have been a member on and off of various parts of it.  I attended one meeting of the Joint Ministerial Committee on Europe in London which was attended by 23 Ministers from the UK Government, the Welsh First Minister, Rhodri Morgan, and I.  This was hardly fair or an equity of arms.<br/><br/>The structure does not work but there is nothing else.  We established a new part of it called the Joint Ministerial Committee (EU Negotiations), which had a very clear written remit.  The two most important parts of it were to seek to agree the terms of the Article 50 letter.  We never saw the Article 50 letter.  I am a member of it.  It never happened.  We were meant to meet every month.  We met four times and then it stopped meeting because if it had continued to meet, my Welsh counterpart, Mark Drakeford, and I would have had to see the letter and we were never shown it.<br/><br/>The committee was weakened by Northern Ireland not being present.  At the first two meetings, the Northern Irish representatives were Arlene Foster and Martin McGuinness.  They were very important members and saw it as very important.  When Mr. McGuinness became ill, a number of other representatives came for two meetings and then they stopped coming.  That does weaken the committee.  I agree entirely with Senator Leyden that something has to happen.  There must be an Administration because it is weakening the possibility of moving forward.  That committee did not meet from February 2017 until the second week in October 2017 so it went without a meeting during that period.  It met again on 12 December last year and we are still waiting for another meeting.  I pay tribute to Damien Green who, as chair of that committee with responsibility for devolution, was making progress.  He was streamlining it and trying to get it to work but we now have another Minister to replace him, David Lidington, and we do not know how this will work.  <br/><br/>The second objective of this committee was to have oversight of the negotiations in so far as they addressed the devolved competencies.  That committee is now vital because it should be meeting on a regular basis - monthly or more regularly - and discussing the negotiating process but it is not doing so.  This reflects upon the basic core weakness of the situation, which is that the UK Government is paralysed by the ideological dispute and is, therefore, unable to move forward in a rational or constructive way.  Therefore, everything suffers from that.<br/><br/>We recognise what we hear of the problems of negotiation with the EU 27 from our own experience.  We do not want this to happen.  We would much rather we were not here but if it is going to happen, it must happen in an intelligent and rational way.  Scotland is the nation of the Enlightenment.  We try to bring a rational and evidence-based view of policy and it is not happening.  If the analysis carried out by the UK Government is the same as our own, it shows that this is pretty disastrous and, therefore, the only sensible thing would be to go for the Single Market and the customs union.  The Irish Government knows that.  We know that.  The UK analysis knows that.  The other 26 members apart from Ireland know this.  Why then would the UK Government not accept that this is the case and find a way to do so because it also squares the circle in terms of negotiation?  It makes the context of negotiation actually work.  <br/><br/>I will address very briefly some of the other points that have been raised.  I think I have covered some of them.  I will not go into the minutiae of people who marry dukes or duchesses - I have never aspired to either.  I will come to tourism because I think it is important.  There are three areas where Brexit will touch almost everybody to a greater or lesser extent.  One of them is people, usually labour shortages.  There will be a massive shortage in hospitality.  We already have a shortage.  We know that there is a Europe-wide shortage of agricultural labour.  This is why Ukrainian workers are working in Germany.  That will continue to be the case.  There will be shortages in a variety of other sectors.  EU nationals in the labour market in Scotland are a bit like a horseshoe.  There is a predominance in lower-skilled jobs and highly skilled jobs and something in between.</p><p>We have five of the world's top 200 universities, which is unique for a country of our size, but 25% of staff are EU nationals so we are very heavily dependent on EU labour.  In the Highlands and Islands of Scotland, the area I represent, one fifth of the workforce will retire in the next five to ten years, amounting to just over 80,000 people.  We are not producing people to replace them so we either have migration or we lose services, businesses and other things.</p><p> People are the first issue and the second is regulation.  One cannot be part of something for almost half a century and not have an entwined regulatory system.  Over 90% of our food standards regulation is European.  How do we disentangle that?  The third issue is money.  There is a series of fiscal flows, one way or the other, and it will be difficult to unravel those to give guarantees for the future.  In the area of agricultural payments, we believe Pillar 1 payments are guaranteed but there is no guarantee at all for Pillar 2 payments so rural development moneys will disappear for a period, which will be disastrous, leaving aside a range of economic and social policy.  There are big issues in all three areas.</p><p> Senator Richmond asked a number of very important questions.  As for timescale, March 2019 is a date for leaving but the Prime Minister, who started off saying there would be no transition and no implementation period, now says the Government wants a transition period and is trying to negotiate it.  If it gets one, the EU has suggested the end of 2020, which fits with the financial framework.  I do not think anybody realistically believes the work can be finished by then so there is an indeterminate period in which something may or may not happen.  There is no point avoiding a cliff edge if one is going to fall off it in 2020 so we need to find a way through.  So far the Government is refusing to talk about it and that is a problem because at some stage it will have to say we are leaving formally in 2019.  After that we will go into limbo, for example, in respect of the fishing negotiations where we will not be part of the annual quota discussions.  That is a much worse situation.  There will be a period in which things will change but we do not know what that period is.  The driver of this, as ever, will be internal UK politics and the UK Government will have to go to the people before May 2022, if not sooner, so it will have to have something it believes it can talk about before then.</p><p> Some of the work Mr. John Webster and his team are doing to build businesses and investment is a good foundation for the Celtic arc.  I have seen many proposals for fixed links and in the 19th century there was a proposal for a railway tunnel between the North of Ireland and Campbeltown.  I believe it is a great idea as it would open up my constituency.  A lot of talking needs to be done on that and recent coverage indicates it should happen.  As a local MSP, I would support it.</p><p> We need to be honest about consent.  We cannot veto the withdrawal formally, though the UK Government could decide that if we do not give legislative consent at the last amending stage, namely, Report Stage in the House of Lords, it could put the Bill through anyway.  Legislative consent motions apply to parts of Bills so the UK Government could come to the devolved administration and identify the parts for which it required legislative consent, on the basis of legislating for our competence.  If we refused to do so, convention demands that those parts of the Bill be dropped.  What would probably happen is that the UK Government would impose those parts of the Bill, but the House of Lords seems to be increasingly of the view that a refusal of a legislative consent motion would be so serious that it would not pass the Bill.  If that were to happen, it would be very problematic for the UK Government.  We do not want a cliff edge and would rather agree a legislative consent motion but the Government knows what it requires to allow us to do that.  There are no ifs and buts and we have spelt it out in words of one syllable.  We put amendments forward which the Government voted down so now it has to tell us what amendments are acceptable.  If it cannot do that, we could pass our own Bill and the Welsh and Scottish governments are considering doing just that.  The Bills have been drafted and they are with our presiding officers for legislative scrutiny.  That is not the best solution and is probably a more complicated solution but may ultimately be necessary.  The UK Government would then have to veto the Bills and pass its own so it is a constitutional crisis.  Having said that, I contend that we have been in a constitutional crisis for the past year and it is only getting worse.</p><p> As Senator Richmond said, it is a disaster but the rational response is to find a way forward.  Membership of the Single Market and customs union is the way forward and we need to keep saying it, even as the Prime Minister, in order to appease one wing of her party, says it should not happen while others in her party say it might happen.  It is the only possible compromise that is left.  We have been offering it for well over a year and far from being hardline, we have been trying to negotiate.  It may well be, as Deputy Haughey said, that at the end of the process there will have to be a vote across the UK and there are a number of proposals for a second referendum, which is not unknown in this country.  It could not ask people the same question but it could ask them if they agreed with a negotiated deal.  In those circumstances we would have to have an arrangement which recognised that, if Scotland voted to reject a settlement and the rest of the UK accepted it, we would have to find a mechanism to take us forward.  We could not repeat the crisis we are in now, with Scotland having voted to stay in the EU while England voted to leave.  As Senator Coghlan heard me say in Killarney, in the end it is the people who will decide and that is how it has to be, whether it is through the ballot box or a referendum.  It will probably be the most serious decision they will have to make in a long time.  For our part, we regard the whole thing as one that must produce a result other than the one the UK Government wants.</p></speech>

We have had very close ties with Scotland over the years and we feel as though we are the same type of people.  After our meeting in Killarney, both Senator Coghlan and I felt it would be beneficial to invite Mr. Russell to come before the committee and give evidence, and I think we were right about that.  We can work on what we have heard in the challenging months and years ahead.  Scotland will have the same problems as we will have and we will be close allies.  I commend Mr. Russell on his great work ethic over many decades and for the way he has served his community.  I read a bit about him yesterday evening and I was very impressed by everything I read.  It is no wonder he has been around for a long time and we all agree with his views on many of the issues.  I also thank Ms Hamilton and Mr. Webster.  I hope the witnesses enjoy the rest of their trip to Dublin and Ireland.</p></speech>

From the Irish College of General Practitioners, ICGP, I welcome Dr. John O'Brien, vice president and incoming president, Dr. Brendan O'Shea, director, postgraduate resource centre, and Dr. Brian Osborne, assistant director, postgraduate resource centre, with special responsibility for mental health.  On behalf of the committee I thank the representatives for their attendance here today.  The format of the meeting is that they will be invited to make a brief opening statement, which will be followed by questions and answers.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw witnesses' attention to the situation in regard to privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses to turn of their mobile telephones.  That is very important because they interfere with the sound system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting and television coverage and web streaming will be adversely affected.  I would be very grateful if they would switch their phones to airplane mode.</p> <p>  I wish to advise witnesses that any submission or opening statement made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I invite the representatives to make their opening statements.  We will start with Mr. Ray Henry.</p></speech>

The IACP would like to acknowledge the work of the committee to date and welcomes and supports the increased focus on mental health and well-being.  We fully endorse the integration of mental health services into the primary care sector and our accredited counsellors and psychotherapists have a key role to play in ensuring the success of this initiative.<br/><br/>One of the strongest messages to come out of the consultation that fed into A Vision for Change was that people with poor mental health wanted alternatives to medication, including access to counselling and psychotherapy.  A Vision for Change<i></i>further highlighted the under-development of our mental health services.  One rural survey found that although one in three GP adult attendees presented with psychological distress, just 11% were in receipt of mental health services.  According to the HSE, 54% of GPs in the north-east region said they would have preferred to have counselling available at their GP practice.  The region identified a gap in availability of counselling, with many GPs reporting that they did not refer patients for counselling because of a lack of relevant counselling services, waiting lists and cost.  A Vision for Change<i></i>recommends the provision of an integrated, recovery focused care delivered in the community, primarily by multidisciplinary teams.  To date there has been slow progress in the implementation of this policy.<br/><br/>In this regard the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, IACP, proposes that the State adopt a programme for the treatment of mild to moderate depression broadly modelled on the very successful initiative known as Counselling for Depression, CfD, in Britain.  The committee members will have received a separate briefing which sets out the detail of this programme.  In summary, this programme trains counsellors to provide a depression specific therapy for individual clients within the National Health Service, NHS.  Professor David Murphy who joins us from Nottingham University is an expert in this area and will speak in more detail to the committee about the success of this programme in Britain.<br/><br/>Our UK equivalent, the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, BACP, developed the programme at the request of the NHS following the introduction in Britain of the national improving access to psychological therapies, IAPT programme.  This programme aims to make therapy free on the NHS for low-intensity mental illness, where previously medication was almost the only option.  The Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, IACP, is proposing that an initiative similar to counselling for depression, CfD, be developed in Ireland and that the IACP would partner with the HSE in developing a tailor-made solution for the Irish system.  The IACP strongly believes that there is a need for greater availability of evidence-based talking therapies for people with common mental health conditions, that are accessible via primary care services and general practice.  Our members are ideally placed to deliver such evidence based therapies which will serve to fill a clearly identified gap.<br/><br/>IACP also believes that access to counselling and psychotherapy services should be available on a universal basis to all those in need of such a service.  One way to increase accessibility for the generality of the people in Ireland is to make the services more affordable.  As an interim measure we request that serious consideration be given to expanding the existing supports which provide tax relief for medical expenses and also the range of health related benefits that are provided for under the PRSI system, and that this be taken into consideration as part of the wider reform of the PRSI system.  Reform of the PRSI system to include options such as counselling and psychotherapy would support mental health services as well as physical health services.<br/><br/>I now hand over to Professor David Murphy who will speak about the counselling for depression, CfD, initiative in the United Kingdom.</p></speech>

This initiative was set to roll out evidence-based therapies in order to make it possible for people to access a range of talking therapy, free at the point of access.  The particular type of therapy that I am familiar with and of which we have been part of the roll out is based on a person centred and an experiential approach to therapy.  It is recognised as a high intensity therapy so that means one can work with people who have both mild and also moderate and sometimes severe depression.  The therapies recommended by IAPT is approved by the NHS and was supported and developed by the British Association for Counselling Psychotherapy in conjunction with IAPT.</p> <p>  The therapy is manualised, so what this means is that a series of competencies have been drawn down from a framework, including drawing out from a series of randomised controlled trials of either person-centred therapy, experiential therapy and comparing that with CBT or with controls or against each.  The parts of those therapies that were considered to be effective have then been put together into this manual and a training programme has been developed.  This means that alongside CBT, people are able to access a choice of therapies and this has been at the heart of and roll out of IAPT.</p> <p>  The therapy is provided by qualified and trained therapists who then engage in this additional training in the manual.  The manual is about bringing together the competencies and upskilling a workforce that already exists that might well be underemployed or underutilised within the field of psychological therapies.  The training is about six to nine months but it only involves five days of contact in a training institution, the remainder of the training takes place while working on the job.  Once people are through the first five days they are ready to go and start delivering this type of therapy.</p> <p>  The training is about bringing people up to a certain level of competence and adherence in the manual and these competencies are drawn from generic, basic, specific, model specific and adaptions and some meta-competencies as well.  It means there is a whole range of therapists who can be moved into this particular manualised form of therapy and start to deliver it quite soon.  This type of therapy is what we consider and what we call a high intensity therapy.  That means a large number of people are able to access it.  It is recommended that they access this for up to 20 sessions - certainly at the most severe end, that should be available for them.</p><p>There is a range of benefits in having a number of therapies available other than the main therapy, cognitive behavioural therapy, which was the original large-scale roll-out within the IACP.  The data that is taken from those therapies as they are applied in routine practice suggest there is virtually no difference in effectiveness between CBT and counselling for depression.  There is a real opportunity to develop a pluralistic field of therapies that are effective and evidence based.  Clients and patients in the health service will benefit from a range of therapies.  Services benefit from having a range of therapies; patients will stay in therapy if they have a choice of therapy, because they will find the right one.  It saves on general practitioners if clients or patients can access the right type of therapy for them, rather than having only one type of therapy available to all people.  Generally, as people become enhanced in their well-being through having a range of different talking therapies, it has a wider benefit for families, societies, communities - everyone benefits.</p></speech>

When well supported and adequately resourced, GP teams can engage systematically in activities known to prevent and care for a range of mental health issues and medical conditions.  This is achieved through the use of brief interventions in respect of alcohol and tobacco, lifestyle interventions in the context of exercise and stress management as well as delivering ongoing community based care.</p> <p>  Elsewhere in the primary care domain, the counselling in primary care service, CIPC, provides off-site counselling for people who are significantly stressed, but this only applies for people who are eligible under the primary care reimbursement scheme, PCRS, or medical card scheme.  General practitioners' ability to refer to voluntary and-or private counselling services or specific services such as local addiction counselling varies depending on local circumstances and, crucially, on the ability of the individual to pay.  The ICGP is of the view that there is a major lack of capacity in this area of service provision.  On a system-wide basis, the volume of service provided by the CIPC is inadequate, and a majority of the population are ineligible for CIPC services.  The contribution of voluntary agencies is increasingly evident and important to GPs and people who use these services.</p> <p>  When a person attends general practice with a mental health issue, several approaches are explored.  The GP will engage in initial evaluation and diagnosis.  People mostly present with mild to moderate anxiety and depression.  In many instances, an opportunity for reflection, shared formulation of the issues, lifestyle advice, a cognitive approach grounded in a pre-existing understanding of the individual and their particular circumstances, signposting to relevant additional resources, and follow up at the practice level will enable many people to resolve the problems they experience.  This is particularly the case when the reflection is undertaken with a GP who has a deep and long-term knowledge of the individual, their circumstances and their past medical history.</p> <p>  Prevention, earlier diagnosis and management of problem use of alcohol and recreational drugs, or the presence of signs and symptoms of a range of psychiatric conditions including postpartum depression, self-harming, addictions, adjustment reaction to life events, abnormal grief reactions, obsessive compulsive disorder, OCD, borderline personality disorder, chronic anxiety disorder, or clinically significant depression will result in a more formal practice-based approach, the management of which will reflect the circumstances of the practice, and the needs of the individual.</p> <p>  The earliest diagnosis of severe spectrum or complex psychiatric diagnoses is also undertaken by GPs, including psychoses, bipolar affective disorder and high-risk suicidality.  These activities are undertaken across the full spectrum of people who attend, including those from deprived and affluent backgrounds, the young and the old.  At the severe or persistent end of the spectrum of clinical presentations, treatment will extend to pharmacotherapy and-or referral to psychiatry.</p> <p>  When practices are operating in a dearth of resourcing, opportunities and time to engage with the people and families concerned are fewer.  Less can be done in terms of prevention and earlier intervention, with increased pressure on GPs to treat people pharmacologically and to refer, regarding which many GPs are unhappy.  Payment is a known additional barrier to optimal treatment for many citizens.  It is a major cause of dissatisfaction where pressure of work is such that GPs are unable to spend adequate time with patients who have significant mental health issues.  Onward referral to secondary care is challenging for people.</p> <p>  The impact of financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, cuts and sustained failure to deliver a contract for general practice has caused many professionally important activities in general practice to come under pressure as a result of competing and conflicting pressures of higher professional values set against relentless business pressures.  This conflict is a major deterrent to younger general practitioners establishing in practice and a cause of burnout among older colleagues, contributing directly to medical emigration and leaving people without essential services.  Our health system would appear to value machines, hospitals, and drugs over talk therapy, time to care and social support.</p> <p>  Being able to manage problems in the general practice setting has the added advantage of markedly reduced or an absence of stigma.  GPs and the people who attend them for care of mental health issues both prefer to avoid the use of pharmacotherapy where possible; while it is quicker and easier to prescribe medication, in many instances it is neither the best nor the first thing to do.</p> <p>  I will hand over to my colleague, Dr. O'Brien.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.196" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018020700002#E00700"><p>Clear and honest communication around resourcing for mental health care is essential.  It is the view of the ICGP that there is an absolute requirement to increase capacity in GP-led health care, including mental health care, within the Irish health system.  Three important observations are particularly relevant in this context.  First, the numbers of GPs and practice nurses per capita in the Irish health system are low by international standards.  The number of GPs per 100,000 population in Ireland is in the order of 64, compared to 90 to 100 in Canada, Scotland and England.  There are approximately 3,700 GPs and 1,800 practice nurses working in our system, and these numbers need to be urgently increased towards 5,000 of each as we plan for a population of 5 million in the intermediate term.</p> <p>  Second, the proportion of total health spending on primary care in Ireland is strikingly low compared to developed economies including Canada, Australia, Scandinavian health systems and the NHS in the UK.  In those health systems, about 8% to 11% of total health spending is directed into primary care, whereas in Ireland the proportion is 4%.</p> <p>  Third, the overall spend on health care in Ireland is in the order of &euro;20 billion to &euro;22 billion, and the per capita spend here is high by international standards.  It is the view of the ICGP that within the Irish health system, we are historically spending excessively on hospital based care, administrative overheads, technological medicine, specialised care and pharmacological therapies.  Conversely, we are spending too little on primary care and on holistic talking therapies.</p> <p>  Irish general practice is leading the Irish health system in the use of electronic medical records.  Despite low levels of funding for primary care, most Irish citizens can access a GP on demand, or within a day or two.</p><p>Most Irish people still believe they have their own GP and have an appreciation of personal care.  The ICGP, Irish College of General Practitioners, however, is of the view that better and higher volumes of care could be provided by increasing capacity in GP-led care.  Recruitment and retention of more GPs would enable higher volumes and better quality of care in communities, including mental health, enabling better prevention, earlier diagnosis and better community-based care.</p><p> Irish general practices are slowly getting larger.  The proportion of singlehanded GPs is now at 18%.  As more GPs work in practices with three, four, or more GPs, these larger practices could usefully incorporate an on-site strand of talk therapy, delivered by GPs, practice nurses and visiting allied professionals such as counselling psychotherapists.  Trend-setting practices are actively exploring the use of relevant innovative care including telemedicine, mental health and exercise apps, as well as social prescribing.</p><p> While turnover in general practice teams is low with good continuity of care, it is not the case in public psychiatry care where high levels of turnover are understood to be a problem.  This creates special difficulties in psychiatry where communication and continuity are particularly important.</p><p> I want to take a clinical case scenario to highlight how general practice might run in mental health care provision.  Mary is depressed.  She attends her GP and she frets in a busy waiting room.  She sits with an agitated man who explains he has diabetes, a mother and a baby with a cough, a gentleman with pain, as well as two other women, one of whom is clearly pregnant.  Mary is anxious but it helps that she is attending her own GP, hers since she was a child.  She likes him because she feels known and heard.  Her GP is careful with her.  Mary explains she is tired all the time and gets headaches.  He listens as she describes that the headaches occur most days, she feels exhausted, cannot do things with the children and feels guilty all the time.  The GP asks what she thinks might be going on.  She is not fully sure but, on reflection, they both agree things are not that good in her relationship.  She has three children under ten, she works outside the home and also visits her mother with whom she has a complicated relationship, who is ill and needs her attention.  She knows she has increased the amount she is drinking but finds the only nights she gets a few hours of decent sleep are when she has had three or four glasses of wine, which is now happening four or five nights per week.  She is worried she has a serious illness, maybe a brain tumour.  How would the children cope?  She is tearful and needs time to compose herself as she tells her story.</p><p> The GP evaluates the headache, does a neurological examination and measures blood pressure.  She says the pleasure has gone out of her life, she feels mostly hopeless and worthless but is not suicidal.  Blood pressure and examination are normal while mental state examination is consistent with mild depression and anxiety.  These findings are shared and, together, they make a plan.  She will reflect on the main causes of exhaustion, undertakes to get back to Pilates and go for a 30-minute walk most days.  She thinks her brother can visit her mother for the next three to four weeks.  She undertakes to reduce alcohol to one night per week.  Bloods are arranged to check for hypothyroidism, anaemia, diabetes, liver enzymes and a menopause profile.  A review is planned for two to three weeks.  The GP outlines what might help such as exercise, mindfulness - the GP suggests a mindfulness app - counselling and also medication.  The GP explains that medication is neither good nor bad but just one of the tools for getting out of a depression.  She is nervous of medication, fearing addiction or that it may alter her personality.  The GP is sure she will get back on top, having previously assisted when she had a moderate depression after the birth of her second child.  This all takes between 22 and 30 minutes.  It is a long consultation and this is where the pressure of time plays out.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.198" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018020700002#F00200"><p>We are keen to reflect on realising the potential of GP-led teams.  If additional funding is made available, as per the Sl&aacute;intecare report, how will this be applied and what will be achieved with it in terms of care for people with mental health problems in communities?  We are not short of good policy but incredibly bad at implementing it.</p> <p>  An important aspect of applying this funding is to closely consider distributing additional funding on a deprivation weighted model, which, given the level of detailed knowledge available on Health Atlas Ireland, can now be factored in with adequate detail.  Additional funding should be used to increase the numbers of GPs along with appropriate supports, including practice nurses and allied health professionals in counselling and family therapy.  This will enable the targeted organic growth of GP teams where they are most needed.  In turn, it will enable greater provision of talk therapy services and related supports in the areas of prevention, earlier detection and better follow-up care.  These are all areas which get lost in the tightness of the system which we are currently trying to operate.</p> <p>  In the intermediate term, this will result in improved capacity at general practice and community levels to address volumes of activity in prevention, including tobacco use, alcohol, exercise and stress management.  For example, people often self-medicate with alcohol and cannabis.  Their eating habits deteriorate under the stressful situations in which they find themselves.  Having a greater capacity in the general practice setting will allow us to address these and will be effective in the primary prevention of a range of mental and physical health problems.  Additional funding will enable GPs to incorporate a broader mix of allied health professionals.  This, together with more GPs, will enable a greater proportion of mental health care to be delivered in the community.</p> <p>  Second, building these capacities will result in more systematic activity in the management of anxiety, depression and pain in chronic disease management.  We sometimes forget this.  There is another part of the jigsaw puzzle where we have a large number of older people with complex multimorbidities.  We increasingly understand that the mental health aspect of these conditions is important to address.  If these are ameliorated, it will lead to better outcomes for those involved.  People with heart failure and diabetes who are anxious or depressed have a poorer quality of life and survival, as well as higher costs when their anxiety and depression are not properly cared for.</p> <p>  The ICGP supports the policy elaborated in the Sl&aacute;intecare report and in the recent HSE report, A Future Together.  We have good policies but we need to implement them.  Both of these policies underpin a shift to the left in terms of a greater proportion of health spending in primary care.  In addition to building capacity in mainstream GP-delivered services, such a shift will enable the embedding of greater volumes of allied health professional care, as well as a more rapid translation of new modalities and new technologies relevant to mental health care, including telemedicine, social prescribing and evidence-based use of social media for improved care for the younger demographic.</p> <p>  The ICGP recognises the value and impact of the voluntary sector in the development and delivery of mental health services, as well as the importance of the work done for particular patient groups.  It is the view of the ICGP that the financial emergency measures in the public interest cuts to the PCRS, primary care reimbursement service, funding model, together with a sustained failure to negotiate a new contract for general practice for 39 years, are both major impediments for the delivery of essential community-based mental health care for Irish citizens.  If we can move on this, the ICGP and the GP-led part of the health care system can and will develop the necessary capacity and innovation which Irish citizens require to achieve better outcomes in both mental health and in the long-term care of frail complex individuals with comorbidities and associated mental health problems.</p><p>Through its main activities of training, research and postgraduate education, the ICGP is well placed and ready to enable capacity and innovation leading to more and better mental health care which can be delivered in communities.  The emphasis will be on prevention, talk therapies and lifestyle modification, supporting greater availability and integration with allied health professionals and reduced reliance on pharmacotherapy and distant hospital and specialist services.  We know what we need to do collectively.  In the past, we have failed to do it.  We are now at another threshold.</p></speech>

The witnesses from the Irish College of General Practitioners appeared before us last December so they already answered some questions for me on this issue.  I have a number of questions for the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy.  I am on an education curve in relation to this issue.  What are the top three challenges facing the association in terms of its interactions with the HSE and the system?  Dr. Murphy referred in his contribution to a package that is tailored towards depression which involves a myriad of therapies.  Perhaps he would elaborate on that package, including whether it would be in addition to the traditional cognitive behavioural therapy.  Does the association have data on recruitment shortfall in psychotherapy in respect of current vacancies as opposed to new positions?  Does the association agree that there is too much dependency on medication and are people being prescribed medication because of a shortage in therapies?  I would also welcome the association's views on the proposal to designate counsellors as psychotherapists and on the use of recovery methods such as the creative arts and music therapy, which I am currently studying?</p> <p>  On Dr. O'Shea's reference to the use of social media to interact with young people, perhaps he would elaborate on that point.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs, at a meeting of which earlier this morning we discussed the dangers of social media for young people.  I would be interested to hear from the ICGP how it believes it would benefit from social media interaction with young people. </p></speech>

The therapy I was referring to is person-centred experiential counselling for depression, which is available in England as part of a suite of therapies.  It is only one approach but it is the one I am trained in and familiar with.  I am advocating it on behalf of the manual because I think it is a particularly good approach for this type of problem in general practice.  There are others but this is the one I am here to speak about.  In terms of a recruitment shortfall, my understanding, through IACP, there is an under-worked workforce of counsellors who would be ready and able to participate in this particular training if it was available to them.  This is the situation in England also.  I think there is too much dependency on medication but I see that as a symptom of a lack of alternative options rather than necessarily the problem itself.  Within the particular approach of person-centred experiential counselling for depression there is not the same kind of dependency on the use of a diagnosis as there might be in, say, a cognitive behavioural therapy in terms of specifically identifying a diagnosis and then working in a particular way for that particular problem.  This particular type of therapy is much more adaptable.  It is underpinned by a theory which is a unitary theory of distress, which it is possible to apply to a range of problems.  In primary care, it is ideal because, as identified in the case study referenced, some people only have anxiety or depression.  Often it is the cross-cutting processes which are more beneficial to work with.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. John O'Brien" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018020700002#G00600"><p>I will respond to the question on medication, which is particularly topical just now.  There was an article on it recently in<i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, which I am sure everybody here has read.  Essentially, the gist of that was that between 2006 and 2016 there was a two-to-three fold increase in the use of medication such as anti-depressants and sleep medications.  This is a cause for concern but it must also be recognised that this is also a global trend.  Across Europe there has been a 20% increase year-on-year in the use of these medications.  It is worth pointing out that in that particular timeframe the population in this country increased by 500,000 people and there were an additional 500,000 people on medical cards.  As everybody will be aware it was a very traumatic period for a lot of people in terms of unemployment, excessive personal debt and a public narrative of extreme pessimism and uncertainty.  Like politicians, GPs see people day in, day out and we hear their stories.  All this resulted in a great deal of anxiety and depression among people presenting to general practice.  I am not making excuses; rather, I am putting a context on this.<br/><br/>Also, there have been very draconian cutbacks in health funding in this country, particularly in general practice.  Funding to general practice is down 38%, which is an awful lot of resource to lose.  Consequently, the net effect is that GPs have been attending more patients with fewer funds and a dearth of back up services because the hospitals services were also under considerable pressure.  Consultation rates have increased and the times available to each patient have been constricted as a result.  GPs have no desire to rely solely on medication and they do not do so but in circumstances where nothing is available they are sometimes forced into positions they would prefer were otherwise.  This cannot be allowed to continue.  It is bad for patients and it is a waste of public money.  It is also demoralising for GPs.  The provision of more GPs, more practice nurses and in-house counselling within general practice is badly needed.<br/><br/>The ICGP has worked on a number of projects with regard to reducing medication, including the reduction in benzodiazepine use, and up to 2012 had been able to demonstrate reductions in that regard but much of that reduction relates to legacy addictions which are very slow to respond to treatment and very hard to pull back.  Also, as psychiatry prescribing passes through general practice it might look like the general practice is doing the prescribing but it is not because the general practitioner re-issues the psychiatry prescriptions.  To that extent, some of what is happening is not in our control.  Also, in tandem with the increase in the use of antidepressants across the Europe the suicide rate was falling.</p><p>There is not a right or a wrong answer to this question.  There is no sweet point on which one can put one's finger, but such big increases would certainly be a cause for concern.  Did Dr. O'Shea want to say something about this?</p></speech>

We often regard it as a failure of therapy, and perhaps it is.  The science around it is a little difficult.  There are two studies to which we might refer the committee.  One, by Tom Fahey et al., concerns the use of antidepressant medication in Irish adolescents.  The study ran from around 2010 to 2015.  The authors noticed a decrease in the prescribing of antidepressants from in the order of 4.74 per 1,000 of population to 2.61.  That is a significant decrease in antidepressant use in adolescents, and the paper is a good scientific study that relates to Ireland.  Another question is how much antidepressants we are using in the population as a whole.  There is an interesting comparative study entitled, Antidepressant Utilization and Suicide in Europe.  These are two very important issues - how much drugs we are putting in and how much suicide we are having.  The study looks at these two parameters across 26 countries, and it is evident from the study that suicide rates have begun to decrease while antidepressant usage rates have begun to increase.  It is difficult to separate and tease this out, but one figure the authors of the study have is that one needs to treat in the order of 660 people with an antidepressant in order to prevent one suicide.  We do not have a right answer to this question but we strongly concur with our colleagues in IACP about having more strands of talking therapy and that it should be diverse and in communities.</p></speech>

I will try to go straight to my questions because time is very limited.  We have before us what I would consider two very important organisations in the treatment of mental health.  Is there good interaction between both organisations?  Are there regular consults, meetings, the kind of interaction one would hope for and expect between two such important organisations?  If so, as a result, are there matching case studies, such as the example Dr. O'Brien gave, and does each organisation get opinions from the other side?  I am interested to know the level of interaction there is.</p> <p>  Regarding the counselling for depression model that Dr. Murphy spoke of, has a costing been carried out on rolling it out in the Republic of Ireland?  I am interested to know whether it is realistic or whether it is one of those things to which we aspire somewhere down the road?  I have a further question for both organisations.  What percentage of GP practices have counselling services?  Is it a high or a low figure?  They should be in every GP practice.  If they are not, can we bring them about?</p> <p>  I have a question specifically for the IACP about registration, qualification and who is qualified and not qualified.  I think many people call themselves counsellors, including me when I was a member of Kerry County Council.  Is there a need for more stringent registration processes so that, for example, if a GP service refers someone, it is happy with the level to which they are referring?  I would like to hear the witnesses' opinions on that issue.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of referral without going through a psychiatrist, should the GPs be able to refer to a counsellor directly, or do they have to go through a psychiatrist now?  Are some parts of the system hindering GPs from getting that consult done more directly?</p> <p>  Dr. O'Shea spoke about the use of drugs and headline programmes and what works and does not work.  Is it his opinion that counselling should always be the first line, is there a need for medication or is it evaluated on a case-by-case basis?  I have worked as a pharmacist for many years and seen people who have been on medication for many years and who function absolutely perfectly and live perfectly normal lives.  Is that a better outcome than someone not on medication and not functioning?  Does counselling work for everyone?  Are we-----</p></speech>

The ICP very much welcomes regulation of the profession.  As far as I understand, legislation is working its way through the Houses at present to designate and protect the titles "counsellor" and "psychotherapist".  In the meantime, the IACP has very stringent standards and a very high quality of counsellors and psychotherapists.  As our members, they go through a very stringent, monitored, standardised, quality-checked process on their journey to become accredited counsellors.  The IACP is a self-regulating body.  In the interim, until regulation becomes a reality, which I understand is a number of years away, although it is in train and is very welcome, the IACP has standards regarding the courses that are accredited, the members that are accredited, continuous professional development and supervision throughout their careers once they have become accredited members.  The IACP is confident, as is the British Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, BACP, in the UK, that its members are fully willing and absolutely able to provide this service.</p></speech>

We do not have exact figures but it would be roughly in the order of around 15% to 20%.  However, that would be in more affluent areas.  In areas of deprivation and in more rural areas, counsellors would not be available.  Again, it goes back to the ability to pay.  Regarding referral, there is no need for a psychiatrist to see someone with a mild to moderate mental health illness in the vast majority of cases.  At present we have counselling in primary care, CIPC, but not all the population is eligible for this and there are long waiting lists.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.223" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018020700002#H01900"><p>The Deputy asked a really interesting question.  If someone is distressed or in need, who should be on the first line?  We are of the perspective in the college that whatever is put in place should be evidence-based and Irish people should have a lot more choice than they have at present.  At present people who are not well-off, who are deprived, have really busy GPs.  Their pharmacist might have time to have a word with them.  There might be something happening in the parish centre, but that is all they have.  We do not see that anybody should be the first line but we see that general practitioners are good and skilful at gatekeeping who needs to go to the really expensive secondary care system.</p><p>In principle, the ICGP strongly supports having more stands of talk therapy and strongly concurs with the observations of our colleagues here that those strands of therapy should be diverse and they should be tried out.  There is much research out there.  We like the study by Professor Tom Fahey on antidepressants on adolescents because it was done on an Irish population. </p><p> The Deputy asked a good question of whether we have a good relationship with our colleagues here.  Truthfully, and to everyone's embarrassment, we do not have a good, effective relationship.  We would obviously say that it is because we are too busy and do not have time but it is because we have not prioritised proper joined-up thinking.  We have developed a good relationship this afternoon.</p></speech>

We are all agreed on that and that talking therapies are an alternative to medication.  There is some consensus on whether we, as a nation, are over-medicated.  There is some division on the question; I have a view and there may be others.  I am interested to know the witnesses' view on the impact of medication on children because of the plasticity of their brains.  I am particularly interested in the doctors' responses on that.</p> <p>  Will the Irish Association for Counselling and Psychotherapy, IACP, to speak more on its observation on availability?  Does it feel that we should be going towards free counselling in terms of accessibility?</p> <p>  Dr. David Murphy referred to the range of therapies.  He spoke about one with which he is particularly closely involved, as well as the role of family therapy, particularly for children presenting with mental health issues.  </p> <p>  The Irish Council for Psychotherapy is also represented in the room.  There are even more friends than the two people presenting.  I ask that the Chairman would accept a submission from that group on the matter. </p> <p>  Those are my comments and questions and I am interested to hear the response.  </p></speech>

I will turn first to the GPs, as most of the questions were directed towards them.  I ask that they respond as concisely as possible.</p></speech>

As we observed in our submission, drugs are not good or bad; they just are.  They are a tool that is useful when they are useful but not useful where they are not.  The evidence for the use of antidepressants in mild to moderate depression is not good and there is no getting away from that.  The evidence for the use of drugs in moderate to severe depression is very compelling but those boundaries are not fixed.  They require the assessment and judgement of the GPs to establish where those boundaries are.</p> <p>  Depression, which is what we appear to be concentrating on a lot here, takes time.  One needs time to hear a person, to let them tell their story, to evaluate it, to be upset, and to get a sense that the GP is interested.  Patients often bring physical complaints into the conversation too, and they must also be addressed.  As was laid out in the vignette earlier, it is a complicated and time consuming thing.</p> <p>  Because of the cutbacks that have been engendered in general practice, which I keep returning to, consultation times have shrunk.  As a consequence, people are under pressure to leave out things that they really want to bring into the equation.  It is not the case that one treatment is good and the other is bad, each has its place, but if GPs are not provided with the time to do the job that they do, then unfortunately, one ends up in a situation where they are backed into a corner.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.232" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. David Murphy" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018020700002#J00900"><p>On the range of therapies currently available in the National Health Service in England, all the therapies which are promoted and supported by the improving access to psychological therapies programme are evidence-based therapies.  It is mostly taken up by cognitive behavioural therapies.  Counselling for depression is the second most accessed of the evidence-based therapies.  There are others which are practised on a much smaller scale.  On the question about families, there is behavioural couples therapy for depression which is seen to be an effective approach.</p> <p>  On counselling more generally, in the English NHS system, there are many qualified counsellors but few who have been trained in the specific evidence-based approaches.  This is something that is subject to a programme of change and I have also spoken to the IACP about it.  Many counsellors working in the health service have not had the specific training to deliver one of these evidence-based approaches.  We feel is very important to ensure that if this is an opportunity to change accessibility to talking therapies here, that the evidence-based therapies are at the forefront of becoming available.</p> <p>  General practitioners arrive at an important way of thinking about people's experiences.  Talking therapies and person-centred experiential counselling for depression approach adopt a very different way of understanding patients' distress than our medical colleagues, hence the difference or tension between a talk therapy or a medical response, that is, medication.  The division of clinical psychology in the British Psychological Society has just released a very far-ranging document, The Power Threat Meaning Framework, which is entirely about a different way of thinking about distress which does not require the idea of diagnosis or the medicalising of people and is very much consistent with the ideas of a person-centred humanistic approach.  </p></speech>

IACP believes that ultimately, counselling and psychotherapy services should be accessible to all.  In my opening statement, I mentioned one thing that could be considered in the interim but we are not there yet.  First, we need to sort out primary care and address the waiting lists for current services through counselling in primary care, CIPC.  As of the end of April 2017, there were 2,530 clients waiting for counselling nationally, of whom 727 or 29% were waiting less than one month, 1,183 clients or 47% were waiting between one and three months, 489 clients or 15%, were waiting between three and six months and 131 people or 5%, were waiting more than six months.  That is the focus at present but ultimately, the IACP's view is that supports should be provided for access to all for services.  That is where the proposal comes for support to access via the tax relief and the PRSI system.</p></speech>

Everybody is an individual.  Dr. Murphy touched on empathy and also, importantly, on people having choices.  We do not hear that too often.  It is like having two bars of chocolate and preferring one over the other in terms of whatever works for somebody.  That relates to what Dr. Osborne said about doctors not having the necessary time to listen to patients.  They are stretched.  I was a member of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and was involved in the work on the Sl&aacute;intecare report, which had cross-party support and the support of those who were non-party.   We genuinely believe that what is in that report can be implemented.  There was no heroism around that work, rather we wanted to set down a marker for the future.  I am glad the witnesses are supportive of it.  Upskilling and competence was also mentioned in this.  We are thinking of the people within the system.  The attitude prevailing in our health system seems to be that one is a nurse, that is their job, they should do it and shut up, and, in terms of upskilling, the attitude seems to be what do they mean by saying they want to upskill, that they do not have the time, and in any event, the service is stressed in terms of the work that needs to be done.  It is a toxic environment.  We have always been self-centred on primary care.  The first port of call is the general practitioner.  Congratulations to the witnesses here, they are number one in the charts.  The first port of call in England and Ireland is the GP.  If the GP cannot access a place for their patient, their patient will probably get lost or the worst-case scenario would be over-medication.  That is what makes me angry.  I wrote the word "access" three times in my notes.  We hear that raised every single say.  I have seen the frustration of GPs about this.  They are trying to do their best but when they get the next place for the patient, the patient cannot access it.</p> <p>  The exchange has been a breath of fresh air.  I do not have questions.  I listened carefully to what was said about the over-prescribing of medicine on occasion.  As has been said to me many times, pharmaceuticals do not do cures, they do customers, which is a major issue.  I am known to be blunt  and straightforward at times but one has to be realistic.  I would love to have a follow-up on this.  I will ask the Chairman to pass on my contact details to the witnesses.  The witnesses have an extremely achievable vision.  We in this committee are trying to set markers for achieving that.  I congratulate the witnesses.  It is nice for a change not to be giving out.  The witnesses have advocated, and it is on the record, as we have said many times, treating people with respect, giving them the time to tell their story, assessing them and giving them the right product or care to which they are entitled.  Well done.</p></speech>

The Deputy referred to social media.  It clearly represents a significant risk for a variety of reasons on one hand, and on the other hand, adolescents and young adults live, breathe and eat social media.  It is part of their existence.  We have an obligation to ensure it is regulated, as far as can do so, and our society is responding to that.  We also have an obligation to ensure that young people are advised, schooled and safeguarded in how to use social media effectively.</p> <p>  Moving on to our therapies, it is not the social media that is evil; it is the way it is used.  Forward-looking services will use apps and will signpost young people to useful websites or Facebook pages.  The HSE will use them.  We should be using these as part of our therapeutic response and as part of resilience and resource building among this demographic.</p> <p>  Moving to another interesting element, in general practice many members of the ICGP are innovative in their approach.  Increasingly we are beginning to use tele-medicine which helps and is relevant in aspects of mental health.  Social prescribing is a very interesting area and there are several pilot studies around the country on that involving GPs, including Donegal in conjunction with the HSE, and in Tallaght, where Dr. Darach &Oacute; Ciardha and his team have involved themselves in social prescribing.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.247" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brendan O'Shea" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018020700002#K01300"><p>Tele-medicine is the use of any technology, it could be a telephone or FaceTime, to develop a contact or enable contact between a therapist - it does not have to be a GP - and the client.  That is tele-medicine.  The person does not have to come to the centre.  Social prescribing is very clever.  It seems very obvious.  Every community has its own resources but they are all different.  It might be a club, societies, a HSE service, a sports club or another resource.  The idea behind social prescribing is that the practice develops a detailed expertise about this because these things change.  If my colleague or I feel that this is a person whose life has entered into a period of fallow after a loss and they are adrift, we talk to them.  Dr. &Oacute; Ciardha would refer to their social prescribing manager.  That person would sit down with the individual, find out where they are coming from, what their interests are and would map them very precisely.  In Dr. &Oacute; Ciardha's practice they have in the order of 50 different agencies around the Tallaght area with links and they send individuals or they identify the services.  It is bespoke social engineering, so to speak.</p></speech>

It has been a fascinating discussion spanning almost two hours.  I am completely on the same page with all the witnesses regarding everything they said.  I often think about the mental health of the GPs and those who work in their practices.  I  acknowledge the huge pace of work and the number of people GPs see every day.  As Dr. O'Shea would know, I have family in the business.   I am concerned when I hear talk of 30 consultations before lunch and GPs being petrified they will miss something during that period.  Our GPs and their support staff do an amazing job and we need to do what we can to help support them.  My firm belief is that the local GP practice should be a one-stop shop.  People, generally, have built up a good and positive relationship with their GP.  I am using the term in a mild sense but if a person is feeling down or believes a family member is feeling down and he or she does not know where to go - I am aware the Minister is talking about bringing in a one-stop phone number, which is a good idea - if such a person is in a deep dark fog and does not know where to turn, it must be to his or her GP with whom he or she will have built up a relationship of understanding, compassion and relief.  A consultation with a GP can be for a ten-minute period up to a maximum of 20 minutes.  It is difficult for everybody involved in that very tight time space.  The fact that our GP practices have extended more into primary care centres is good.  There is often a physiotherapist, a tropical medicine practice, a dentist and the GP operating out of a centre.</p><p>I acknowledge what was said about a maximum of 20% possibly having somebody on hand.  It should be something we aim for.  I am interested in the NHS and the type of talk therapy that includes up to 20 sessions.  What are the costings around that?  It is the first time I have heard social engineering referred to in the context of thinking about positive mental health as opposed to mental health as an issue.  It makes sense and there is much we can do on that.  Ballymore Eustace does not have its own GP.  Sean Fogarty, a very entrepreneurial post office owner, provides access to a tele-doctor service.  It is better to go in and talk to a GP face-to-face but it is a great system for a community and village that does not have one.  People can go into the hub where they have privacy.  </p><p> Talk therapy is hugely important.  In Kildare, there are referrals to HOPE(D), which gets no State funding whatsoever.  It is wonderful to be able to support it.  It is something we need to grasp.  What are the witnesses' views on the issue of dual diagnosis?  What are the difficulties from the witnesses' perspective in terms of trying to deal with that?  What is their appraisal of the CAMHS system? </p></speech>

I will go straight to Senator Devine.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  One of the witnesses mentioned that the suicide statistics decreased in the ten years after 2006.  I disagree with that because it was the period of the lost decade and there was an increase in suicide in this country.  Greece was first because of all the turmoil there.  I disagree on that but perhaps we have caught up and steadied.  There are remaining pockets of increased suicide in deprived areas.  It is areas of deprivation that are still seeing an increase in those rates.</p> <p>  I was quite interested in the incidence of the prescription of psychotropic medication.  The answer was it was neither good nor bad but I have a great concern about over-medication and the reliance on it, given the pressure on all system points in all areas of our health service.  Hopefully at some stage I will get some more data on that to give us an idea of the situation.  I know of seven year olds being prescribed Prozac.  I do not know the incidence of that throughout the country.  It is contraindicated at such a young age.  It seems to be a last measure option.  It would be interesting for us to know how we are treating our young children.  Can we steer well away from medication as much as possible?</p> <p>  I agree on the issues of community-led social prescription and community activism.  Instead of using the term "low intensity mental illness", we have to start using the term "well-being" because that is what it is about.  We do not want a diagnosis.  Will Dr. Murphy repeat what he said about The Power Threat Meaning Framework and that there is no need for a diagnosis for the majority of us because the majority of us have issues with well-being at different stages in our lives?  We do not need to be diagnosed, we just need to be supported in our communities by GP practices, counselling or community facilities such as clubs or sports.  A knitting club would be one of my suggestions but not everybody is into that.  I am interested in that link.  We have to blow the water on all of us.  A large portion of those on waiting lists are suffering from mental ill-health.  We just need to simplify community life and community well-being services  </p></speech>

One of the comments Dr. O'Brien made was about the suicide rates and the decrease possibly due to the increased use of antidepressants.  That is a very naive comment because there are many inputs into suicide intervention and prevention and looking at antidepressants alone is probably the wrong thing.  When people are prescribed medication it does not have an immediate effect in the first two, three or four weeks but it can have a very immediate effect and create symptoms such as suicidal ideation, which these medications can create.  A lot of people have gotten in touch with us on that very topic.</p> <p>  I will pass the witnesses on.  There were a million other questions.  All the questions that are not answered now will be put into a letter for the witnesses to answer.  We are running very late.  I will pass on to Deputy Browne.</p></speech>

I understand that the issue of opioids and benzodiazepines which was raised in <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>was addressed.  When I asked parliamentary questions on this issue several months ago, I was surprised by the high percentage of people on medical cards who were on these types of drugs.  Is the number of those attending privately the same?  Is the number of people on medical cards who have been prescribed these drugs higher in one sector than in the other?</p><p>In Wexford we have several charities such as Talk to Tom and It's Good 2 Talk.  Do practitioners engage with these charities?  Anecdotally, I know that some do and some do not.  What is the level of engagement with these charities?  Some are section 39 organisations and some are not.  Some organisations are doing brilliant work but their availability is <i>ad hoc</i>.  </p></speech>

The whole business about the European-wide fall in suicide rates and the European-wide increase in antidepressants was just a statement of fact.  No one can make the link between that fact and its causality.  The causes and mechanics of suicide is a much more complex story than can be dealt with here.  I am certainly not making the statement that upping the use of antidepressants will drop the instance of suicide.  I am not saying that; I am merely making a global point.</p></speech>

The college has a health in practice programme and it also runs a GP "take care" programme of well-being at all its conferences.  A question was asked about what we do if a GP is stressed and if there is a stressing event personally or professionally?  In the current situation, especially in urban deprived and rural areas, we cannot even get a locum, so the GP cannot even take a day off.  It comes back to recruitment and retention.  Deputy O'Loughlin mentioned there is no GP in Ballymore Eustace.  That will become more significant because there will be vast swathes of the country without GPs.  Deputy Michael Harty's "No doctor, no village" campaign was quite apt in that context.  When people are travelling 50 m to 60 m round journeys for their 80-year-old depressed grandmother, there will be an outcry and it needs to be addressed.  It comes back to recruitment and retention.</p><p>FEMPI is driving young doctors out of the country and forcing older doctors to retire.  </p></speech>

Is play therapy on the witnesses' radar?  A few people have contacted me about it and it seems a very good early intervention technique.  When Dr. O'Shea appeared before the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, he strongly advocated for a new GP contract as being critical to any progress.  We are a good year down the road.  Has any progress been made and is there anything we can do as elected members to help him get this critical factor over the line?</p></speech>

The purpose of this morning's meeting is to allow the Minister for Health, his officials and the director general to update committee members on key health care issues.  The committee has flagged it would particularly like to have the issue of hospital overcrowding addressed during this session.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, who is accompanied by the Ministers of State, Deputies Jim Daly and Finian McGrath.  From the Department of Health I welcome Mr. Greg Dempsey, deputy secretary, and Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General.  I also welcome the director general of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, who is accompanied by Mr. John Connaghan, Ms Anne O'Connor, Mr. Liam Woods and Mr. Ray Mitchell.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Any opening statements made to the committee may be published on its website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p> Before the Minister makes his opening statement, I note the lateness of its delivery to the committee.  Replies to questions arrived at 8.40 p.m. last night and the Minister's statement arrived at 8.40 a.m. this morning.  This point has been made on several occasions.  Committee members have their own views on the matter, to which we will come, but I wish to put on the record that if we are to have a proper and meaningful engagement, it would be helpful to have the relevant information beforehand.  I call on the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

My officials and I will endeavour to work with the committee secretariat to ensure a more satisfactory situation in future.  I welcome the opportunity to once again appear before the committee.  I am joined by my colleague, the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Jim Daly, and Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, and Mr. Greg Dempsey, deputy secretary general, of my Department.  I also welcome Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien, director general of the HSE, and his officials.</p> <p>  Last year, 2017, was a significant year in terms of the progress made in reforming our health service.  To make the changes required to create a health service of which we can be proud requires significant preparatory work.  I acknowledge the very valuable work done in driving the reform agenda.  Several key pieces have been put in place, not least the Sl&aacute;intecare vision which several members of the committee were very influential in developing.  My Department has overseen the finalisation of the ESRI&rsquo;s projections of demand for health care in Ireland 2015-2030, the health service capacity review to 2031, the national strategic framework for health and social care workforce planning, the national trauma strategy which I am delighted was yesterday approved by Government and the national cancer strategy 2017-2026 which was published last July.  These will feed into the Government&rsquo;s response to Sl&aacute;intecare, on which extensive work has been undertaken and which shortly will be finalised.  Several key reform building blocks of which all members are aware and have discussed as being necessary were identified and published in 2017.  This is needed in order to build the health service we want through identifying the capacity required, looking at specialties such as trauma and seeing how we can put in place plans to save lives rather than talking about it for years, working with organisations such as the ESRI to look not just at the current needs of the health service but what we will do when people in this country continue to age and, thankfully, live longer and in terms of ensuring we have the required workforce and make further strides in regard to cancer, where there have been extraordinarily significant improvements in survival rates in recent years, with figures published last week showing over 60% of Irish people with cancer now live five years or longer after diagnosis, up from only 40% in 1994-98.</p> <p>  I would like to take the opportunity to thank all those in our health services for their tremendous work in providing a high quality of care for patients, often in challenging and highly pressured circumstances.  Our staff and patients deal with the system as it is today, both good and not so good, while those in positions such as mine urgently seek to introduce improvement and respond to growing needs.</p> <p>  Government is committed to the implementation of a significant programme of health care reform, as outlined in the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  I am pleased to inform the committee that significant progress has been made in developing the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan, a draft of which has been shared by my Department with the Departments of the Taoiseach and Public Expenditure and Reform.  Following discussions between Departments, I intend to shortly bring the plan to Government.  As members are aware, the recruitment process for an executive director of the Sl&aacute;intecare programme office, as raised with me on my last appearance before the committee, is now well under way and I expect the selection process to be completed by April.</p> <p>  I acknowledge that members are particularly interested in discussing the issue of overcrowding in hospitals and I assure them it is also a priority for me and I will address the issue at the outset.  I am of the same mind as members in regard to patients on trolleys waiting for long periods in overcrowded emergency departments.  Neither I nor anyone else in the Government or the HSE is claiming that the difficulties which arise immediately after the new year are unpredictable, which is why detailed plans and extra resources were in place.  However, we still encountered a surge that was extremely challenging for the system.  There is a difference between predictable and avoidable and to achieve the latter we will have to break the cycle of overcrowding.  All present accept that will not be done by any one year&rsquo;s winter plan.  </p> <p>  I wish to first focus on this year&rsquo;s winter plan.  As part of budget 2018, an extra &euro;30 million was made available to respond to winter pressures in 2017, with a further &euro;40 million being provided in 2018.  This investment is aimed at alleviating pressures in our emergency departments during the winter period, includes increased access to home care, transitional care and extended access to diagnostics along with additional bed capacity.  While it did not achieve all that everyone in this room would have wished, it is having an impact, which is very important.  An extra home care package, an extra transitional care bed or one of the 170 or more extra beds we have opened in the health service is a benefit to the man or woman availing of it.  The extra resources produced benefits for patients in the health service.</p> <p>  However, we must consider the context in terms of emergency department attendances, which rose by 2.8% last year.  We can get lost in figures but that is over 34,000 additional patients compared to 2016, including a 5.6% increase in emergency department attendances by people over 75.  Within this context of increasing demand, HSE data indicates that at the end of December 2017 there had been 2.6% or 2,517 fewer patients waiting on trolleys in 2017 compared to 2016.  Although there are varying figures in this regard, such as those produced by the INMO, it is important to note that even the INMO figures for November noted a significant drop in the number of patients on trolleys, so we did see some benefit from the extra resources put into the system.  That is based on the measures being implemented at all levels and shows incremental improvement within a challenging operational environment.  </p> <p>  However, it is important to acknowledge that in spite of the intensive efforts of staff, management and the HSE over the winter, since the beginning of January this year we saw the annual situation whereby the system tipped over and there was a significant increase in the number of patients on trolleys, along with a continued increase in the age and complexity of those patients.  Each winter, the system must also deal with the increased demand for services due to the prevalence of flu, which is currently at its height.  Our system is also working hard to grapple with the challenge of infection prevention and control, specifically the emergence of superbugs.  We might later have an opportunity to discuss how the health service infrastructure does not help in terms of stopping the spread of superbugs and the need for capital investment in that regard.</p> <p>  Considerable reform and additional capacity are needed to reduce the unacceptable number of patients who are still ending up on trolleys.  This winter we are opening over 300 additional beds.  As I stated, 170 additional beds have been opened with a further 139 due to come on stream.  The capacity review report will inform our plans for increasing capacity further.</p> <p>  Notwithstanding the rising demand and pressures on our hospital system, some hospital sites have made a considerable leap forward in improving their trolley performance in the past year.  That is testament to the great and local work being done by health service staff.  I acknowledge the hard work of hospitals that continue to focus on improving patients&rsquo; emergency department experiences in challenging circumstances.  I hope those working in the health service can take heart from the national patient experience survey, whereby we did not listen to commentators, politicians, representative bodies or the Minister but spoke directly to patients.  Almost 14,000 patients who spent one night or more in an acute adult hospital were asked about their experience, with 79% rating their admissions experience as good or very good and 85% rating their overall hospital experience and stay as good or very good.  Even in the very challenging circumstance of over 1.2 million people attending our emergency departments every year, the vast majority report a good experience in that regard.  It is obvious that there are still far too many people for whom that is not the case and we must work on that.  The capacity report outlines in an evidence-based, internationally peer-reviewed way the number of further beds needed in hospitals and the community out to 2031.  There is now nowhere to hide as the figures are available.  Even if we reform the health service, as we must, we will still require 2,600 additional hospital beds by 2031, some of which are urgently required and will have to be front-loaded.  I am advancing the capacity report through conversations with Government colleagues in regard to the capital plan.  </p> <p>  I wish to reassure people that the budget for the national treatment purchase fund, NTPF, and waiting lists has now dramatically increased and I expect there to be good progress in driving down waiting lists as we come into the spring.  In five of the last six months of 2017, there was a reduction in the number of patients waiting for a hospital operation or procedure.  Far too many people were waiting but in five of the last six months of 2017 the number waiting for procedures on hips, knees, cataract or other inpatient day case procedures fell.  The increased investment we are making does make a difference.  Now that we are significantly increasing the size of that investment this year and giving the NTPF a total budget allocation of &euro;55 million, which more than doubles its 2017 allocation of &euro;20 million, I expect further progress in that regard.</p><p>Colleagues in the HSE and NTPF are working on additional waiting list measures, including scheduling a much increased volume of procedures over that undertaken in recent years.  The HSE is also focusing on scheduling patients in public hospitals in specialties that have patients waiting long times for procedures and when more complex procedures are required.  </p><p> It is important to note, and something we do not hear very often, at present in this country over 57% of patients wait less than six months for a hospital operation or procedure.  I want to drive that down further but that is the reality.   More than 84% of people wait less than 12 months.  We want to drive that down further as well.  However, that is the reality.  This is happening despite the additional demands on our acute hospitals, which, since 2000, are carrying out four times more procedures for patients aged 65 and over and twice as many in the under-65 age group.  That is an incredible figure.  Four times more procedures being carried out in Irish public hospitals for patients aged 65 and over than in 2000.  </p><p> It is important to acknowledge our outpatient waiting list remains the biggest challenge.  It is worth noting last year almost half a million, 479,000, outpatients did not attend their appointments.   That is not patient blaming in any manner or means.  It is acknowledging that almost half a million people last year who were invited into an Irish public hospital to have an outpatient appointment did not attend.  That suggests to me there is a serious issue to ensure the accuracy of our lists.  Every one of those missed appointments is somebody else who could have had an appointment.  </p><p> When people in this room, including myself, commentate on the size of outpatient waiting lists, it is important to inject into that conversation that 479,000 outpatients did not attend their appointment last year.  We need to get under the bonnet in working out why that is the reality.  The HSE is working with my Department in respect of that.  In tackling that issue, we also need to look at the balance between new and return appointments.  That will free up considerable capacity to address outpatient waiting lists.  A number of steps are being taken to ensure the lists are accurate and these efforts are going to intensify significantly in the coming months. </p><p> In line with Sl&aacute;intecare&rsquo;s recommendations, we also need to prioritise the improvement of our primary care services.  Last year, I extended eligibility for medical cards to children covered by the domiciliary care allowance.  We are working now to enable all persons in receipt of carer&rsquo;s allowance to qualify automatically for a general practitioner, GP, card from later this year.  That has been welcomed by all political parties and groupings.  Investment in additional staffing and service re-orientation has also been made in the therapy areas, most recently in budget 2018 with funding provided for the recruitment of extra occupational therapists.  Additional funding has also been provided for continued investment in, and expansion of, our community intervention teams, a vital nurse-led service which is a successful hospital-avoidance measure, as well as enabling patients to be discharged earlier from hospitals.  </p><p> To build on these developments a key priority for me and the whole of Government in 2018 is the negotiation of a new GP services contract.  I acknowledge the important role GPs play in our health service and my strong commitment to the development of a new GP contract.  One of the key objectives is to develop a contract which has a population health focus, providing in particular for health promotion and disease prevention and for the structured ongoing care of chronic conditions.  In this country, we have people being managed for chronic diseases in our acute hospital settings that in most other European countries would be managed in the community.  Our GPs are up for having that conversation, we need to have that conversation and we need to shift the management of chronic disease from our hospitals into the community.</p><p> A process of engagement with the representative bodies of contracted health professionals is planned, aimed at putting in place a new multi-annual approach to fees, commencing in 2019.  We are also looking at service improvement and contractual reform in line with Government priorities and the Sl&aacute;intecare report.  Agreement in principle on this process has now being achieved with the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  It was reflected in the revisions to the FEMPI legislation he brought through the Houses of the Oireachtas before the Christmas recess.   Officials in my Department are undertaking preparatory work with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and with the HSE in respect of this important agenda.  This is an vital issue in the context of the GP contract negotiations, as representative bodies have sought clarity on this matter.  I hear them clearly on wanting a process to address FEMPI and discuss what more general practice and other health contractors can do in the context of the reform agenda.  </p><p> It is essential that engagement on GP contractual issues is aimed squarely at meeting the substantial challenges, current and future, the health service and general practice face.  I want to be clear to our general practitioner colleagues.  We their profession to be sustainable and we need them to have confidence that being a GP can be a sustainable career now and into the future.  At my request, officials of my Department are working with their counterparts in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and in the HSE to ensure that the overall approach is focused fully on the strategic challenges and on the reform agenda.  The wider reform agenda set out in the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan will inform the approach to be taken in developing our GP services and improving access.  I look forward to intensive progress in the coming months on the GP contract and I hope and expect agreement can be reached on the introduction of a range of service developments starting in 2018.  </p><p> I want to turn briefly to the recruitment and retention of staff within our health services.  I accept we face challenges.  We discuss this on a very regular basis at this committee, although it is important to acknowledge that the level of recruitment in the health services is continually increasing.  There are more people working in the Irish health service this year than last year and more last year than the year before.  A national strategic framework for health and social care workforce planning has been developed by a cross-sectoral group led by the Department of Health.  It will support the recruitment and retention of the right mix of workers across the health and social care system to meet planned and projected service needs.  </p><p> The issue of pay restoration in section 39 organisations has been the subject of considerable debate, most recently in this committee last week.  I have asked the HSE to carry out an evidence-gathering exercise to establish the factual position regarding pay reductions and pay restoration in these organisations.  This analysis will establish, with supporting evidence, whether, when and to what extent reductions in pay rates were applied during the crisis in each relevant organisation.  It will also establish whether, when and to what extent restoration of pay reductions has happened and will identify the financial implications for each organisation, taking account of all sources of funding, associated with addressing the issues identified and will propose an appropriate plan for phased resolution in each case.  It is anticipated this process will bring about the necessary clarity and transparency and lead to an agreed way forward.  Contact is continuing with the parties involved and it is at a sensitive stage.  This issue needs to be resolved and put into a process.  It needs to be resolved without the need for any industrial action that would cause any difficulty for any patient, client or citizen in this country.  </p><p> The 2018 national service plan sets out a budget of more than &euro;14.5 billion for the HSE.  That is the highest budget ever allocated.  This represents an overall increase of over &euro;600 million on 2017, which is, by any measure, a substantial additional level of funding.  The amount allocated each year follows an extensive process, which must consider both the funding requirements as submitted by the HSE and the reality of the fiscal position this country faces.  This process concludes with the Government making a decision as to the funding it will be in a position to provide to the HSE.  </p><p> These types of engagements are a normal part of the budgetary process and happen with all agencies across Government.  All public bodies put forward spending proposals but all such bodies, including the HSE, are required to operate within the amounts proposed by Government and determined by the D&aacute;il.  While increased resources contribute to health service improvement, there are also ways in which improvements can be achieved within the current resources.  I know this is a view shared by HSE colleagues and the HSE has my full support in achieving these improvements as part of our shared reform agenda.  It is simply not possible to achieve in one budget all that we want to achieve.  </p><p> However, it is absolutely possible to achieve a number of those things over a multi-annual basis.  As economic stability and growth of this country continues to move forward, we will be able to build on progress every year.  However, it is a statement of fact that every year every agency in this State will seek more funding from the Exchequer than the latter can provide.  Each agency then has to work to turn that into a plan for the organisation during the year.  The HSE, as I said, has my full support in the delivery of what I think is an ambitious and exciting service plan.  It will see all services either maintained at last year's level or, in many cases, being increased on last year's level.  I touched on a number of those areas where we will see increases.  </p><p> We all share the same goal.  Working together, we need to find sustainable solutions to the issues facing the health services.  I believe 2018 will be the year of reform and the beginning of adding extra capacity in order that we can build a better health service for patients and staff.  It marks in a very real way a reversal of previous Governments' failed policies of reduction of bed capacity by making it clear we need more hospital beds.  This year commences with the publication of a trauma report so that we can build on patient outcomes and save patient's lives.  The recruitment process is under way for a Sl&aacute;intecare lead.  I refer also to the publication of a capacity review and very shortly the publication of an ambitious and exciting Government capital plan.  There will also be external reviews for all maternal deaths in our health service, improved cancer statistics and a renewed and energised focus on a GP contract and FEMPI.</p><p>I look forward to the year ahead and trying to build and show demonstrable progress in a number of areas of our health service.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#F00300"><p>I thank the Vice Chairman and members.  My team has already been introduced so I will go straight to my remarks, which are focused on the identified issue of overcrowding.</p> <p>  Each year our emergency departments, EDs, see close to 1.3 million patients and on average 25% of those patients are admitted.  The total number of ED attendances has increased year on year while bed capacity has remained largely unchanged.  This has created significant challenges for hospitals, which manifest primarily in emergency departments while challenge is also arising in terms of elective access.  In the current year alone, ED attendances are up by 6.3% compared with the same period last year.  This is on top of an increase in ED attendances of almost 3% during 2017 and 4.3% in 2016.</p> <p>  A key additional challenge facing our hospital and GP services is the sustained increase in the number of older patients presenting to EDs.  During 2017 hospitals reported an increase of almost 6% in the number of older patients attending ED with some EDs experiencing an increase of upwards of 10%.  This year to date, a further increase in this age group has been observed with the number of presentations up by a further 3.3% compared with the same period last year.  Typically, patients over 75 years have more complex care requirements and are more likely to need to be admitted to hospital for treatment and will have longer lengths of stay.  This means that the available capacity is under increased pressure as we do not have sufficient patient discharges every day.</p> <p>  The numbers waiting on trolleys at 8 a.m. fell by 3% during 2017 when compared with the full year of 2016.  The number of patients on trolleys between October and December was consistently lower than for the same period 2016.  These improvements were directly linked to increased capacity in a number of hospitals and sustained focus by hospital groups and community health organisations in reducing delayed discharges and improving patient flow.  Targeted funding for emergency services in 2017 enabled consistent improvements in the wait time for funding under the fair deal scheme and an increase of up to 300 beds during the year.  The trolley improvements were maintained to year end 2017.</p> <p>  The issue of overcrowding is a concern for both patients and staff, compromising a safe environment for assessing and treating patients.  Of equal concern is the length of time patients wait in EDs.  In 2017, the HSE sought to tackle both issues through investment in emergency departments, with University Hospital Limerick opening its new emergency department in June 2017 while upgrades were undertaken in St James's Hospital and at Mullingar.  The major capital development in Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital, Drogheda, is opening on a phased basis in 2018.  This development includes 80 beds plus theatres and an expanded ED. </p> <p>  The HSE has continued to focus on full compliance with no patient waiting over 24 hours and improvements have been observed in this during the year.  Some 14 hospitals, including the three paediatric hospitals, achieved compliance of 98% or more in December 2017.  Through our performance management process, we sought improvement plans from hospitals.   A key challenge for most hospitals is the increasing requirement for isolation of patients to ensure that infection control issues are managed appropriately.  The hospital system does not have sufficient isolation facilities or single rooms and as a result patients can wait for significant periods for suitable accommodation.  In 2017, funding of &euro;5 million was provided to support the cost of upgrades in EDs and wards aimed at addressing infection control, security and environmental issues.</p> <p>  In January 2018, the number of patients on trolleys increased due to increased attendances and the age and acuity of patients presenting.  A key challenge this year has been the sustained increase in influenza cases with associated challenges in terms of providing appropriate isolation and consequential delays in discharge of patients to home and other community settings.  At its peak this year the influenza rate was higher than last year and unlike last year, when it decreased sharply, it is expected that the high rates will continue for a number of weeks with continued pressure on hospitals.  There have been two strains of flu present, which has meant that the isolation requirements are more complex and most hospitals have had to create cohort wards to ensure there is no cross-contamination.</p> <p>  This year a further challenge is the incidence of influenza in nursing homes which has prevented new admissions from hospitals during January.  As of last week, it was estimated that more than 200 beds were out of use due to influenza cases in nursing homes.  It is welcome and important that nursing homes are observing the national guidance on infection control but in the short term it means that fewer discharges from hospitals are possible. </p> <p>  A legitimate question that is posed by the public at this time of year is whether we make appropriate provision for winter pressures including the flu and other infections.  It is important to emphasise that all hospital groups and community health organisations, CHOs, developed joint winter plans to ensure appropriate preparedness for winter surge.  These plans included actions such as ensuring adequate medical and nursing staffing levels over the Christmas period; ensuring that senior decision makers are available to the greatest extent possible to support timely and appropriate admission, review and discharge of patients, for which a key requirement is to ensure that there is appropriate admission to emergency departments out of hours; increased access to diagnostics; staffing of surge capacity and targeting reduction in delayed discharges; vaccination campaigns and initiatives for staff and high-risk patient groups.</p> <p>  From daily engagement with hospital groups , it is evident that these measures did have some impact over the winter period and this is evidenced in the fact that while the overall attendances increased by 6% resulting in increased admissions, our rate of admission remained broadly the same.  Hospitals highlighted that there were no delays in diagnostics and the number of delayed discharges fell from 580 to 450 between December and January 2018.  All hospital groups put flu plans in place.  Compared with the previous year, vaccination uptake rates are up in all categories, namely, health care workers, over 65s, and flu vaccinations by GPs and pharmacists.  These combined initiatives have supported hospitals to address the sustained increase in attendances during this period.</p> <p>  Funding of &euro;40 million was made available this winter to support surge pressures.  Of this, &euro;30 million was allocated to support additional home care packages, transitional care and aids and appliances.  The main service areas include development of 30 additional transitional care beds in the Cork area; opening of the day hospital in Cashel; four rehab beds in Limerick; opening of six neuro beds at the National Rehabilitation Hospital; increase in funding for complex discharges; additional transitional care beds at the rate of 20 per week; additional home care packages at the rate of 45 per week.  The remaining &euro;10 million was allocated to support the opening of an additional 260 beds during 2018.  So far, 176 beds have opened across the acute hospital system and a further 84 are planned to open during the year.  As part of our winter exceptional measures, we have transferred 100 patients to private hospitals to alleviate pressures in public hospitals.</p> <p>  The key issue for our hospitals and community services is to develop sustainable solutions for access to services.  The implementation of the Sl&aacute;intecare report and the publication of the national capacity review by the Department of Health in January are critical in this context.  The capacity review report acknowledges that our acute capacity is not sufficient to meet our current demands, with hospitals operating at almost 100% capacity.  It also highlights the requirement for significant investment in the community to ensure that the aging population can have their needs cared for appropriately.  The report sets out a clear plan for delivery of 2,500 beds, as well as sustained investment in primary and social care services.  When it is considered in conjunction with Sl&aacute;intecare, it offers a blueprint for the future delivery of hospital and community services over the next ten years.  It also affords an opportunity for better streaming of emergency and elective services.  The HSE is working closely with the Department to agree a robust implementation plan for core recommendations of the review with clear milestones for delivery of changes in the model of care delivery and investment in additional capacity.</p> <p>  This concludes my opening statement and together with my colleagues I will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

Before I invite questions, there are two issues I want to raise briefly.  I also have some questions of my own, which I will hold until the end.  The first issue concerns a letter I was sent yesterday by a psychiatrist who I will not name, although he is named in the press.</p><p>I was very disturbed to receive a letter under a HSE letterhead urging me to resist the pressure to yield to populism - specious arguments - and to give my support for the retention of the eighth amendment to the Constitution, Article 40.3.3o.  I would like Mr. O'Brien to comment on that.  I state for the record that I do not think anyone appreciates getting letters of this nature.  We need to hear from Mr. O'Brien whether it was a breach of HSE policy.  I have some passing familiarity with that and am reasonably sure it is.  Perhaps, Mr. O'Brien could confirm that and advise the committee as to what will be done to follow up on it.  This individual, who I am not going to name, is in the media now defending the actions.   It is very distressing to be in receipt of emails of this nature which purport to come from the HSE.</p><p> My second point may be one for Mr. O&rsquo;Brien and the Minister.  It relates to the section 39 agencies.  Are all of the representative bodies signed up to and involved in the process that was referred to?  Can the committee have a timeline on that?  As someone who was representing the bodies at the time, the Government moved nice and quickly to cut their wages and we would like to see the same sort of speed and attention with regard to pay restoration.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.292" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#G00200"><p>On the Deputy's first point, I thank her for forwarding that letter to me.  Otherwise, I would not have been aware of it.  Clearly, the HSE does not take a position on this issue as an organisation, neither would it be appropriate for it to do so.  The use by an employee of both our letterhead and our email system to communicate a position, not just with Members of the Oireachtas, but more broadly, is not in conformity with our policies.  The individual in question has already been met with and will be taken through the appropriate procedures.  Normally, we do not issue the general guidance about not taking part in referenda and so on until a vote is called, but this clearly raises the issue of needing to do so more quickly.  Obviously, the vast number of employees within the HSE are entitled to have and will have their own personal opinions and will take part as citizens in the process, but they may not represent themselves or use the corporate identity of the HSE in putting that forward.  It is absolutely important that I be clear that the HSE does not take a position on referenda or electoral matters and must remain neutral.  No member of staff may use the name of the HSE or its corporate resources to advance any side in any such issue.  That individual is fully aware of that at this point.</p></speech>

I received the letter too.  The Vice Chairman's comments are 100% correct.  It is very important that our public bodies, in particular the HSE in this case, remain entirely impartial.  Obviously, the health service will implement the laws of the land where any decision is taken by the Irish people.  This is not the first example of this.  We have seen situations where stickers have popped up in our various health care facilities containing various emblems and slogans relating to this emotive and complex issue.  That has been brought to my attention.  I welcome very much the comments and clarifications of the director general and it is important that they be transmitted across the health service.  As citizens, everyone is absolutely entitled to their view, but not in terms of utilising the logo or name of our health service.</p> <p>  On section 39 organisations, I note that ICTU is leading the engagement on behalf of all the unions.  Individual unions are also involved, however.  I do not want to say too much, as talks are at a sensitive stage, but I note there are two timelines involved.  On the first timeline, I would like an agreement to be reached before any industrial action is due to take place.  The timeline for the subsequent process will be agreed as part of that.  I do not want to say anything further than to note that there is ongoing engagement which ICTU is leading, albeit, obviously, individual unions are also involved.</p></speech>

We are here again at the start of a new year talking about potential difficulties in budgetary management and the stress under which the budget will find itself in the time ahead.  In that context, there is no doubt that issues have been raised by the HSE, the Opposition and many commentators on the budgetary process, or how the budget is arrived at.  If one looks back at the last number of years, it is evident that the HSE is almost always right about the shortfalls that will arise by the end of the year whereas the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform are always wrong.  That is a fact of life.</p><p>Is our process for budgetary arithmetic and assessment completely dysfunctional?  Every year the HSE goes in and we accept that a certain amount of horse-trading is involved.  The HSE goes in with a figure, outlines the reasons it was arrived at and the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform insist on a reduced figure and the making of value-for-money savings and, perhaps, names other key areas where budget savings can be made.  Almost consistently, that has proven to be a flawed policy.</p><p>If one looks back over the years, one had probity in terms of medical cards and other value-for-money savings measures which were farcical from start to finish.  Let us be honest about that.  It puts the HSE in a very invidious position very early on in every year.  The HSE is planning to deliver health services knowing it cannot achieve that because sufficient funding is not in place.  The Minister will point out that there is an additional &euro;600 million being made available to health services this year and that this year's budget of &euro;14.5 billion is the largest in the history of the State.  Of course, that is true but there are also a lot of issues giving rise to additional funding requirements, including population increases, changing demographics, the complexity of health care and all the challenges that flow from that.  Just because one has a larger budget does not mean it is, <i>pro rata</i>, a major improvement on previous years.  When one looks at the changes in profile and the various clinical problems in our health services, it is clear we need additional funding in key areas.</p><p>I raise this because the Department of Health sent a letter to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien on 26 January 2018 on issues which have been previously raised by him on the budget process and the funding of services.  It refers to Mr. O'Brien's letter, received on 8 December, enclosing the HSE's 2018 national service plan and its view on the financial challenges for the year.  The letter stated: &quot;As we enter the new year and begin to implement the plan, it would be useful to set out my response to the comments in your letter.&quot;</p><p>The comments in Mr. O&rsquo;Brien's letter were primarily about highlighting the major challenges ahead where the budget provided was, in his view, insufficient.  Of course, he is right.  We know that as we sit here on 7 February because he has been right every year.  It is not because he is smarter than anyone else, it is because of the conflict between the process on his assessment and the agenda from the other side to contain public expenditure.  It is Mr. O'Brien who is charged, fundamentally, with delivering health services in this country and ensuring we have a safe and improving health service.  In view of its consistent failure to address and put together a budget in a meaningful way and have it approved by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform for implementation by the HSE, I wonder sometimes whether that is the agenda of the Department of Health any longer.  There are consistent overruns.</p><p>I am amazed that the letter was sent.  Are there agendas undermining the budgetary process between the HSE, the Department of Health, the Minister for Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform?  The letter the Minister sent to Mr. O'Brien on 26 January was extraordinary.  There seems to be some handwashing or pointing the finger of blame in anticipation, which is unhealthy in trying to arrive at a sustainable, fair and rational budget with which to deliver enhanced services.  That has not been done in the budgetary process to date.  The freedom of information requests published recently by <i>The Irish Times</i>indicate that the process is flawed, does not serve the HSE well or its clients in long-term budget planning.  The Department of Health seems to be playing both ways, in respect of the Government's request that it cap expenditure, but it is in no man's land in advocating for health services.  <br/><br/>We do not want to see any industrial action or any impact on the clients of section 39 organisations.  There seems to be almost a Machiavellian intent at work because the starvation of these organisations has been a very successful policy from the point of view of the section 38 organisations and broader health services which can now recruit large numbers of staff from section 39 organisations.  Many section 39 organisation staff are opting to move to section 38 organisations and the HSE.  The difficulties in retaining and recruiting staff, compliance with the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, standards for the correct numbers of staff with the proper training in section 39 organisations have been flagged for a long time.  How long will it take for the process outlined by the Minister of State to come to fruition?  <br/><br/>In January approximately 12,000 patients were on trolleys, the highest number on record.  There have, however, been some extraordinary achievements in Beaumont Hospital but huge challenges in Cork and Limerick.  Has any assessment been made of what was done right in Beaumont Hospital and the challenges faced in other hospitals?  Can there be cross-fertilisation of the good ideas that have an impact on patient experiences in the health service or are there silos which affect the impact decisions have on the roll-out of services?  Beaumont Hospital was a serial offender for numbers on trolleys and waiting times.  Why is it now a star?  Why can the other issues not be addressed?  It is hardly because the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is the local Deputy.</p></speech>

The bed capacity review recommends that there be 2,500 beds - intensive care and step-down beds - across the health service and a substantial increase in the numbers in nursing homes.  Has there been any audit or will one be carried out of the 2,500 beds required?  It would require approximately five new 500-bed hospitals.  With the best will in the world, we will be waiting a long time for five hospitals to be built.  Could an audit be carried out of what stock could be available through cheap conversions or upgrades of wards that may have been closed or changed to other types of facility to try to get some capacity into the system quickly?  Does the HSE have the capacity to do this or would it need outside assistance?  </p> <p>  It is extraordinary that 200 hospital beds were taken by patients with influenza.  I assume that many of them were elderly people who are more likely to be badly affected by influenza.  We seem to be incapable of dealing with patients in the nursing home setting.  Figures, opinions and views vary, but many residents from nursing homes are being transferred or referred through out-of-hours services to an emergency department which is probably the wrong place for them to present.  Has any consideration been given to enhancing and increasing community geriatric services in order that residents can be treated in the nursing home setting?  Many of them require intravenous treatment.  I am sure the competence and expertise are available, but they need to be deployed in the right area, with nurse specialists, geriatric nurse services and geriatricians to provide treatment in the nursing home, rather than transferring residents to an emergency department.  </p> <p>  I have spent the past seven years observing the budgetary process for the Department of Health and the HSE and I am very disappointed that we have made no progress on how to assess and articulate the funding required.  It seems to be a constant game of chess, draughts or snakes and ladders because there does not seem to be any coherent response to the HSE's requests when it points to the demands that will be placed on it in the years ahead.  All of the funding sought will never be given, but I assume most accept that it is sought in good faith and that it is not a number plucked from the sky.</p></speech>

This time last year Deputy Billy Kelleher predicted that January would be a crisis point in hospitals and, as he almost always is, he was correct.  We knew that this would happen and that there should have been a better plan in place, with some simple moves such as making the flu injection available free to everyone or having a better public awareness campaign to highlight the advantages of having it.</p><p>I cannot sit in front of the Minister this morning without bringing up the case of Bandon district hospital.  As the Minister is aware the issue is before the Labour Court today.  This issue has been going on for a long time.  I hope that underneath it all, a cost saving exercise is not under way as this issue has persisted for too long.  This morning, 13 beds lay idle in Bandon district hospital, which is known locally as the cottage hospital.  It is a term of endearment.  The care given in the hospital, which the Minister visited himself, is exceptional.  More serious than the beds lying idle is the fact that no respite has been available for nearly a year.  If it all comes together and it opens, there will be four weekly respite beds.  There is a huge need for that.  The people of Bandon have been without respite beds for their loved ones for nearly one year.  Many of them have reached crisis point with their own mental health because they need a break and the person who is being cared for probably needs a break.  I cannot stress enough the seriousness of this situation.  If there is no resolution today, the Minister should step in.  I stress how important this is to the people of Bandon.</p><p> On waiting lists coming down, I have a submitted a parliamentary question and I do not expect the Minister to comment on an individual case.  One of my constituents has Muckle-Wells syndrome.  He attends a consultant every year and last month he was told that nothing more could be done and he was off the consultant's list.  This man maintains that he needs monitoring and having googled the syndrome I agree, although mine is a non-medical view.  He was told that another patient has taken his place.  If this is the way lists are being reduced, then it is not fair.  This may be something that could be looked into.</p><p> I welcome the fact that GP visit cards will be available for carers.  They are our unsung heroes.  It is not just a monetary thing; it is an acknowledgement of the wonderful work they do.  Will the Minister indicate if he has a more definite date for when this measure will come in?  Will the Minister outline what is being done to make it more appealing for positions in rural GP practices to be filled?</p><p> On the ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities some weeks ago the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, said it would be a few weeks.  This time last year he told me it would be a few months, before that he told me it would be the end of 2016.  Does the Minister of State have a definite date and what is happening in this regard?  As the Minister of State is aware, under the Disability Act 2005 the assessment of need provision says that a person is assessed within three months of application and the assessment finishes within another three months.  The Minister of State is aware that children are waiting years, not months, for this assessment.  This is preventing early intervention.  It will have long-term effects on children who are waiting.  Is the Minister of State doing anything to speed up that process?</p><p> I also wish to ask the Minister of State about respite for those who are over the age of 18.  I am aware that his office has been inundated with requests.  Are there any plans in place for respite for people who turn 18?  They go from getting a small amount of respite to hardly any.  What are the plans in this regard?</p><p> I have a query for the Minister of State, Deputy Jim Daly - who is my constituency colleague.  We were told about a year ago that 750 mental health services positions were approved between 2015 and 2016.  I acknowledge this was before the Minister of State's time but the latest figures we received indicate that 667 positions were approved during that time.  This means there are 83 positions that seem to have disappeared.  I stress that hardly any of these positions were filled but they were approved.  Where did the positions disappear to?  Are they not now approved or what is happening?</p></speech>

This is especially relevant this year because the ink was not dry on the budget until somebody squeaked from the corner that there were insufficient resources to run the services.  I cannot understand how that happens.  It is particularly concerning recently because I have discovered that Ireland is among the highest spenders in the OECD in health services.  There is some reason that I do not know and I cannot figure out what it is.  I am sure the Vice Chairman would like to know what it is also.  </p></speech>

One simple thing we could do is carry out an audit or a comparison with other countries that do not have the same problem.  There must be one.  Ireland is among the highest spenders and we know what we have to compare with.  Can this be done?  I am aware that the number of people on trolleys has been reduced and I am aware that the flu is a serious issue and it comes at this time and so on.  Despite what people may think when they look at me, I remained standing in our household when everyone else got the flu.  I do not go along with the general appraisal of the situation that Deputy Kelleher did that I should have gone down in the early stages.  I am really concerned that it should be simple to find out where people have come from when they are sitting on trolleys, if we do not have the accommodation ready, if we should have the accommodation ready, if they should be treated somewhere else or if have they been treated or was there any attempt to treat them somewhere else such as primary care centres.  There is not much sense in having primary care centres if they cannot do the job one would expect to be done in a primary care centre.  There are a lot of them all over the country now, including a good few in my own constituency, and it does not seem to affect the numbers of people who are turning up in accident and emergency departments.  I believe it should.  If we cannot identify this information then all we are doing is duplicating services, in a very expensive way.</p> <p>  A simple audit needs to be done and I would love to find out why it cannot be done.  RT&Eacute; conducted an investigation some time ago on some of the things that were happening in the hospitals and it was able to find out information we did not know about or if we did, we did nothing about it.  That is not being critical but it is something we have to answer.  We must answer to the public and we must tell them outside what we are at.  If it is not satisfactory, then the public has a way of very quickly dealing with us.  I would like an answer to why there are deficiencies and whether they are permanent or are temporary.  Are they theatre deficiencies or are they accident and emergency deficiencies?  Is one overlapping into the other and if so, to what extent?  Is extra capacity needed?  The local hospital in Naas opened up 11 extra beds, a move which was very welcome and came at a good time.  I thought we would have needed 20 beds at that time to eliminate peak time shortages.  This is why I am concerned in this area.  The Minister has pointed to the extra beds that are required between now and 2030 but I believe we need them before then.  From my own observations, which I admit are not scientific, I believe we need the beds before 2030.  Modern building methods will now very quickly bolt on extra accommodation to an existing hospital to high standards and the same as the rest of the building.  This can be done very quickly, efficiently and cost effectively.</p> <p>  On the issue of spending, does an examination ever take place as to the cost-effectiveness of the service we provide at all levels in community care or in the hospitals and so on?  There must be some way of identifying these.  Deficiencies have been identified over the years and I am not suggesting these were simple; Ireland has come through a serious time in the context of the availability of finances.</p><p> However, we cannot go on with that forever.  We have to move on, pick up the cudgels once again and simply ask ourselves why we seem to be chasing the game all the time.  If we are always chasing the game, it is bad for the personnel in the hospitals and for all health personnel.  We are always the subject of criticism.  By "we", I mean all of those involved in the provision of services.  Some time ago, a role in a local GP service was advertised.  There was a great deal of furore about it beforehand, to the effect that the service was closing down.  All the people who seemed to know everything announced publically that the service was closing down.  What was the result of that?  There was only one applicant for the position.  Nobody wants to join a service that is closing down.  I have never known that to happen anywhere.  We must examine the impact of what we do and say about the services, and the effect it has on the confidence of those involved in them, particularly where emergency services are concerned. </p><p> My final point concerns step-down beds.  A classic case of this issue is St. Brigid's Home, Crooksling, where we already have step-down beds.  Somebody, who I will not name, wrote a letter to tell me that home was definitely closing down.  I have news.  That will be difficult, because I do not agree with closing it down.  The reason is simply that the facilities there are state-of-the-art and are much sought after in this country at present.  They are readily available beds of a high standard, with a high quality of nursing care, the use of modern technology to the greatest extent possible and a dedicated staff.  What do we do with this asset?  We try to make the bed situation worse by closing it down.  The theory is that another facility will be opened somewhere else.  I contend that we can open one somewhere else as well, because we need that too.</p><p> I cannot understand why people do things like that.  The message I want to deliver is that nursing homes that are effective and well-run should not merely be kept but that we should continue to improve them.  When somebody from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, tells me that I do not understand, that the building is falling down, my answer is that it is not.  I know as much about buildings as HIQA does.   Sometimes I get frustrated.  Frustration leads to annoyance, and annoyance leads to reaction.  At that point, something needs to be done.</p></speech>

I thank Deputy Kelleher for his questions.  I very much appreciated that when he said "Here we go again", he included the word "again".  He spoke about observing HSE budgets for the last seven years.  If one examines budgets since the HSE was established, one sees a recurring issue.  In fact, looking at some of the progress we made on the HSE's budget last year, one can see that the demand-led schemes broke even.  Moreover, the nursing home support scheme broke even, and the additional funding that I required was very small when compared with the additional funding other Ministers required in the past.  This would have made their budgeting process blush.  I am very satisfied that the phenomenon we are seeing in this country is not just an Irish one.  Looking at health services throughout the world, including in our neighbouring jurisdiction, in Northern Ireland or in many European countries, it is clear that the challenge of budgeting for health services is genuinely a global issue.  That is not to say that we should not continue to strive to do better.  We absolutely should.  However, it is too simplistic to state the HSE is always right or that the pesky old Department of Health is always wrong.</p> <p>  Of course the HSE has a job to do.  I respect the job they do and take it very seriously.  I read about rebukes and fraught relations.  I do not see any such thing.  What I see is a health service doing what it is meant to do, that is, advocating and highlighting what it believes are its needs now and in the future.  I see myself as a Minister going to the Government table, putting forward a case for the health service and obtaining additional resources.  I see the Government expecting to see demonstrable improvement in certain areas in return for those resources.</p> <p>  The people of this country voted, quite rightly, for a stability treaty that brought in fiscal rules by which we are bound.  We are bound to a maximum amount the State can spend.  If someone approached this objectively from the perspective of another jurisdiction, was apprised of the annual budget for Ireland and saw the proportional increase the Department of Health and the HSE received for the delivery of health services when compared with other public services, I would contend I had fought my corner very well.  The Government has prioritised health yet again.</p> <p>  Perhaps the only mistake the director general and I have made is that we are too transparent.  Excellent health correspondents use freedom of information legislation and find all our letters back and forth.  I can assure the Deputy, who has been a Minister in Departments and has been around long enough to know, of one thing.  There is no agency in this country that does not look for more money than the Government of the day is able to provide.  That is the reality.  Perhaps they do not all write letters back and forth to each other.  Maybe we are guilty as charged of being too transparent, in that we put our discussions in writing so that they are available to read.  If anything, the letter the Deputy describes as extraordinary is quite ordinary, in that a Minister wrote back to one of his agencies to state it must live within the budget it was given.  It is appropriate for organisations to seek value for money.  It is even more appropriate to seek value for money at times of economic boom and budget growth, in order that we do not slip back into mistakes of the Celtic tiger era.  I emphasised in my letter that since budget 2015, the HSE's allocation has increased by &euro;2.4 billion, or 20%, averaging an increase of about 6.6% per annum.  </p> <p>  The point I was making in the letter is that there is a difference between a challenge and a shortfall.  There are more things that the health service would like to do, and that I would like it to do.  We are going to do them, together, on a multi-annual basis.  However, that is different to a shortfall.  The director general and his organisation have a legal obligation to produce and sign up to a service plan that they intend to deliver.  I approve this plan, bring it to the Government and publish it.  I am not going to speak for the director general, who will speak for himself in a moment, but when I launched the service plan I heard the HSE state clearly to the people of Ireland that this document outlined the services it would deliver this year.  In every single case in that service plan, there is at least maintenance of last year's service level and in many cases, there is a significant increase in service provision, be it in respite care, waiting list funding, access funding, speech and language therapy or mental health services.</p> <p>  That is not to say that there is not substantial pent-up demand in our health service and indeed in our public services.  I think the Deputy and I will agree on this.  We have discussed some of these problems already in addressing capacity issues and we clearly have work to do there.  I am excited about being able to grow the health budget again.  I am excited to be able to build on the work of my predecessor, the Taoiseach, who also did so.  However I think the committee would agree, as would the HSE and every citizen in this country, that it is not all about money either.  If it was all about money, my predecessors would have solved this a long time ago.  Our approach has to be about funding linked with progress.  It has to be about targeting specific areas.  We must not attempt to boil the ocean.  Instead, we must pick certain areas of the health service to improve on in a given year.</p> <p>  I have proven already that when decent funding is allocated to the health service, as the Government did last year, the health service, with careful management, can provide many parts of its services within budget.  The budgeting assumptions that my Department and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform must make were proven correct last year where several parts of the health service budget are concerned.  In particular, the nursing home support scheme, which received a budget of almost &euro;1 billion, and the demand-led schemes in areas pertaining to the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, have shown that we can budget correctly.</p> <p>  There are other parts of the health service we all know are a bit harder to predict and to budget for.  That is not a uniquely Irish phenomenon.  How many people will turn up at the door of a hospital?  How bad is the flu going to impact this year?  That is something on which we must continue to work.  We can absolutely manage our processes better.</p><p>It is too simplistic to say that one agency is always right, that the other is always wrong and to try to paint it in a confrontational way.  I am not suggesting that the Deputy tried to paint it in a confrontational way but some commentary does.  We go through a very robust process, set out in law, which results in a HSE service plan being produced every year.  My job is to make sure that the Government's priorities for the health service, which we often discuss here, are reflected in that plan.  The director general's job is to deliver that plan.  I would think that it is a job for both of us to continue to put forward new ideas on how we can do things better and continue to deliver services in a better way for our people.  A number of building blocks which we have published and produced in recent weeks and will continue to produce, with the next big ones being the Sl&aacute;intecare implementation plan and the Government's capital plan, will give real life to some of those ideas.</p><p> I take the Deputy's point about section 39 bodies.  I visited, as I am sure the Deputy has, a number of section 39 bodies.  They tell me that they have a situation where they try to recruit staff, such as nurses or health care assistants, or others, and find that a nearby State agency or section 38 body is able to pay those people a better wage.  They tell me that the section 39 bodies therefore become uncompetitive and while they might be called a section 39, to the man or woman who comes in off the street and uses the services, they are a core component of the provision of public health services.  We have to work out a way to address that.  There are many section 39 bodies of different sizes, shapes, composition and even governance structures.  The financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, saw a swift introduction of pay reductions back in the dark days, first with our public servants, then with fees to contractors.  Section 39 bodies were also asked to make cost savings.  There is no doubt about that.  They subsequently took a range of measures, including pay reductions in many instances.  Last summer, the public service pay agreement formed an agreed pathway for public service pay restoration.  We saw the first benefit of that before Christmas with more in the new year.  That will continue.  We now have to seek to address our section 39 bodies.  It is fair to say that the position relating to these agencies is more complex.  We need an analysis.  Each organisation might be different.  We need to know if they applied a reduction, how they applied it, if they have restored it and when it was applied.  I note, in correspondence from unions, that they are looking for a process to validate and interrogate the realities of the situation.  I do not wish to be coy and not more forthcoming but I am conscious that discussions are ongoing with unions, which management is engaged in with a view to averting industrial action.  I hope they can yield a positive outcome.  As a part of that outcome, we need an agreed process and a timeline for that process.  I have no doubt that at the end of this process, there will be a funding requirement for our section 39 organisations.  It is a matter of how we get there, how we validate and verify, and the thought process that we put in place.</p><p> The Deputy's point about trolleys is one that I make all the time.  A number of our hospitals perform well and a number perform very badly.  I need to be careful not to be overly simplistic in suggesting that it is all down to one issue because there are certain challenges in certain hospitals.  Looking at Limerick, for example, we know that there is a bed capacity shortage in the mid-west that goes back many years.  There are issues with management and clinical leadership in every hospital, ensuring that discharges are done by the weekends, and other operational issues, but there is also a need for investment.  My understanding of the issue at Beaumont Hospital is that we have seen excellent managerial grip and excellent collaboration with clinical leadership, but we also saw that on the back of investment, including investment in the hospital, which the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, knows about from experience over the years, and investment in the community which serves the hospital with home care packages and transitional care.  The audit of capacity in general is under way.  I have made it clear that while the capacity review talks about the extra beds which will be needed by 2031, it also makes it clear that we need some of those beds now.  I am not saying that this is a ten-year plan, and to come back to us in 2031 when we will have all the beds.  We need to look at what we can do quickly.  I have asked the HSE to identify and report back to my Department how, if coupled with investment, we could quickly open additional beds in advance of the next winter period.  Beds are quite a big part of the answer but only if they come with reform.  We have seen extra beds go in in some hospitals but have not seen significant improvements in trolley numbers.  In Galway this winter, extra beds were received but the hospital made a number of changes to pathways which resulted in a significant improvement in Galway's numbers for a significant period of the winter.</p><p> The Deputy is right about the issue of nursing homes and referrals to hospitals.  I was going to ask the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, to address it but he has had to go to the Seanad.  That is an issue which can be dealt with in three ways.  We can investigate what else we can do with the general practitioner, GP, contract and with GPs linking with our nursing homes to keep patients in what might well be a private room with an en suite rather than a busy emergency department.  On nurse-led care, there is definitely a role for our nurses.  Our Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO, colleagues have clear views on that.  There is also the integrated care programme for older people.  There is no doubt that there are far too many patients who have to leave their nursing homes and go to hospitals.  It is not a criticism of nursing homes but we have to look at how we can help to keep patients there where we know they will have better outcomes.  The last thing one wants is to send a vulnerable older person into an overcrowded hospital if one can provide that person with an isolation facility.  Equally, our nursing homes locally have to know that they have that support.  The GP contract and a nurse-led service are the key ingredients for that.</p><p> Deputy Murphy O'Mahony joined the queue of everybody other than me as nearly always right.  Deputy Billy Kelleher said he was told he was nearly always right.  The Fianna F&aacute;il position is that Deputy Kelleher and Tony O'Brien are always correct.</p></speech>

The Deputy is right about predictability and avoidability.  I will not play a word game and confuse everybody.  The point I am trying to make is that everybody knows.  If the Deputy was sitting in the chair I am in now, we would all know the pressures our hospitals come under.  They are pressures our hospitals are always under but we know that tipping point is hit every January.  I tried, my predecessors tried and my successors, in time, will try to handle it.  Unless we take some big, fundamental actions, that will be repeated each year.  I genuinely believe that the capacity review is a big part of that.  There is also the issue of trying to keep people out of hospitals in the first place.  Sometimes, in January, there is a bit of misinformed commentary.  If people are on a hospital trolley, a clinical decision has been made that those people need to be admitted to an acute hospital.  It is not a case of people who could go to see a GP, take two antibiotics, and be home in bed, resting.  The bigger question is, if those people had access to chronic disease management in the community and so on whether we could have avoided that acute incident ever happening.  That is where I think the GP contract has a role to play.</p> <p>  I am sure our colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Daly, would be delighted to answer the question about Bandon District Hospital if he was here but he is not so I will give it a go.  The Deputy is right.  I visited Bandon District Hospital and it seems to me to be a wonderful, very special place.  I was struck by the warmth of the staff and the patients.  I am conscious that there are issues before the Labour Court and it would be inappropriate of me to comment but I hear clearly from Deputy Murphy O'Mahony about the importance of the facility, specifically the respite facility, and the burden that the lack of the facility is placing on people in the Bandon area.  My Department and the HSE are watching developments with interest.</p> <p>  The director general might want to comment on the waiting list issue in a moment.  I am not a doctor and the Deputy pointed out that she is not one either.  The decision for people to be removed from waiting lists who no longer need to be on one is a clinical one.  There is no edict, nor should there ever be one, that a person is taken off a list unless a clinician believes that there is a better way to care for a person.  If the Deputy wishes to send the details of that individual case to the HSE, I am sure it will look at it.</p> <p>  A GP card for carers requires legislation.  I said it would come in quarter two of this year so I expect we can have this in place by summer.  Let us work together on that to try to get the legislation passed.  We have a very busy legislative agenda ahead, as we all know, from my Department in the coming weeks.  I would like to get that passed and in place by the summer.  Supports for rural GP practices, building on what my predecessor, the now Taoiseach, Deputy Varadkar, did, will be looked at in the context of the GP contract.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan rightly makes the point, as many of my colleagues also rightly make, that we are among the highest spenders on health care in the OECD.  Even when one strips out the proportion of private health care included in that figure, we are still at the high spending end of that league table at OECD level.</p><p>We have to look at what we are spending the money on.  I have previously used the analogy at this Committee of an old car which can be terribly expensive to run.  A neighbour up the road can have a newer, flashier car which is actually cheaper to keep on the road.  There is an issue here about the system we are pumping the money into.  It is no disrespect to the system, but politicians and HSE management have acknowledged that it has to be reformed and changed.  Patients are being treated in more high-cost locations - places they would rather not be - than is the case in other jurisdictions.</p><p> The point about people on trolleys is important.  We have to remember that we are talking about people and not get lost in figures.  The people on trolleys are those who clinicians have decided need to be in hospital.  The reason they are on a trolley rather than a bed is because there is not enough bed capacity in that hospital.  That is the straightforward part of the answer.  The more complex but equally important part relates to the possibility of making reforms in the community health sector and keeping those people well and living in the community so that they do not have to come to the hospital in the first instance.  That relates to some of what Deputy Kelleher referred to in terms of nursing homes.  It also refers to things such as the diabetes cycle of care and how we look after people with asthma and chronic diseases in general.  These have to be key priorities for us if we are to invest more in primary care.  We know that there is a benefit in that regard.</p><p> The Deputies spoke about primary care centres.  We have built a very good primary care infrastructure now.  We are still building it; I am opening another centre in Limerick on Monday and there are a number of them coming on stream in the coming weeks and months.  That is good.  The State has invested a substantial amount in primary care centres.  The conversation now has to move on to what is in those centres.  These centres require staff and diagnostics.  I opened a primary care centre in Castlebar recently and the X-ray and ultrasound machines are now in situ there.  Patients who would have had to go to Mayo University Hospital are now having their X-rays and ultrasound examinations done under the governance of the hospital but under the direction of the primary care centre.  That has had a very positive impact on those lists.  We have to investigate how many more primary care centres we implement that system in.  We have plans for a number of them in that regard.</p><p> I agree that we need extra beds by 2031.  The evidence also shows that we need a number of the beds now.</p><p> We should acknowledge that activity based funding has given us a greater sense of what we are spending money on and what we are getting in return.  We have to look at that in terms of the community.</p><p> I am aware of the issue concerning Crooksling nursing home.  I look forward to visiting it in the near future.  We certainly should not be reducing capacity anywhere.  When a facility is being decommissioned it should be replaced by a facility with not just the same amount of beds but more.  We also have to look at how we keep those facilities for the use of older people.  A local group has a number of ideas in that regard, and I am aware that the HSE in South Dublin County Council is engaging on that as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.314" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#M00200"><p>On the issue of nursing homes, in my opening statement, I was referring to situations where nursing homes were now following the guidelines so that patients with flu were being retained there.  Consequently it was not appropriate to discharge into them.  They were being supported both by public health teams and community intervention teams.  This is part of the emerging and developing integrated care programme for older persons.  We are seeing a reversal of the previous pattern where patients were automatically sent into hospitals.  We have to get further down that road, but it means that the nursing home, even if it has two or three empty beds, is otherwise effectively regarded as a flu ward into which we cannot discharge patients directly.  Overall, that is a better place to be.</p> <p>  I will ask Mr. Connaghan to comment on the performance issues relating to trolleys when I am finished because that is an area within his brief.</p> <p>  I do not agree with the committee's perception of the correspondence or the budget process as it relates to the service plan for 2018.  We have had the pleasure of discussing a number of service plans across this floor, and the spectre of the famous medical card probity issue of 2014 was raised.  We are nowhere near that territory.  The committee must know that if I had concerns of that nature I would express them, as I expressed them previously.  Within this service plan a number of risks to its successful delivery are spelled out.  The service plan in its full form was approved by the Minister, having consulted Government, with those risks taken into account.  Every service plan and every budget has some element of risk associated with it, and it is appropriate for a public body proposing a service plan for ministerial approval to be transparent with that Minister about what those risks are.  The 2004 legislation, combined with freedom of information legislation, makes our service planning process extraordinarily transparent, especially when added to the performance reporting process, which I would contend is more transparent in the HSE than in any other public body in the State.  That does not mean that from time to time we do not have some crunchy conversations where we share our different perspectives.  We are not living in North Korea; we can have good discussions.  We all accept the fundamental reality that, ultimately, the budget for the HSE is decided and announced on budget day.  Our task then is to construct a budget in the shape of a service plan which we can propose to the Minister and the Minister can subsequently approve.  We then publish that and make every effort that we possibly can to deliver that service plan in the way that we framed it.  That, essentially, is what this service plan is about.</p> <p>  The correspondence is the ordinary correspondence that goes on between Ministers and their officials.  I would not agree with the proposition that the Department of Health is not a strong advocate for the health system.  I believe it is.  I have worked within it and alongside it.  I have had the opportunity to work with every Minister of Health going back to Deputy Miche&aacute;l Martin, and every one has been a strong advocate for the health system in their day.  The difference between the past, when we were in the most difficult of economic circumstances, is that we now see targeted investments around specific improvements that were not possible in the past.  Matched against that, we seek - as outlined in the value improvement programme which Mr. Connaghan might say a word about - to use better the relative small proportion of the total resource we have, and stretch those resources to get the best possible range of services we can.  The overriding priorities are patient safety and access.  That has been clear in all of the correspondence from the Department and back to the Department.  The Minister has been very clear about it.  We will make our best efforts on all parts of the service plan, but nothing will take away from those priorities the greatest possible quantum of service to improve access in a way that supports the highest level of patient safety that we could possibly achieve with the resources we have.</p> <p>  On the variable performance regarding trolleys, as the Minister has said it is probably too simplistic to take the trolley count in a given hospital and reach a conclusion about the overall performance of that hospital.  It has to be adjusted for the size of the population it serves, for the resources it has and for the quality of the infrastructure it has in its emergency department versus the balance of the hospital.  I can give two examples of that.  Kilkenny and Limerick, hospitals which have had particularly challenging trolley counts this winter, are locations which have recently had the benefit of new acute care buildings with modern, first class, contemporary accommodation, versus ward accommodation which in general is of the "nightingale" variety.  Consequently the clinical decision is more likely to be to hold the patient in an individual room - which often has an en suite, climate control and environmental control - rather than transfer the patient to the ward, even though that will add to the trolley count in that particular hospital.  There are a variety of factors, and I will ask Mr. Connaghan to expand on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.315" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Connaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#M00300"><p>I will make some comments as someone who has recently joined the Irish health system from a different jurisdiction who has the benefit of being able to compare and contrast in some respects.  In common with most modern health economies, the Irish system has witnessed significant changes in bed use over the past ten years, characterised by a significant drop in length of stay for medical beds.  In recent years, that process improvement has begun to stand still.  In fact, we have flatlined over the past couple of years.  That points to a system where some of the process improvements we could make have begun to bottom out.</p><p>That is an important point in comparing the relative efficiency regarding the use of our resources, as Deputy Durkan pointed out.<br/><br/>The increasing elderly population is also an important factor.  Over the course of 2017, we have seen an increase in admissions of people over 75 of approximately 5.7%.That drives a longer length of stay.  Patients tend to be sicker and elderly patients tend to have increased comorbidity of a number of conditions, which means that the stay in hospital is more complex.  That makes discharge more difficult.  This is another material factor in considering where we stand regarding trolley waits.<br/><br/>One of the issues that strikes me about the Irish health care system is that our ability to discharge effectively and efficiently in the evenings and at weekends is hampered by our ability to have diagnostics readily available.  That is a simple fact in terms of the number of consultants and support staff that are available to man operate facilities on a 24-7 basis.  We need to consider what we can to do alleviate this as part of any consideration of expansion.  We cannot simply expand bed capacity without considering what needs to wrap around that to make the expansion more effective.<br/><br/>There are things we can still do in terms of pursuing process efficiencies.  This links in to value improvement.  There are a number of elements we need to consider that are perhaps not entirely in balance, such as the number of acute assessment beds we have, the number of beds in the system, and where we are in terms of community resources.  When we consider the differences in performance between Limerick and Beaumont, for example, which have been mentioned already, we can do some very simple maths.  What is the population we need to serve?  What is the expected rate of admissions and discharges and how does that lead to our bed base?  We can readily see that some parts of the system are more stressed than others.  We need to consider where we would ideally like to have beds in the longer term versus what is opportunistic and what we can invest in the short term.<br/><br/>We also have what I would call failure demand in the system, which is another reason that drives matters regarding people on trolleys.  Failure demand is where we cancel electives for a considerable period, which is what we do <i>in extremis</i>during the first part of January, and where they then reappear in the system as emergencies.  We need to avoid driving failure demand.  The long-term plan in Sl&aacute;intecare to separate elective and emergency care is perhaps something we really need to pursue quite quickly.  It would also allow us to enhance what we are doing in terms of efficiency and effectiveness regarding elective care.<br/><br/>I will pause there and can say a word or two about the value improvement programme if the Vice Chairman wishes.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.318" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1359" speakername="Finian McGrath" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#N00300"><p>There were three questions on disability concerning the UN convention, assessment of need and respite care.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony for her question.  I feel very strongly about the UN convention.  The Deputy is absolutely right that it is a very important issue for the disability sector in Ireland.  We have 645,000 people with some form of disability.  I also feel very strongly that we cannot hold back on ratification until the ink is dry on every remaining item of legislation.  We have made major progress in the last weeks, particularly up to Christmas.  We got the &euro;3 million to start up the decision support service and there is wide consultation in train on the deprivation of liberty; the Deputy may have seen the advertisements in the paper over the Christmas period.  I want to make sure every disability group and organisation as well as every organisation that advocates for senior citizens is involved in the process.  That is partly the reason for the delay.</p> <p>  The important thing is that we have a clear plan now.  On 30 January, the Government decided to authorise the ratification of the UN convention.  That is phase 1.  I am hoping to have a resolution before the D&aacute;il in the next two weeks.  My target in that regard is mid-February.  For the deposit of the instrument for the ratification, my target date is the end of February.  In the meantime, I will be looking for support from all the political parties to allow me some space in respect of the deprivation of liberty issue, the disability Bill and some of the other instruments that have to be put in place.  My objective is to have the resolution before the D&aacute;il in the next week or two and to ratify the convention by the end of the month.  I totally accept the criticisms of the delays.  A lot of complex issues arose, particularly around deprivation of liberty, and we want to get the legislation right.  We have it at the moment and are waiting for final consultation.</p> <p>  The UN convention sends out a strong message to every person on this island that we care about them and that we care about the rights of all people with disabilities.  More importantly, as well as caring we are putting in place the services to support them.  On jobs, for example, the UN convention should improve the economic prospects of people with disabilities.  In respect of gender equality, the convention will be of benefit to all persons with disabilities including women with disabilities.  Article 6 of the convention deals specifically with the position of women with disabilities.  Another issue that is important for people with disabilities and their families is that of poverty.  Implementation of the convention should improve the lives and chances of people with disabilities in reducing the incidence of poverty, particularly among people with disabilities but also in rural communities, which is an issue that arose this week.  The convention puts inclusion at the top of the political agenda.</p> <p>  As stated, I am aiming to have a resolution before the D&aacute;il in mid-February and ratification by the end of February.  Hopefully nothing will go wrong this time.</p></speech>

The matter is very complex.  I want the disability sector and those dealing with senior citizens to be involved in the process.  If it takes another few months to do that, so be it.  I will take the hits and deal with it.</p> <p>  On the assessment of need issue, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony rightly said this is a provision under Part 2 of the Disability Act, 2005.  There has been a steady increase in the applications.  I totally accept that.  The recent figures I have in front of me are in the region of 6,000 applications.  We know we are facing huge challenges in meeting the statutory time frames.  There are many complex cases but we have set out and are planning to act on the delays.  We are doing three major things.  We have put in place a comprehensive plan with individual measures for each CHO area to deal with this issue.  A new standard operational procedure for assessment of need is being implemented by the end of 2018.  This will improve efficiency in the operation of the assessment of need process and the compliance rates.  The reconfiguring of the disability services is taking place.  It is part of the Progressing Disability Services for Children and Young People programme.  Integrated teams are operating well and the assessment of need process is running more smoothly than in other cases.  A policy review is taken place in respect of assessment of need, with the ambition to extend it to adults in 2020.</p></speech>

I appreciate the support I have received from the committee and other colleagues, as well as the strong support I have received from the Minister the Department of Health and the HSE.  We accepted before Christmas that there was a huge crisis in respite services.</p><p>This is why we got together with our colleagues in government and in opposition to look for extra funding.  We received an additional &euro;10 million on top of this year's budget to enhance the respite service and the disability sector.  Of this, &euro;8 million is for an extra 19,000 nights respite care on a full year basis.  These are to be provided in ten new dedicated respite houses throughout the HSE community health organisation areas.  There will be three in the greater Dublin area.  The other &euro;2 million has been put away in a special pocket for innovative respite solutions, such as home sharing or extended day services, to provide assistance where people need it most.</p></speech>

Three new community houses will be in the Dublin area.  It is an issue we take very seriously.  There is agreement in the Department and the HSE that when we invest in disability services we must deal with priority cases first.  I have a budget for this.  Do we need more money?  We absolutely do, but we have started building.  As I have said previously, our key objectives are to invest in services, reform services and, with the new momentum for the UN convention, to put the person with the disability at the centre of the services.  This is what I hope for 2018.</p></speech>

I also apologise if I ask questions which have already been asked.  I know from Twitter that certain things have been asked.  If I duplicate questions I ask the witnesses to let me know and I will look back later.</p><p>This morning, there was an article in the <i>Irish Mirror</i>by Mikie O'Loughlin about the alleged refusal of the morning-after pill in a community pharmacy setting to a girl who claimed rape.  As a community pharmacist I never realised it was my role when dispensing the morning-after pill to judge or to have any role with regard to how the unprotected sex happened.  My understanding as a community pharmacist is our role is specifically on seeing whether the product is suitable and making sure that patient gets the service required.  Perhaps whoever feels they are most qualified might comment on this.  Perhaps it is a once off, but if it is going on in our community pharmacies it would be prudent for the HSE to have an advertising campaign, particularly in light of the Minister making the morning-after pill available at the weekend to medical card holders, which I do not believe was ever advertised.  Perhaps there is an advertising campaign to be done on accessibility to emergency contraception.  It is topical in light of recent discussions on the eighth amendment and some parliamentarians' views on self-certification or justification of termination of pregnancy in the case of rape.</p><p>The Minister is aware we spoke at the eighth amendment committee on the availability of free contraception, and it was raised by the Irish Family Planning Association that 18% of women, which is almost one in five, who are non-medical card holders have an issue with a price barrier when it comes to contraception.  I thank the HSE for its response.  Approximately &euro;90 per year on contraception is the average amount reimbursed by the State per woman.  Will the Minister let me know whether he is considering rolling this out and whether we have a timeline?</p><p>Another issue has come to my attention and I ask the witnesses to correct me on it if I am wrong.  People used to get a medical card if they had cancer and this was taken away some years ago.  I know from my previous role it was a great comfort to cancer patients and primary care providers that if someone had a bad diagnosis the GP could just write a prescription and the pharmacist would dispense it, and we would sort out the medical card payment element when we had dealt with the patient in a caring manner.  It has come to my attention that it is now a discretionary card and there appear to be issues with people having to prove they have cancer.  I am not big into anecdotal evidence, but I have heard that people are being required to justify getting the card by having to state they might definitely die, or they are definitely terminal or definitely at stage four.  To me, particularly in the case of children with cancer, this is just not humane.  It is not humane to ask parents to guarantee their children will be dead in 12 months so they will definitely be given a medical card.  This is not the way to approach things.  Can this be streamlined?  Can there be a nicer and more holistic way of doing it?  The way it used to happen four or five years ago worked really well.  We all got paid and the patient got fixed up.  I never heard as many complaints as I have heard recently.</p><p>The Vice Chairman raised the issue of a letter sent on HSE headed notepaper to Members of the Houses by Ciaran Sean Clarke, and I know it has been dealt with to some extent.  Perhaps the HSE could let the committee know under what cases can staff employed by the HSE use headed notepaper.  As a parliamentarian I am very conscious of what I put on personal and on headed notepaper.</p></speech>

What are the actual rules?  There must be a list of rules somewhere on when people can use headed paper and when then cannot.</p> <p>  Do we have any news on the roll-out of the male HPV vaccine?  Do we have any new data on the uptake?  We were up at 61% recently.</p> <p>  Yesterday in the Chamber, Deputy Clare Daly raised the case of the lady who died during an intervention into an ectopic pregnancy in Holles Street hospital.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, stated he was disappointed by the hospital which, I understand, is threatening to injunct the Minister for Health.  Will the Minister comment on this situation?  How does he see it moving forward?  The committee has spoken previously about dragging people through judicial processes when they have been through extreme trauma.  Is that really the way to treat people?</p> <p>  I welcome the trauma centres proposed by the Minister.  Will the witnesses comment on the integration of this plan with the Sl&aacute;intecare report?  We are back to the structures of the HSE and how these trauma centres might fit into any proposed realignment of community health organisations and the training hospitals in each area.  Is there any intention on the part of the HSE to educate people on the pathways to follow once they have a trauma or injury?  I have long felt that many children in the accident and emergency departments in children's hospitals have not had a serious accident.  They may just have a broken bone.</p><p>People in the community are not aware of some of the primary care centres, especially the centre in Smithfield for minor injuries.  That is a really good set up.  Many people in Dublin city do not know that is available.</p></speech>

I apologise if I go over some of the ground again.  I had to deal with a Commencement Matter in the Seanad.</p><p>I am grateful for the comprehensive reply to my question on the availability of drugs.  There is a question mark over short supply of some medication, some pharmaceuticals.  I have got a comprehensive reply and I appreciate that.  There are two issues.  The reply confirms that there is a short supply in some areas and the HSE is dealing with it.  <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>recently had a report on overprescribing.  The usage of one particular drug has gone up by more than 1,000%.  That huge increase in the use of medication is a major cost to the health service.  In one case it went from slightly over 100,000 people taking an item to more than 600,000 using it.  There is also a big budgetary problem with orphan drugs.  Is it time to look carefully at the availability and use of drugs?  On the one hand we seem to have overuse and on the other hand we do not seem to have funding to provide for particular drugs.  Do we now need to have a full review of how we are managing the cost of pharmaceuticals and drugs?</p><p>As part of my question I also raised the issue of the effect of Brexit on the availability of drugs because we are very much tied to the UK market in many ways.  We need to plan for that adequately.  In fairness, the reply deals with that.  That is another issue we need to plan for.</p><p>I know people may be tired of me raising the issue of the increase in administration and administrative staff.  I was given figures this morning indicating an additional 2,605 administrative and managerial staff in the HSE since 2014, which I calculate to be a 17% increase.  I know the argument will be put to me that there were cutbacks in difficult times and this needs to be made up.  However, the HSE now has 17,715 people in administrative and managerial roles.  That is an increase of 17%.  The number of staff nurses has increased by 3.65%.  The number of public health nurses, who are to the forefront of helping us keep people out of hospitals, has increased by 3.69%.  People on the front line in section 39 organisations are having difficulty because we have not restored the cuts they suffered.</p><p>While I know there is more paperwork related to health care, there has been a disproportionate increase in administrative and managerial staff.  A 17.2% increase does not sit right with me.  I raised this question 12 months ago and I raised it two years ago.  Where is the cut-off point?  The HSE now has 17,715 people.  Is the cut-off point 17,800?  Is it 18,000?  Is it 19,000?  Surely the HSE has a plan.  If we go down this road, we will not have the funding to sort out the people in the section 39 organisations.  We will have a difficulty in recruiting public health nurses.  The whole job in health care is to keep people out of hospitals.  The only people who can do that are the people who work on the front line - out in the community.  I ask for a detailed reply on that issue.</p><p>I also raised the issue of elderly care.  I am grateful for the reply on that.  I suggested we need to have a forum involving all the focus groups, nursing homes and the care providers.  We have a huge change in the demographics with a greater number of people living longer and therefore greater demand.  Many nursing homes are experiencing difficulty in getting GP cover at weekends.  How will we deal with that?  I am talking about dealing with that immediately because that cannot be parked.</p><p>Many people need to go from nursing homes into hospitals because our health service does not provide the care for them in the nursing home.  A simple example is with dieticians.  Dieticians employed by the HSE will not attend nursing homes because they are not covered for travel expenses.  If a patient needs to see a dietician, someone has to go into the hospital with them.  It takes up time in the hospitals and there is an issue with value for money.  The private sector is coming into many nursing homes and prescribing supplements giving rise to a huge cost to the health service.  Those are simple examples.  That is why we should have a forum.  There are 23,000 or 24,000 people in nursing homes.  We need to see how we can create efficiencies in dealing with people in nursing homes rather than putting them through accident and emergency departments, but it needs to be co-ordinated.</p><p>Those are the issues I want to raise.  I again thank the people who dealt with the questions I submitted.  I raise those issues on foot of those replies.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1378" speakername="Rose Conway Walsh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#P00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  It is really good to have all the decision makers in the room at the same time.  Sometimes it feels a bit like Wimbledon, going back and forth from one to the other.  I am really happy they are all here this morning.</p> <p>  I wish to raise the issue of the Versatis patch, which affects 25,000 people.  Since 1 December, I have been contacted by many people who are really concerned about this.  It goes right through the lifecycle, and includes older people and younger people with arthritis.  All of them have one thing in common; they are all in chronic pain.  I know the witnesses will have been contacted by a large number of GPs who have said that this is the treatment their patients require.  I am baffled over why it has been withdrawn.  The message it sends out is that people who have the money will not be in pain but those without the money will have to continue in pain.  The alternative treatment for that type of chronic pain is either morphine or paracetamol.  The patients are telling me that the paracetamol and other drugs that are given are not working.  They really do not want to go on morphine because of all its side effects.</p> <p>  Has the HSE done a cost-benefit analysis of that decision?  I am really concerned about the escalating mental health impact even over the short time since it has been denied on the medical card or the drugs refund scheme.  The amount of additional money the HSE will end up spending on antidepressants and other drugs that do not work will far outweigh the &euro;30 million being spent on Versatis.</p><p>That is outside the cost of the isolation and what it does to patients.  For example, I have a 31-year-old constituent with chronic arthritis who is in much pain.  She was able to get out and drive around the community, leading a somewhat independent life.  She cannot do so now and she is confined to her bed.  All the calls I get from her are made from her bed.  I am extremely worried about her and other patients left like this.</p><p> For somebody like that, the option is to go to a pain management clinic and ask what to do because he or she is immobilised.  People must ask how they can be helped.  The patient I mention has been on the waiting list since July 2016.  When Vertsatis was no longer available and she contacted the relevant people, she was told it would be at least another 15 months on the list.  There is nowhere to turn for these patients other than their GPs.  Those GPs are advocating in the best way they can.  What is the process for looking at this again?  I know there are other drugs.  The witness might tell me this was designed especially for people in the aftermath of shingles but there must be other drugs in the system that treat multiple conditions.  This is one such drug.</p><p> My second issue concerns physiotherapy services.  In Mayo - I am sure it is not unique to the county - there are people waiting months, including children with disabilities.  I am glad to see the man with a plan here and what he is working towards.  At this moment we have children with disabilities who are supposed to be getting clinically assessed for weekly physiotherapy but they have not had physiotherapy since September.  It is a fact and there is no way to hide it.  What plans are in place for that?  I have asked colleagues to submit a number of parliamentary questions in this regard.  In Erris the physiotherapist is back again and I hope that will somewhat reduce the list within that confined area.  It is a serious problem that must be examined now.</p><p> I must also ask for an update on Translarna.  The Minister has met Lewis Harte-Walsh and I thank him for that.  He knows how time-sensitive is the approval of Translarna.  I am not sure where Mr. Connaghan has come from or the jurisdictions in which he has served.  I was trying to pick up the accent but whether it is Scotland or any of the other 22 countries, he would know Translarna is approved there, albeit conditionally in some parts.  We need to have it approved here quickly.  There are only five children who need this drug so we are not talking about huge amounts of money.</p><p> The Castlebar primary care centre is an excellent service and I look forward to increased services within that.  There is an issue around Castlebar and I ask for it to be taken into account when planning the other primary care centres.  We should not be in a position where the primary care centre physical structure is built and we then start looking for staff.  We should do it much earlier, possibly at the planning stage.  There is also an issue with transport.  The primary care centres must be careful of working in isolation.  There is a primary care centre outside the town but people on very low incomes and dependent on social welfare may have to pay for taxis to get in and out from those centres.  It is cost-prohibitive.  There must be a process with the community transport system to help patients get in and out and make the centre accessible.</p><p> Could I get an update on staffing for Coolock, Darndale and Dungarvan?  The Taoiseach's maiden speech mentioned that everybody would looked after from Dungarvan to Doohoma.  I would also like an update on Limerick city, Boyle and Westport and Claremorris in the Mayo area.  I am concerned that if no new staff is being put in place, staff will be dragged in from surrounding areas.  That is fine but I am really concerned about the surrounding areas, again because there is no public transport.  I cannot see how this will increase capacity within these communities unless there is additional staff.  Perhaps we can get an update.</p><p> I must ask the Minister again about a case that I raised with him in 2016 concerning a man waiting for a spinal operation.  He is still waiting for it.  He had an operation but could not have another one because of capacity issues in Galway.  He is now in the Mater hospital.</p></speech>

If somebody is waiting, in dire pain and display suicidal tendencies and behaviours, where do I go?  I am at a loss.  There are cases across the board and I really need to know what to do in those cases when somebody is presenting with suicidal behaviour.</p> <p>  There has been much discussion of capacity in hospitals and step-down beds.  Are there plans to provide more services through the district hospitals, perhaps looking to reverse some of the Fianna F&aacute;il decisions to close the beds in these district hospitals?  Is the reversal of that policy being considered, with investment being put into district hospitals and particularly hospitals like that in Belmullet, which saw half of its beds cut in 2010?

I will throw in my questions, although we normally take them in sets of three.  The first question relates to the neuro-rehabilitation strategy.  I would like an update on that and also information on whether the people who deliver the specialist community care can be included as part of the implementation group.  That is not the overall umbrella group but rather people with direct experience of delivering that community care.</p> <p>  I have raised the matter of doctors getting paid for a qualification they do not have.  I have done this repeatedly and there is probably a nicer way of putting it.  It is entirely the fault of the HSE and the witnesses know as well as I do how contracts of indefinite duration work.  It can leave things like this open.  Nothing has been done to stop this from happening and I am definitely not convinced of the idea that people who are already busy and overstretched are now supposed to monitor their colleagues.</p> <p>  Will the Minister update us on the Comhliosta, the integrated hospital waiting list management system?  Mr. O'Brien mentioned that 100 beds were purchased in private hospitals.  This relates to the budget, and we all appreciate that peace has broken out between the parties here, whether or not it is normal to be otherwise.  Was this purchase budgeted for at the beginning of the year or was that extra?  Will it happen again?  What is the cost per bed night?  How was the decision made?  Does it come directly from the hospital budget or is there a special emergency budget?  Will the witnesses outline that?</p> <p>  The Minister referred to waiting lists and said nobody is taken from a list unless a clinical decision is made.  My understanding is sometimes people are taken from those lists without a clinical decision being made.  A letter or text message is sent asking if a person still wants the appointment.  If the person cannot or does not reply - there can sometimes be very good reasons - the person is taken from the list.  That would not be a clinical decision but one effectively made by an administrator.</p><p> With regard to early intervention, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, mentioned the assessment of need.  I have been informed that in the CRC the speech and language therapist, SLT, is on maternity leave, the occupational therapist has another job and has left, and the physio, likewise, is not around.  Are there any plans to recruit these staff?  How will they be replaced?  Parents from all over the country, specifically, from my area, have presented themselves to the CRC only to be told that the wherewithal is not there to help them.</p><p> I refer to the use of PPS numbers as a unique identifier.  My colleague, Senator Warfield, has written to the Minister in this regard.  We understand that instructions have been issued to hospitals to use the PPS number and that it is necessary for PCRS reimbursement.  When we discussed this here, we had a long conversation about how the PPS number could not be used because it did not have sufficient protections to protect the anonymity of the patient.  The Minister might comment on that.</p><p> The issue of transvaginal mesh products has been raised with me.  I was very disappointed, not with anyone in this room - they all will be delighted to know - but with the Taoiseach, who stated that he did not have an answer on the day because he had not been briefed about it.  It is not the habit - of anyone in my party anyway and I do not know about others - to brief the Taoiseach on what is coming up on Leaders' Questions but it was the subject of a "Prime Time" programme the night before.  I was surprised.  I am aware that those who are suffering as a result of complications were very disappointed.  I note that Deputy O'Connell had also raised this issue as have others.  It is very concerning.</p><p> My last issue relates to a letter the Minister sent me.  It is in regard to the Minister examining the possible extension of the reimbursement scheme for those who are living donors.  I want to put on the record that I welcome that letter.  We are hopeful of a positive outcome for a very small number of people, but people who give something unique and good.  The Minister might expand on that a little.</p><p> There is a significant number of questions but health is a very important issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#R00200"><p>Absolutely.  I thank the Cathaoirleach.</p> <p>  I thank Deputy O'Connell for raising a number of important issues, as always.  On the issue regarding the morning-after pill, I obviously do not have enough facts to comment with any degree of certainty other than to say I want to live in a country and see a health service that provides women with access to the supports that they are legally entitled to, such as the morning-after pill, without any degree of judgment, cross-examination, interrogation or anything else.  While I do not know the facts in that case, I would suggest that there are a number of avenues open to anybody in highlighting that with the regulatory authorities.  Everybody has a professional responsibility in terms of discharging the law of the land.  As the Deputy correctly points out, in my time as Minister for Health I have made a number of policy decisions to try to help improve access to that, most particularly, the fact that a person with a medical card can now access it directly through her pharmacy, as a person without a medical card could always do, without her now needing to go to her general practitioner.  I take the point the Deputy makes about the need to ensure that information is publicly available and I will certainly undertake to do that.</p> <p>  On access to contraception and free contraception, I am very much of the view in reading the report of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Eighth Amendment of the Constitution, of which the Deputy was a member, that it is not all about terminations.  The report is not all about abortion and anybody who represents it as such has not read it correctly or at all.  If one reads the report, while it obviously makes a number of recommendations on termination in Ireland, and the committee's view that the eighth amendment should be repealed in full, a view which I support, it also addresses a number of things the State and the health services must do to protect pregnant women, to support pregnant women, to support people in crisis pregnancy, to increase access to counselling, and to improve sex education and access to contraception in general.  As the Deputy will be aware, I have set up within my Department, as a response to the Oireachtas committee's report, a working group chaired by the Chief Medical Officer to work through what I refer to as ancillary recommendations.  I nearly think it is unfortunate that they are called "ancillary" recommendations as no doubt they are core to the broader and wide debate that is already under way in this country.  We will examine it in that context.</p> <p>  On the issue of medical cards, I will ask the director general to comment in a moment but I would just make two points.  First, we have seen a massive increase, rightly, and thankfully, in the number of discretionary medical cards in this country.  On 1 January 2014, there were 50,294 discretionary medical cards.  One year later, there were 76,665.  Another year later, there were 99,396.  Another year later, on 1 January 2017, there were 116,362.  On 1 January of this year, the number was 131,160.  We had 50,294 people with discretionary medical cards at the start of 2014 and have 131,160 now.  I hope that is reflective of a compassionate system, that when somebody does not qualify on means grounds there is a compassionate approach in that regard.</p> <p>  On the issue of children with cancer, the director general prior to my time in the Department of Health took a decision on their automatic eligibility which was the right decision.  For children with cancer, there is automatic eligibility.  I will ask the director general to comment on that in a moment.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of the HPV vaccine for boys, as the committee will be aware, I have asked HIQA to carry out a health technology assessment, HTA.  We will know the final outcome of that by the autumn.  We may begin to have an indication of the likely outcome of that a little earlier than that.  Obviously, I will be guided by that.  Instinctively, I see great benefit in it.  However, I need to be guided by the HIQA HTA as well.</p> <p>  On the issue of a case before the court, I need to do something I do not like doing which is bite my lip.  I will say as long as I am Minister for Health I will always take the approach of trying to put systems and structures in place to ensure that people who suffer a bereavement who loose of a loved one through the maternity services can have access to all of the facts and all of the information and that the system can learn from such tragedies.  It is a matter of public fact that I met Mr. Thawley and when I sat in a room with a grieving widower who has lost his young, beautiful and healthy wife, I told that man we would establish the facts.  I intend to honour that commitment.  As the committee will be aware, we have made a policy decision that all maternal deaths will now be subject to an external review.  That is appropriate.  It is good practice.  It is something that should be welcomed by the maternity services in general in terms of ensuring learning across the system.  We have established in the HSE a women and infants' health programme and we have Dr. Peter McKenna, the clinical director, there as well.  We are making positive strides in that regard.  On matters before the court, I am happy to let them play out but, instinctively, my view is we should not be finding people in court in these situations.</p> <p>  I thank the Deputy for her comments regarding the issue of trauma policy.  As Minister for Health, I have the honour of bringing it to Government and publishing it.  The only reason I am able to do that is because of the incredible work of clinicians of the HSE and of patients and patient groups over a sustained period of time since 2015.  This is something that every doctor will tell one will save lives and will improve outcomes.  It is something we badly need in this country.  We cannot have a situation where we can stand over a system where almost 30% of patients are ending up effectively in the wrong location when they suffer a major trauma and are being transferred to other locations.  I have heard commentary that simply is not true about ED reconfiguration.  It is really not about this.  Approximately, 1.2 million people attend the emergency departments each year.  We are talking about a cohort of major trauma patients of 1,600.  When one divides that up, it amounts on average to four a day.  We are talking about getting those patients to the right place.  There probably is not an Oireachtas Member who has not been in contact with the HSE over his or her years as a public representative about a patient in a hospital who really needs to get to Beaumont or CUH.  I have heard the Chair on this and she is correct.  There are issues of connectivity and that is why this is a plan that will not be implemented overnight.  We have published the plan now and we will implement it.</p><p>I really believe that, despite all the difficulties our health service faces, we have shown as a country that when we publish a policy plan in key specialties, we can make real differences.  We have seen this with cancer.  We are now beginning to see it with our national maternity plan, and I believe we can also see it regarding trauma.  The point made was entirely correct.  The plan emphasises heavily the fact that it is not just about treating the major trauma incident in the hospital; it refers to a five-step pathway.  One is obviously prevention.  How do we prevent and reduce major trauma?  I particularly welcome the support of agencies such as the Road Safety Authority in this regard.  There is a need for us to make our workplaces more safe and to minimise the number of workplace accidents.  There is a need to continue with the mental health agenda to reduce the incidence of self-harm.  All of these can cause major trauma.  There is a very important piece on rehabilitation.  The idea is not to put all the patients in the major trauma centre and say &quot;Job done.&quot;  The point is that a patient who requires a major trauma centre should be able to get there quickly and receive the expert care needed and then be transitioned back to the community, or local hospitals, thus freeing up space in the major trauma centre.  Therefore, there has to be a full continuum of care.  We have a lot of work to do in that regard.<br/><br/>On Senator Colm Burke's point, I will ask the director general of the HSE to talk about over-prescribing and what the HSE is doing in that regard.  Much of the data associated with the excellent work done by <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>probably came from the HSE's medicines management programme.  It is very important work that Susan Mitchell put into the public domain.<br/><br/>The point the Senator made is a very interesting one.  When I talk about value improvement programmes in the health service and the idea that the Irish health service, like most other health services in the developed world, should have value improvement programmes, which view is shared by the HSE, I do so in the belief that this is an area we have got to consider.  We must consider how we can achieve better value and clinical outcomes for our patients.  We all know that over-prescribing of medication is a challenge in this regard.  I hope to be in a position very shortly to make a significant announcement on Ireland's participation in international collaboration on drug pricing.  We have been working quite hard on this for quite a period, and we are almost at decision point in terms of formalising our involvement in international collaboration.  I will ask the director general, as the employer of the administrators and others referred to, to comment on this.<br/><br/>My Department received almost 12,000 parliamentary questions last year, which is good.  Almost all of them, or very many of them, get referred to the HSE because they refer to operational matters.  Those questions are answered by administrators.  I take Senator Burke's point absolutely that there needs to be a plan and an understanding of the appropriate level to be reached.  That is a very well made point.  I differ slightly on the assertion that only front-line staff can produce a direct patient benefit.  Bearing in mind much of the Healthy Ireland agenda, if one goes to see a hospital consultant today one notes the man or woman managing the files outside that consultant's door is making sure the waiting list continues to decrease.  Therefore, I very much see a role for administrators.  In fairness, the Senator acknowledged in his contribution that we saw, during the recession in particular, significant reductions in administrative roles in an effort to protect the front line, but to the point where it may now be having an adverse impact on the front line.  Nurses and doctors are asking me who should answer the telephone when it rings in the ward.  Therefore, there is a need to get this right.  I take the Senator's point.  It is right that he has highlighted the matter.  I shall ask the director general to comment on it.<br/><br/>With regard to the idea of having a forum on nursing home care and how we interact with the nursing home sector, I appreciate the director general's view but I am positively disposed to the idea and instinctively believe it is good.  We will not be able to deal with all the challenges facing the demographic trends in this country on our own.  We already know that the nursing homes sector, including both public and private elements, plays a major role and is likely to play an even more significant one in the years ahead.  Structured engagement on best practice and the exchange of ideas are a good use of everybody's time.<br/><br/>I thank Senator Rose Conway-Walsh for her questions, most of which I will ask the HSE to answer.  I will start the answers on some of the questions.<br/><br/>With regard to the Versatis patch, the decision was made by the medicines management programme on clinical grounds.  I have heard people's concerns.  I have been listening to people expressing concern.  As Professor Michael Barry stated eloquently in recent days, there is a process whereby a general practitioner can say to the medicines management board that a certain patient needs the patch.  It is important to point out that there is already an appeals process in place.  The director general might expand on that.<br/><br/>On the issue of Translarna, I had a meeting with the Senator in Castlebar.  I thank her for facilitating that.  I very much understand the sensitivities and the importance of this issue.  The Senator is talking about a mother who wants to keep her son out of a wheelchair for as long as possible so he can have as much quality of life as possible.  I understand his condition affects quite a small number of patients in this country.  As a result of the meeting in Castlebar, I had a meeting with representatives of Muscular Dystrophy Ireland in Dublin.  They brought along a clinician, from Temple Street, I believe.  At that meeting, we had a good discussion on the process that is still under way and the importance of the relevant company and the HSE engaging of this matter.  I am conscious of the various legal aspects, on which I will not comment.<br/><br/>On the issue of smaller hospitals, I have two points.  The capacity review makes it very clear that we do need to increase capacity significantly.  It also makes it very clear that all the capacity does not need to be in major acute hospitals.  The step-down, transitional-care and elective facilities have a role to play.  I envisage a very secure, sustained role for our smaller hospital network now and in the future.  I believe it is likely that bed stock in a number of smaller hospitals will have to increase for clinically appropriate purposes in those locations.  All of this will be determined by my working through the capacity review with the capital plan on which I am engaging with Government colleagues. <br/><br/>It is important to refer to the idea of setting up hospital groups and of having hospital group boards.  We now have such boards for all our hospital groups  The idea is that the centre does not dictate to everybody.  We do not say a certain hospital must do a certain thing now.  The hospital groups come up with strategic plans and ascertain how best they can use the health infrastructure available within their area.  I look forward to receiving strategic plans from all the groups this year.<br/><br/>Most of the questions of the Vice Chairman are more appropriate for the director general.  On the neurorehabilitation strategy, the idea that there would be an inclusive process of involvement makes sense.  The HSE is undertaking that body of work so I will ask it to respond.<br/><br/>The Vice Chairman asked about the position on the specialist register.  Comhliosta is a matter we have talked about for quite a while.  The NTPF has a body of work on this.  There are two parts to advancing any body of work.  One involves the e-health agenda, on which I am hoping to make good progress in our capital plan.  The second concerns the operational aspect.  Mr. Liam Woods might be in a position to expand on that.  The director general can talk about the cost of the private beds.<br/><br/>With regard to the administrative validation of waiting lists, the point I was making in response to Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony was based on a patient who was told they no longer needed their treatment.  The patient was told by a clinician, not an administrator.  Even when we do administratively validate lists, there is a role for the general practitioner in terms of reinstating someone's position on the list.<br/><br/>I am very positively disposed to the idea on living donors.  We have made some changes in that regard.  I have asked officials to examine the Vice Chairman's suggestions-----</p></speech>

I have asked the chief medical officer to do a body of work on this.  I saw the programme in question and have heard about the experiences of women who have had very debilitating conditions and who face very upsetting circumstances.  I have noted the impact on their families.  I have to balance this with the comments of the clinicians on the programme.  They said that, in some cases, they believe the treatment in question is appropriate.  From my perspective as Minister for Health, I believe the most appropriate thing I can do is ask the chief medical officer to consider international practice.  The Deputy and I have discussed on the floor of the D&aacute;il the point that the HPRA is the appropriate point of contact for any complaints or concerns in this regard.  As the Deputy knows, it is processing a number of them.  I will keep in touch with the Deputy on this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.360" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#S00800"><p>I thank the Minister for his answers.  With regard to the HPV vaccine, I welcome the fact that HIQA is due to report by the autumn.  Some 30,000 boys will not be vaccinated this year, because of the loss.  I could hazard a guess that it will probably be September 2019 before we seek to start vaccinating.  Perhaps I am wrong; perhaps it will be six months earlier.  While we are on a roll here and while we have managed to reverse from 50% or 51% up to 61%, there might be an opportunity to move things on a little faster.</p><p> Mr. O'Brien mentioned the ancillary or core recommendations that we would like to change.  I remember a pie chart from the recommendations.  The split was 44% to 56%.  However, give or take, 50% of crisis pregnancies are due to no contraception and 50% are due to contraception failure.  I fully support the position on accessibility to contraceptives to bring about a reduction of crisis pregnancies - I know the Vice Chairman shares my view in this regard.  In the first instance, this should happen through sex education.  Furthermore, adult contraception would seem like a good place to start.</p><p> I am conscious of the medical view on the vaginal mesh.  It seems to be used to treat various conditions and there are various ways of going about it.  This is relevant for the maternity strategy.  To a great extent, incontinence, especially in women, was a taboo subject for years.  It was seen as a side effect of having children.  The thinking was that women would get over it and it was not spoken about.  I maintain the lack of pre-natal and post-natal physiotherapy as well as the quick through-put of women through hospitals are relevant factors.  A woman is seldom in hospital longer than three or four days after having a baby.  Indeed, we hear of some people being out after three or four hours.  I acknowledge the great work that public health nurses do but I have found that it tends to be focused more around the baby rather than the mother.  It is a pity the Minister of State at the Department of Health, Deputy Daly, is missing.  One of the primary reasons for admission to nursing homes is incontinence.  When it is not dealt with at maternity level, it goes into later life for women and causes problems.  Incontinence can lead to urinary tract infections and this outcome is a common cause of confusion and falls in older people.</p><p> All this feeds into neglect of our maternity services.  There is a major lack of investment and neglect of women in this country.  It is all linked and it has an effect on quality of life.  I know the Minister for Health is worn out from listening to me talking about incontinence pads, but there is significant expense on people as a result of this.  Furthermore, there is the green aspect of the disposal of same.</p><p> I welcome the increase in medical cards for children.  I hope children are getting them easily.  We need to ensure that, in cases where adults are diagnosed, we make it as easy as possible for applicants to fill in the form and get medical cards.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.362" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#T00200"><p>That is interesting.  I will comment first and then pass over to the director general.</p> <p>  I do not disagree with a word Deputy O'Connell has said on the issue of our maternity services - I doubt anyone present disagrees either.  The fact that we did not have a national maternity strategy in Ireland until 2016 tells us all we need to know about it being the proverbial Cinderella of the Irish health service.  We are now on the cusp of being able to advance plans to build new maternity hospitals, relocate maternity hospitals and advance our anomaly scans.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the human papilloma virus vaccine.  We have done something great in this country.  I am proud of the work of the HSE and the political leadership from many people in this room and in these Houses.  I am proud of the work of all the clinicians who have supported this as well.  We have managed to do something that other countries have not managed to do, that is, reverse a concerning trend in HPV prevalence.  We need to continue on that track.  There can be no room for complacency.  We continually need to call out those who profess to be medical experts, but who are not, and who put forward dangerous misinformation, often on social media.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked about the expansion of the vaccine to boys.  Deputy O'Connell, as a scientist, will appreciate that it is appropriate for me to follow the scientific advice from the health technology assessment process.  That is why I asked HIQA to get that process under way.  I expect to be better informed of the outcome shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.363" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018020700002#T00300"><p>I wish to be clear about the position of medical cards for children.  Any child below the age of 18 years who has been diagnosed with cancer is automatically entitled to a medical card for a subsequent five-year period.  That has been the case for two-and-a-half years.  The standard process for a person above the age of 18 years has not changed in recent times.  Discretionary medical cards are available for those with cancer.  Should there be a diagnosis of terminal cancer &ndash; there is no crude timeline &ndash; there is an emergency medical card application process.  There has been no policy change in that regard.  If committee members are experiencing individual exemplars of some procedural change then we will look at them.</p> <p>  A question was raised about staffing numbers.  Since October 2013 figures for medical and dental nursing are up by 9%, health and social care professionals are up by 21%, other patient care staff numbers are up by 24% and administration management is up by 17%.  The administration management category ranges from the most junior grade, grade III, right up to senior managers.  Some 85.7% of the total are in front-facing roles in care delivery settings.  That reflects to some extent what the Minister was saying.</p> <p>  I made a journey around the health system, especially during the period when there was significant reductions in clerical and administrative posts.  One of the key points made to me by health professionals, who were often in short supply themselves, was that what they most needed was someone to lift the administrative burden in order that they could focus more on the direct provision of patient care.</p> <p>  The number of senior managers represents only 1.4% of the total workforce.  That is comparable with other health systems.  Clearly, we need to have an overall strategic view on the right balance between the various grades.  We go through a process each year that involves ourselves, the Department of Health and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It centres on what is called the funding workforce plan and it seeks to address those concerns.  The broader workforce planning process has been outlined and published by the Department of Health.</p></speech>

We talk about trying to keep people out of the hospital system, but if we do not have people working in the community, then we have a problem.  That is the point I am raising.</p></speech>

We have significant increased our public health nursing workforce in the past year.  We have not quite reached the objectives sought, but we will seek to increase our nursing and other front-facing health professionals in line with our ability to recruit.  The only thing that holds us back is our ability to recruit in that area.  There is no question of an agenda of not recruiting to refill posts in those areas.  We increase the workforce in line with the funded workforce plan.</p> <p>  Senator Conway-Walsh asked about the patches.  It is important to emphasise that there has been no withdrawal of reimbursement for those patches.  There has been the introduction of a secondary layer of approval.  On a three-month basis, it is possible, on application by a general practitioner, for approval to be granted for a continued prescription under the medicines management programme.</p></speech>

At that point, a patient could be started on the patches for a three-month period.  Within that three-month period, if the GP wanted to continue prescribing, then the GP would need to register that on the application system.  In other words, what is being introduced is a higher level of clinical supervision for the prescribing of the patches.</p></speech>

Have a large number of applicants been turned down?  Could it be the case that GPs are not aware of the programme?  It would be quite worrying, if that was the case, but I do not think it is.</p></speech>

I do not have data for the proportion of applications which are approved.  The reason the programme was introduced was there a strong sense that the patch was being prescribed inappropriately, both by condition and duration.  The clear intention was to have greater clinical supervision of patients who would otherwise have gone on to receive the patch for an overly extended period for conditions which were not indicated.  Consequently, it is inevitable that some patients will be switched to other medications.  That was the intention of the programme.</p></speech>

On the timing of questions, I fully appreciate what Mr. O'Brien said.  Equally, the HSE could time its responses according to when it received questions.  I hold up my hands as I suspect it was my questions that went in on Monday morning.  However, there were others which were received long before then.  I do not see why everything has to be left to the last minute.  Responses could be sent according to when questions were received.  It will not be news to Mr. O'Brien that we have considered and discussed the timing of responses to our questions on more than one occasion.</p></speech>

There is a real need for clarity on this issue.  The director general has tried to bring clarity to it.  I suggest we provide a written brief for the committee, today if possible, in order that members can best advise their constituents and bring clarity to the matter.  I have been told very clearly that GPs can apply in the first instance and appeal a decision.  The Medicines Management Board must approve a patient in that regard, but let us try to provide as much clarity as possible for the committee on what the process looks like and set out the timeline for it.  I ask the HSE to revert to the committee secretariat.</p></speech>

That is what I am told at home.  The issue is that it has been licensed for use to treat post-shingles pain.  In the past five years I have seen us go from having one box on the shelf to 20.  It was being used for literally everything and there is a huge cost.  I think the Minister said it was the second highest pull on the reimbursement budget.  Someone said it.  It is at the top cost-wise.  The issue with which we have to deal involves the patient who has been using it for five months to treat back pain and then lands into a pharmacy with his or her medical card only to be told it is going to cost, I think, a couple of hundred euro a box.  The issue is that someone might be without an alternative during the approval period.  While it is fine for the HSE to tell us stories about the price and the reasoning when it is drawing up its briefing note, what we are looking for is a solution for patients.  On the ground, the prescription is being run off by the GP; the pharmacist says the patient cannot have it; the approval process starts and there is a gap in treatment for the patient.  A worry is being put on the patient because of the price of the product.  When the HSE is preparing its briefing, I would appreciate it if that element for the patient is covered.</p></speech>

If one looks at the 2015 annual report, the number of managerial staff was down as 4,700 because grades 7 and 8 were listed under the heading of managerial capacity.  We have changed this and taken them out of the managerial capacity category and listed them under the administrative capacity category.  The issue I have relates to public health nurses.  The public health nurses I meet tell me that nothing has improved for them.  Mr. O'Brien tells me that they are now doing a lot of the administrative work with which those on the front line were previously dealing, but the staff on the front line are telling me otherwise.  That is my concern.</p><p>I have also asked where is the cut-off point.  Over 500 administrative staff were taken from the HSE and assigned to Tusla.  We are now at a figure of 17,700 administrative staff, which is a higher number than we had before 2010.  On top of this, we have to take the 500 staff who went to Tusla, which means that, technically, we are at a figure of 18,200.  Where is the cut-off point for administrative and managerial staff, given that in other areas there has not been a <i>pro rata</i>increase?  </p><p>I also raised an issue about section 39 organisations in which those who work on the front line have not received the appropriate increase in remuneration which others received.  That is why I am referring to the disproportionate changes which have occurred.  That is what I am concerned about.</p></speech>

The Minister has outlined what is being done in that regard.  All I can do is reiterate that there is a workforce planning process that has been elaborated on.  There is an annual, funded workforce planning process.  There is a a live discussion between the Department and the HSE to seek to provide for an appropriate balance.  I am also aware that this issue was raised with Ms Rosarii Mannion when she was before the committee last week to discuss the section 39 organisations issue and that she agreed to engage with the Senator on it.  I propose that she continue to do so.</p> <p>  On the issue of specialist registration, what is happening is that in each location where a person is employed in a consultant post and who is not on the relevant specialist register, his or her individual clinical director is carrying out a review to establish what issues arise to provide us with a full picture of what we do or do not need to do.  When the review is completed, the relevant action will be taken.  </p> <p>  On issues to do with neuro-rehabilitation, Comhlista and the 100 private beds, I will ask Mr. Connaghan and his team to respond.</p> <p>  On the issue of text message validations, I understand text messages are used only in relation to specific individual appointments, rather than in relation to validation lists.  They would not result in a person being taken off a list.  Failure to respond to a text message might, however, result in the individual appointment being reallocated to ensure it was not lost to the system.  That is the standard process.</p></speech>

From the day a person starts on a fixed-term contract the clock starts ticking and the person begins to accrue an entitlement under the law, and I would not stand in the way of anyone who has that entitlement.  I asked Ms Mannion about this and it struck me that the HSE does not have a handle on how many people are embarking on a journey towards a contract of indefinite duration.  If we have only got as far as clinical directors conducting a review, it strikes me that it is not a priority and not urgent.  I believe it should be an urgent matter and I have not heard what is going to be done to ensure it does not keep happening.</p></speech>

We have a dependency on a number of persons in this category.  Ms Mannion is very focused on this.  I do not regard it as appropriate for any publicly-funded body in the health service, whether it is a section 38 organisations or otherwise, to seek to fetter the Minister's discretion and rights with regard to requesting a HIQA review.  In questioning the Taoiseach, Deputy Clare Daly is reported to have indicated that the HSE had, at one point, taken a court action to prevent the publication of a HIQA report.</p></speech>

An arrangement has been in place for a number of years to reimburse high-cost drugs on a named patient basis through primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, drugs prescribed through hospitals.  It has been working very successfully and has been expanded into a new area of care recently.  There was some dialogue around the use of a PPS number for that purpose but it is not yet in use and no decision has been taken at this stage.</p> <p>  The point about waiting lists was addressed.  We hear the comment about representation on the neurorehabilitation group, which has a manager in place and is a key piece of the overall trauma strategy to which the Minister referred earlier.  The National Rehabilitation Hospital and Peamount Hospital in Donnybrook are engaging in a networked approach as a part of the strategy.  We will take away the Vice Chairman's comments on representation on the group.  I am not familiar with the full details of its representation.</p></speech>

Over the winter period, and on a continuing basis, we have been holding twice-daily assessments of where we are nationally.  This assessment is done by senior HSE members involved in operational management and during the day it is extended to CHO chiefs and hospital group chief executives.  The assessment tells us we are running out of capacity inside the public system and we need to do something <i>in extremis</i>to extend it into the private sector.  We make judgments on a day-to-day basis but we also look ahead by up to four days to anticipate pressures on the system.  It is addressed on a tactical basis.</p></speech>

The medicines management programme is systematically examining each area, by volume and cost, where there appears to be evidence of overprescribing.  It is working on an educative basis with prescribers and putting in place new processes, such as with patches, to create appropriate controls.  In the phenomenon known as "polypharmacy", it is very easy to have drugs added to a formula but not so easy to have them removed and the medicines management programme is an active targeted campaign, particularly in the area of repeat prescribing, which is systematically addressing the issue.  There have been a number of initiatives in the past and this is part of a rolling programme to limit overprescribing.</p></speech>

Perhaps the term "overprescribing" might be too general.  Data analytics are certainly being used to identify all sorts of areas of concern where there are either regional variations or national patterns by comparison with other jurisdictions that look out of line in terms of prescriber and drug consumption.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Flanagan, and his officials to the meeting.</p> <p>  We were about to consider amendment No. 49 when we adjourned on the last occasion.  I believe we inadvertently skipped over an earlier grouping that includes this amendment.  However, the first amendment in that section was not moved as the member was not present.  The grouping is reconstituted, therefore, with amendments Nos. 49 to 68, inclusive, 70, 71 and 173.</p> <p>  I am uncertain whether this is the third or fourth session on this Bill.  It is creating significant concern for me given the build-up of legislation on other matters that we must address.  I am appealing to members &ndash; the Minister included &ndash; that we expedite the processing of the remainder of the amendments today to, hopefully, conclude Committee Stage before we complete today's session.</p> <p>  I will invite Deputy O'Callaghan to address us on amendment No. 49, which is the first in the grouping.</p></speech>

Amendment No. 49 seeks to put in a new section for section 15.  Instead of having the six laypersons nominated or appointed by the Public Appointments Service, the six would be nominated by the Citizens Information Board, An t&Uacute;dar&aacute;s um &Aacute;rd-Oideachas, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, Free Legal Advice Centres Limited and the Top Level Appointments Committee.</p><p>It gets away from the idea that we have to put out an advertisement to see who will apply.  We have six respected bodies that will do their best to appoint suitable people.  The proposed section 15(2) makes the point on who the chairperson should be.  If this amendment is passed, it will mean that we do not have to deal with amendments Nos. 50 to 68.  I am throwing that in, not to tempt members to support it, but it is something that will have a consequence.  I urge the Minister to accept amendment No. 49.</p><p>Other amendments are dealt with in the grouping but no other amendments in that group are in my name.  Amendment No. 70 is in the name of Deputy Sherlock.  Amendment No. 71 is in the name of Deputy Clare Daly.  She is trying to delete the word &quot;lay&quot;.

My first preference is for the approach in amendment No.  50.  I will come back to that.  My second preference would be for the approach taken by Deputies Daly and Wallace.  I will not support amendment No. 49 as it would mean that my own amendment would fall.  I think it is too prescriptive.  Certainly these are all relevant organisations but we need an approach that ensures greater flexibility for the kind of organisations that can be represented and I think this is achieved in amendment No. 50.  As I said before, the approach that would be taken is that the lay appointments would be divided into two parts, one part which would appointed through the traditional Public Appointments Service approach and the other part involving three positions, and possibly more than that if we are looking at additional lay members, that would be nominated through a process whereby a panel would be drawn together from all the relevant organisations.  Any relevant organisation could apply to be on that panel, be it any of the six mentioned in Deputy O'Callaghan's amendment or others such as the Immigrant Council of Ireland, the Migrant Rights Centre, the National Women's Council or the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  All these organisations could apply to be members of that panel and would be contacted at the point at which a vacancy existed in the Judicial Appointments Commission and would be entitled to nominate somebody for that position.  At the end of that process, three persons would be appointed.  It creates greater flexibility but also potentially greater diversity in the organisations that would be represented.  With regard to Deputy Daly's few minutes in this group, could she tell us what the implication or result of removing the word "lay" from all those sections would be?</p></speech>

We have been discussing this.  This group of amendments is really about aiming to have a diverse as a commission as possible.  The Bill favours individuals with particular skills from particular backgrounds.  They may well be qualified.  They might be a bit monocultural.  What this seeks to do is shake it up a bit.  We did propose a number of lay appointments from FLAC, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  The amendments in this group take another step and provide that the lay membership should have at least some members with experience of working with offending behaviour and-or rehabilitation of offenders while removing the requirement that they have experience in commerce, finance or administration and in making appointments to public office or senior private appointments.  I know amendment No. 67 in the name of Deputy Wallace is similar in that it says they should have experience of civil society, trade union activity and academia.  I agree with that as well.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 60 introduces other amendments to another aspect of section 15 in that it introduces an obligation on the Public Appointments Service in appointing lay members to have regard to the objective of equal gender representation on the commission and the objective that the members of the commission reflect society's diversity.  I do not know why that is not in the Bill in the first place.  Amendment No. 69 in the name of Deputy Wallace does the same.  I am not fully sure where the "lay" thing comes in with regard to this group of amendments but I think they are linked to another batch of amendments.  I will have a look and come back in a minute.  </p></speech>

The points are much the same and I do not want to go over them again.  As Deputy Daly just said, the broader and more diverse the group that makes up the commission, the better it will be all round.  A few of my amendments involve deleting stuff to facilitate a situation where the chair is picked by the commission.  I am not getting much support on this one.  As I said before, I am not hung up on whether the chair is lay or legal but I just think the commission should pick the chair.  We probably have not finalised exactly the full make up of the commission and the number because of the amendments we have gone through to date but I do think that allowing the commission to pick its own chair is a good idea.  I cannot help it if not enough members agree with me.  Most of the points have been made.</p></speech>

They could be there representing the Irish Council for Civil Liberties but they would still come from the lay category so it is removing the "lay" definition from the people who come from those NGOs.  We have said that while they are coming from that component body, the fact that they would have a legal background and be involved in that body would not necessarily exclude them or count them as one of the legal people.  They could come out of the lay bit and that is why it is removed there.  I think that is what it is.</p></speech>

We are now dealing with key aspects of the Bill in terms of the nominating bodies and the nominating process.  We are really at the heart of the legislation.  I will deal with the points made in support of the amendments.  In the first instance, I want to consider the proposed section 15 in respect of amendment No. 49, the deletion of section 15 and the substitution of that with a new section.  In summary, the amendment replaces the role and function of the Public Appointments Service in the recommendation of lay members and indeed the lay chairperson as envisaged under the legislation.  The amendment deletes the provision in the Bill relating to knowledge and professional experience pertaining to lay members and the non-legal chairperson.  The amendment also substitutes a nomination process for the appointment by the Minister of lay members involving six specified nominating bodies.  The amendment also provides that the Minister shall appoint as chairperson a retired judge of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court.  The amendment effectively replicates other provisions of the Bill, for example, those relating to the suitability of persons to be appointed, as provided for under section 15(4) and those relating to approval by resolutions of the Houses of the Oireachtas of layperson appointments, as provided for under section 17(1) of the Bill.</p><p> Indeed, on the matter of the Public Appointments Service aspect of the amendment, I am concerned at the effect of these provisions which seek to remove from the process the appointment of members.  Removing any role from the Public Appointments Service is not something that I can support.  I am aware that concern was expressed on Second Stage of the Bill by Deputies at the involvement of PAS in the process.  I stated then, and repeat now, I do not see any foundation for aspersions cast on the Public Appointments Service process in so far as that would relate to the selection of the non-legal or lay members, including the lay chairperson, as provided for under the Bill.  The position under section 15 of the Bill provides for an independent, detached and objective process for securing the services of lay member appointees.</p><p> The Public Appointment Service model is the centralised recruitment process across the public service, including appointments to State boards.  I have heard criticism of the process in the House.  I have read it in the media.  I am firmly of the view that that process is open to scrutiny and transparent.  Furthermore, I believe it is highly effective in doing the job it is required to do under legislation.  I am not convinced by arguments that appear to question the integrity of such a fundamental public service process.</p><p> As far as the application of the Public Appointments Service to this particular piece of legislation is concerned it seems that in the matter of selection of lay members, the Public Appointments Service would, indeed, be the appropriate body to charge with responsibility and that process is, to my mind, the most appropriate.  It also ties in directly to the carefully designed provisions of section 15(7) setting out the relevant knowledge, the matter of experience and the level of expertise that we would be looking for in the lay appointees.</p><p> I believe that it is important that we keep this to the fore in the context of what we are doing here.  We are not merely appointing individual non-legal randomers here.  We are charging persons with certain responsibility.  Of course, I fully accept that it is important, and striking at the heart of this process, that there will be a non-legal chair and non-legal majority of those on the commission but I cannot accept that there is any plausible basis for a suggestion that there could be either political interference or what might be described as legal interference in the selection of lay members once the Public Appointments Service is the recommending body for appointment of lay members.</p><p> The PAS will conduct the selection process.  It will recommend the names.  The Minister will appoint such persons but only following resolutions approving the appointments in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I would perhaps see a role potentially for this committee in the matter of the resolutions of the appointments of the Houses of the Oireachtas, and this is as it should be.</p><p> It is not reasonable, in my view, that what is now effectively the standard arrangement for such board appointments could be construed as anything other than independent or how it could in any manner be characterised as being potentially an instrument for some sort of agenda-pushing or preferment.  The PAS is the centralised provider of recruitment assessment and deals with the selection services.  It provides recruitment services to many public bodies that members around this table will be aware of.  It is the recognised leading recruiter for public service jobs here and as a member of Government, I endorse that role.</p><p> Deputies have suggested that this system produces a certain homogenous type of board member.  I reject that.  I do not believe that to be the case, especially in the circumstances where varying criteria for selection, as is the case here, are being provided for.</p><p> I am particularly concerned at the manner in which Deputies propose to dispense with the carefully crafted wording of section 15(7) of the Bill that we have made reference to in previous debate.  It is vital that the Bill continues to contain very well considered and sufficiently detailed criteria against which the appointments of the non-legal members must be considered.</p><p> It is important that we consider the detail here - the indicated knowledge and indicated experience of the lay members, the operation of the courts, the provision of supports to persons who are victims of crime, human rights, equality, issues concerning diversity among members of society, process and procedures for making appointments to public office or to senior positions in public or private sector organisations, commerce, finance, administration, including public administration, board membership and corporate governance, professional dispute resolution, experience in the area of mediation.  This is also supported by the stipulation in section 15 that PAS shall have regard to the desirability that the lay members of the commission will, among them, possess certain knowledge and experience in as many as possible of the areas as outlined.</p><p> I am not really sure on what basis the stipulated criteria around experience or knowledge might be dispensed with under the amendments that we have here.  I would have thought knowledge and experience of the operation of the courts, matters pertaining to diversity, appointments procedures and corporate governance, for instance, were really important in the context of what we are discussing.</p><p> I do not agree to the proposed amendment that would move away from the Public Appointments Service model and dispense with a set of known experience and knowledge criteria.</p><p> On the last aspect of the amendment dealing with the nominating bodies, having regard to the fact that the amendments envisage no role for the Public Appointments Service, this involves the deletion of section 15 so that the mechanism for securing lay membership of the commission is based on a nominating bodies approach - these bodies ranging from citizens advice bureau to TLAC.  However, I need to stress here that given the position of the Deputies as far as the committee model is concerned and other aspects of the membership of the commission, there are consequential issues here that we will have to revisit on Report Stage.  I want to flag that now.  I am sure I am saying something that, having regard to amendments already made, will not be taken as a surprise by members but that may well entail a different design.  It may entail a bigger, somewhat tailored commission, for example, to ensure that all five court presidents have an appropriate involvement and role.  There may be some scope to consider how precisely the appointment or nomination process for lay-members might best be organised.  I have already indicated that I would be far from happy to have a situation where we are writing out or deleting all reference to or role of the Public Appointments Service.</p><p> As regards this amendment, as the Deputies are putting forward a nominating body mechanism which is focused on six specific organisations, it is true that a number of other board arrangements are based on a nomination system focused around a specific number of organisations.</p><p>We have examples, such as the recently inaugurated Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  We look at the Policing Authority nominating bodies for membership.  Having nominating bodies is not in any way objectionable in itself.  However, while the bodies with which we are now dealing may well be in a position to nominate suitable persons, it is possible to think of many more bodies that could have a role.  Many of those would perhaps say that they have an even more relevant role in these circumstances.  In ways, it is invidious to speak of different bodies here in terms of their possible contribution or lack thereof, but any departure from the role of the PAS will give rise to a weakness in the legislation.</p><p> I cannot accept the specific aspect of the amendment which provides that the chairperson would be a retired judge of the High Court, the Court of Appeal or the Supreme Court.  I said this on Second Stage, and perhaps I have even said it at this committee, so it will come as no surprise if I repeat it, but I cannot accept that a person with such a bank of experience, knowledge and expertise, having regard to his or her fundamental and active role of the Judiciary, can suddenly become a lay person within the meaning of the Bill.  I would have thought that in order to qualify under the term "lay", one's experience and expertise would have to be outside of the area of law.</p><p> Amendment No. 4 seeks to provide that an individual who previously held judicial office could be considered a layperson.  That strikes at the heart of the Bill.  I strongly contend that a layperson should not have held senior judicial office or, dare I say, any judicial office.  Having a lay chair of selection commissions is not uncommon in other jurisdictions.  Corresponding commissions in England, Wales and Scotland have lay chairs.  It is clear that not everyone agrees with this measure, but the amendment puts forward the notion of a retired senior judge as chairperson and I do not believe that is in keeping with the letter or spirit of the Bill.  I am not going to accept that amendment.</p><p> Amendment No. 50, in the name of Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire, seeks to replace section 15.  My difficulty with this prescription is that the targeted and comprehensive framework to be referenced in selecting six ordinary lay members as set out in the section 15(7) would be very difficult to observe if the PAS was confined to only making three selections from these seven categories of experience and knowledge.  Again, my concern would be that we would lose valuable inputs to the judicial appointments framework of the commission if we embark on a process that would unduly restrict the operation of section 15(7).  The Deputy has indicated that he wants to consider some diversity aspects of the Bill on Report Stage.  As I have already mentioned, I am not overlooking the need to reflect on the lay membership aspects of the Bill between now and Report Stage.</p><p> I cannot agree with the approach in amendments Nos. 51 and 52 in the name of Deputy Wallace.  I understand that amendment No. 54 in the name of Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock will not be moved.</p><p> Amendments Nos. 53, 56, 57, 59, 61 and 62 in the name of Deputy Clare Daly would have the effect of removing certain references to laypersons being recruited by the PAS, instead giving it the job of recruiting the practising solicitor member of the commission, the practising barrister member and the four lay members.  These amendments are necessary to facilitate the overall approach of Deputy Daly's amendments which seek to replace the Bar Council and the Law Society nominees on the commission with a practising solicitor and a practising barrister recruited by the PAS.  The effect of that is to remove the very important role for the Law Society and the Bar Council, which is that they would be the bodies charged with the responsibility of nominating members of their own society or organisation.  I will be supporting the retention of this section.</p><p> On Amendment No. 60-----</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.476" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018020700002#D01900"><p>The Minister is insinuating that we want to get rid of the authority of the PAS but the amendments I have tabled, for example, those that proposed to remove sections 15(7)(e) and 15(7)(f), were drafted to remove any requirement or desire on the part of the PAS for experience in public sector appointments, board membership and corporate governance.  These proposals are made with a view to broadening the potential for the PAS to choose from outside of the usual career civil servants or retired civil servants who would be likely to have experience in these areas, thus encouraging as broad and as diverse an approach as possible by the PAS rather than restricting it only to candidates who have such experience.  This would also minimise the potential for public sector groupthink within the commission.  The commission is unique and would be best served by a diverse membership with a dynamic and innovative approach to decision-making.</p><p>From this perspective, the inclusion of lay members with little or no experience of public sector appointments processes or board membership would be preferable.  This is also the reasoning behind the amendment of section 15(7)(e) to remove the reference to "public administration" and insert the words "civil society, trade union activity and academia".  Again, this would encourage the casting of the net wider to include lay members from these backgrounds, rather than seeking only to appoint lay members with backgrounds in finance, commerce and public administration, as is the case under section 15(7)(e) as currently drafted.</p><p> Amendment No. 69 proposes to insert a new subsection (8) to impose a statutory requirement on the PAS, when selecting lay members of the commission, to aim for gender balance and diversity.  I am not arguing for one moment that we should abandon the use of the PAS.  This proposal provides for an innovative approach to the selection of judges.  It is desirable to have diversity in the composition of the commission.  No one denies that people from the backgrounds that have been highlighted are more qualified than some of the lay members who should be included for diversity reasons.  However, this does not change the fact that it is good to have a wide range of approaches.  None of us has a God-given right to believe our approach is always correct.  People take different views and all I am asking is that the make-up of the commission be as diverse as possible and reflect society to the greatest possible extent.  Regardless of how clever or experienced a person is, all of us are members of society and our objective here is to establish a commission that reflects society.  If we do not make the commission diverse, it will reflect only part of society.  We are not, as the Minister appeared to insinuate, calling for the PAS to be abandoned.</p></speech>

I apologise if my earlier explanation was unclear.  In fairness to the Minister, he explained the issue better than I did.  The reason our amendments propose removing the word "lay" is that we are also proposing that the legal persons be appointed by the PAS.  To improve diversity on the commission, we want these appointments to be made on the basis of the same standards that will apply to the appointment of laypersons.  We recommend that the barrister and solicitor be appointed by the PAS.  To this end, we propose the deletion of the word "lay" to ensure these two nominations are also covered by the diversity requirement when the PAS is making its decision.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018020700002#E00400"><p>On the issue of diversity, there is no suggestion that there would be legal or political interference in lay appointments, which appears to be the Minister's interpretation. It is more a sense that there is a degree of inertia among the types of persons who are sometimes appointed to State boards.  While they are often competent and capable individuals, as many Deputies from all political backgrounds who have experience of State boards will agree, these boards are not as diverse as we would like them to be.</p> <p>  As Deputy Clare Daly stated, we are asking the PAS to cast the net wider.  The Minister made a number of criticisms, most of which do not apply to amendment No. 50.  I should clarify that the Minister's specific criticism of amendment No. 50 is inaccurate.  He indicated the proposal seeks to remove the criteria for lay appointments set out in subsection 7.  The new subsection (10), proposed in amendment No. 50, provides that the persons appointed under the diversity and inclusion panel would be subject to the same criteria as those laid out in subsection (8) of the new section.  These are the same criteria as those set down in section 15(7) of the current text.  As such, the same criteria would apply and the Minister's criticism of the proposed amendment is inaccurate.</p></speech>

I do not see any direct relationship between the three terms and I foresee problems in the selection process in this regard.  I also suggest that the concepts of civil society and dispute resolution, which would, I presume, include trade dispute resolution, are already reflected in the other expertise and experience headings we have included in the legislation in any event.</p> <p>  As far as amendment No. 68 is concerned, the effectiveness of the new commission and the manner in which it will get its work done is absolutely critical to the success of the body.  I stress again the necessity to have good experience.  I do not see any valid reason for deleting the reference that would be imported by amendment No. 68 and I will not accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The point about whether it would be invidious to select certain organisations is not a criticism that applies to amendment No. 50.  My amendment retains all the criteria by which people would have to reach certain standards, creates greater flexibility and preserves the role of the PAS.  As such, none of the criticisms made about other potential appointments systems applies to amendment No. 50.  Perhaps the Minister intends to accept the amendment but, if not, I would appreciate a substantive reason for his decision.</p></speech>

The reason we oppose section 19 is it refers to the "Procedures Committee and other committees of Commission."  We have made the decision, as a committee, that we will remove the committee structure so, consistent with that, we should not allow in section 19.  Therefore, I am pressing the opposition to the section as a whole.</p></speech>

The select committee agreed that the procedures committee was the one committee that was worth preserving and, therefore, I shall vote to maintain section 19.  It will require an amendment to reflect the other changes that I have made but I intend to vote to retain the section.</p></speech>

It requires that the annual report, which the judicial appointments commission would be required to publish, would contain a diversity statement.  We are trying to achieve diversity and wide representation in our judicial appointments and the judicial system generally.  It makes sense that the annual report be required to make a specific statement on how successful it has been in achieving that. </p></speech>

I refer the Deputy to section 27(4) which enables the Minister to direct the commission to provide an annual report "in such form and manner" as may be specified.  Under subsection (5) the commission must comply with such a direction.  Section 28 contains similar provisions in so far as the functions of the commission are concerned.  It is my belief that these provisions already in the Bill adequately cater for what the Deputy is seeking to achieve and I am not going to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.769" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018020700002#N00400"><p>I move amendment No. 115:</p><blockquote>In page 26, to delete lines 15 to 26 and substitute the following:&ldquo;(3) Subsection (1) shall only apply to a legal academic who has qualified as a barrister or solicitor and subsequent subsections of this section, in so far as they relate to a person who is referred to in them as a &lsquo;head of a faculty&rsquo; or &lsquo;head of another faculty&rsquo;, shall not be construed as enabling such a person to be the subject of such an appointment unless the person has qualified as a barrister or solicitor.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>This amendment refers to the new section which it is proposed to insert into the 1961 Act and which concerns persons who are entitled to be appointed to judicial office.  The ostensible intention of the proposed new section is to make the process more open and flexible, but there is a difference between the provisions included in the Bill concerning legal academics potentially qualified to be judges and the heads of Bill, as published, which I seek to reintroduce.  The distinction in the heads of the Bill is that someone who has practised as a solicitor or a barrister for four years and is a legal academic could be appointed a judge.  The key part of the proposed new section, as worded, is subsection (3)(a) which states &quot;who, at the time of the appointment referred to in that subsection, is a barrister or a solicitor&quot;.  It requires a higher standard. Essentially, it require the person to be a barrister or a solicitor at the time of his or her potential appointment, a restriction which I do not think is necessary.  It will restrict the desire to allow legal academics, even those who are qualified, to become judges to the point where the proposed new section is of no particular additional benefit.  The amendment seeks to address this issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.770" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018020700002#N00600"><p>I cannot accept the amendment because it would remove two very important elements from the requirements of eligibility of legal academics for appointment to judicial office.  First, it would remove the requirement to be a solicitor or a barrister at the time of appointment.  Second, it would remove the requirement for practical experience of the courts for a continuous number of years, namely, at least four years.  The proposed section 45A to be inserted into the 1961 Act provides the additional basis for qualification for appointment as a judge.  It opens up eligibility for appointment to a legal academic of not less than 12 years' standing who, immediately before such an appointment, has been employed as a legal academic for a continuous period of at least two years.  In addition, such a legal academic, under the terms of the new section 45A, must (a) be a barrister or a solicitor at the time of being appointed as a judge and (b) have practised as either a barrister or a solicitor for a continuous period of not less than four years.  Similar requirements, with some modification, take account of the role applying in the case of a person who may be a head of a faculty.  In addressing the amendment I wish to be clear that the Government was persuaded of the need to tighten the provisions of the general scheme in order to ensure legal academics appointed to the Bench would have had an amount of practical experience of the practice and procedure of the courts.  The practising qualifier, as it could be called, is an essential supplementary element and I am not disposed to dispense with it.  Therefore, I cannot agree to the amendment.</p></speech>

It is also common in other countries.  In America many people appointed straight to the Supreme Court come from an academic background.  It is important, however, to maintain, particularly in courts of first instance, a practical knowledge of how courts operate.  I would be concerned if legal academics were, say, put straight into the High Court, the Circuit Court or the District Court without any experience of appearing before courts and practical experience of how the rules of evidence operate.  For this reason, I do not support Deputy Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire's amendment.  However, it is an issue that needs to be looked at.  Perhaps the Minister might look at it from the point of view of appointments to the appeal courts, to which someone could be appointed without the necessary practical court experience.</p></speech>

The provisions need to be loosened somewhat as the section is too restrictive.  I take the point about the necessity to have some practical experience, but the bar is being set too high.  Provisions such as those which have been suggested by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan could be considered in that regard.  It is likely that I will redraft my amendment in the light of the Minister's comments, but I ask him to reconsider the matter.</p></speech>

The Law Society of Ireland, among others, thought this was an unnecessary provision to include in primary legislation.  It is not a requirement to be met in terms of eligibility for appointment to the District Court or the Circuit Court.  The legislation provides for the commission to set out detailed eligibility criteria, including a statement of skills and attributes for appointment to each court.  For reasons of diversity, it would probably be better if the eligibility criteria under that heading were set out by the commission rather than in primary legislation as it would facilitate greater access.</p><p>Judicial appointments are currently open to barristers and solicitors, but the bulk of them are made from the barrister profession.  Only eight solicitors have been appointed to the superior courts since solicitors became eligible in 2002 for such appointment.  No solicitor has been appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court and no female solicitor has been appointed as a judge of the superior courts, in spite of the fact that 51% of the membership of the Law Society of Ireland are females.  There have been 90 appointments since solicitors became eligible for appointment, but only a handful have made it through, with solicitors constituting only 8% of the membership of the superior courts, even though 80% of legal practitioners in the State are solicitors.  That cannot be reconciled with the public interest or the desirability to have a broadly experienced Judiciary which is reflective of the community it serves.  It is too narrow.  Why would this be provided for in legislation?</p><p>A small effort to draw in solicitors is made in subsection (5).  However, that effort is minimal.  Clearly, solicitors are pegged below barristers in the sense that personal conduct at proceedings can be taken into account by a relevant committee which would favour barristers.  It also references practice and knowledge of procedure in the courts.  It is necessary to have rules on eligibility and experience, but it would be far better to leave it to the Commission to outline in its statement on skills and attributes, as in the case of appointments to the lower courts.  That would be better with a view to encouraging diversity.  That is the intention behind the amendments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.814" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1233" speakername="Charles Flanagan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018020700002#O03600"><p>I acknowledge the strong lobbying engaged in by the Deputy on behalf of the solicitor profession.  She has made an important and serious point.</p><p>However, I cannot accept the amendment for the following reason.  It is essential that any lawyer seeking appointment as a judge, and particularly as a judge of the superior courts, must be in a position to demonstrate knowledge not only of that court but also knowledge and experience of the practice and procedures of the court.  That is probably best garnered from working on a daily basis within the ambit of the superior court.  Deputy Clare Daly's amendment No. 120 seeks to delete the text of sections 37(4) and 37(5), the purpose of which is to give guidance to the commission in assessing whether a person has the appropriate knowledge of the decisions and the appropriate knowledge and experience of practice and procedure.  Section 37(4) allows for a disregard of the necessity for Court of Appeal knowledge and experience in respect of a serving judge candidate who was appointed to the bench before the Court of Appeal came into existence in 2014.  I note, however, the point made by the Deputy that in order to ensure there is a breadth of legal experience on the bench, it should not in all circumstances be confined to one arm of the profession.  I have some sympathy with that.  I would say that is changing, there is no prohibition in law to preclude such a change as is now taking place, particularly in recent years.  As legislators, we need to be conscious to reflect certain diversity in our courts system and those who preside over it, but I do not accept that this amendment is the most appropriate way of so doing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.816" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018020700002#P00200"><p>It is important to recall that the Courts Act is the legislation that sets out the qualifications for persons who wish to apply for appointment to the courts.  Currently, any solicitor or barrister can apply to be appointed to the District Court up to the Supreme Court.  Deputy Clare Daly is correct where she says that the majority of appointments to the superior courts come from the barrister profession.  Similarly, the majority of appointments to the District Court come from the solicitors profession.  The reason for both practices is because barristers practise more in the superior courts, whereas if one goes to the District Court, one will see that the advocacy and practice there is dominated more by the solicitors profession.  I am not suggesting that either is not capable of doing the other work, and perhaps there should be more barristers in the District Court and more solicitors in the superior courts.  However, the section before the committee is giving guidance to the commission and says that it should not recommend anyone for appointment to the Supreme Court, the Court of Appeal or the High Court unless he or she has an appropriate knowledge of the decisions and appropriate knowledge and appropriate experience of the practice and procedure of the courts.  Irrespective of whether one is a barrister or a solicitor, I do not believe anyone should be appointed to a superior court unless he or she has knowledge of that court.  It would be a virtually impossible task for someone who has never been in the court before to be put on the Bench and told to run the court.  We need more solicitors to apply for positions on the superior courts.  Many solicitors have been appointed.  We do have a female solicitor in the High Court.  It is changing over time and in a few years, I am confident that there will be a much higher percentage of solicitors in the superior courts than is now the case.</p></speech>

I am not sure what the solution is but I am sure that we have a problem.  I agree about practice and procedure and that there should be a level of knowledge there, but the fact that later there is mention of personal conduct of proceedings, would tend to offset the knowledge of practice and procedure and would give a preference to barristers by having the two.  Practice and procedure are absolutely fine, but then there is the question of having the other as well.  I am prepared to look at it again when we get to report stage.  The points that have been made are interesting and I will consider them further.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the Deputy's comment that she will reflect on the matter between now and Report Stage.  However, a strict reading of the amendment indicates that the Deputy is seeking to reduce the two requirements to one, namely that a person has appropriate knowledge of the decisions only.  That is somewhat narrow.  I accept what Deputy O'Callaghan has said about the knowledge of the practice and procedure on the structure and operation of the court as well as the decisions.  I am sympathetic to the point being made.</p></speech>

The expressions of interest process under section 46 provides that the Minister convenes a sub-committee of the Chief Justice, the chairman and the Attorney General, and their job is to select and recommend three names for these vacancies.  There is no public advertisement process.  Section 46 states that "the Minister shall request the Commission to seek expressions of interest on the part of eligible persons...".  I believe this allows too much scope for a non-transparent and selective approach since it leaves it to the commission to approach eligible persons.</p></speech>

The Bill currently provides that the commission may provide information on the selection procedures and other matters in a statement.  This amendment puts an obligation on the commission to publish the information so the public can access it.  I do not believe it would be a very onerous task to publish the information on selection procedures if we are talking about transparency and public confidence.</p></speech>

I do not believe the amendment is necessary.  The form of statements of selection procedures, and of the requisite skills and attributes approved by the commission, are under section 57 which provides for these always to be published in any event.  Section 40 provides for discretion to provide further information on those statements through such means as the commission may consider appropriate.  The issue of public information is already catered for in section 57 of the Bill.</p></speech>

I believe that the word "publicly" is not necessary because it would mean they would have to set it out in a published statement.  However, it is discretionary currently and it should be mandatory that the public and applicants should know what are the information and selection procedures for somebody who wants to apply for a job, as opposed to the information not being disclosed by the commission.  I support the word "shall" but I believe we could do without the word "publicly".</p></speech>

This is about the principle of the commission having the ability to rank its choices, which is absolutely critical.  The Bar Council recommended it as did the judicial appointments review committee, the membership of which comprised judges.  Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill proposed the same thing and it is a reasonable proposal.  If the commission does not have the power to rank, what is the point?  It will have spent time and effort in analysing applications so the suggestion that it then hands everything over to Government, for it to pick which candidate it wants, is ludicrous and it would go against the whole purpose of the legislation.  If we want to empower a commission and give it teeth, it will have to have the ability to rank judges.  Everybody is in favour of this and it is a common-sense proposal.</p></speech>

I do not propose to accept the amendment for the following reasons.  The issue was the subject of public discourse prior to the arrival of this Bill before this committee.  Ranking, exercising preference or advocating a particular order are not contemplated in the Bill.</p><p>The question of whether the names forwarded to Government ought to be given in the order of preference was discussed by the committee at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage in January 2017.  There is an important constitutional issue set out in Articles 35 and 39 of the Constitution, where the President appoints judges only on the advice of Government.  The concern was that ordering candidates in order of preference would place a limitation on the Executive obligations of the Government.  It would interfere with discretion that Government must maintain.  I see a real difficulty with a Government being bound by recommendations in a way that reduces its authority in terms of the exercise of choice or making an informed decision.  That would unduly interfere with Government's prerogative in so far as tendering advice to the President.</p><p> Deputies will be familiar with the current procedure under the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  It considered the issue of whether to recommend applicants in order of preference and in its 2002 report it set out the view that such an order of preference would place too great a restriction on what is the constitutional prerogative of Government to select judges.  That was the view of the judges 15 years ago.  I do not recall in the period since then any departure from that view.  I ask the committee to be mindful of the constitutional issues involved and having full regard to those issues, I do not propose to accept the amendment.</p></speech>

I think we need to recall that sections 42, 48 and 50 are the most important parts of the legislation.  We have spent hours talking about, and there is a large number of sections on, the make up and functions of the commission.  Ultimately, what we need to recognise is that the reason we are setting up the commission is so that it can make a recommendation to Government based on its expertise.  At present, having gone through all the palaver of having many different groups represented on the commission, ultimately what they are being told to do is to give the Government three names for any one judicial vacancy.  The Government is then in the position to pick any one of those three names or indeed it can pick any person who has not been recommended to it.  The only consequence for the Government if it does not pick one of the three names is that it simply has to publish in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il </i>that the candidate appointed was appointed pursuant to the Act and was recommended by the commission.  That is the only downside, that is the function of it.  I do not think that is sufficient.</p><p>In my Bill, I had a requirement that if the Government is not going to accept the recommendation of the commission that it should have to give a reasoned explanation as to why it was departing from the recommendations of the commission, without, of course, identifying any of the individual involved.</p><p>It is worthwhile that the names are ranked.  Why not do so?  The Government still has the constitutional power to appoint whoever it wishes.  The fact that the names are ranked does not interfere with that constitutional power.  If they are listed one, two and three, the Government can go for candidate three and, if needs be, it can state that the person appointed was recommended by the commission.</p><p>I support this amendment.</p></speech>

The points have been well made.  In an ideal world, I would not be of the view that Government should have much discretion in this area, but obviously there are constitutional considerations.  In that context, it is important that the names received by Government are ranked and are clear.  I have tabled amendments later which are similar to what Deputy O'Callaghan has outlined about requiring an explanation for non-appointment in relevant circumstances.</p> <p>  I support this amendment because it is important that candidates are ranked and that is a view supported by the Law Society and others.</p></speech>

I know we are making substantial and significant changes to the manner in which judges are appointed, but we are not asking the people to change the Constitution and Articles 35 and 39 of the Constitution are quite clear that the President appoints members of the Judiciary on the advice of Government.  If Government is to be bound by recommendations of a type that will follow this amendment, then we are significantly altering what is the prerogative of Government under the Constitution, advising the President.</p> <p>  Let me reiterate that this matter has been considered in the context of this very point and there has been a marked reluctance on the part of judges, the advisory board and Government to reform matters in such a way as to be constitutionally problematic.  I cannot accept this amendment.  I would foresee an opportunity for a very strong constitutional challenge in the event of there being a party to this process who may have been ranked in a position that appeared more favourable than that included in the recommendation of Government.  This is an important legal and constitutional issue.  In view of that, I am not prepared to accept this amendment.</p></speech>

The reason we have spent weeks and months adjudicating on this Bill is that the present situation needs to be altered.  There is no constitutional impediment.  The judicial appointments review committee, comprising judges and chaired by Mrs. Justice Susan Denham recommended that the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board should be empowered to rank candidates.  It did not have a problem with that issue.</p> <p>  What is being said here is that the power to recommend has to lie with the commission or else there is no point in setting it up.  The power to advise the President on appointments has to remain with the Government, as provided for in the Constitution.  There is nothing wrong with that.  The Government advises the President, but that should not prevent the Government from being limited in who it can advise on.  There is no contradiction there whatsoever.  We are empowering the commission, so it has to be given some teeth.</p></speech>

What we are doing in the Bill is making a significant reform by ensuring that the names of three applicant candidates come before Government and of those one will be recommended to the President.  It has not been the practice of the Government to go outside the recommendations, so that in the event of the commission receiving recommendations in an order of ranking, that unduly ties the hand of Government in its advice to the President.  It is a constitutional issue.</p><p>Under the Constitution, the matter of advices or recommendations to the President or a nomination of Government is a function of Government and in accepting this amendment we would be going beyond that in a way which is constitutionally questionable.</p></speech>

I think, even from the Minister's perspective, a number of things have been decided which will mean that there will be a degree of tidying up when it comes to Report Stage.  This will apply to everyone at some point or another.</p> <p>  Amendment No. 134 is in the name of Deputy Wallace.  Amendments Nos. 134, 137, 150 and 151 are related and will be discussed together.  Amendment No. 151 is a physical alternative to amendment No. 150.  I call Deputy Wallace to open the discussion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-02-07a.898" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1355" speakername="Mick Wallace" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2018020700002#T00600"><p>I move amendment No. 134:</p><blockquote>In page 30, after line 38, to insert the following:&ldquo;(3) The Government shall nominate for appointment one of the three persons recommended by the relevant committee in accordance with <i>subsection (2)</i>.&rdquo;.</blockquote> <p>All these amendments are linked and deal with the same principle.  I am seeking to insert, after line 38, that the Government shall nominate for appointment one of the three persons recommended by the relevant committee in accordance with subsection (2).  The Bill, as drafted by the Government, is tinkering around the edges of stage one of a three-part process to judicial appointments.  At the moment, names can be given to the Government but it has the power to ignore them all and pick someone else altogether.  I know it has not done that but it can do so, and we should address it in legislation while we have the opportunity.  No change at all is proposed in this Bill to stage two when the Government nominates a judge to the President.  The Minister, Deputy Ross, had a provision on this in his Bill when he was in opposition but changed his mind when he was appointed to Government.</p><p>The degree to which judicial appointments in the State are conducted independently was described as &quot;globally unsatisfactory&quot; by the Council of Europe's Group of States against Corruption.  In the 2017 EU justice score board published by the European Commission on 10 April 2017, the Commission indicated that, according to the information provided by the Irish authorities, &quot;the government may appoint a person who is not on the list sent by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board but in practice does not do so&quot;.  Figure 57 of the report shows that Ireland has the second highest amount of Government freedom to appoint judges in the EU.  Where candidates are proposed by an independent body, the score depended on &quot;whether the executive can reject a candidate judge at all, whether it can choose only among the proposed candidates, or whether it can choose and appoint any other candidate, even if she or he is not proposed by the competent authority&quot;.  It was noted that &quot;[a]n important safeguard in case of non-appointment is the obligation to provide reasons and the possibility of a judicial review&quot;.</p><p>The relentless focus on what is really minimal change to stage one and the populous approach by the Government is over-hyping the law versus lay distinction in a deliberate tactic to distract from the real issue of Government control and political allegiance in judicial appointments, as identified by the Irish Council for Civil Liberties in its 13-page submission during the consultation process for this legislation in 2014.  As the Judiciary noted in its letter to the Taoiseach, the Association of Judges in Ireland, in its press release, and Michael Collins SC, in his article in the<i>Bar Review</i>, have noted, the Bill does nothing to achieve its publicly stated purpose of removing political influence from the appointment process and, if anything, only serves to exacerbate the problem.</p><p>These amendments would have a real impact on the important stage two of the appointments process when the Government nominates a judge to be appointed by the President by restricting the Government to only choosing one of the three names provided to it by the commission.  The Bill, as currently drafted by Government, does not reform stage two to any significant degree.  The ratio of law versus lay members or what any commission or the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board decides will not matter if the Government of the day can continue to negate the whole of stage one and pick whomever it wishes, regardless of whether that name is included in the list of three names.</p><p>As I previously stated, I accept that the Government has not been doing this.  Given that it can do it, however, it is now appropriate for us to address the issue and to ensure that it is not allowed to ignore the recommendations of the commission, particularly as we are going to such bother to set it up in the first place.</p></speech>

We are trying to plug the holes in the Bill.  As currently constituted, the Government can bypass the recommendations of the commission and nominate whomever it likes.  We are trying to stop that.  I thought the whole idea behind the commission was the independence of judicial appointments.  As currently structured, the Bill provides that the Government shall "firstly" consider for appointment those persons whose names have been recommended by the commission.  My amendment provides that "firstly" would be changed to "only".  There is no constitutional conflict or anything like it.  It is an eligibility point relating to the recommendation of the commission and I do not see the problem with it.</p></speech>

The effect of amendment No. 134, in the name of Deputy Wallace, would require the Government to nominate for appointment one of the three persons recommended by the commission process - "require" being the operative word.  I repeat that successive Governments down the years have not gone beyond the process as set down under the judicial appointments regime.  I advise the committee of the position of successive Attorneys General going back to the mid-1990s.  The position under the Constitution is such that the Government has discretion under the Constitution in advising the President on whom to appoint to judicial office.</p><p>Any attempt to interfere with, limit or fetter that discretion, either by an Act of the Oireachtas or otherwise, that might require the Government by law to appoint persons from a list of three is problematic.  The Government must at all times remain free under the Constitution to choose a person other than a person among the names recommended by the commission.</p><p> I remind the committee that, under section 50, on the publication of a notice of appointment, and under section 51, on the requirement regarding the annual statement to the Houses, the Government must set out whether an appointment was made from the names recommended by the commission.  Therefore, the Government is clearly accountable for its decision but it must be accountable in a way that does not in any way interfere adversely with the constitutional position, that is, that the Government cannot constitutionally be fettered by law in regard to the individuals it chooses to recommend to the President.  The clear advice to the Government is that the acceptance of the amendment would not be in accordance with the requirements of the Constitution.</p><p> Similarly, amendment No. 137 would require the Government to nominate for appointment one of the persons recommended in the commission's process.  Again, I envisage clear constitutional issues and difficulties, which have been adverted to by the Attorney General.</p><p> Amendment No. 150 seeks a change in regard to the advising of the President by requiring the Government to consider only those names recommended as opposed to considering those names first.  Again, I envisage a constitutional issue.  In no circumstances should the Government be restricted to considering only the names recommended because, under the Constitution, the Government enjoys full discretion as to whom it recommends for appointment.  In this regard, I am drawing clearly on advices and statements of the current Attorney General and, indeed, successive previous Attorneys General.</p></speech>

The reason is people want to ensure the public interest is served by having people appointed to the Bench solely based on merit.  This has not always happened.  Sometimes people are appointed not on the basis of merit, but because of political or personal connections.  The reason this could have occurred so readily was that, until 1995, there was no statutory regime in place that provided guidance to the Government on how it should exercise its constitutional prerogative to nominate people for appointment.</p><p>The current position is that we are trying to put in place a structure that provides advice to the Government.  The Minister is no doubt considering the appointment of a Garda Commissioner.  When dealing with this matter, he has the Policing Authority advising him, and the Public Appointments Service runs a competition.  Although the Government has an absolute statutory entitlement to appoint a Garda Commissioner, that decision is made within the parameters of advice given.  If the Minister does not follow advice, it can have a consequence, although he is legally perfectly entitled not to follow it.</p><p>What Members are trying to do in these amendments is put in place a statutory regime whereby the best candidates are recommended to the Government.  Obviously, the Government itself makes the decision on whether it wants somebody recently appointed.  It has complete constitutional freedom to appoint qualified lawyers to the Bench but what we are trying to provide is some guidance for that.  That is what this legislation is about.</p><p>In respect of the previous amendment, the Minister said there would be constitutional frailty in ranking the individuals recommended by the commission.  I disagree; there is no constitutional frailty.  The commission can decide to rank three individuals from one to three.  Constitutional difficulties do arise, however, in respect of the amendments we are considering, whereby the Government would be required to select one of the three people, and nobody else.  Somebody could challenge this and claim it is interference with the Government's constitutional prerogative to nominate people for appointment.  That would be problematic.  We must realise, however, that there has to be some consequence for a Government that does not follow the recommendation.  The Minister is entitled not to follow the recommendation when appointing people to the Bench but there has to be some consequence.  If Deputy Mick Wallace is appointed to the Bench although he has not been recommended, the only thing the Government has to do is publish in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>that he was appointed to the Bench and was not one of the candidates recommended by the judicial appointments commission.  There is no real consequence to that.  It involves no real change.  The circumstances are the same as those that exist at present.  For that reason, Deputy Jack Chambers and I have recommended that the Government be required, if it does not follow the recommendations of the commission, to publish a reasoned explanation.  It would afford full protection regarding confidentiality and the anonymity of applicants.</p><p>I cannot support the amendments, however, because they go too far in interfering with the Government's constitutional prerogative.  If people in government were really serious about the reform of the judicial appointments procedure &mdash; this comment is not directed towards the Minister, Deputy Charles Flanagan &mdash; they would be seeking a constitutional referendum on the issue.</p></speech>

At least a Government may be thrown out of office.  I would be very concerned about giving the full power of appointment to a judicial appointments commission appointed by the great and the good after competitions by the Public Appointments Service.  How does one get rid of its members?  The benefit of having the Government appoint people to the Bench is that if one does not like that Government's decisions, one can throw its members out of government.</p></speech>

The relevant article of the Constitution to which I understand the Minister to be referring is Article 13.9, which is a general provision on how the President exercises his powers and functions, not just in the appointment of judges.  It states:</p><blockquote>The powers and functions conferred on the President by this Constitution shall be exercisable and performable by him only on the advice of the Government, save where it is provided by this Constitution that he shall act in his absolute discretion or after consultation with or in relation to the Council of State, or on the advice or nomination of, or on receipt of any other communication from, any other person or body.</blockquote> <p>Therefore, all the Government is required to do according to Article 13.9 is advise the President in his appointment of judges.  Nowhere does it state the Government, in advising the President, is in turn precluding itself from taking advice from a commission or from enacting legislation setting out a process restricting itself to just three names provided by that commission.</p><p>The ICCL submissions from 2014 suggest the Government should be restricted even further to receiving the three names ranked in order of preference, as we have been discussing.  It should be obliged to nominate in order of that rank.  In order to respect and not unduly fetter the Government's discretion, the proposed amendment leaves the Government the final choice of selecting one of the three names.</p><p>Reference was made previously to an article by Senator Michael McDowell, senior counsel, stating it is 100% clear that it would be unconstitutional to restrict the Government to picking only one of three names provided.  A <i>Bar Review</i>article of 2017, by another senior counsel, states the opposite.</p><p>Senior counsel can only give their opinion as to whether something is constitutional or not but only the higher courts can hold or decide that something is constitutional or unconstitutional.</p><p> Did the Minister ever seek advice from the Attorney General, who would have had to seek an opinion from a senior counsel as to the specific question of whether it would be unconstitutional to restrict the Government's power of nomination to a list of three of names provided by the commission?  If so, will the Minister tell us which senior counsel was used, the date of the opinion and whether the Government will publish it?  I know the Government does not normally agree to that but given it is such a serious issue, perhaps it might on this occasion?</p></speech>

There are constitutional consequences, particularly in the context of amendment No. 134 in the name of Deputy Wallace.  If that was included in the Bill, it would direct the Government on the matter of a nomination or a recommendation.  That is where there is a constitutional difficulty and issue.  I acknowledge the reference to the Constitution by those here.  It is important we are mindful of it.  The Government decided not to seek a change in the constitutional position and not to refer this issue to the people but to reform significantly the legislation by way of statutory enactment of a Bill.  It is important we do not go beyond what is constitutionally acceptable in the matter of the appointments.</p> <p>  I repeat that any attempt on the part of the Legislature to interfere with the constitutional position of Government on the appointment of judges would have consequences of a constitutional nature.  Reference was made to the policing issue and the appointment of the Garda Commissioner, which is, of course, under way.  Without digressing, let me say the recommendation forthcoming, under the law, from the Policing Authority is open to the Government to accept or reject.  However, the difference with Deputy Wallace's amendment is that choice would be removed from Government in a way that is conflicting with the Constitution.</p></speech>

That is regrettable because this whole debate has been cloaked in that it is about wresting from the Government the power to make judicial appointments.  We are supposed to be here to take that away from it and exercise more democratic accountability.  That is how this Bill has been sold to the public.  However, the Minister is saying we cannot do that constitutionally, so this is just a puff of smoke.</p> <p>  The Minister said that constitutionally the Government cannot be fettered in its choice.  That is not true.  The Government is fettered in its choice by the law.  I would love to be a judge but I cannot be appointed as one because I am not a barrister or solicitor.  There are criteria there.  Putting in a criterion saying a person can be appointed a judge only if he or she is nominated by the Judicial Appointments Commission is no different from putting down any other requirement in law.  That is all it is.  The power to advise the President still remains with Government.  However, its choices are fettered all the time in law.  We were sold the idea that was what we were doing here, that is, that we were trying to fetter the Government's hand in this.  That is the whole intention.  I do not agree with the points being made.</p></speech>

The constitutional issue was raised in regard to ranking people but I cannot even remotely see the argument there.  In this one, I can see it slightly more but I am still unconvinced.  The committee or the D&aacute;il, obviously, should not put in place any provision that is unconstitutional but I am not sure I understand or see the constitutional argument.  Deputy Daly has rebutted it fairly well in respect of Article 13.9.  It is a desirable end.  If it is demonstrated that it is not constitutional, then I will not support it but at the moment I am unconvinced by the arguments made on the basis of the Constitution.  I cannot quite see the constitutional argument being made.</p></speech>

The Government will say what it wants.  We can argue against it.  There are senior counsel who are prepared to say they think it is unconstitutional and there are senior counsels who are prepared to say they think it is not unconstitutional.  If we are trying to do what we set out to do, why not test it properly?  The opinion should be published.  It is all very well to be hiding behind the Attorney General.  He comes up with these so-called opinions and does not even back them up.  That does not stack up.  If we are going to be transparent, then we should publish the opinion of the Attorney General and see if it stacks up.  I have talked to people in the legal area and they said this would not be a problem in terms of the Constitution.  The Government said it is.  Why not publish the opinion from the Attorney General, if that is what it states?  Is the Government just hiding behind the Constitution?</p></speech>

Any suggestion this is being rushed through would be doing the Chair a disservice.  We are anxious to ensure there is proper and adequate time for debate and proper and adequate scope to ensure that every section of the Bill is considered fully.  My difficulty with this particular amendment is that it is mandatory.  Deputy Wallace states in his amendment that "[t]he Government shall nominate for appointment one of the three persons recommended by the relevant committee in accordance with subsection (2)."  To my mind that conflicts with a constitutional requirement that the Government must, under our Constitution, remain free to choose any of the persons or to choose a person other than from among the names recommended by the commission.  That is the prerogative of Government under our Constitution.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the international stage.  If we examined practices in other countries referred to by the Deputies, we would also see a choice from among a number of recommended candidates.  That will be the position here, having regard to our Constitution.  A number of names would be considered, as recommended by the commission.  The President would then be advised, under the Constitution, as to the position of Government as far as those recommendations are concerned.  Anything that would narrow that is constitutionally unsound and I am unable to recommend acceptance of it.</p></speech>

The 2017 EU justice scoreboard, in a report published by the European Commission in April 2017, indicated that we were the second worst in Europe for Government interference in the appointment of judges.  We will probably still be the second worst in Europe after the Bill is published.  That is all I have to say.</p></speech>

It is far too easy to cast aspersions about a process and state that it has served citizens in a way that is less than optimal during the years.  I do not accept that; I strongly reject it.

That is all I am saying.  It means that we have the second highest level of political involvement in the appointment of the Judiciary.  I am saying that unless we change things dramatically, we will still have one of the most politically oriented and influenced methods for appointing judges.</p></speech>

This amendment is slightly different.  It deals with the situations where the commission cannot in good conscience recommend any applicants to the Government for appointment.  This is what we are dealing with.</p><p>At present, the Bill provides for the commission to send on the names and r&eacute;sum&eacute;s to the Government and the Government gets to pick whoever it likes.  We were told the whole reason behind the Bill was to avoid that type of situation.</p><p>My amendment provides that if the commission believes there is no one who it could in good conscience recommend, then I do not think anyone on the list should end up as a judge.  The amendment provides for re-advertising the appointment within a three-month period.  I imagine the circumstances would be rare but I believe we need the provision.  Otherwise, it is simply a free-for-all for the Government and it can pick whoever it likes.  That is what we are supposed to be moving away from.</p></speech>

The position at present where this would arise is that the commission would report to the Minister the names of all eligible people who had applied, though none were recommended by it.  The Government would then exercise its constitutional prerogative, if satisfied, to so advise the President to appoint one of the eligible persons.</p> <p>  I am unsure whether Deputy Daly's proposal represents a solution to the issue or challenge to which she refers.  It would see the commission going back into a loop, maybe even an endless loop, of quarterly attempts to fill a post until it finds someone that it deems suitable.  There may be several reasons why it is not in a position to recommend at least one of the candidates.</p> <p>  At the end of the day, the issue of the Government's constitutional prerogative arises, against which all sections are being debated and will be consequently enacted.  It may be that a perfectly suitable person has made himself or herself known to Government.  That person may not have been prepared for whatever exceptional reason to apply to the commission but may become available for appointment by the Government.  Anyway, I would find it too difficult to accept any change or amendment that might in any way adversely interfere with what is, a Cheann Comhairle, the constitutional prerogative of Government.</p></speech>

He said that if a good person was out there who became available for Government but did not make him or herself known to the commission, then the Government could hand-pick that person.  However, if a good person was out there, he or she could be nominated within the three months when the commission re-advertises.  That person, presumably, would come forward.  If the person was that good, presumably, the commission could recommend him or her.</p> <p>  At the moment, the Bill provides that if the commission cannot recommend anyone, it sends the entire list to Government.  The Bill is silent on what happens next.  Basically, members of the Government can throw their eyes over and decide all those on the list are crap and opt to get someone else or they might decide the names on the list are not great but decide to take one of them anyway.</p> <p>  I imagine these situation are rare.  To be honest, if the commission cannot recommend anyone, no one on the list should end up as a judge.  It is perfectly reasonable to say the position should be re-advertised.  Let us suppose the Government or some other body believes a great candidate has become available.  Let us suppose, for example, that Deputy Jim O&rsquo;Callaghan has become available.  Then they could ask him to apply to the commission and let the commission test him.  I am actually more convinced about it now.</p></speech>

Let us see what we can do between now and Report Stage.  I am rather conscious of the need to ensure that the constitutional prerogative of Government is at all times preserved and in no way interfered with in a way that might give rise to some difficulty.</p> <p>  I remind the Deputy that I know of no relevant circumstance in recent years since we have had the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board process.  The process is such that there is an annual advertisement or invitation for people to express their interest to make an application.  That tends to form a process that is not unsatisfactory.  I know of no case where the Government decided that each and every person on a list does not accord with what the stated intention of the Government might be in its relationship with the present.  We will have another look at it, but I am conscious of the constitutional position.</p></speech>

Under the old regime, there would be occasion when the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board would not make a recommendation of names to Government because it could not recommend sitting judges.  For example, let us suppose there was a vacancy on the Supreme Court or the Court of Appeal and the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was of the opinion that the vacancy should be filled by a sitting judge.  In that situation, the board would not make a recommendation to Government.  In a way, that could be interpreted as a message being sent.  However, under the new legislation, any judge who wishes to apply must go through the commission process.  It is slightly different.</p> <p>  I am not really providing any definitive clarity on my attitude to the amendment but it is a point that deserves to be made because a different issue arises.  The point being made by Deputy Clare Daly's amendment is that if the commission does not find an individual to recommend, then it would be required to go back through the process again.  There is benefit in that.  Otherwise, if the Government does not get a recommendation, it could simply decide to nominate someone.</p></speech>

We have seen the commission arrive at a determination whereby, having regard to the number of persons under consideration, it was not prepared to make a recommendation to Government.  What would change in the terms of reference in having a second round or another round?  What might happen to ensure that on the second occasion after a lapse of time the commission would be minded to come back with a ranking of first, second and third in accordance with the process the Deputy would see as being optimal?</p></speech>

Let us suppose the commission was looking at candidates and found that it could not recommend any of them.</p><p>Does it mean we will leave a vacancy and appoint no one?  Will we just let the Government pick its political friends for the job or will we ask the commission to have another trawl to see if it can come up with someone fit for the job?</p></speech>

However, we are talking about transparency and procedures.  The Minister used a scenario in which the board could not recommend anyone, the Government said all the recommendations were brutal but had a person in mind and appointed that person.  What is wrong with informing the individual that the job would be re-advertised, he or she could apply for it, the commission would then decide on it and it would then go back to the Government.  We want to set up a commission which evaluates and scrutinises this in a fair and transparent manner.  I think that is the best of doing it.</p></speech>

I do not believe they can be left to a circular process of quarterly meetings.  I am not sure if I can accept the premise that we have a commission sent into a loop of re-runs in an attempt to fill a vacancy.  Parallel to that, we have the important prerogative of the Government to select a candidate for appointment by the President.  I am not going to re-run the constitutional arguments but vacancies must be filled, appointments made and the courts need to have their business transacted.  Any element of doubt or reversion to quarterly meetings which might not be in a position to produce a result is, at best, uncertain and, at worst, very damaging.</p></speech>

(1) Where&mdash;<blockquote>(a) the judicial office of Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal or President of the High Court stands vacant, or<br /><br />(b) the Minister reasonably apprehends that any of those offices will stand vacant,<br /><br />the Minister shall request the Commission to seek expressions of interest on the part of eligible persons who wish to be considered for appointment to such office.</blockquote>(2) Upon receiving the expressions of interest referred to in<i>subsection (1)</i>the Commission shall consider the suitability of all eligible persons expressing such interest and recommend, based on merit, to the Government, ranked in the order of the Commission&rsquo;s preference, the 3 most suitable candidates for appointment to the judicial office referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>.<br /><br />(3) The Commission may accept expressions of interest from eligible members of the Commission.<br /><br />(4) In deliberating or making a recommendation to the Government pursuant to this section, the eligible members of the Commission who have expressed the interest referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>shall not sit as members of the Commission.<br /><br />(5) If the President of the Court of Appeal has expressed, in relation to the judicial office, the interest referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>, the next most senior judge available shall sit in substitution on the Commission, that is to say whoever of the judges specified in paragraphs (b) to (k) of section 9 (substituted by section 28 of the Court of Appeal Act 2014) of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 ranks first in precedence (after the President of the Court of Appeal) in accordance with said section 9 and who is available to serve on the Commission (excepting for this purpose any such judge who, in relation to the foregoing judicial office, has expressed the interest referred to in <i>subsection(1)</i>).<br /><br />(6) If the President of the High Court has expressed, in relation to the judicial office, the interest referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>, the next most senior judge available shall sit in substitution on the Commission, that is to say whoever of the judges specified in paragraphs (c) to (k) of section 9 (substituted by section 28 of the Court of Appeal Act 2014) of the Courts of Justice Act 1924 ranks first in precedence (after the President of the High Court) in accordance with said section 9 and who is available to serve on the Commission (excepting for this purpose any such judge who, in relation to the foregoing judicial office, has expressed the interest referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>).<br /><br />(7) If the Commission, having considered the suitability of all of those persons who have expressed the interest referred to in <i>subsection (1) </i>decides that it cannot recommend to the Government the names of 3 persons for appointment to the judicial office referred to in <i>subsection (1) </i>but can recommend the names of a lesser number of persons for that purpose, then it shall recommend to the Government the names of that lesser number of persons for appointment to the judicial office so referred to.<br /><br />(8) The cases to which <i>subsection (7) </i>applies include a case in which the number of eligible persons who, in relation to the judicial office concerned, have expressed the interest referred to in <i>subsection (1) </i>is less than 3.<br /><br />(9) If the Commission cannot, in accordance with this Act, recommend to the Minister any names of persons to fill a judicial vacancy referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>, the Minister shall request the Commission to seek expressions of interest on the part of eligible persons who wish to be considered for appointment to such office at three-monthly intervals until such time as the Commission is satisfied, subject to <i>subsection (2)</i>, to recommend at least one person to the Minister to fill the judicial vacancy concerned.<br /><br />(10) In this section &quot;eligible person&quot; means a person who the Commission is satisfied is qualified for appointment to the judicial office concerned by virtue of section 5 or 45A of the Act of 1961.<br /><br />(11) In this section &quot;eligible member&quot; means a member of the Commission who the Commission is satisfied is qualified for appointment to the judicial office concerned by virtue of section 5 or 45A of the Act of 1961.&rdquo;</blockquote></blockquote> <p>I will try to be brief.  The general idea of the group of amendments is to do away with the senior judicial appointments committee proposed in the Bill and instead have the commission as a whole do the job of making appointments to the role of Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal and President of the High Court.  At present, the Bill envisages a committee made up of the Chief Justice, the Attorney General, the chairperson and possibly the Minister to make the most senior judicial appointments.  The Minister's presence in this is not clear.  The Bill speaks about the Minister convening a meeting but it is not really clear what his or her role would be on it.  It would be good to have it clarified.  It is a contradiction in the Bill and I would like to see the commission doing the job.  I do not like the political composition, the small size and the fact that the commission would be sidelined in such critical appointments is not good.  What is the point in going to all the trouble of setting up a commission like this and then giving the job to a tiny committee at the side for the most important appointments?</p><p>This amendment would add other provisions to deal with senior judicial appointments, such as empowering the commission to rank them, as we discussed.  I will not go over that again.  It would also fix what might be a loophole in the Bill, as if the commission cannot recommend three people there would be the ability to recommend fewer.  That is not currently provided for in the Bill.  There is also an advertising element.  This would get rid of that mad committee, give the power to the commission and tidy up some other elements.</p></speech>

The existing section 46 procedure involves the setting up of an advisory committee consisting of the Attorney General, the chairperson of the commission and the most senior available appropriate judge who is not an applicant to seek expressions of interest and make a recommendation on the three names to the Government.  The amendment seeks to transfer this expressions of interest process to the commission and requires the commission to rank its recommended candidates.  Where there are no recommended candidates, the expression of interest process is to be re-run on quarterly intervals as mentioned.</p> <p>  I stress the importance of the special advisory committee procedure in respect of these top posts.  This was designed to take these three posts and their very special and important requirements out of the mainstream commission process, while at the same time ensuring the commission was present in the process via the chairperson.  There are considerations at play to ensure those people who would be the very best candidates for these top jobs would not be deterred in any way from putting their names forward.  I have already mentioned and must stress again the constitutional prerogative of the position of the Government.  I have already mentioned the three-month loop that I understand is being inserted in the Bill in any event.</p> <p>  The critical positions of the Chief Justice, the President of the Court of Appeal and the President of the High Court cannot be left in this loop type of arrangement.  We cannot envisage a case in which these positions remain vacant for extended periods.  That is why the concept is to have a special requirement, having regard to the seniority of the positions.  I am minded to listen carefully to the views and I do not really have a closed mind to these special procedures.  Nevertheless I see difficulties with leaving these matters of import to the mainstream commission process.</p></speech>

A person should not be appointed as Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal or President of the High Court unless the person is a judge.  If a barrister can be made Chief Justice or a solicitor can be made President of the Court of Appeal, it would be like a person who has never been a teacher becoming a principal of a school.  On Report Stage, Deputy Chambers and I will consider putting down amendments in that respect.</p> <p>  The explanation of the Minister against this proposal appears to be that because these are such important positions, we would not want the commission dealing with it.  In a way it is an indictment of the commission.  This has nearly gone full circle because the process has become so complicated.  We are chasing our tails to ensure everything is put in place.  The Government has put it in the Bill that these positions would be dealt with separately because they are so important.  They are so important it seems they cannot be left to the commission.  I am not desperately happy with Deputy Daly's amendment but to be consistent in the approach to the Bill, I will support it.</p></speech>

I am not clear on that.  The Minister's role is still there, although the Minister has argued it is not.</p><p>The question of whether the position is vacant is a side argument.  It is a question of whether the commission or this committee evaluates it.  The points have been made.  We are setting up a commission; of course it should have this job.</p></speech>

Before I talk about my experiences on transport, I will speak a little about myself to put a face to the statistics.  First and foremost, I am an award-winning filmmaker.  My documentary on disability in the screen media industry toured the festival circuit and finished its festival run with an award.  Another one of my films recently premiered in Portugal and was also nominated for an award.  I am a TEDx speaker and I am fluent in Irish.  I am about to graduate with a BA honours degree in film and television production and I have my eyes set on a master's programme.  I and many others like me are the future of this country.  Despite these impressive attributes, I cannot board a bus of my own free will.  I am forced give details about where I will be, what time I will be there and what time I intend returning.</p> <p>  Maybe I would not mind if the system worked but it does not work. Time and again, I and others like me are let down by this deeply flawed and unrealistic system.</p><p>I am 21 years old.  At that age I should be allowed to be spontaneous.  I should be free to hop on a bus and explore our country, a country whose Constitution was built on the idea of freedom and equality.  When did we stray so far from the visions of our forefathers?  I would not be seated here today in front of the committee if this was a country of freedom and equality.</p><p> Even when jumping through all these transportation hoops, the system continues to let me down.  Last year alone, I would say I was let down by our transport system over 20 times.  I have missed out on business meetings that could have secured a job for me.  I have had to miss appointments because I have showed up for my pre-booked bus only to be told that there has been a mis-communication and I will be unable to travel as the bus has not been properly adapted to allow me onto it.  The bus has to be adapted to let me onto it.  It is not completely accessible.  I have missed out on valuable opportunities to spend time with my friends, leaving me isolated from them and ultimately cutting me off from the wider world.  I cannot begin to describe the emotions that go through one's body when one is seated at a crowded bus stop and a driver has to step out to say that one cannot travel simply because one has a disability.  This has happened time and again.  One is seated there and sees the crowds of people whispering to each other.  Sympathetic looks are exchanged.  Then the bus pulls away and one is left there alone, feeling like one is nothing.</p><p> Then there is the email one has to send to let one's prospective business partner, employer, friend or whoever know that one will be unable to attend the pre-arranged meeting.  Who is going to salvage my reputation when I am labelled "unreliable", when I am unable to get a job and am forced to feed into the stereotype that people with disabilities do not work or when I am cut off from the rest of society because the thought of getting a bus is too much for me and I decide I am better off staying home?  I am too young to feel this jaded by a system that can be fixed.  We are fighting, but we cannot do it alone.</p><p> There are people who try their best to help.  I have had bus drivers put themselves at risk to lift me onto buses because they refuse to accept the broken system and they are committed to ensuring I reach the destination of the journey I pre-booked 24 hours in advance.  There are people like Kieran Delaney and Senator John Dolan who will stop at nothing until people with disabilities are given the rights they deserve.  Kieran has had to make telephone calls to ensure I do not get stranded in Dublin because of a grievous error that has never been my fault.  One night I sat in Bus&aacute;ras and I was told I would not be travelling but that the company would try to accommodate me on the next bus.  The next bus came and it could not accommodate me and the same happened with the next one that came.  It was getting dark and I was genuinely concerned I would not make it home.  I wondered what I would do.  I checked hotels but everywhere was fully booked.  I was terrified that I would end up stranded or abandoned with no way home.  That is the reality of the system.  </p><p> Then there are the times when I have got onto the bus and there have been no clamps.  The drivers offer to put my chair in the cargo hold when I transfer into a seat.  That is well and good because I am able to do that, but I should not have to.  I should not have to risk my chair being put in the cargo hold where it could be broken.  If my chair gets broken I automatically become helpless and dependent, and I assure the committee I am neither helpless nor dependent.  Do the members think this is acceptable in Ireland in 2018?</p><p> My life is complicated enough without having to chew anxiously on my fingernails, wondering whether I will be able to make my pre-booked journey.  It is a journey I am forced to book in advance because people with disabilities are an afterthought in the system.  I admire the introduction of the four-hour plan, but it is not enough.  The 24-hours notice for a bus journey is not enough.  Public transport should not be a human rights issue, but in its current form it is.  What is it going to take for the system to take account of the plight of people with disabilities when using the service and to implement change properly?  How many more people are going to give up and be forced to become isolated, wards of a system that is exclusionary and ultimately dangerous?  I reject the idea that I should have to book my journey.  I reject being in any way different from the committee members or their colleagues.  They do not have to book transport in advance so why should I?</p><p> There must be no more being left on the side of the road, no more having to call in favours just to get home, no more missed opportunities, no more feeling like a burden for wanting to live independently in society and no more discrimination against people with disabilities.  Fixing this system is a lot easier than having me to contend with.  Enough is enough.</p></speech>

I welcome the focus she has put on the issue today, but what in her view could be done in the short term to make the system better such that she would have fewer of the terrible experiences outlined?</p></speech>

I have been really fortunate in my film career to have travelled the world.  I have been to Berlin, the United Kingdom and many other countries.  In the United Kingdom all buses have ramps which are lowered with the push of a button by the driver.  In Berlin it is the same.  All taxis in London are also accessible.  The provision of automatic ramps could save so much time, hardship and embarrassment.  At a basic level, it is horrific to be dependent on others to get from A to B.  I acquired my disability.  I started life as a happy, active child.  As my condition worsened, I realised the playing field was uneven.  My parents had to learn the hard way what I would be faced with in life.  I have fought so many battles, but the battle with the transport system is the one that has worn me down the most.</p></speech>

I pay tribute to Senator John Dolan and Mr. Kieran Delaney, a staff member in the Houses of the Oireachtas, for highlighting the things we, as politicians, take for granted or are not aware of but should be.  </p> <p>  I thank Ms Murray and Mr. Moran for being here.  I enjoy using public transport wherever I go, which sometimes is a challenge, but that challenge is nowhere near what it would be if I had a disability.  I live in Boyle, County Roscommon which is serviced by buses and trains which I am sure present challenges for people with a disability.</p> <p>  Ms Murray has mentioned that the introduction of the four-hour plan for train usage is not enough and that 24-hour notice of a bus journey is also not enough.  As I am not familiar with these issues, perhaps Ms Murray might elaborate.  She has also mentioned that if she misses a pre-arranged meeting, she is labelled as unreliable, which is unacceptable.  It never occurred to me that a person who turned up late for a meeting owing to a public transport issue would be deemed to be unreliable.  I am disappointed that commuters had to help Ms Murray off trains because staff were too busy.  That is what they are paid to do; it is their job.  If she pre-books a journey and a properly adapted bus is not provided, that is not human error but negligence.  I agree with the Chairman that if a person pre-books a journey and a property adapted bus is not provided, there must be recourse to the provision of a taxi.  This hurts staff and the companies.  I accept that the companies are doing a lot and that they need to do more, but in situations where a staff member shows no interest in helping disabled persons, it is not good enough.  I understand Senator John Dolan and Mr. Kieran Delaney have highlighted these issues and will continue to do so.</p></speech>

The 109X from Cavan to Dublin is the bus I use to catch to attend meetings and so on.  The college meets my transport needs by providing a taxi.

People are irrelevant when the system is broken.  Most of the time, it has been staff who have come to my rescue on buses.  On one occasion when it was raining and I was so fed up with the system that I was driven to tears, the driver of the bus, with a passenger, lifted my chair into the cargo hold.  I rang the company to complain and told it that if there was not a wheelchair accessible bus available for my return journey, there would be trouble and there was because the bus was not wheelchair accessible.  I spoke about my experiences in Busar&aacute;s when bus after bus was not wheelchair accessible.  Mr. Kieran Delaney had to ring Mr. Ray Hernon to organise a single decker bus to take me home.  I am reliant on others.  I rely on the kindness of strangers and people like Mr. Hernon and Mr. Delaney, rather than on a system that is wholly unacceptable.</p></speech>

They have come to him many times and told him that it is a problem, so why was he not there when it counted?  It is admirable to sit at this committee but unless one follows through, to be admirable will not cut it.</p> <p>  I wonder what the Minister will do to ensure that I, Mr. Moran or anyone like us will not have to sit before the committee again.

I commend the committee on taking on this important issue, which, fundamentally, relates to equal rights.  Ms Murray is correct, I believe she was referring to Rosa Parks when she spoke about revolutions starting on buses.  Rosa Parks lived in an apartheid state in America and was told where she could and could not sit on the bus.  We have a totally unequal system whereby Ms Murray is not even allowed on the bus in the first instance or she is told which bus she can or cannot get on, and is obliged to give 24 hours' notice of her intention to travel.  That is wrong and I oppose it completely.</p> <p>  I know Padraic and have worked with him on this issue.  We met the Minister only last week, a matter on which I will comment after Padraic makes his statement.  We presented the Minister with a petition of over 3,000 signatures demanding equal access to our public transport system.  The Government, Bus &Eacute;ireann and Dublin Bus are all paying lip-service in respect of this matter; they are just engaged in a box-ticking exercise.  Someone who was good friend of mine, and who has passed away, was John Doyle.  He was a wheelchair user who worked for the Disability Federation of Ireland.  In the early 1990s, John and a small group of individuals led a campaign that focused on Dublin Bus, whose vehicles were wholly inaccessible to anyone in a wheelchair at the time.  They chained themselves to the railings at Bus&aacute;ras, put it up to the company and forced it to change its perspective.  Ultimately, it led to Dublin Bus updating and changing its fleet and introducing low-floor buses.  That is where it ended.  It was the company wanting to get these people off their backs and deciding to invest in it.</p> <p>  We have able-bodied people making decisions who do not look through the eyes of someone with a disability and who put in place what they think is needed without living the experience.  It is something that Mr. Moran will speak about and it is clear from listening to Ms Murray that this is where the problems lie.  In my own constituency of Wicklow, Bus &Eacute;ireann operates the 133 route.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has invested in updating some of its fleet and that is welcome.  In Wicklow, however, it is only possible to access buses at certain stops because the other critical pieces of infrastructure, such as higher footpaths to allow people to board, are lacking.  It is only a box-ticking exercise.</p> <p>  I have some specific questions for Ms Murray.  There should be free, unrestricted access to all public transport.  It should not require 24 hours notice nor should it need four hours.  That gives people with disabilities the message that they must live their lives in such a way that nothing unexpected may happen and that everything must be planned in advance.  It is not acceptable for anyone to get sick or be spontaneous.  That fundamentally treats them as unequal citizens.  Having spoken to the Minister last week, I think he is slowly starting to appreciate the issue.  I would like him to be more proactive in using public transport rather than tweeting when he gets on a bus for the first time.  He might accompany the witnesses and see the difficulties that people experience.  There have been minor improvements but what other restrictions are there?  I gave the example of Rathnew in Wicklow where people with disabilities cannot access the stop for the 133 route in their home town and have to go elsewhere in order to get on the bus.  What other restrictions are there, apart from those relating to the 24-hour notice?</p></speech>

I come from Navan originally.  When I started taking the bus and first tried booking it, I was told that I would have to get on at Cavan.  I asked if I was expected to go to Cavan rather than go two minutes down the road to get the bus and I was told that was what I would have to do and that was the company policy.  I did it for a while but then I decided I was having no more of it and I told the company that I would get on at Virginia.  It told me that I could not do so and I responded that I could.  I went out with a measuring tape and measured the kerb.  I was well able to get on at the stop in Virginia, it was just that Bus &Eacute;ireann did not want to stop mid-route and go through the rigmarole of clamping me in.</p> <p>  The clamping of the chair is another issue.  Most of the time, I tell people how to clamp the chair.  I think that some of the drivers have started to realise that I am asking them for a reason.  I have stopped ringing to complain because it makes no difference - and the system remains broken - but when I used to call, I would explain that the drivers did not know how to use the clamps and that they had not been trained how to do it.  It is a fundamental health and safety issue.  If a driver does not know how to clamp a wheelchair down and a customer goes flying, it is not the customer's fault.  It seems as though some of the drivers have read the same thing because they give an automatic response whereby they say they are trained and have been given refresher training.  Whenever I have complained, the response seems automatic and I am told that they are sorry I have had the experience and where I can log the complaint, which they will then do nothing about.  That is the system.  I once alighted from a bus in Navan, it was not my usual stop, where there was a drop of 3 ft to get to the kerb.  I sat at the bus stop looking at the kerb and wondering whether I would manage to land if I fired myself off it, because that was the only way that I was going to get from A to B.  So there are problems with bus stops and with ramps not working.  I have also had an experience whereby a bus had been adapted but when the driver checked the ramp, he discovered it was not working.</p><p>One then wonders what one is supposed to do.</p><p> As regards Dublin Bus, it was snowing and raining last week and I was waiting for a bus.  The bus drivers did their best and asked people to fold up their buggies but people refused to do so.  I sat with blue hands, shivering, because I could not get on the bus because people would not fold up their buggies as not all buses have a designated spot for buggies.  I was left in the freezing cold and do not know how I did not get pneumonia.  I sat at the bus stop and decided I would go for a coffee, cry and try again.  That is the system.  One sits, cries, gathers oneself and tries again.</p></speech>

I work for Sky Ireland as a service specialist and for East Coast FM as a  production assistant, sports reporter and broadcast co-ordinator.  Sky Ireland are based on Burlington Road and I have commuted from Bray to Ballsbridge daily for the past three and a half years.  I have observed the progressive worsening of the service provided by Irish Rail on the DART line, from stations being manned in the past to the current situation.  Most people do not realise that people with disabilities or impairments do not like to ask for help and that it is very humbling to have to ask for assistance but it has to be done at certain times.</p> <p>  In terms of transport, we should be fully independent and autonomous to get on a bus or train without having to give four or 24 hours' notice.  The current requirements are unfair.  If any of the able-bodied population had to do that, people would not stand for it because it is against human rights.  In Ireland, we seem to do things and then retrospectively acknowledge they do not work.  I will highlight a few incidents that came into the public domain because I work in media and know how the system works and how to get a reaction.  Other people cannot do that.</p> <p>  Last August, I left work and communicated with Pearse station.  I am lucky because I have such a good relationship with the staff in the Irish Rail stations that I have the personal mobile numbers of some.  Those good relations with the majority of staff is the reason for events such as these not happening to me more often.  Last August, I was going home at approximately 8.30 p.m. or 9 p.m. after work in Sky and it was communicated to Bray that I was on the DART.  I got to Bray but there was nobody there to assist me to disembark.  I realised I was stuck.  One might ask why I did not use the emergency button.  Emergency buttons at wheelchair level on the DART are never armed and are mere decoration.  I had to wedge my chair against the wall and try to stand up and break a little piece of plastic in order to push the button that is high up on the wall.  The alarm went off.  When I ended up in Greystones, the driver advised me that the alarm had gone off but he thought it was an error and never checked.  I could have been attacked or having an asthma attack.  Anything could have been happening.  The driver did not bother checking what had happened.  I lodged a complaint with the Railway Safety Authority about that incident but it did not follow it up.  There is no reason to lodge a complaint because nobody will follow up on it.  One is told that the company is very sorry and so on but nobody does anything. </p> <p>  On 17 December last, I was on my way home on a Sunday evening.  At that time, DART trains are only every half an hour, so one must plan which DART one will take.  I telephoned Pearse station and a staff member from Sandymount was sent up to put me on the train.  He communicated to Bray.  I got to Bray and nobody was there to assist me.  I could not press the higher emergency button because I could not break the piece of plastic, so off I went to Greystones.  I broadcast that experience on Facebook Live and for the second time called on the CEO of Irish Rail to be courageous and come out and speak to me.  It is very easy to make cuts but it is harder to stand face to face with a person directly affected by the cuts.  I went to Greystones.  The DART had to get out of the way because the Rosslare train was approaching, so the doors began to close.  I had to stick my legs out the doors to keep them open.  It took the driver five minutes to come down to check why the doors were not closing, as a result of which I ended up with a swollen ankle.  If I had not stuck my legs out the doors, I would have ended up on a siding because the DART had to be moved out of the way to allow the Rosslare train past.  Having got off the DART, I then had to hope and pray that the Rosslare train driver would get out and put me on his train as not all Irish Rail drivers are insured to put down ramps and are not insured to leave their cabs because if there is an incident, they are in trouble.  That is another big issue, in that there are no safety protocols in place and all one gets from Irish Rail is lip-service.  It keeps happening.  If something keeps happening, one fixes it rather than keep papering over the cracks, which Irish Rail is very good at doing and getting away with because nothing is happening and no one in Irish Rail seems to be answerable or trying to fix it.  That is a fundamental issue.</p><p>I had an interview with Barry Kenny on East Coast FM in December where he talked about automated ramps for the DART.  Automated ramps were piloted about ten years ago.  They had to be abandoned for the simple reason that the infrastructure in some DART stations is so old.  In certain station such as Seapoint, if it involves an eight-carriage DART, a person has to be on carriage three because there is no space anywhere else on the platform to go.  When I argued this point with Barry Kenny, he totally dismissed it and told me the platforms are all the same length.  Yes, they are all the same length.  I was not arguing that.  What I was arguing was that there is an infrastructural problem and that is part of the reason the company had to abandon it because it could not fit the ramps around the infrastructure because it is too old.  When this was piloted before, the company was told it would have to redesign the system and that, fundamentally, this would cost too much money.<br/><br/>Another part of its argument is that people are not talking at windows or it is not making money because we have Leap cards.  Irish Rail is still getting the money from the Leap card so that is another issue.  Taking staff out of stations is the biggest issue.  Due to the fact that I am in full-time employment, I am no longer entitled to the travel pass because, according to the system, I was cured when I got a job.  I inadvertently probably set a trap for Irish Rail a couple of months ago when I made this public knowledge.  Last Thursday evening, when I was leaving work, I got three separate phone calls from three members of staff in three different stations on the DART station telling me Irish Rail's revenue protection unit was out to catch me without a ticket.  What they do not know is that I obviously buy my ticket because I have to and I do not mind that.  However, this is a ploy on their part to set me up to get me to go away and stop giving out and fighting for people.  My fundamental argument is that I am lucky with my cerebral palsy.  I can talk, communicate, articulate and say &quot;This is wrong.&quot;  Some people with disabilities and impairments cannot do that.  According to the last census, just over 600,000 people are registered with disabilities.  It is a lot easier to make cuts because we are not a big voting group.  We cannot get out in mass protests.  Last year, the entire country was discommoded by a bus strike and it got sorted out.  Why?  It was because the entire population was discommoded.  People with disabilities are discommoded every day but it is acceptable because we cannot take protest <i>en masse</i>.  We cannot get out and say &quot;This is wrong&quot; because there so few of us are actually able to do.  Ms Murray and I are sitting here for the ones who do not have a voice.  We have to fight for the ones who cannot fight.<br/><br/>I have said that I am really lucky in that I am a two-time Paralympic athlete.  I have travelled around the world to places like Beijing, Portugal, Brazil and Canada.  I have seen many different transport systems.  When I was in Porto in 2016, I could get on its tram system and get into the city centre by myself without assistance.  I could do it in Paris.  I visited Wales for the Ireland match last November and I got on a train.  If Europe can do it, why can Ireland not do it?  It is very simple.  We have a knack in Ireland of building things and then not following up on systems.  We build it and then realise we have made a mistake instead of actually doing it from the outside.  Last week, Irish Rail launched its accessibility app.  I am on the committee for that app.  That app has not been fully tested.  I am going in next Wednesday to test that app with Irish Rail.  Irish Rail launched that in Connolly Station.  Irish Rail left two people on the platform.  Connolly Station has the most staff of any DART station.  If Irish Rail cannot get it right for a launch, what hope do the rest of us have for the rest of the time?  I am really lucky that I am here today because of Ciar&aacute;n Delaney and Senator John Dolan.  Without them, I would not have known that this was even possible.  As a result of the fact that I was so distressed last Thursday, they were so good in trying to help me in terms of the revenue protection unit.  Deputy Brady can attest to the state I was in, as can Aisling Dunne because she also rang me to make sure I was okay.  I have to get help from a system that should be there.<br/><br/>We are now on the cusp of something great whereby we are about to ratify the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  This committee has the chance to actually make the system work and not accept this.  The problem is that it is accepted because we cannot protest <i>en masse</i>, which is part of the problem.  Like Ms Murray, I should not have to ring Ciar&aacute;n Delaney in a panic or ring Deputy Brady and tell him that I am in trouble because the system is broken and a company wants me to go away.  That the outgoing CEO of Irish Rail does not want to meet me and will not respond to me demonstrates a lot of contempt on his part.  I am contacted by Barry Kenny, Jane Cregan and some other people.  I do not want them.  I want him.  I want him to sit down and tell me why this is happening because I can guarantee that if Irish Rail said tomorrow or RT&Eacute; &quot;Six One News&quot; announced that every citizen in this country had to give four hours notice to use transport, it would not happen because it would be sorted out because it would involve the entire country.  A minority group is being discommoded and it is almost like we are not respected as humans, which is a fundamental issue that needs to be addressed.  Were it not for the likes of Ciar&aacute;n Donnelly, I would not be here today.  He is doing his best to try to highlight issues but, again, as Ms Murray said, we should not have to do that.  We should not be here.  The system should be there to protect us.  This is fundamentally what I want.  It is not about me.  It is not about me getting the DART.  Fundamentally, it is about protecting people who cannot communicate.  I know people who have a speech impediment.  If they have to pick up a phone and use a touch talker, the person at the other end of the phone does not know that so it will take them 30 or 40 seconds to type something out.  That person will not wait.  Fundamentally, we need to protect people with disabilities and give them equal rights.  We should not be saying &quot;This is what we need to do because of cutbacks.&quot;  Put staff in stations.  We have &euro;13 billion coming back from Apple.  That is money that could put staff back in stations.  That is something that could be used build a better infrastructure and give people equal rights, not lip service and saying &quot;Well, we are going to try&quot;.  I am tired of getting apologies.  It has got to the point where Irish Rail does not even apologise to me because it happens so often.<br/><br/>Before the outgoing CEO came in, passengers were informed when lifts were out of order.  That is not there anymore because he simply did not want negative publicity.  I do not know about the members but I would much rather than have that on a board than an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>saying how I could not get out of a station because the lift was broken.  I am really lucky in that I have travelled and seen different systems.  I spoke to the Minister last week and I know he is trying to deal with it but he is only dealing with it now because people like Ms Murray and I are bringing it to the forefront.  We should not have to do that.  As Deputies and Senators, the members are supposed to look after those who are deemed to be vulnerable.  Some people with disabilities are really vulnerable.  They are not being looked after and protected.  I thank the committee for listening.</p></speech>

If it is in order, the committee will write to the CEO and ask him to meet with Mr. Moran as a matter of urgency to listen to the points Mr. Moran wishes to make to him.  It is disrespectful of him not to meet with Mr. Moran, particularly when Mr. Moran has experiences and analysis that will help his organisation become more efficient and has acknowledged that there is a significant number of employees in Irish Rail who are very helpful and who want things to improve.</p></speech>

Once again, it highlights the difficulties he faces.  I am a bit perplexed that Irish Rail has carried out so much work on all the railway stations and platforms and now finds that Mr. Moran has obviously seen a glitch in its planning of the detail of the platforms such that it cannot seem to fit his requirements.  Mr. Moran can elaborate on that in a few minutes.  It seems Irish Rail has spent millions over the past ten, 15 or 20 years on platforms but Mr. Moran is saying there is an issue regarding his requirements as a user.</p> <p>  Regarding Mr. Moran arriving in Bray with no staff member waiting to assist him, this is happening far too often.</p><p>Mr. Moran said that the staff sometimes forget he is on board.  A system must be put in place that imposes a penalty if that happens.  People can apologise in a letter and so on but there has to be some penalty imposed.  I understand staff members are extremely good and go beyond the call of duty but in some cases, management and staff are not delivering on the requirements the witnesses need.  That is not good enough.</p><p> Mr. Moran referred to isolated incidents.  He seems to have been involved in many isolated incidents, which I find humorous but worrying also.  I note that on three occasions since last August he has requested a meeting with the chief executive officer, CEO, of Irish Rail.  I know Barry Kenny but Mr. Moran wishes to meet the CEO of Irish Rail and I believe the committee should request that such a meeting take place.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for their submission.  I will not thank them for their patience because they have run out of patience and this issue is enduring.  They say they are a voice for other people, which is a laudable quality.  I hope we can get this matter sorted out.</p></speech>

He did not turn up that day, and I raised the point that he should have been here with the company's representative.  I repeat that he has to meet the witnesses because as chief executive, this issue is a test of the credibility of his organisation.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Their evidence is very valuable for us.  More than anything else, individual cases can bring about change.  That is important.</p> <p>  Second, I congratulate Mr. Moran on all his sporting success.  It is a signal honour to be a world champion and to represent Ireland at the Olympics.  I congratulate him also on his sports reporting.  He is demonstrating by his experiences in life how he has overcome many difficulties to get opportunities.  That is all the more praiseworthy in his case because he has had to overcome extra difficulties.  Well done on that.</p> <p>  I will make an observation the witnesses can either confirm or otherwise.  The problem of unmanned stations has come up in previous meetings, in other words, humans being replaced, which results in no one being available in stations to react to situations such as those described by Mr. Moran.  Is that a major issue?</p></speech>

What I did not touch on when initially presenting was that the hub system Irish Rail launched two weeks ago is already in place whereby every fourth DART station is manned, namely, Bray, Dalkey - it is supposed to be manned - Blackrock and Pearse stations; I cannot remember the ones after Pearse station.  That system is already in place and it is not working.  As the company got it wrong on its launch, what do the rest of us have to do?</p> <p>  Regarding platforms being narrower at certain stations, at Killiney, Dalkey, Sandycove, Glenageary and Lansdowne Road stations, as well as certain parts of Blackrock and Sydney Parade stations, one has to be at a certain point on the train for a ramp to be able to go down because the platforms are too narrow when the train passes a certain point and there is no room to put down a ramp safely and alight from it.  I was perplexed that Barry Kenny did not know that.  Irish Rail is sending out public relations, PR, representatives to talk to people when it does not know its own infrastructure.  I questioned him about that in an interview on East Coast FM and he was dismissive of it.  He just said that the platforms are the same length.  They are the same length but because of the location of the fixed buildings on the platforms, there are issues with them.  Irish Rail will need to fix those before it even considers the introduction of automated ramps because to introduce automated ramps, an automated ramp will be needed in each carriage and it will say it cannot afford to do that.</p></speech>

There is the old German trains which they replaced with the new Japanese fleet.  I do not know the exact numbers but in the wheelchair bay on the DART, there is an emergency button located down low where I would go with my wheelchair.  That is if I can get into it because if someone puts a bike in the wheelchair bay and does not move it, I end up having to sit in the middle of the aisle blocking the entire DART.  The ones in the wheelchair bays are never armed.  I have spoken to Irish Rail about that and the reason it will not arm them is because a child might hit them.  I understand that argument but I do not understand why a driver cannot get out, arm it and then disarm it with his carriage key.  I am lucky in that I have acquired a carriage key but sometimes I cannot get to it in time to arm my own switch.  I acquired that because I have friends in Irish Rail.  If one does not have a carriage key one has to try to do what I did, namely, stand up, break the glass and hit the one that located very high up.</p></speech>

There is one in the wheelchair area, which would be level with the arm rest of my chair, that is not covered by plexiglass.  It just has a big round button with a picture of a wheelchair on it.  When they are armed they light up green and when there is no light it means they are disarmed.  They are a mere decoration.  There is no point in having them there because I cannot hit it.  It does not work.  It will not communicate with anyone unless I physically manage to stand up and hit it or ask a passenger to keep the door open until the driver remembers that I am sitting there.</p></speech>

As the Chairman alluded to, we have had the various advocacy groups in already so it is good to meet actual service users and hear their experiences.  As they are aware, the Minister will be before the committee directly after this session.  I asked Ms Murray a similar question but Mr. Moran said he spoke to the Minister, Deputy Ross, last week.  If he was in our position today, what would he like to see him commit to in a public manner?  What would he like to see him, as Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, commit to achieving in, say, 12 months, two to three years and over a longer period?  Mr. Moran will acknowledge he will not change the current structure overnight but we should be setting down clear goals, pathways to achieving those goals and, importantly, a timeframe for implementation.  He might share with us what he believes are the three priorities in the short, medium and long term.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Moran.  His experiences of being abroad are invaluable in terms of how we can get our system in place.  What comes out in front of us is the loss of staff at the stations and the junctions.  I see it raised locally at home and in Cobh.  As Mr. Moran said, once the station becomes automated the man leaves the job but the man, or the woman, is still needed on-site because machines can break down.  He makes a valid point in that regard.  As the Chairman said, we had all the providers and the groups in but it would be no harm to have a case study done as well.</p></speech>

I am aware that because of austerity, many services were cut but having staff in stations will be a great help.  When I go to another country I do not have to check if I need to give someone notice.</p><p>Irish Rail states one should check the website.  If I were a tourist, I would not check a website if I must give notice.  One thing is if there were some way in which Irish Rail could be given more help in terms of subvention.  There is no accountability from Irish Rail, however, because if there was, this would not keep happening.  Irish Rail says mine are isolated incidents.  I have an awful lot of isolated incidents.  Irish Rail sends its PR gurus out to say it does 100 things every day and nothing goes wrong.  The only reason mine are known about is they are reported publically.  </p><p> How many cases are happening that we do not know about?  That is my other point.  Where is the accountability?  Irish Rail is not being held accountable for anything.  It just gives an apology.  An apology means nothing.  We want equal rights and equal access.  We want the same human rights.  We do not want to beg, plead and be a pauper to ask for help to get on a train.  That is a fundamental right.  I am unable to drive because I have a startle reflex.  I depend on the DART.  </p><p> Last Sunday night, I watched the Superbowl.  I decided at 8 p.m. that I wanted to do that.  I did not know I was going to do it until 7.30 p.m.  However, because Bray has a person in the station I was able to go from there.  The problem was whether Pearse Station had more than one staff member so that someone could be sent to Lansdowne Road to take me off.   Fundamentally, it is about putting staff into stations and putting funding that was taken out back into the system.  Perhaps the Minister, Deputy Ross, could look at that.</p><p> The ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities will help because there is going to be some accountability to the effect that people with disabilities will be given respect and be treated like equal citizens of our nation as we have equal rights to a service. </p></speech>

If there was a requirement on the transport provider to publish those figures on such incidents monthly or bimonthly, at least it would be obliged to account for them.  I refer not just to the primary issue of not having the service.  If transport providers were obliged to put figures into the public domain, the publicity might put a bit of pressure on the organisation.</p></speech>

I had hoped to speak to Ms Murray as well.  I welcome Mr. Moran, who spoke of inequality.  People who require wheelchair access are denied it on a daily basis because prior notice is required.  When Bus &Eacute;ireann's chief executive officer appeared before the committee, I asked how many times people requiring disability access were let down in 2017.  Bearing in mind that he knew the type of meeting he would be attending and the issues being addressed, he did not have that information with him.  I thought that was telling in itself.  We were to be furnished it immediately after the meeting.  It was almost a fortnight after the meeting before we got the response.</p> <p>  The response itself is equally telling.  It is just one line.  It says there were ten official complaints received in 2017 related to issues with wheelchair accessibility.  I know of more than ten myself in one small corner of the State.  One may wonder what credence, focus or attention the providers are giving to the official complaints being made and what mechanism they have for recording them.  The response that there were ten complaints throughout 2017 speaks volumes when each member knows people who have complained multiple times of being denied access to a service.  </p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann said it had a disability access and information officer.  That was the first I heard of it.  I spoke to other people in Louth and they were not aware of it either.  I asked whether the phone number of that person be displayed in public areas, for example, at bus stops.  People could then ring directly if they were left at the side of the road if a driver pulled up and said he or she was not qualified to operate the lift and the bus did not have a low floor.  The answer was no but that it might be looked at again.  It was more or less an internal number.  Nobody in the public domain knew there was an officer there who could be contacted directly.  </p> <p>  That shows the focus.  Bus &Eacute;ireann also said that its last audit was in 2013, five years ago, and that it is almost completed.  What does that tell us?  I acknowledge that it is public transport and we all know it has been starved of funding.  The subvention was cut year on year and it is not much improved.  What pressure is the Minister applying on the public transport network to make sure that people requiring disability access have it.  I understand from a report in the press that at the launch of disability access on the DART, two wheelchair users were left on the platform.  The Minister was not there either.  This all speaks volumes.</p> <p>  I raised another issue at one of the other meetings.  Private transport companies awarded public contracts by the State have no legal obligation to provide wheelchair accessibility despite providing a public contract on a public route.  That is something we must ensure changes as well.  I am sorry I missed Ms Murray.  I have read Mr. Moran's report and thank him for coming.  </p></speech>

It is good to listen to Mr. Moran.  He, like Ms Murray, is giving a voice at a high level to many other people who are unable to articulate their experience.  Deputy Munster touched on some of the figures.  From speaking to Mr. Moran and other people with disabilities, I know there are many people who feel they have nowhere to go when they are denied the basic right to equal access to the public transport system.</p> <p>  Mr. Moran is out there living his life and has represented Ireland in boccia as a Paralympian in Beijing and London.  It is fantastic and the biggest impediment to Mr. Moran is the system itself.  That says something about this State and how it treats its citizens in terms of equality.  I have spoken to Mr. Moran many times about this.  Today he touched graphically on the fact that he feels he is now being targeted.  It is not by individuals within Irish Rail.  It is the system itself because he is articulating the difficulties he is having accessing our public transport system.  He is fearful of using the public transport system.  </p> <p>  Last week, he came in here the morning after the incident on the DART when checks were put in place to make sure he had a ticket.  He had to pay to get a taxi to and from a meeting with the Minister because he was fearful to use the DART.  He fears an effort is being made to silence him and the voice that he gives to people.  That needs to be addressed.  That is wrong.  The Minister has taken all that information.  Unfortunately, I will not be here to listen to the Minister's contribution.  However, I hope he will be able to provide some answers because that is wrong.  </p> <p>  I want to touch on a few areas Mr. Moran mentioned.  In my previous contribution, when Ms Murray was speaking, I referred to box-ticking.  What Mr. Moran said about the emergency buttons being unarmed typifies that.  A button is put in, it looks good but does not work.  That is totally crazy.</p><p>That needs to be addressed immediately.  Mr. Padraic Moran explained his experiences graphically.  When he tried to press the button to alight from the train it did not work and he ended up in Greystones.  We would not go near the consequences that could have come from that.  </p><p> Mr. Moran mentioned that prior to the new chief executive taking office, it was publicised when the lifts were out of service.  It might be useful if Mr. Moran would explain how this was done.  He said that it is not being done now because the chief executive or some other faceless senior people in Irish Rail believe it would portray a negative image of the company.  How was notice given to the public when a lift in the train station was out of operation?</p><p> It is worth teasing out this issue a little bit more.  The Minister has plans for the roll-out of new carriages in 2020, 2021 or thereabouts and he will be looking at the automated ramps at that stage.  Even with ramps, some of the DART stations are not accessible.  Mr. Moran touched on how the implementation of unmanned DART stations is having a great impact.  What are his views on a combination of the two?  Leaving aside the massive infrastructural works that would be needed in the mid-term, does Mr. Moran think the rail and DART stations would work if the automatic ramps were in place, as well as the manning all stations?  It is critical that all stations are manned for a multitude of reasons, including disability access, public safety and other considerations.  </p><p> With the way the manual ramps are used now, a staff member is the only person who can use the ramp.  Would it be possible to introduce a system where a member of the public - possibly a personal assistant - could be trained to work a ramp in the short term, if insurance was provided?  Obviously, the current arrangements are simply not working.  An app on the designation of certain stations as hubs was supposed to be piloted and it is telling that Mr. Moran was a member of the group that was to be part of the pilot study.  The app was launched last week, however, without the pilot study and as a consequence, two people with disabilities were left on the platform.</p></speech>

However, I will read the transcript of their response to my questions later.</p> <p>  I wish to put the following questions to Mr. Moran.  In his statement he states that he requested a meeting with the chief executive of Irish Rail three times since August 2017, and that all of the requests seemed to have fallen on deaf ears.  Did he make the request in writing?  Did he receive a reply of any sort in writing?</p> <p>  He stated also that he received three phone calls from three different staff in Irish Rail, advising me that the revenue protection unit were trying to catch me without a ticket as I no longer have an entitlement to a travel pass because I have a job.  Will he explain in a little more detail how that panned out and how things stand now?</p> <p>  I see in his presentation that he mentioned his experiences in Porto, Paris and Cardiff.  What strikes me is that he was able to roll on with no problem.  Will he give us a little more information and flavour of the things he experienced in those cities, particularly where it contrasts with his experience in this country?</p></speech>

That should be the object of the exercise as a right.</p> <p>  Part of the reason we are doing this exercise is the European directive that requires us to change our habits.  Many of the progressive and positive changes that have happened especially from a social perspective - leaving aside the banking issue -  have come from the European Union.  It has forced us to do things that we should do as a matter of course.  I was a member of the Dublin Transportation Initiative back in the early 1990s.  Essentially, it focused on Dublin and the surrounding counties but we were looking at developing transport policy and the issue of disabilities was very much part of the policy being talked about at that time.  I refer to the visual and audio information on trains and buses, the wheelchair accessible low floor buses and we have bought a lot of stock since then.  I am concerned about the rail service.  Trains last a long time and even if we buy in new trains, some of the carriages from the older trains will not have been designed with low floors and other adaptions for the disabled.  It is a case of moving quickly to a point where one does not have to give notice that one will travel and one can act as an independent person and get on a bus or train.</p> <p>  As I see it, the witnesses must tell us what they want us to do.  They have set out in their statement what is wrong and what needs to be put right.  Some of it will come down to members of the committee making recommendations in the report to be written by the committee.  We should really be putting timelines on it in order that we see the changes happening as quickly as they possibly can.  If there are points that are not covered already in respect of things that can be done in the short or medium term, it would be useful to hear them.</p> <p>  There is no doubt that there have been changes since the issue started to be considered.  I do not think that really happened in any serious way until the 1990s but we have not embedded it into the thinking of people, when we are buying rolling stock or are designing stations, to automatically consider what is needed.  I think the new stations are different but retrofitting the older stations is a bigger issue.  I understand the directive mainly deals with rail transport but obviously taxis and buses are critical to many as well.</p> <p>  If the witnesses have any requests, in addition to the points raised in the opening statement, as well as timelines or changes that would be practical, it would be useful to hear them.  It is the practical changes that will make a difference, as well as the change in culture.</p></speech>

They used to state, &quot;The lift at such and such a station is out of order&quot;.  It was Mr. Kenny's considered opinion that this was negative publicity, so such information was removed from the boards.  I would much rather know I can get off at a certain station than have an article in the <i>Irish Independent</i>because the former would be much better than being splashed all over the <i>Irish Independent</i>.  That is how that information was portrayed and that is why it has been taken down.<br/><br/>Regarding the mobile ramps, in theory it would be helpful if someone who is trained could be present at stations.  The other issue Irish Rail now faces with the de-manning of stations is that it must lock the ramps into position because in certain stations there is antisocial behaviour and the ramps were being thrown down onto the tracks.  Therefore, one needs a carriage key to open the ramp.  In theory, the presence of trained people at stations is a good idea, but in practice I do not know whether it would work because the ramps need to be locked for safety concerns.  If a ramp falls on the track, it stops the DART moving.  It is a question of whether Irish Rail can do this and provide insurance for someone else to do it.  However, why should an ordinary member of the public have to do a job that people in Irish Rail are paid to do?  That is what they are there for.  What I find interesting is that in Irish Rail's annual report in 2016, in one of the first lines on page 1, it was stated the company was looking to improve services for all its passengers.  I would ask for which section of passengers it is looking to improve services.  It is not improving services for people with disabilities.<br/><br/>In relation to-----</p></speech>

In his experience, are there ramps that, like the steps on a Ryanair plane, are embedded in the trains and automatically deploy?  Is that a scenario?</p></speech>

If I go to Seapoint on an eight-carriage DART, I must be in the third carriage.  If I go to Dalkey on a six-carriage DART, I must be in the fourth carriage.  It literally depends which station one is going to, and the automated ramps must be on the carriage behind the driver because he or she will have to see the ramp going down and going up.  Tara Street and Connolly stations are on bends, so the driver cannot see past the fourth carriage.  Therefore, infrastructure-wise, automated ramps will not work in every station.  Irish Rail piloted this before about ten years ago, wasted an awful lot of money and then realised, if it wanted automated ramps, it would have to rebuild some of the infrastructure, which would be too expensive.</p></speech>

They did not tell me I still have a wheelchair under my backside.  It is one of the points I have raised, that perhaps the system needs to be looked at in general because, while I know we are at full employment for most of the population, there is a gap in respect of people with disabilities.  Things may be rescinded if they get a job.  Fundamentally, how we improve the system to help people gain employment is something else that needs to be looked at.  I look at it this way:  If I were claiming social welfare and had a medical card, I would cost the State a lot more money.  In the grand scheme of things, my travel pass is a minimal expense compared with what it would be if I were in receipt in social welfare.  I know the Minister, Deputy Ross, was to write to Irish Rail to seek clarity on the incident.  I have not communicated fully with Irish Rail because the Minister was dealing with the matter last week so I am not 100% sure of the outcome or whether he has got a response from Irish Rail.  Perhaps the committee will be able to find out that from him later today.</p></speech>

I have one question about the point Mr. Moran made that because he found employment, he automatically lost his entitlement to an allowance or travel subsidy or free travel.  Some social welfare entitlements, notwithstanding the fact that someone goes back to work, continue for a period of time thereafter.  In other words, as part of the transition of going back to work, one keeps that entitlement for a year or two years so that one has opportunities.  Mr. Moran now has more income but also more expenses.  He is travelling more, is doing more things and is more mobile.  He also has extra costs associated with his work, given his disability.  He might have to take more taxis, for example.  Perhaps it would be helpful if he did not lose the basic right to transport.</p></speech>

The travel subsidy is linked to the disability allowance.  There is no provision to link it to the long-term illness scheme.  I get the argument that a bad back is a long-term illness.  However, a proviso or provision could be introduced to the effect that if it is a primary physical disability, or if one looks at it on a case-by-case basis, it can be put into that system.  However, because form A says this, it cannot change.  In certain circumstances, when one is trying to access services with a disability, the system does not allow itself to be bent.  It is either box A or box B, and if it is neither of them, then good look to the person.</p></speech>

With something like that, Mr. Moran would not be placed in the invidious position of being afraid to use transport because these people are waiting to grab him.  It is entirely inappropriate, improper and unacceptable that he had that experience.</p></speech>

I have asthma and require a brown and a blue inhaler.  Since I am now in the long-term illness book, I do not have a medical card and because asthma is not considered a cerebral palsy-related condition, my inhalers cannot be covered by the book.  The book says "No".  This does not necessarily mean I do not have asthma.  That is just to the give the committee an example of a system that, because the book says this, it cannot bend to incorporate something.</p></speech>

I am very grateful for this timely opportunity to address the committee on the issue of accessibility of public transport for people with disabilities.  As the members may know, fighting for improved accessibility of public transport has been a key priority of mine since becoming Minister.  In recent years, progress on this issue has been made but it has been unacceptably slow.</p> <p>  I will start by listing the steps that have been taken in recent times to improve the lives of people with disabilities who use public transport.  Accessibility features, such as wheelchair access and audio-visual aids, are built into all new public transport infrastructure projects and vehicles from the design stage.  Newer systems, such as Luas, are fully accessible.  Of the 143 rail stations on the Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann network, 84 are now accessible.  Since 2007, some 17 rail stations have been built to accessibility standards.  Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann city fleets are 100% wheelchair-accessible, as is approximately 80% of the Bus &Eacute;ireann coach fleet.  This will increase as the coach fleet is replaced.  Under the rural transport programme, 69% of service trips are defined as either fully or partially accessible. </p> <p>  On board audio and visual next-stop announcements are available on all of the Dublin Bus fleet.  All of the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet has the capability to annunciate automatic audible next-stop announcements, and all additions to the fleet since 2015 have been fitted with multimedia screens that show route progress and stop information.  All Dublin Bus stops and Bus &Eacute;ireann stops in regional cities are wheelchair accessible.  The upgrading of regional and rural bus and coach stops to make them accessible is being rolled out on a route-by-route basis, beginning in Donegal.  The taxi wheelchair accessible vehicle, WAV, grant scheme, in operation since 2014, helped to increase the number of WAVs in the fleet from 3% to 7.6% at end 2017.  A target of 10% has been set for 2020.  Other measures in place to assist people with disabilities using public transport include the travel assistance scheme, demand-responsive transport under the rural transport programme, the provision of real-time passenger information on the Internet, by app and electronic displays at bus stops, and improved functionality and availability of the Leap card. </p> <p>  The list may sound impressive but it is not enough.  Funding in itself is not the full answer.  Making the journeys of passengers with disabilities more comfortable and stress free is a completely different matter.  Understanding the difficulties and challenges that face people with disabilities who need to use public transport seems beyond the imagination of the able-bodied.  This is not good enough.</p> <p>  Since becoming a Minister, I have been particularly struck by the personal experiences related to me in my meetings with people with disabilities who use public transport.  They make the case that the current improvements are inadequate.  There is a convincing consistency to their stories.  The improvements made may look impressive on paper but when put into practice, they fall short of providing full access for people with disabilities.  Examples of this are where there are accessible buses but bus stops are not accessible, and the interface between accessible rail infrastructure and accessible trains where a ramp is required between the platform and the carriage.</p> <p>  I wish to respond to Ms Alannah Murray, Mr. Padraic Moran and others who made submissions today and in this past to this committee.  I, too, have observed and been frustrated by the slow progress of Government strategies and action plans.  The most appropriate expert voice for the views and difficulties of the disabled is not that of able-bodied politicians or semi-State company directors; it is their own.  The most appropriate place for them to express these views is not only in the media or at meetings of these committees, but in the boardroom.  Disabled people need a place at the table, the place where the decisions that affect them are made.</p> <p>  As a result of wide consultation with members of the disability community and with disability bodies striving to make an impact, I have decided that no public transport company in my Department shall in future function without a minimum of one board member who has personal knowledge and experience of the needs and difficulties of people with disabilities using public transport.  Well-meaning board members offering sympathy to those with disabilities are self-evidently less able to make practical and informed decisions than those who overcome the physical obstacles daily.  It is easy for financial experts to calculate the figures and allocate funds for more accessible buses and trains, but ensuring those funds make a difference where it matters is much more challenging.</p> <p>  The process to include those with raw personal experience of disability on public transport on the boards will begin today.  First to be advertised will be the National Transport Authority, whose role and responsibility for public transport is immense.  I look forward to appointing a new director to this board in the coming months.</p><p>These will be swiftly followed by CI&Eacute;, Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann, Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann.<br/><br/>Meanwhile our work goes on.  While it is now clear we need those with practical experience at the decision-making table, we also need an increase in funding if we are going to deliver further results.  I am pleased to report that I secured a trebling of the funding provided for the accessibility retrofit programme as part of the four year capital envelope for public transport announced in budget 2018.  An amount of almost &euro;28 million is being made available for accessibility upgrades for existing older infrastructure in the period 2018 to 2021.  I intend to improve upon that in our national development plan, NDP, over the next ten years and beyond.  Investment in public transport will be accelerated under the NDP to support the development of an integrated and sustainable national public transport system.  A number of key new major public transport programmes are being considered under the NDP over the period to 2027.  As with all new and recently developed public transport projects, these programmes will be fully accessible as part of the normal design.  Under the NDP, there will also be a continued investment programme to fund retrofitting of older existing public transport facilities to enhance accessibility.  It goes without saying that public transport operators as the providers of the services will continue to be central to how services are delivered and accessed by people with disabilities.<br/><br/>The Department&rsquo;s sectoral plan under the Disability Act 2005 is called &ldquo;Transport Access for All&rdquo;.<b></b>This concept is predicated on the principle of universal access to public transport which does not distinguish between people with disabilities and other passengers.  At the whole of Government level, the National Disability Inclusion Strategy 2017 to 2021, NDIS, launched in July 2017 by my colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is aimed at improving the lives of people with disabilities.  Implementation of the NDIS is being overseen by the NDIS steering group on which my Department is represented.  The comprehensive employment strategy, CES, for people with disabilities sets out a ten-year approach to ensuring that people with disabilities, who are able to and want to work are supported and enabled to do so.  Both my Department and the National Transport Authority, NTA, are represented on the CES implementation group.  Between the two strategies, there are 19 public<b></b>transport related actions for which my Department, the NTA and-or public transport operators have lead responsibility for implementing and to which we are wholly committed.<br/><br/>There are also a number of other Government strategies and plans which include accessible public transport actions and commitments.  My Department is in the process of consolidating all of the actions and commitments into one document, which will form the basis of the work programme for my Department&rsquo;s accessibility consultative committee.  Its role is to monitor and review progress on the implementation of their respective actions under the NDIS.  Membership of my Department&rsquo;s consultative committee is drawn from organisations representing people with disabilities, members of the disability stakeholders group, key agencies under the aegis of the Department, as well as other relevant State agencies.  At Department level, the consultative committee will not only monitor the NDIS actions, but will use the consolidated actions document to monitor all the accessible public transport actions in the other Government strategies and plans for which my Department, the NTA and-or public transport operators have the lead role.<br/><br/>While progress has been made on improving the accessibility of our public transport system, I am keenly aware that people with disabilities continue to face difficulties when they want and need to use public transport to carry out their normal daily duties and activities.  Last week, Irish Rail announced a reduction in the notice period required for all DART users requiring assistance from 24 hours to four hours.  While I absolutely acknowledge that this falls short of my Department&rsquo;s commitment to access for all, it is a further step in the right direction.<br/><br/>Such difficulties were well articulated by those with lived experience of disabilities and those representing them, at the committee&rsquo;s hearing on 13 December last.  I have also held a number of meetings since taking office with a range of groups representing people with disabilities and also with individuals who have outlined to me, in stark terms, the obstacles they experience in every day life in accessing public transport.  People such as Padraic Moran, who is in the Visitors Gallery and who appeared before the committee this morning, Sean O&rsquo;Kelly, representatives of the Irish Wheelchair Association, IWA,  the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, the Disability Federation of Ireland, DFI, Members of both Houses and, in particular, the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, who I see every day, and Senator John Dolan, who I have met many times on this issue, have all helped to inform my view that we must do more.  That is why more has to be done to address the issues raised by them.<br/><br/>Not all of the challenges which people with disabilities face when using public transport are about infrastructure or facilities.  Some are about changing attitudes and improving the understanding of the needs of people with disabilities.  For example, last October I was pleased to launch the &ldquo;Please don&rsquo;t buggy in the wheelchair zone&rdquo; which highlighted the importance of the dedicated wheelchair space on all Dublin buses. <br/><br/>The transport operators and the NTA outlined at the earlier hearings plans for further measures to improve accessibility.  They will soon be joined on their boards by disability activists, as a result of a decision which I announced today.  I will be watching closely these developments to see if they are delivering for people with disabilities, as I trust the members will be too.  I am sure this development will improve the position for people with disabilities using public transport but they will also be representative of all users and will bring great talents to the boards and they will also bring an insight which no one else shares with them.  I look forward to further engagement with the committee on this important issue in the months and years ahead.</p></speech>

Before I call the members in the rotation which we normally agree, one important issue was raised today by Padraic Moran, who met the Minister last week.  A key point he made was that he has requested on at least three separate occasions to meet the chief executive of Irish Rail to make a significant contribution outlining his experiences and how he has been dealt with.  He further elaborated here today that there are many issues about which he has serious concerns.  Will the Minister use his good offices - we will also be using ours and we will write separately on this - to ask the chief executive to meet with Mr. Moran urgently to discuss these issues.</p> <p>  Our two witnesses today starkly and clearly outlined their concerns and the members might also like to comment on this.  A lady who has a disability has been let down by a State provider 20 times.  It is an appalling, disgraceful and a shameful situation and no fine words will paper over the lack of commitment to provide a place for a person who has notified a transport provider they intend to use its transport.  This lady gave not 24 hours notice but 48 hours notice, but there was not a place for her.  There should be a requirement on a transport provider when it is notified, notwithstanding the fact that people should not have to do this at all, to provide wheelchair accessible transport for that person to travel to where they wish to go if the provider fails to provide a space on public transport for them.  That is very important and the Minister might comment on that. </p> <p>  Where a transport user who has a disability wishes to board a bus at a particular location - as we were told, this lady could not board a bus in Virginia and had to get her father to drive her to Cavan -  there should be an obligation on the transport provider that if a transport user designates the nearest point to them and it is not accessible, the transport provider would provide proper and appropriate transport to the first available location nearest to where the transport user lives where it can be provided.  This is a denial of fundamental human rights.  I accept and acknowledge the Minister's commitment in that area, but it angers me that we have all this fine talk but we do not have the fine action that is needed.  We have transport companies which are treating people with contempt.  I call Senator O'Mahony to be followed by Senator Feighan.</p></speech>

He raised similar issues, some of which were identical to the ones he raised this morning.  I have absolutely no reason whatsoever to doubt what he said.  He is a person of great courage and good faith.  I have asked my officials to meet Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann on all those issues immediately.</p><p>I believe the meeting will be tomorrow.  The matters will be addressed as quickly as possible, as they are genuine and meaningful.  It is absolutely wrong that there should be any lack of contact between people with disability and boards of management.  If that is the only link we have, we will have to ask them to improve it.  There should not be a brick wall between those people with disability and the management of the company.  They have really good reason for complaint.</p><p> I listened to what was said this morning, including Ms Murray's comments, and that is precisely why I am ensuring people with disability experiences are put on these boards.  I am not saying he necessarily would come through a process but if Mr. Moran or people like him applied and came through the process, they could bang the board table and say what is happening.  It would be absolutely direct access between those who on a daily basis are using the public transport and the chief executive who makes the decisions.  That is my broad response.  We will put in people with this experience and they will bang the table.  The comments are correct and I worry about the disconnect between those people referred to by members and the people at the top.  It is still there, and that is what we are trying to remedy.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for his presentation, being frank and acknowledging the need for more funding.  He also acknowledged the frustration he feels as a result of the slow progress being made.  The committee is frustrated as well but how small is that in comparison with the people trying to access the system?  That is key.  We need solutions.  I acknowledge and applaud the Minister's announcement of his desire to put people with disabilities on boards.  As he said, that is where the decisions are made and it is a solution.</p> <p>  A matter was raised earlier, and it is the individual cases that nail home this issue.  Ms Murray described crawling onto a bus in Virginia, so the rural and urban divide was covered in this respect.  Would the Minister be prepared at some stage to make an unannounced journey along with either Ms Murray or Mr. Moran?  They kept articulating an issue with the system so would the Minister experience it for himself along with them?  There were helpful individuals along the way.  When the Minister responsible for transport is making the trip, perhaps some extra effort would be made.  I do not know.  It would be a real signal on the part of the Minister and the Government to state this will stop and that the Minister wished to experience these issues personally.  We heard the words this morning but the Minister could go on the journey to experience the frustrations and difficulties these people have.  While the Minister has a busy schedule, if he could do that at some stage, it would mean a huge amount to the people experiencing difficulty.</p></speech>

I understand these are being taken seriously but it is embarrassing to find those personal stories have be relayed on so many occasions.  Reading the report indicates much has been done but there are remaining issues.  I welcome that there will be no public transport company department without a minimum of one board member with personal knowledge and experience of the needs and difficulties of disabled people.  I very much welcome that and this process should be enhanced.  We have been here since 9 a.m. talking about this but these matters are very important.  It has been an experience for us to listen to those testimonies.  Sometimes, as politicians, we do not hear enough people complaining.</p> <p>  In yesterday's edition of the local newspaper, I read that unless &euro;460 million is allocated, the bulk of the rail network faces closure.  This would affect the rail lines to the west and north west, including those in counties Roscommon, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim and Donegal.  Does the Minister have any views or will he comment on the story?</p></speech>

The Department agreed to release information in this respect.  I appreciate it is a very important question but I ask that we deal with it later and we deal with it separately from disability matters.  That is not to take from the Senator's question at all.  Perhaps the Minister will address it when we have dealt with disability matters.  I want to try to keep this meeting structured towards disability issues, if that is okay.  We can have an answer to the question but we will stick to disability issues first.  Some members wanted me to facilitate the debate on disability matters first before moving on if there are other issues.  That is not a problem but I want to keep a structure.</p></speech>

He has undoubtedly seen the proceedings over the past number of weeks after the committee took the decision to invite various advocacy groups, representatives and some service users to share their experience in using public transport.  The committee did this after being contacted by a lady alarmed by the celebratory tone she noted in the news that the service was going from requiring 24 hours' notice to four hours' notice on the DART.  We took a collective decision to tackle this as a committee.  It is important that we have done this work.</p> <p>  I asked Ms Murray what she would say if she could ask the Minister a question.  She said she would ask why he failed to turn up at the initiation of the DART service requiring four hours' notice.  Was he consulted about the launch and if so, did he ever indicate he was in a position to attend it?  I welcome the Minister's announcement that he will appoint people of varying abilities to the State boards.  It is a positive development but one would wonder why the announcement was not made in November 2016, when the Minister started a review on who was to be appointed to State boards.  Perhaps I am wrong.</p><p>In November 2016, the Minister indicated a change in appointments to State boards.  Has anybody been appointed since the procedure changed?  Has anybody with disability issues been appointed to the board of a public transport company?  We heard from Mr. Padraic Moran today about a case of a cart going before a horse.  He was part of the consultation committee for the creation and establishment of the app.  It was launched two weeks ago and he is being brought in next week to test whether it works.  It seems farcical to launch an app without having conducted a test on it.</p><p> The Minister says there has been unacceptably slow progress in recent years.  Has he, since becoming Minister, ring-fenced a certain percentage of his annual budget to accelerate that progress and make more public transport vehicles more accessible?  Has he increased and ring-fenced the budget and, if so, what is the percentage?  He says that Dublin Bus and Bus &Eacute;ireann city fleets are 100% wheelchair-accessible.  That is very positive and welcome.  What percentage of bus stops are wheelchair-accessible to enable people to get on and off the bus?  It is good if the bus can accommodate a wheelchair but it is problematic if one cannot get the wheelchair on.  We learned from a witness about where a person had to be carried out of his or her wheelchair, held by shoulders and legs, out of the wheelchair, onto the bus, and back into the wheelchair.  What percentage of bus stops are wheelchair-accessible?  A large chunk of our routes are tendered out and even more recently, with the change in timetables and rostering in Bus &Eacute;ireann, a large percentage of private operators are contracted to provide the service.  Is there any requirement for private contractors to have wheelchair-accessible buses to qualify for a State contract?  Some 3% of all public bodies should have people with a disability employed.  Will the Minister confirm that the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, as well as the various agencies under his remit meet that 3% target?</p><p> Mr. Padraic Moran raised a matter today which was raised by another person previously and I have experienced it in my own constituency.  While the travel pass is administered through the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, it is something in which the Minister might get involved.  The travel pass is available to somebody who has a disability pension from the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection.  Somebody might be doing part-time work or be retired on sick grounds with a small occupational pension.  I know a person in Mullingar who has an occupational pension, which is the same as what he would receive as a disability pension but, because it is an occupational pension, he is disqualified from availing of a free travel pass.  He cannot drive.  There should be consideration to introducing medical need where the free travel pass is concerned and I would welcome the Minister's opinion on that.</p><p> The Minister spoke about a whole-of-Government approach to dealing with people with disabilities.  While we are speaking specifically about public transport today, what about the parts of the country where there is no public transport, no buses, no trains, no DART and no Luas?  The motorised transport grant was abolished for new entrants in February 2013.  It is now February 2018, five years later, and that has been closed to new applicants.  I would appreciate if the Minister could update us today about when he envisages that the Government will launch that scheme again.</p><p> He spoke last year about launching a campaign for people who park in parking bays for people with disabilities.  It is a welcome initiative.  A witness who came before the committee spoke about the number of people who placed their shopping, buggies and luggage in the disabled space on Dublin Bus.  Are there any penalties in place?  If not, would he consider introducing penalties for people who park in a disabled car space or who use the disabled space on Dublin Bus services for holding something that should not be there?</p><p> I have two final points and thank the Chairman for his indulgence.  The Minister confirmed today that the National Disability Inclusion Strategy, 2017-2021 contains 19 targets for his Department.  Has any one of those 19 targets been fully implemented?  Of those 19 targets, is there a clear timeframe as to when they will be implemented so that we can actually adjudicate that progress has been made over the four years of the plan?  It would appear, from the witnesses at the committee over the last weeks, that there is a particular problem with Irish Rail in helping and assisting people with reduced mobility or varying levels of ability.  I do not want to tar everybody working in Irish Rail with the one brush and Mr. Padraic Moran stated he has telephone numbers for certain staff members who are more than helpful and accommodating, which should be acknowledged.  What are the consequences when somebody turns up and is not accommodated?  They may not have reached the 24-hour target and in some cases we heard of someone giving 48 hours' notice and the target not being reached.  Now that the four hour target is in place, what is the consequence if that is not achieved?  Will somebody be held responsible for not carrying out his or her job?  When do we expect to be in a position where one does not have to give any notice to travel on public transport?  We are talking about the implementation and ratification of the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Surely we should be working towards a system where no notice is required for someone availing of public transport?</p></speech>

My colleague has covered most of the topics.  I welcome the report and the Minister's deliberations.  All one can say is that actions speak louder than words.  Improving public transport accessibility is covered under the forthcoming ten-year national development plan, NDP.  Ten years is a long time.  Transport accessibility is covered in the NDP.  Will it be front-loaded?  Otherwise, will there be deficiencies in accessibility in some parts of the country for at least another ten years?  How do we address the overall issue of the implementation of the accessibility plan?  Otherwise, it gives the impression that, under the NDP, there will be ten years where areas of deficiency may not be resolved.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  I have three points or questions.  I will have to leave shortly after I make the point to be in the Chamber.  The first is on the issue of staffing of stations.  I put it to the Minister that one cannot have full accessibility for all without staffing in all stations.  I do not see how it can be done.</p><p>I do not see how one can have genuine equality of access without staffing in all stations.  Rather than moving forward, the experience has been one of moving backwards.  Earlier, an example was given in the form of the DART line where, a number of years ago, there were staff in all stations while now they are at just one in four.  The cuts need to be reversed as doing so will benefit all passengers, not only those with disabilities.</p><p> When we discussed the future of Bus &Eacute;ireann and bus services at the last meeting, the Minister and his officials made the point that there may be situations in the future where Bus &Eacute;ireann does not provide a service but the State intervenes to ensure private companies step in.  I said I was not happy with such a state of affairs and I am opposed to privatisation.  In such a scenario, are the same obligations going to be placed on the private companies to respect people's civil rights, and to take action to make their services fully accessible?  What steps will the Minister take to ensure they do this?</p><p> A report appeared yesterday about what the National Transport Authority was saying about the viability of routes.</p></speech>

There are positives and negatives which we need to consider.  There is an EU directive on accessibility and the main focus of attention is on rail.  Can the Minister tell us what the response from his Department will be to that?  When does it have to respond to the directive?  Is there a timeline for compliance and how is it intended to comply with it?  The EU has been very useful in changing attitudes in Ireland and this is also a useful intervention.</p> <p>  I tabled a parliamentary question which the Minister diverted to Irish Rail and the NTA, both of which replied to me.  In one I was told a strategy would be worked out relating to the future needs for rail, and I am sure the Minister is engaged in the process because it will require capital investment.  Irish Rail told me there would not be any new trains in 2018, 2019 or 2020 because there is a lead-in time from order to delivery.  I assume the specification of the new trains will include disability features - can the Minister confirm that?  Is retrofitting of existing stock included in the &euro;28 million mentioned by the Minister, or is the money for a different use?  How does he see the money being used?  If there has been an audit of retrofitting existing rail stock the Minister might give us some insights into it.  I understand that suburban rail is very different from intercity rail.  We want to be realistic about what may happen.</p> <p>  The National Transport Authority, NTA, was before us and its representatives told us they need to deal with individual local authorities to carry out work to make bus stops accessible.  They focus on particular corridors and routes.  Is there a timeline for this?  Have additional demands been made by the NTA to the Department relating to that particular proposal, and can it be accelerated?  Is any of the &euro;28 million being used for this purpose?</p> <p>  I received a reply from the NTA on foot of a parliamentary question to the Minister relating to the spread of taxis.  People across the country have disabilities and a need for universal access.  The objective is to get from 7.5% to 10% and the concentration is very important.  I understand the Minister cannot target a grand scheme at any particular location but there are parts of the country that are very bad, such as Tipperary where there is one taxi for every 12,000 people while a comparable county, Donegal, has one for every 4,800.  It is not about a urban-rural divide, though Dublin has the highest ratio of accessible taxis.  A more targeted approach is needed in other parts of the country where the take-up is not sufficient.  Is the Department thinking of how this may be achieved?  It might need local engagement with taxi groups or their organisations but there is a problem.</p> <p>  On the Bus &Eacute;ireann fleet which has been put out to tender, the NTA told us if a commercial operator won a contract it would have two years to upgrade to an accessible fleet on a particular route.</p></speech>

It is not a like-with-like situation.  I am happy to go back and look at the notes I have.  If I am wrong, I am fine with that.  The one thing we do not want to do is go backwards.  That is the point I want to make.</p> <p>  The response to one of the questions I asked was that there was a pilot study done on retrofitting, which was done up to ten years ago.  Could the Minister dig out that report for us?  If it was costed, what information is there on it?  I presume the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport had sight of it.  </p> <p>  On the rolling stock, we heard that the ramps have to be locked away because of potential anti-social behaviour and the risk of people throwing them onto rail lines.  How is that done without having staffing in stations?  It is difficult to marry the two.  </p> <p>  The Minister told us in his opening statement that the Department is doing a report which is amalgamating a lot of reports.  I think that is useful.  It is better that we are working to one document so we can measure outcomes.  When is the Department likely to complete that report?  Will he make it public?  </p> <p>  One of the questions we have been asking on the public information campaign on the buggy and wheelchair space, is whether it is a question of empowering bus drivers or of changing the culture of the public?  I would like to hear the Minister's views on that. </p></speech>

I agree with the Senator that it is inadequate.  The stories he is hearing prove it is inadequate.  The stories are not just anecdotes from malcontents; they are from genuine people who are coming forward with difficulties and drawing attention to the frequency of the issues.  The intelligence of those concerned and the fact they are articulating so well is absolutely compelling evidence that this is going on.  What is coming from the top down is not adequate.  That is what we are trying to address.  We are unanimous on that.  The Senator asked if I would be prepared to go on a journey with Padraic or Alannah or someone who is having constant difficulties and the answer is of course I would.  I would be absolutely delighted.  I might have to put on a beard and a hairpiece to do it.</p></speech>

I will come to Deputy Troy's questions.  I apologise if anybody seemed to be celebrating too much about the 24-4 pilot.  That was not the intention.  There is a distinction between celebrating and announcing something to the public.  It was a breakthrough but it was not enough.  There was no suggestion at that stage that it was in any way a final outcome.  It was to let the public and everybody who is suffering a disability know there was going to be a change from 24 hours notice to four hours notice but also that it was a pilot scheme.  The important thing is it is a pilot scheme on the DART.  People should know it is being addressed.  There should be information that is being addressed and that they can use it.  The important thing about the 24-4 is that there is feedback during and afterwards about how it is working.  This is not the final outcome.  As somebody else said, it is not enough.  It was certainly announced and it was given a huge amount of publicity, which was positive, but the important thing is that people knew about it so the pilot worked.  As a result of conversations I had with at least three disability groups recently, we will ask Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann to report on how that pilot is going so we can get the information and release it so people know what is actually happening.  It should not be stored up and kept secret in the vaults of Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.  It has to be taken in so that people can see it including those who have contributed to it.  We should go ahead on that basis.</p> <p>  The State boards-----</p></speech>

What happened was I had an 8.30 a.m. appointment in south Dublin, which is a longstanding appointment, that goes on until after 9.30 a.m.  I had an appointment at 11 o'clock in Dublin in my Department which could not be moved.  I was very sorry to miss the event.  That particular event was starting at 10 a.m. and involved a trip out to Howth and returning later.  I just could not keep all three of those appointments.</p></speech>

I am very sorry if they took offence.  It meant cancelling two appointments or one.  That was what happened.  I have been more than willing to meet anybody on this issue at any time and do anything to promote the interests of people with disabilities.  It would not be fair to take offence.  I have gone outside to meet people whenever any Member of the Oireachtas has asked me.  I was delighted to do so.</p><p>I do not believe there is any question of bona fides there.</p><p> On the issue of State boards, Deputy Troy asked if I could have done it a year ago.  Yes I could have, absolutely, but it is part of a policy generally which I am introducing into my Department to change the whole way that appointments are made to State boards and the type of people who sit on State boards.  The Deputy will be aware that I put two people on to the Road Safety Authority who had gone through all the processes; it is not about me appointing them at all, I just make the final appointment.  These two people were involved with road victims groups and had suffered tragically, but they have something unique to offer which was not there before.  I want to do similar actions with other State boards, but it is a gradual process.  This is part of the process.  I want to make sure the users of the product, in this case the vehicles, are banging the table at the boards and in particular people who are vulnerable.  This is a really appropriate type of procedure.  It may mean that some people on State boards do not feel very comfortable.  Good.  I am delighted to hear that.  </p></speech>

There are gaps and this is the reason we are advertising for the National Transport Authority, NTA, now.  This vacancy and those on other boards will be filled in this way and by these types of people very shortly.  Do not hold me to this, but by the end of the year they should probably all be filled.  The Deputy is quite right.  It is just part of a gradual change.  Everybody who goes through this process goes through the Public Appointments Service procedures and will then be interviewed.  It is much stricter than any other Department.  A name will then come up to me for appointment.  I believe this will be a very worthy experiment, which I suspect and hope will be permanent.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to the application and I will ask my officials to address this tomorrow.

God, I thought I was getting off easy there but the Deputy is quite right.  I have the list here.  On the ring-fencing of the &euro;28 million we have enormously expanded and increased the amount of money being allotted to people with disabilities in recent years.  The &euro;28 million is actually trebling the amount.  I have seen a lot of cases where ring-fencing suddenly becomes a minimum rather than the maximum.  We could do it but currently we are increasing the spending, especially on retrofitting, at an extraordinary rate, which is unprecedented.  A sum of &euro;28 million over four years is a lot of money.  This is going mostly to infrastructure and retrofitting.   On top of this is an ongoing programme.  This means that all those funds will be spent on retrofitting, going back on things that went wrong in the past.</p></speech>

Can the committee also get a rough idea of how the case that was made?  If the Minister argued for the money he must have had a case and the Department must have audited the needs.  I welcome that fact that the money will be there.  We are not having a row about it but we do need to know what we require to get up to a point where we have universal accessibility.  Why would we reinvent the wheel in duplicating the work that has already been done?  It would be very useful to know what the Minister looked for, what he got, what still has to be done and roughly how much is to be spent in each category.</p></speech>

The Minister can articulate with his Cabinet colleague that there needs to be a review and that account needs to be taken of a person's ability.  If a person is unable to drive, has reduced mobility and public transport is his or her only way to travel then we should support them with a free travel pass, especially when in some cases the person is of limited means.  Eligibility for this free pass as currently established is that a person must be over a certain age - even if he or she has no issue with travel or has a car and never uses it - or a person must be of limited means and maybe, in some instances, not able to use the travel pass.  This is an opportunity where the State could provide and make a real difference to persons who are of limited mobility if they could qualify for a travel pass, and this may form part of our report.</p><p>That is all I am saying.  I ask the Minister to take it up with his colleague.</p></speech>

I hope to be able to report something to the Deputy about it soon.  One should not think it has been neglected.  It has not.  Sometimes such minor matters can run into difficulties with lawyers and others, but it is progressing.  It will be finalised soon.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the UN.  The UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is tremendously good news.  It certainly requires complete disability access in transport on an equal basis with others.  We probably also should point out that there is a broad approach that if there is practical progress on public transport accessibility we are within the requirements of that particular convention.  We are not there yet but we are making progress.  My guess is that we certainly meet the second requirement, which is Article 4.2, that we are making progress towards that and there is a genuine effort being made.</p> <p>  I do not want to deal with Deputy Barry's questions if he is not here.</p></speech>

That is fine.</p> <p>  Deputy Barry was next.  On the staffing of stations, the Deputy stated all stations have to be staffed.  I understand the point.  I am not sure that the Deputy is correct.  That is why we have this pilot on the DART.  The pilot will hopefully come up with the answer to the Deputy's question on whether hubs are effective.  At present, there are only two stations, maybe three, which are completely unmanned.  There are 13 which are manned permanently and 15 which are partially manned.  The purpose of that pilot is to answer its question.  That is why we want to be really transparent about it.  If the answer comes up that this is not working, we will have to face it.  Let us give the pilot a chance.  It should throw up the difficulties, if there are some.  If there are three unmanned and 15 partially manned, it should reveal whether that is adequate.  That is why we are doing it.  I would ask Deputy Barry for a little patience on this.  We will be straight about it.  We will see if it is working or if it is not.  The objective is that eventually those with a disability should be able to travel in exactly equal circumstances and with equal ease as anybody else.  That is it.  If we can do it by having stations which are unstaffed that is fine but if we cannot, we will have to find a better solution.</p> <p>  On the InterCity trains, there will be customer service officers.  Those are coming in now.  They will not need a pilot as such.  There will be customer service officers on those permanently this year; they will be on every train and they will be able to help passengers on and off the trains.  I hope it will not be necessary to have a pilot there and that they will be adequately catered for.</p> <p>  On the issue Deputy Barry raised about private companies stepping in, if they are operating PSO services they must operate accessible buses.  That is simple.  The role of private companies in the transport sector is not a noble one in terms of accessibility.  It is not satisfactory and it is one we have to address.  There is no point in beating about the bush and saying that they are stepping up to the plate; they are not.  It is not acceptable that private companies should not conform.  I am aware there are market reasons and people are worried that they might not be interested in the routes but we will have to devise a means whereby they do so and that they have buses which are-----</p></speech>

Maybe the additional cost of meeting disability needs could be looked at by the Minister.  I am not saying that is the way to do it but that might be one way where there is support for a company, as there is support for the State companies.  I would not discriminate against any passenger by not having the same support if we can but it is a matter for assessment.  In that regard, what happens in other jurisdictions would be important.  Otherwise they cannot compete.</p></speech>

It is what they call a high-floor bus.  The problem is it is difficult for those with a disability to get in and out of such buses.  There are also mismatches - some referred to it - between the pavements and the bus stops.  The NTA is addressing this problem by looking at smaller short-distance buses for 50 km journeys.  They should be able to address part of that problem.  They may in the future be able to require that private companies as well as public companies use those buses.  There must be uniformity here.</p> <p>  My note states the NTA proposes to move to regulate the accessibility of the public transport services operated by commercial operators.  The NTA has stated that it will publish its proposals in this area later this year which will set out minimal accepted accessibility standards for fleets operating public transport services for new licences and on renewal of existing licences.  We will not continue the kind of regime whereby they do not have to conform in a way which is acceptable.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised the EU directive on accessibility.

I will get more detail on this issue for the Deputy.  However, I am told that the Department of Justice and Equality is the lead Department and we are feeding into its work.  That applies to both the strategies we are talking about, namely, the CES and the NDIS.  The Department of Justice and Equality is leading on the proposed European Accessibility Act.  I will provide more details on what is actually happening there.  It is somewhat subterranean, as far as I am concerned, but I will certainly get that.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about the accessibility of new trains.  All new services, including Bus Connects and Luas trams, will be accessible.  Everything will be accessible.  It is absolutely clear.  In regard to retrofitting, the &euro;28 million I have mentioned will all go towards retrofitting.  It is ring-fenced for this purpose.</p></speech>

In light of all of the points raised by the members, the Minister and others at this meeting, perhaps providing the Minister with advice in this regard is a function of the Department.  Maybe it should be, if there is not already someone who is concentrating on this issue on a full-time basis across all of the service providers.

However, people with disabilities are spread throughout the country and there are very big differences in availability.  I am not saying that there is an easy solution to this, but I wish to draw attention to areas which the Department may not even consider to need taxis.

A comparable county, also of rural make-up, is Donegal.  It has a population of 158,000 and 33 such taxis.  There is a sizeable difference in people's experience depending on where they live.  This is not a comparison between an urban and a rural environment.  It is comparing like with like.  If the Department looks at the list of what is available and tries to create a decent spread across the country.  There may be a small number of counties that need to be cajoled into considering the need for this.  It is all very well to have a 10% target, but if that 10% all goes to urban areas and there is not a decent spread, the people who do not have other modes of transport will probably be worse off.  That is the point I am trying to make.  I understand that a grand scheme is something that people must decide to take up, but it strikes me that there is an imbalance which is worth considering.</p></speech>

However, the NTA stated, I believe when presenting to this committee, that it would address it and devise a viable solution if one could be found.  It is on the agenda.

The greatest assault on disability is to reduce or end a service.  The possible closure of rail lines affects all passengers.  This is a major issue of concern.  The Taoiseach indicated yesterday that there would be no closures on his watch, and that is welcome, as far as it goes.  However, the NTA made it clear that there is a need for an investment of in the region of &euro;466 million in order to make these rail lines genuinely sustainable.  There is no point in keeping ghost or skeleton services going.  They have to be genuine, proper services and that requires a significant investment and a reversal of the cuts we have seen in recent years.  I hope the Minister is in a position to follow up on the comments of the Taoiseach by committing on the money front.</p></speech>

I have said before - and the Taoiseach said it yesterday - that I have absolutely no intention and no plans to close railway lines or routes anywhere and that I have not heard the prospect being discussed.  That is not the objective at all.  If there is an ambition, it is to make routes more efficient and profitable and to add value for the taxpayer and the consumer. What was being carried in that paper yesterday was a reference to a worst-case scenario in the rail review.  I am guessing that was the source of the story.  That was published in 2016.  Much has changed since then.  Many of the cuts which Deputy Barry referred to have been reversed.  The public service obligation, PSO, has been increased, and the commitment to rail is absolute.</p> <p>  There are obviously large problems in the whole public transport sector.  These are the problems we come across on a daily basis.  They are not going to be met with a slash-and-burn response but, rather, the opposite.  Our ambition is to see the railways flourish.  That report reflected the rail review, and then some other documents from after the consultation process which expressed the views of virtually everybody who contributed to that consultation process.  It was not a reflection of any decisions or, to my knowledge, as Minister, any discussions that have taken place among members of the Government.  We do not intend to close any rail lines.</p></speech>

I suggest we talk about this issue at our next meeting and perhaps have a further debate on the matter.</p> <p>  I thank the Minister and his officials for attending.  I also thank Padraic Moran and Alannah Murray from earlier.  This has been a very important meeting.  We might ask that Mr. Moran keeps in touch with the committee as it will be advertising for submissions on its report on its web page.  We will consider submissions and hope to have the report finished some time before Easter if we can.  I want to remind the Minister to not forget Mr. Moran's query regarding Iarnr&oacute;d &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>
