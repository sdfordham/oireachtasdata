I welcome from the European Court of Auditors, Mr. Kevin Cardiff, Mr. Janusz Wojciechowski, members, Mr. Peter Welch, director, and Mr. Tony Murphy, director and member-designate.  I thank them for appearing before the committee today to brief us on two of their special reports, on the EU support to young farmers and on the EU rural development programmes.  They will address the Oireachtas Joint Committee on European Affairs later today and we appreciate their giving of their time to address this committee. </p><p>I understand Mr. Cardiff will complete his term of office soon.  I wish him well on whatever path he takes in the future.  I also welcome to the meeting members of the newly-formed Oireachtas Joint Committee on Rural and Community Development, including its Chairman, Deputy Joe Carey. </p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Cardiff to make his opening remarks. </p></speech>

The two reports the committee has asked us to talk about are special reports on the effectiveness of programmes rather than whether each amount of money was given to the right person at the right time.</p> <p>  In my time on the court this is the first invitation we have received to this committee but some of its predecessors came to us in Luxembourg and were able to see the European Court of Justice and some other European institutions.  I would guess that Mr. Murphy, who will take over from me, will be happy to extend the same invitation if the committee would like that.  I am taking advantage of this being my last session and of the committee's invitation to us to introduce my successor, Mr. Murphy.  He is a former auditor in the Comptroller and Auditor General's office who has worked in the European Commission and the European Court of Auditors.  When the Government was looking for my successor it advertised through an open competition and Mr. Murphy was the successful candidate.  </p> <p>  Mr. Welch is the director in the Court of Auditors who manages the staff and the operation of the area of the court that deals mostly with agriculture.  The specialist on this topic is Mr. Wojciechowski, the Polish member.  He rushed here from Brussels today to allow us take advantage of his expertise.  He is not just the member who carried out these audits, he is a member of the division of the court which looks after agricultural and natural resources issues and is a former Member of the European Parliament, who sat on the agriculture committee of the European Parliament.  He is quite expert and has a sense of what parliamentarians are interested in, as well as what auditors are interested in.  I will leave it to him to introduce the two reports and then we will answer the questions between us. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.9" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Janusz Wojciechowski" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012400002#B00400"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to present our main conclusions.  Our two reports are interesting and important for the debate about the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, in the European Union.  The first report is about the rural development programmes published last November.  Good programming is key to the success and effectiveness of expenditure of the rural development fund.  The fund comprises &euro;100 billion for seven years or almost &euro;15 billion per year.  The direct payment aspect of the CAP accounts for approximately &euro;40 billion per year while the market intervention fund accounts for approximately &euro;4 billion.  The rural development fund is approximately &euro;14 billion.  Altogether that is &euro;58 billion per year.</p> <p>  The main beneficiaries of the rural development fund are France, Italy, Germany and Poland.  Ireland receives approximately 2% of the total amount of approximately &euro;2 billion over seven years.</p><p>The programming process is organised on a national level in the majority of member states but, in some member states, such as France, Germany, Spain and Italy, it is organised on a regional level.  We examined 12 rural development programmes, RDPs, as shown on the map we have presented.  The countries or regions audited included Poland, Romania, Greece, Austria, Campagna in Italy, La Rioja in Spain, and Ireland.</p><p> Our main audit questions were: is the programme focused on performance and reflected in the legislative framework?  Do RDPs have potential contribution to better results?  How was the programming process managed by the European Commission?  The conclusions were that the programmes were too general, too long and complex with the programming process being too lengthy, and they were insufficiently focused on results.  The data relating to the size of the programmes we audited are interesting and members can compare the size of the RDPs during the previous financial period of 2007-13 and the current period of 2014-20.  The average size of the programme in the previous financial period was 459 pages, whereas it is 781 pages for the new financial period.  Ireland is the only member state in which the RDP is not bigger than previously; it was one page shorter.  Our opinion is that the Commission requires too much data and information.  One of our conclusions is that RDPs are interesting for academic debates but they are not useful for farmers.  The process of approval for programmes was lengthy, taking almost one year from the first draft being sent to the Commission to the final approval.  In the Irish case, it was a little shorter but the process lasted almost two years in some member states.</p><p> The next slide outlines the problem we have legislating too late for the RDP.  In the period 2007-13, everything was finished before the first year of the new financial perspective whereas for the period 2014-20, the regulations were adopted by the Commission in 2014.  That was too late and the consequence was the lack of expenditure from the rural development fund, RDF.  In 2010, after four years of the previous financial period, spending was 29%, whereas in the current financial period, it has only reached 21%.  It was good for Ireland because in the previous financial perspective, Ireland was the leader.  RDP spending in Ireland and Luxembourg was higher than 50% and no country or region had spending of less than 15% in 2010.  Currently, we do not have a member state where the spending is higher than 50%.  The two leaders in spending are Finland in first place and Ireland in second place.  I offer congratulations because that is good information.  However, in six member states, the absorption is less than 15%.  This is the consequence of the programming process being too lengthy and being approved too late.</p><p> The next question is concerned with the report which I would like to present relating to the programming of the RDF.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee members, I thank the Chairman for extending an invitation to us to attend to consider the audit reports on rural development programming.  I welcome the witnesses from the ECA.  I wish Mr. Cardiff all the best as his term in office draws to a close.  I congratulate Mr. Tony Murphy on his nomination to the court.  I thank Mr. Janusz Wojciechowski, who has a challenging name, for his presentation.</p> <p>  My committee is new and we had our first meeting on 29 November 2017.  Rural development support is the second pillar of the CAP and my committee is interested in several elements of this policy.  The EU plans to spend almost &euro;100 billion on rural development in the period 2014-20 through the European agricultural fund for rural development.  Ireland plans to spend &euro;4 billion of public money on the RDP during this period.  Given the expenditure involved and its importance in supporting a vital part of our economy, I welcome the report's conclusions and recommendations and the focus on performance and results.  However, no one can foresee the future.  There are plenty of potential shocks such as Brexit and the recent threats to international trade and the effects of climate change.  How would the witnesses evaluate Ireland's performance when compared with that of other member states?  What were the main lessons learned in terms of performance and the process for Pillar 2 of the CAP?  Overall, how satisfied are they with the RDP?</p></speech>

In this report, our evaluation of the Irish RDP is positive.  We have a big problem with the delay in the RDPs but in Ireland the progress of absorption is among the best in the EU.  Perhaps more information about our evaluation of Ireland will be found in the next report about young farmers.  We have two big problems in the EU - one is the reduction in the number of farms and the second is the reduction in the land available for farming.</p><p>In Ireland, fortunately, the situation is better; it is not the same as in the rest of Europe.  We can observe positive results of the Common Agricultural Policy in Ireland.  The country has good arguments for the spending of money and it is generally okay.  There was no objection to the Irish rural development programme which had been designed especially for Irish farmers.  Perhaps there might be more about it in the next report.</p></speech>

I am from east Galway, an area that has seen an increase in the number of people leaving agriculture.  There is also the fact that young farmers are not coming into it.  That has been verified by the Western Development Commission and gives cause for concern.  The number working in agriculture in the west has dropped by 41% in the past 20 years, which is a stark reminder of where the industry is going in the west.  For young farmers-----</p></speech>

I come from County Donegal in the north west and I am Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson on agriculture.  It is very useful that the delegates have taken the time to come before the committee to make a presentation on their reports and offer us the opportunity to engage with them in that regard.</p> <p>  Into how much detail did the delegates go while examining spending under the rural development programme in individual countries, in particular Ireland, under the various schemes in place?  They may have done so, but if they did not, will they comment on the effectiveness of the schemes?  I am interested in hearing about that matter.</p> <p>  The overall point made in the report is that in the previous CAP programme delivery period the schemes became more bureaucratic and more difficult to deliver.  That is also our experience domestically.  The feedback on changes to the Leader programme which has been a strong driver of rural development is that it is now more bureaucratic, which makes it more difficult to deliver.  The experience of those applying under it and the ability of those at local level to direct it are reduced as there is more red tape.  This has contributed to it being much slower in getting off the ground and it has also impacted on its effectiveness.</p> <p>  I am interested in hearing the views of the delegates from the European Court of Auditors on agricultural schemes.  In this country we are much better at making payments than many of our European colleagues, but there has been an ongoing problem in making payments following on from farmers taking action on various schemes and as a result of funding often being withheld pending the resolution of issues.  For example, if an issue arises on a particular scheme, for example, the GLAS environmental scheme, farmers will not be paid until everything is resolved.  That goes back to the requirements to be met at European level in making payments, rightly so, as I accept that the money must be accounted for.  However, there is a view that there could be more flexibility because of the fact that in many cases the programmes are of five years duration.  The funding could be paid because in the unfortunate event that money has to be recouped there are the means to so do.  Because of the approach taken many farmers who have spent money, made an impact and delivered the programme are left waiting unnecessarily for funds at the end of the process.  I am interested in hearing the view of the delegates on the issue and whether providing for more flexibility is possible in how the schemes are administered.</p> <p>  I am also interested in hearing feedback on the communiqu&eacute; published by Commissioner Hogan on the next CAP programme and his proposals.  There are discussions on providing for more subsidiarity.  Do the delegates believe the communiqu&eacute; takes into account the findings they have made in their report on rural development?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Janusz Wojciechowski" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012400002#D00600"><p>I thank the Deputy very much for his question.  Yes, he is correct that there is too much bureaucracy, but we did not use that formula.  Before my appointment to the European Court of Auditors, I was, as Mr. Cardiff said, a Member of the European Parliament.  We discussed the issue of simplification at length, but, ultimately we did not reach it.  We have a more bureaucratic Common Agricultural Policy.  We counted the number of pages involved in the 118 rural development programmes and for the Commission there were approximately 100,000.  That involves a lot of bureaucratic work, but it is not useful for the purpose of monitoring expenditure.  In the audit we only covered the programming process, not individual programmes, but there was an audit of the young farmers' scheme, the results of which were very interesting.  We observed that the problems of young farmers were a consequence of a policy that had not been sufficiently oriented towards results.  Money is being spent, but nobody knows what is expected or what should be achieved with it.</p> <p>  We are preparing a briefing paper on Commissioner Hogan's proposals.  Perhaps Mr. Welch might say more about it.  At the end of March we expect to present our position paper based on our reports and the conclusions and recommendations made in previous reports.  The document is being prepared by us.</p> <p>  Yesterday I presented the report on the rural development programme to the agriculture committee of the European Parliament and there was much interest in it.  Everybody knows that simplification of the policy is necessary.  Perhaps the Irish RDP might be a good example.  One could ask that if it was possible to prepare a shorter RDP in Ireland, why was it not possible to do so in Italy, Greece or other member states?  Perhaps there might be good practice in Ireland from which we can learn.</p></speech>

Some Irish MEPs saw it as supporting the Leader programme structure that applied at the time, but as we have never looked at the structure since, we are not in a position to talk about the Irish experience of the Leader programme, in particular.  What we did find at the time was that an important element of the success of the Leader programme was keeping important decision-making functions close to the people who were receiving the funds.  That was not the case for every element, but for some elements local decision-making was better than highly centralised decision-making.</p></speech>

One of my earlier audits was on water policies and the CAP and the ways in which they interacted.  We have looked at the effectiveness of the spend, the reimbursement systems, procurement - pretty much every element.  One aspect of the rural development programmes we find is that one can have too many objectives.  We find this in many different audits.  If one has a single objective for a particular programme, it will probably have some impact.  However, if one says that money may be received by a beneficiary and then one provides a list of several different things, that becomes more of a transfer of money than something that has particular purpose.  At a political level, one might think that the transfer of funds from urban to rural areas or from Europe in general to outlying areas is perfectly correct.  However, from an auditor's point of view, if one examines the effectiveness of the programme, one examines in particular the objectives of that programme and one may say a particular objective was not met.</p> <p>  Regarding RDP issues in general, we often find that things need to be simpler but we often also find, frankly, that the programmes do not deliver on the particular purpose for which they were set up.  I ask the committee to forget the current young farmer's scheme and consider the old young farmer's scheme, for example - the RDP element of it rather than the scheme in general.  One might say that a large number of young farmers receive some funding, but was there a real change in the transfer of farm holdings from older to younger farmers?  We look at the objective that was assigned to the programme.  Other elements, such as the impact on a rural area of the overall amount of funds transferred, can be very important too, but that is not typically what we look at.  Compliance with the RDP is problematic.  It tends to have a higher error rate.  We will talk about this a little later in the day at the other committee.  However, Ireland has no special problems.  When we carry out our overall audit, in a given year there will typically be eight or ten cases in Ireland, sometimes fewer, sometimes more.  We have no special pattern of problems in the Irish cases.  If anything, not in this audit but in the 2015 audit we examined four or five Irish cases and found no errors at all.  These are all positives.  These were probably single payment cases.  There were no particular issues or problems for Ireland.  Generally speaking, the Irish system seems to be well administered.  There were problems a number of years ago with the land parcel identification system, which I know caused trouble then.  We talked about recoupment.  Some problems with recoupment arose, but we have not found those problems more recently.</p></speech>

I have seen a copy of it.</p> <p>  Deputy McConalogue touched on the issue of Leader funding.  We were very proud of the previous model we had in Ireland in that it was rooted in communities, which is a big issue, as the witnesses know, in that it is desirable that European programmes be bottom-up rather than top-down and that the community genuinely feel a sense of ownership.  It was a very good model and it has been changed.  Communities have sought to soften the initial proposals for change, but it is not the same system it was across the board.</p> <p>  The other issue we hear repeatedly from Leader companies across the State is that there are serious delays in getting the funding out.  It is much more bureaucratic than it was.  We had a Leader system which was at the forefront of rural regeneration in Ireland, which was a template, which was the system that would be held up as the poster boy at European level and which was offered to other European states as the way to do things.  What are the witnesses' views on the way we unravelled that and the problems there are with delays in getting the funding into communities?  We now hear of profound delays across the State.  Did this arise in the witnesses' research?</p></speech>

We are supposed to audit approximately &euro;140 billion of European funding each year.  We have increased considerably the number of special reports we carry out but we cannot handle more than approximately 30 a year.  The more recent output is something between 25 and 35.  Six years ago, it was closer to 15 or 20.  Each audit takes about 13 months from inception to finalisation.  There are so many different European spending programmes that coming back to them, even the larger ones, more than once every ten years is quite difficult.  In recent times we have considered trying to look a little more strategically at the overall systems.  This is precisely the report about which Mr. Wojciechowski spoke.  We have stepped back a little and looked at the way in which this RDP, as a whole, is managed.  The messages from that apply then pretty much to all the programmes, not just to certain specific ones.  In truth, too, although the Leader programme has changed a lot in Ireland, it probably has not changed as much Europe-wide because there was a pretty basic reform more or less in the year or so after that report was published.  We typically try to find a European-wide perspective rather than a specifically national perspective.  We do not have the resources to go to every country and do that, but-----</p></speech>

What I have to say is very brief and a little ironic.  I welcome the fact Senator Mac Lochlainn has highlighted the overemphasis on bureaucracy down through the entire system.  It brought back to my mind a conversation I had with a public official who was dealing with an application with which I was involved.  I queried the amount of bureaucracy involved and how far-fetched some of it was, and the answer and the reason I was given was, "We can be audited by Europe at any time."  He was overemphasising his need to cross the t's and dot the i's.  It seems to me, having heard the ECA's report this morning, that there is something of a vicious circle in this regard.  While the ECA does not want that overemphasis on the bureaucracy, the paperwork, etc., its perceived iron fist may be causing it to an extent with people on the ground.  It is something of a vicious circle and a contradiction.</p></speech>

An auditor comes along and finds a problem and then the natural reaction is to have additional control.</p><p>We do not typically argue for less control of spending.  We suggest making this spending programme simpler so that it is harder to make a mistake.  If there are 20 different potential objectives for a particular piece of spending, it is harder to say that any one of those is effective because the money is spread out.  It is not focused on something in particular.  A simple example, which we are going to talk about in the Committee on European Union Affairs, is reimbursement programmes where a beneficiary receives money with a bunch of conditions attached to it, spends it and then applies back for the money.  Those programmes are more difficult and more complex.  Therefore they have a higher rate of error than the single farm payment where there is an entitlement and the payment is based on that entitlement.  </p><p> When the Commission is designing programmes, we encourage it to make them simpler so that control should be less of an issue.  However, if Ireland makes mistakes and pays out money where it was not due to be paid out, the Commission will say it needs some of that back.  It happened a couple of years ago.  That means that the Irish Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is always anxious to have controls.  It is important.  However, we never say, for example on the area-based entitlement, that a country must be 100% right.  If a European auditor, whether from the Commission or from the Court of Auditors, asks if a figure is right, I think the number is plus or minus 3% on the area.  No one is expected to be 100% correct.  However, they are expected to follow the rules that are there.  We advocate not giving people an excuse for not following the rules.  The rules should be made simpler in the first place.  Maybe that is where the balance can be found.  People need to follow the rules but the rules can be simpler.  I estimate that in 50% of RDP reports, we say this could have been simpler.  </p></speech>

We know from farmers that they feel the burden of bureaucracy when they have to fill out reports.  What steps is the Court of Auditors taking to try to minimise that?  The witnesses talked about making the processes simpler.  However, there is a general concern that the European Commission is overly bureaucratic in many ways.  Given that, what concrete steps are being pursued to ensure the process can be cut down so members are not obliged to hear it has been six years since Ireland has had a review in respect of the Leader programme?  That is not progressive.  We need to know a timeframe.  Targets were mentioned and we need to know when Leader will be reviewed.  I would like to hear that it will be reviewed on a two or three-year basis.  Then we can take action in Ireland, based on the conclusions of the reports of the European Court of Auditors.  If we must wait for six years, loads of time will have moved on and we will have lost the opportunity.  To me, there is a burden of bureaucracy.  That is what I am hearing with regard to reporting on the RDP and Leader.  What concrete steps is the court taking to reduce that burden both for itself and for applicants looking for funding?</p></speech>

We have an analysis of which sort of programmes lead to those results.  That has featured heavily in our annual report over the past couple of years.</p> <p>  One of the key things we are doing in the report that Mr. Wojciechowski has presented is to look at the complexity of the programming documentation the Commission requires.  Some of that complexity is bureaucratic but does not particularly affect the farmer as it is between Ireland and the Commission.  We hope the farmer is not too affected by that.  One element of that complexity is the wide range of schemes eligible for support under rural development programmes.  There are 118 rural development programmes across Europe.  Each one could be financing about 50 different schemes.  </p> <p>  We are looking at an enormously complex universe of schemes.  That is why we have to make some big choices about where we are going to focus our attention.  Is there a way we can do some work which will cover more than one scheme at the same time?  The key things we have been looking at over the past year, aside from these important reports, are the greening scheme which accounts for about 30% of direct payments to farmers and, emerging shortly, a report on the basic payment scheme that accounts for another 70%.  We are focusing on those big schemes which affect every single farmer.  We are trying to make sure that we provide a useful input so that it is right.  One of the things we have achieved through this report is a much bigger awareness of the complexity involved in the programming.  We were asked about the impact on the Commission's proposals.  I am pleased the Commission seems to be looking at a slimmer and more strategic programming document in future.  It is talking about bringing Pillar 1 and Pillar 2 together.  We are seeing some impacts.  I cannot promise we will be back in two years' time to look at Leader in Ireland.  We have to look at everything else that is happening all across Europe, to see where the risks are and where we can have an impact.  However, we are working very hard and providing a lot of useful information, which is helping target spending and industry programmes where they can make a difference. </p></speech>

This report was published in June last year.  It was presented in the European Parliament before two committees, namely, the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development and the Committee on Budgetary Control and I will outline the main conclusions.  The main target of the young farmers scheme is the generational renewal of European agriculture.  However, we did not achieve this goal.  There is no generational renewal.  This report shows we have very serious problems in European agriculture.  </p> <p>  The first problem is the large reduction in the number of farms.  In 2005, there were 14.7 million farms in the European Union.  In 2013, it was only 10.5 million farms and the number now is approximately 10 million.  In the European Union, we lose 1,000 farms each day.  This is the tempo of reduction in numbers.  Of course, it is possible to say we have bigger, stronger farms.  However, there is the question of what should be the end of this process.</p><p>How many farms will there be in the long-term future?  That was the first observation.</p><p> The slide on display shows the results of young farmers support in the period 2005-13.  The blue line shows the number of young farmers, statistically defined as under 45 under the EUROSTAT category, in the European Union.  The number of such farmers was 3.3 million in 2005 and by 2013, it was 2.3 million.  That is 1 million young farmers fewer than before.  The red line is the average size of farms.  While that has increased a little, the data show that the area of land held by young farmers also was reduced in that they held 57.7 million ha in 2005 and only 51.9 million ha in 2013.  There has been a reduction both in the number of young farmers and in the amount of land held by them.  </p><p> The next slide shows that the number of young farmers fell in a majority of member states, that is, all but two, namely, Romania and Slovenia.  The slide on display shows expenditure in the financial period 2007-13, when we spent &euro;3.2 billion.  Ireland was not a big beneficiary, as only 800 farmers were supported to the amount of approximately &euro;6 million.  In the current programming period, under the first pillar of the new system, for Ireland the amount is roughly &euro;121 million.  </p><p> The next slide contains very interesting data on the generational situation in European agriculture.  The problem is that 80% of European farmers are over 45.  They are not young as per the statistical category.  One third of farmers are older than 65.  There are only two member states in which the percentage of youngest farmers, that is, those under 35, is greater than 10%, namely, Austria and Poland.  On the right hand side of the slide, we can see the percentage of farmers older than 65.  This figure is under 10% in only three member states, namely, Germany, Austria and Poland.  As for the situation in Ireland, the youngest farmer figure is 6.3%, while the oldest is 26.5%.  That is better than the average but there is a problem in that there is no improvement in the generational situation in Irish farming, as is the case in the majority of member states.  Portugal was a big beneficiary of the young farmers support.  It has more than 50% of farmers who are over 65.  The slide on display shows that we have different situations in different member states.  It is not a good idea to propose the same solution for them when the situations are absolutely different.  The slide on display shows that expenditure for 2001-13 was &euro;3.2 billion in Pillar 2.  In this programming period, we have &euro;3.8 billion in Pillar 2 and &euro;2.6 billion in Pillar 1 for the young farmers.  </p><p> The slide on display provides examples from our report that illustrate the lack of logic of intervention.  The examples are from my country, Poland, and from Italy.  This is not a criticism of the member states but of the logic of intervention.  In Poland, for example, a farmer holding more than 500 ha received &euro;100,000 as a direct payment and an additional &euro;3,000 as a young farmers payment.  What is the impact for generational renewal?  There was no reason for the payment.  Was he a new farmer or was he in need of an incentive to stay in agriculture?  No.  While it was good for that farmer's additional income, there was no link to generational renewal.  In Italy, it was the case that a company was supported by the young farmers scheme because one of the shareholders was young, even though he was not an active farmer.  This company achieved &euro;8,000 as an additional payment.  This is not logical intervention.  We criticise this.  The target is generational renewal but this is not a good way to achieve it.</p><p> As I said yesterday at the Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development of the European Parliament, the main problem of European agriculture is that we plan the Common Agricultural Policy from a seven-year perspective but we need a long-term vision of the development of European agriculture, not over seven years but 27 years.  What is our vision of agriculture in 2040 or 2050?  We have to start our thinking about this.  It is a political question to create this vision.  It is not the task of the European Court of Auditors.  We can observe, however, that this is the main problem.  How many farms should there be in Europe in the long-term future?  How big should they be?  How many farmers should there be?  Should we have industrial farming or organic farming?  There should be a clear policy for the future.  Maybe Commissioner Hogan will propose something.  The lack of a long-term vision for agriculture is the big problem and the big challenge for the European Union.</p></speech>

Mr. Wojciechowski gave us some startling statistics, including the point that 1,000 farmers per day are exiting farming in Europe.  Europe is a big place but that is still a huge number.  Another significant statistic from his presentation is that 80% of farmers are over 45 years of age.</p><p>That number has not changed substantially in the last period of time either.  The system was changed in the last Common Agricultural Policy review whereby there is a 25% top-up in pillar one.  Has that been examined yet and has it made a significant difference for young farmers and generational renewal?  Young farmers received a 25% top-up on their basic payment.</p></speech>

It is too early to evaluate the functioning of the young farmers scheme.  In the previous system it was only pillar two, now it is pillar one.  The examples I presented from Italy and Poland show that this form of support probably will not be effective for generational renewal, but we do not have the full evaluation of the new system.  It is a political decision which system will exist in the future.  The problem is that this is the consequence of programming proceeding too late.  Now we have full knowledge about the functioning of the system in 2007 to 2013, but we do not have an evaluation of the new system yet.  We start debate about the system after 2020.  This is the big problem.  The new policy and new instrument should be based on the evaluation of the previous period but we do not have enough data to evaluate it.</p></speech>

That extra 25% goes to many people who would have taken over the farms anyway and there are probably not many who specifically take over a farm simply because of the 25% they will get for a five year period.  It is probably not a sufficient incentive for people to do something they were not going to do anyway.  That brings us back to one of the dilemmas.  We like simple schemes and this is quite a simple scheme.  However, just because it is simple does not mean it is necessarily going to have a big impact.</p></speech>

The figure is 1 million young farmers lost from agriculture in the eight years between 2005 and 2013.  That is supported by the figures from the Western Development Commission which show that 41% of people left agriculture in the 20 year period up to 2016.  The witnesses are the auditors and part of their job is to examine whether the money we are spending is effective, being spent correctly and if there is value for money.  I guess that the stark reality here is happening throughout Europe.  I think of the west of Ireland and places such as Galway, Donegal, Mayo, Sligo, Leitrim, Clare and Kerry and I wonder what type of country we will have 20 years hence.  We will have a country with no people living in rural areas and big farmers who will be farming major portions of land.  The same thing appears to be happening in Europe now.</p> <p>  The witnesses have given us the facts from the audit but there is one thing lacking.  Have they proffered any solution?  As the fall-off is so dramatic and given that there is an ageing population in farming, the Court of Auditors should not leave this for another ten years before it audits it.  This is alarming.  Year-on-year changes must be made to make sure it becomes effective.  We must attract people back into farming.  We must ensure that young people would prefer to be farming and making a reasonable living from it, rather than moving to the cities to work in factories, offices or whatever.  Otherwise we will end up with rural Europe being devoid of people, services and communities.  That is a huge problem.  I have not found any comment from the auditors to indicate what they feel should be done.  Having looked at the statistics do they think it is something that merits ongoing audit year-on-year rather than waiting for another ten years?</p> <p>  Also, the simplification we talked about earlier regarding Leader and so forth is probably reflected by farmers.  Young people will walk away from this industry because there is too much hassle and not enough from it.</p></speech>

We show the problem.  The reduction in the number of farms has consequences for rural areas.  The farmers are leaving the job and going to the cities.  It is a big problem.  Our report shows the same.  There is a problem with synergy between the European policies.  Take the example of the young farmers.  The results were a little better for the young farmers scheme in Poland.  The generational renewal was achieved a little, although not much.  The reason, in my view, was not support for young farmers support but for old farmers.  It was a pension fund, which was the structural fund for pensions for the old farmers.  It was the reason they decided to give their farms to the young generation and it was effective.  It should be considered.  Perhaps this is a good solution too - good synergy between the policies and the pension policy.  They are not easy solutions.</p> <p>  I am not a politician now.  If I was a politician my answer would be clearer, but I am an auditor and we are waiting for the clear vision of the European policy.  When I presented this report in the European Parliament one Member of the European Parliament said, "Okay.  We had 14 million farmers and now we have 10 million farmers, but 10 million farms are better because they are stronger farms.  This policy should be continued".  That was one political opinion about it.  As a former politician it is not okay for me, but not as an auditor.  This is the reason I said earlier that we need a long-term vision for European agriculture.  That is the situation from my point of view. </p></speech>

It is very helpful and informative.  I have some questions on the statistics.  Is a young farmer defined as 45 years of age in the statistics in the report or what is the age for defining a young farmer?  In Ireland it was traditionally defined as 35 years and later it moved to 40 years.  A report issued in Ireland several years ago stated that there were more farmers over 80 years of age than under 35 years of age.  I do not believe that statistic has changed.  That is the imperative in this situation.  The two big issues in Irish and European agriculture are age and what we do about carbon and climate issues.  I am seeking clarification of the European definition of young farmers.  Is it 35, 40 or 45 years of age?</p> <p>  The Chairman stated that the issue is not so much the young farmers coming into farming as the older farmers leaving.</p><p>Traditionally, we had a retirement scheme for farmers and it worked very well.  It promoted the younger farmer coming in and the older farmer leaving the occupation.  It operated between the ages of 55 and 65, if I recall correctly, and at the time there was a very good uptake.  Should the Commission be looking at that and incentivising a project of that magnitude so we could have a generational change?  As the figures demonstrate, it is the most important element required in European, if not Irish, agriculture.</p><p> This is a macro report and it considers the entire topic from a European level.  Have the witnesses drilled into the small and minute details such as issues with Irish farming for young farmers, including the matter of "old" young farmers or gentlemen involved in partnership schemes who did not get installation aid or the top-up?  Were those cohorts examined in the report and if they were, what were the results?  If they were not examined, will those two very important cohorts be considered?  They feel they have not been looked at appropriately by the current system.  It is all about the age demographic.  As the Chairman said, perhaps it is not about getting young people into farming, although that is very important.  The infrastructure we have put in place in the past few years and through the agricultural colleges must be acknowledged in that respect.  Perhaps we must act on the other end and we need a promotion to help the next generation to let go of the reins.</p></speech>

EUROSTAT and DG Agri, which collect some of the numbers on this, tend to collect data for farmers under the age of 35 and farmers between 35 and 45 and so on.  One cannot get a set of statistics that quite match the policy we are aiming for.  It is quite reasonable to think the figure given is close to the reality, possibly across Europe.  What we see across Europe is that only 6% of farmers are under 35.  There are many complicated structures around the different member states.  In some cases farms are family businesses and many members of the family have a role in the farm.  Sometimes they are held by companies.  We have not done an exhaustive examination of all the elements.  Mr. Wojciechowski indicated in the presentation that it is in the member states where there is a scheme for looking after older farmers that one sees a better performance.  It is correct to say that in Germany a farmer cannot claim an old-age pension unless one ceases to be a farmer.  Germany has one of the better performances in terms of generational renewal.  There is a relationship between all these policies.  Sometimes it goes beyond our audit scope and into general social policies.</p></speech>

We have a Common Agricultural Policy and a cohesion policy.  A Common Agricultural Policy is not enough to solve all the problems of rural areas.  It may be different in Ireland but I have an example from my country, Poland, which is a big beneficiary of cohesion policy and the Common Agricultural Policy.  From the Cohesion Fund, only 11% is addressed to rural areas, which is 90% of Poland's territory, with 40% of the population.  That is an incorrect proportion in my view.  With the Common Agricultural Policy, which takes in food supply safety and the environment, the development of rural areas should be supported.  The Common Agricultural Policy and cohesion policy are equally important in this respect.  It is necessary to change the political vision.  It is absolutely necessary to support rural areas even more now because we have the problem of people leaving such areas.  We can see empty villages throughout Europe and my country of Poland is the same.</p></speech>

The basic finding is that although we have had decades of young farmer support, it does not seem to have made much difference to the basic statistics.  The implication is that if we want to support young farmers with a transfer of funds, which Europe does, we must transfer them in a way that would incentivise a transfer between generations.  There were examples from Mr. Wojciechowski.  A money transfer will not make a difference to behaviour and for a future Common Agricultural Policy, we must think about how expenditure would change people's behaviour.  That is the core of the report's recommendation.</p></speech>

The first portion dealt with the rural development plan and the transfer of land to young farmers.  If we are to preserve rural Ireland as we have known it, this must be a core policy objective.  The train is leaving the station and if policy does not change very quickly, the family farm structure as we know it will disappear.  The current policies go against retaining the family farm.  There are incentives which do the same and encourage farmers to lease land to non-family members.  The ownership and working of land need to be separated.  If the family farm structure is to continue to the next generation and the one after, the young farmer must farm the land.  It is not enough to own it as that will last for a generation and the family will then disappear over the horizon.</p> <p>  We have incentives, especially in this country, that have EU approval but they encourage large commercial farmers to take over tracts of land.  It will destroy the family farm structure and unless we change those policy objectives soon, it will be too late.  If I want to transfer my farm to my son, there is no tax incentive to do so.  If I lease the land to a stranger three, four or five miles away, there is a very significant tax incentive.  It is destroying the family farm structure.  Unless we do something about it very quickly, the entire family farm structure will disappear.  That would be very regrettable.</p> <p>  Our dairy herd size has increased dramatically and there is much demand for land.  With the incentives, the price of leased land is getting very high.  If a young farmer wants to work on the family farm and expand a bit, he would not be able to compete with the larger units in the area.  He would be squeezed and feel he would not have a viable unit.  There are problems with policy objectives and if we are serious about preserving rural Ireland, we must examine them quickly.</p> <p>  There is the question of how the schemes have been implemented.  We have heard an amount of hard luck stories from young farmers who failed to qualify for the existing aid.</p><p>Everyone sitting at this table can provide a list of such stories.  A fellow who kept a few cattle when he was in college would fall outside the five-year rule when he takes over the farm.  If he had animals in his name at 20 and takes over the farm at 26, he is not eligible for young farmer aid.  There are other instances of this.  For example, if a young farmer took over the farm for health or family reasons after the age of 35, he would be left on a very low payment and would likely see no future in it going forward.  This scheme has not worked well in practice.</p><p> Our family farm structure is crumbling.  It is a structure which has served rural Ireland very well but the policies in place are undermining it.  If one looks at the amount of mountain land being farmed by individuals - not owned, but farmed - one will see that it is increasing rapidly.  The policy coming from and approved by the Commission is all geared towards large commercial units, which might be more effective for food production but which are certainly not conducive to good rural communities.  If that family farm structure disappears, rural Ireland as I know it will be dead and gone.</p><p> Before I became a Member of the Oireachtas, I was the leader of a farming organisation.  The family farm structure, to me, is sacrosanct, but as it stands we are losing it very quickly.</p></speech>

We have to consider the layers of policy making that are involved.  We have looked at a particular European programme and we have provided the results.  When talking about the CAP, we should remember that it is not actually a common policy.  There are many common elements and a common pot of money, which is then distributed.  However, each country has a national envelope.  There is quite a bit of national level adjustment, and the interaction of European policies with national policies must be considered.  What the Deputy is saying is very interesting to us because it affects our consideration of the next set of audits we might do.  In terms of policy prescriptions, we are focusing on the European level and what the Commission, as the main actor, should do, because that is what we audit.  That does not invalidate what the Deputy is saying, but it must be remembered that the policy-making takes place at several different levels.</p></speech>

I fully agree with the witness.  However, we now have a situation were 20%, that is, the largest farms, received 80% of European subsidies for agriculture, and the other 80% received only 20% of those subsidies.  This is the political choice we face in deciding the future CAP.  We show a picture of what the situation is.  It should be very seriously considered why four million farms have been lost in such a short period of time.  Why have we lost 20 million ha that were previously declared farmland?  This is a very big process.  It should be considered.</p> <p>  For our next audit plan, I propose to investigate the reduction in land used for farming.  This is a big problem.  There was debate about this issue in the European Parliament too; it is a very important problem.  The situation faced by family farms is a key issue for the future.  We have to decide what the policy will be for this type of agriculture.</p></speech>

It contained charts from 2007 to 2013 showing that there has been a decline in the numbers of farmers.  There were 300,000 farmers in Ireland when we joined the EU.  We now have 120,000 farmers.  It should not come as a shock to any body or group that farmer numbers have been in decline across Europe over the last 20 years.  If I run a company and am losing money, I have to solve the problem straight away.  I do not look at it for 15, 17 or 20 years.  The witnesses can compile reports but if a political decision is taken by the Directorate-General  for Agriculture and Rural Development, do they have any say in it?  They have correctly pointed out that 80% of European grants go to 20% of farmers.</p> <p>  Deputy Cahill raised the issue of the family farm in Ireland.  It has been decimated.  The EU has brought in regulations which farmers have to adhere to, especially in the west, that mountains had to be destocked.  Farmers cannot farm as they did before because of designations.  The witnesses are wondering why we have lost such a large number of people - 41% in 20 years, as Deputy Martin Kenny pointed out.  The reason is that people cannot farm their land.  There has been no subsidy brought in for designated land.  There has been a flight from the land, and that will continue unless the situation is addressed.</p> <p>  Ireland and ten other countries have to have a green certificate while the rest of the countries in the EU do not.  I agree with the green certificate and believe that it is good for young farmers, but why is it not a requirement for the 27 member states?  In Ireland, there are a group of young farmers who we call the forgotten farmers.  The European Court of Auditors have looked over this and seen it going on for years.  If one did not have a quota in 2000, 2001 and 2002, then it is their tough luck.  Even if the farmer is still under 40, he or she cannot get the single farm payment because he or she has fallen through the cracks.  I went to Europe to explain this, and I now know that the European Parliament voted on something before Christmas.  However, we have lost young farmers because of that.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses agree that we are moving towards more industrialised farms?  If a west of Ireland farmer is getting &euro;4,000 through the single farm payment and another guy in another part of the country is getting &euro;140,000 and a piece of land comes up for sale - we all know that farms have to increase a bit - then we know that the other guy is going to get the land.</p><p>The EU has watched over this - so has the Court of Auditors - and allowed it to happen, with report after report.  That is the reason for the demise.  We need not conduct a big operation of examination on it.  What I ask is how much influence can the Court of Auditors bring so that the family farm will be protected.  As Deputy Cahill pointed out, how much influence can they bring to bear to ensure that the farmer with 20, 30 or 40 hectares will be looked after?  We can have all the reports we want in the world.</p><p> The other side of it is, how much has the Court of Auditors done where the likes of the big food joints as wells as the meat factories are dictating the price to the farmer?  The farmer in Ireland, and in Europe, is a price taker, not a price maker.  This has been watched over by courts of auditors and by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and nothing has been done.  The single farm payment was brought in to ensure that people could afford food right throughout Europe.  No one has a problem with that.  In 1980, if a farmer sold three cattle, he could buy a car.  One would need 30 cattle now to buy the same car.  That shows the devaluation.  We should not scratch our heads and wonder why we have lost the numbers of farmers we have in Ireland but also in Europe.  There is a flight from the land.  With all the statistics we have looked at there, I ask the members of the Court of Auditors when will someone shout stop.  They stated these are political decisions.  The buck is passed once again to the political people.  While I know it, I did not have to do up a report.  I know in my area what went on down through the years.  We all know the number of farmers we have lost.  What I ask the Court of Auditors is how it, as a body, will rectify this so that the forgotten farmer, including young farmers, will be looked after.  How will it ensure that the family farm will be protected, that the EU gives a certain amount of payment and that, as was rightly pointed out earlier on, someone with seven donkeys does not get the payments?  We are paying farmers to not farm right around Europe because to get the single farm payment one does not need stock of any type.  I believe what we have done is generate hobby farmers who can go and work in America or any part of Europe and still draw the single farm payment.  Will that continue to be allowed?</p><p> When one talks about young farmers, there was a system brought out - in fairness, by the previous Government - where one could go into farming and do the green certificate at the same time.  On the new scheme that has come out now, the Department has stated that Europe said no, one cannot do that and one must have one's green certificate in one's hand.  As a result, only 970 young farmers have gone into that scheme.</p><p> I agree fully that one needs to make sure young farmers are doing a certain amount of farming.  I am not asking them to work morning, noon and night.  It is also necessary to provide an incentive for elderly farmers.  However, in saying that, and returning to the family farm, where a farmer who was in organics wanted to go into GLAS, which is Pillar 2 funding, the EU ruled that it was double payment it could not give it.  At the same time, we can give an 80 or 90 year old farmer the single farm payment as well as plant his land, which will not bring any young farmer in.  The Court of Auditors needs to look at all the scenarios.  In my opinion, Europe, as well as the Court of Auditors, has failed to ensure that the family farm is protected.</p><p> The significant demise in farming is not news for the simple reason that a farmer might say - one should think of what I said about designations - "if my land cannot be farmed to its potential, why would I be getting nothing more?"  That is the scenario that has come to pass.  Right around Europe the big are getting bigger and the small farmers are being pushed out.  I always thought that Europe was not for that but that is what it has done.</p></speech>

For the first time, before the start of the debate about the future of the Common Agricultural Policy, the court has interesting dialogue and reports and we discuss them.  I again thank the committee for the invitation; it is a good example that we discuss seriously this data which show the dramatic conclusions of our audit.  This is very important.  In the Polish Parliament, and in the European Parliament, there was a similar debate.  This is the first time the court is well prepared for this debate about the future.  However, we are not politicians.  It is not our decision which of our recommendations will be adopted and which of them will not be.</p> <p>  About the family farming, as I recall, this is not from the audit.  As a former Member of the European Parliament, I am aware there was a long discussion of what was first a proposal of the European Commission to cut the payment for the big farms and to give more to the family farming.  Finally, it was not accepted because the lobby of the big industrial farming was very strong there.  These are politicians' decisions.</p> <p>  Our satisfaction, as a court, is that now we have an interesting report which is a good basis for the discussion.  As Mr. Welch stated, we will prepare the briefing paper - our opinion based on the results of audit.  I hope that our observation for the first time will be seriously considered during the debate about the future of the Common Agricultural Policy.  I again thank the committee for its interest in us.</p></speech>

There are another couple of questioners.  If Deputy McConalogue can be as brief as possible, maybe we can take two questions together.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.83" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2018012400002#L00500"><p>At the outset, I should have wished Mr. Cardiff well.  I thank him for his service as the country's nominee after the past six years.  I also wish Mr. Murphy well on his appointment.</p> <p>  On the report, I note the auditors' report finds that the objectives are not working and that the funding is not achieving its objective.  Did they go into any detail to establish why that is?  It may not be in their remit.  I do not think they did but I seek to ascertain whether they did in any way try to establish that.</p> <p>  Also, in terms of those who are leaving, I note that there are almost 4 million farmers who have left overall in eight years.  What is the dynamic behind that?  What categories do those farmers fall into?  Did they delve into that and can they enlighten us in that regard?</p> <p>  I echo what a couple of previous speakers stated on the importance of trying to sustain the family farm model here in the country.  I reiterate the forgotten farmer issue that has been well made here, and how that is something we need to address and ensure that the Commission addresses in the next round, where a farmer, regardless of age, but who could be 25, who has been farming for more than five years is excluded and is not regarded as a young farmer.  Although it is clear that there is consolidation of farming units, it is crucial that we do not have a CAP policy that unfairly accentuates that and does not allow farmers the choice to stay in agriculture because the young farmers' scheme, for example, excludes them even though they may only be in their late 20s but have been farming for more than five years.</p><p>They are left in a position where farming is not an option.  The Common Agricultural Policy, CAP, leaves them in that position.  Incentivising older farmers to transfer, whether to their own family or to neighbouring small farmers, is crucial.  There is an emphasis on that too.  There needs to be an appetite to ensure that they are passing the land on and that policy facilitates them to do that rather than retaining it.  Older farmers will generally have small farms because if one has 30 acres and is 70 years of age, one might be able to manage it, but if one has 150 acres and is 70 years of age, one will not be holding on to it because it simply would not be possible.  Holding on to those units may mean that somebody next door who has 50 acres and needs 30 more cannot make his or her farm more sustainable because policy does not facilitate the transfer in timely fashion.  The graph of those under 30, under 45 and up to 65 shows that 20% of farmers are under the age of 45.  Taking a starting working age of 20, that represents 25 years of working life.  Only 20% of farmers are in that category.  The largest category is those who are of pension age.  It is inverted.  There are fewer younger people and more older people in the industry to the extent that pensioners are the biggest sector.  Policy needs to try to turn that around.</p></speech>

The Deputy highlighted an issue.  The Commission's communication on The Future of Food and Farming draws attention to the number of smallholdings among the beneficiaries of the CAP.  I cannot find the exact numbers but a very large percentage have less than 5 ha.  As the Deputy points out, many older farmers are concentrated in that area.  In our work, we are sometimes in different parts of Europe, visiting some of those very small farms - much smaller than 30 ha - run by older people.  In those circumstances, those people will carry on farming for as long as they are there.  When they go on, their farm will be almost systematically consolidated into a neighbouring holding because no young person will take over a small farm in a mountainous area and have a subsistence living starting in his or her 20s or 30s.  No one will do that.  That is a big reason for which people move out of farming.  That degree of consolidation will always be there.</p> <p>  Another thing we see around Europe is that economic circumstances are very different in different places.  There are places where people move out of farming because there are good jobs to be had in other sectors.  One cannot stop them.  That will also happen.  There are also farmers who are losing their markets.  That is a much more painful process.  We are looking at income stabilisation mechanisms which are a means to stop a person from being forced to give up farming after just one or two bad years.  We will look at that shortly to see if those mechanisms are working.</p> <p>  One of the many issues in this sector which constrains what we can do is that we look at European policies and how European spending works but we do not look at the whole range of factors which apply to farmers, such as inheritance tax, inheritance laws and so on.  All of these things are national competencies.  It is true of our recommendations and of the limits within which the Commission works that only a certain number of levers can be pulled from Brussels.  Many levers remain in national hands and it is not really our job to tell different member states how to organise their internal affairs.  We leave it to politicians to take political decisions and we also try to respect the rights of member states to take their own decisions in their areas of competence.</p></speech>

We have been trying to get more time with national parliaments around Europe, not less, so the invitation is much appreciated.  If it interests the committee, we can host it or a delegation from it in Luxembourg, as big or as small as members like, and we can spend more time both explaining what we do and exploring some of the detailed issues discussed.  Some pertain to Europe and some are national issues but we are trying to have more to say that is relevant to decision-making.  That is our direction.  I thank the committee and, while I will not be there, I hope we will see members at the court or back here in a year or two.</p></speech>

It was a very good example of how co-operation with national parliaments is important for our work.  I have one final reflection.  There is discussion in the European Union about the idea of renationalisation of the common agricultural policy.  It is not our responsibility to present opinion about this but our report shows that we need a more flexible European agricultural policy because we have a different situation in different member states and the future Common Agricultural Policy should be better targeted for the specific situations in member states.  I am sure that it is absolutely necessary.  We should not just discuss this with the European Parliament; debate with national parliaments is also very important.  I thank the Chairman and distinguished Members of Parliament for this invitation.</p></speech>

We have had a wide-ranging discussion on the whole CAP.  One can see how important it is going into the future and important points have been made regarding generational change.  I think Mr. Wojciechowski's idea about a longer-term view for agriculture and the CAP going forward should be considered, rather than the seven-year process.  I thank Mr. Cardiff for his invitation.  Hopefully we can take him up on it at some stage.  I wish him success in the future.  I wish Mr. Tony Murphy every success in his position for the coming period.</p></speech>

I welcome an opportunity to update the committee on the progress on some of the issues identified.  The Chairman has already welcomed my officials.</p> <p>  On the reviews that have taken place, I think the committee is aware that in recent months there have been many positive changes in Oberstown.  These changes are continuing to address the challenges at the campus.  In 2016, the Oberstown board of management commissioned independent reviews in a number of key areas of operations, security, health and safety and behaviour management.  In addition, examination of all of the policies in Oberstown, including care, safeguarding and professional standards on the campus, has also taken place.</p><p>There were a number of objectives for these reviews, and a key objective was that optimum care continues to be given to children residing in Oberstown following the changes that have taken place in the past 12 to 18 months.  Essential to this is ensuring the people working in Oberstown are supported through good organisation, training and development.  The recommendations of these reviews, as well as the action plan developed by Oberstown following the HIQA report, will point the way forward in ensuring the highest standards of care for these young people are being sought to be implemented.</p><p> To ensure the implementation of each of the recommendations in the various reviews, as appropriate, I established a review implementation group in March 2017.  This implementation group was tasked with analysing the recommendations of the operational review, the security review, the behavioural management review and the two health and safety reviews.  I am pleased to confirm to the committee I have received the final report of the review implementation group, and I express my thanks to the group.  Having studied the report, I am confident there is evidence that positive change is taking place and that further change is planned for the campus.  The report highlighted the work that has already taken place in implementing the recommendations and the timeframe for work on outstanding recommendations.</p><p> The full implementation of the recommendations must be viewed as a long-term strategy for the campus, while some of the recommendations are more immediate.  Implementation of the recommendations of each review is under way on campus.  It is led by the board of management, in collaboration with management, staff and the Irish Youth Justice Service of the Department.  One of the best ways of knowing whether things have changed is by hearing from the young people themselves.  With regard to their participation, I am pleased to say I received a letter from the young people in Oberstown inviting me to visit to tell me about their accomplishments while in Oberstown.  I plan to visit very soon.  I would have visited earlier except I have not been well, but I am back in action and I am very interested to hear what they have to say.  I am pleased they invited me.</p><p> The Department is consulting young people in Oberstown, through the participation hub in the Department, on revised national standards that set out the rules that govern Oberstown and how it is run.  The hub supports implementation of the strategy through the provision of information, training and advice for Departments and agencies and the non-statutory sector.  The consultation in this regard with the young people in Oberstown is nearing completion and has involved intensive engagement since November 2017.  The purpose of the process is to ensure the Department's new national standards will reflect the views of the young people.  A child friendly version of the standards will also be published.</p><p> In December 2017, which is not that long ago, I was delighted to launch Oberstown Children Detention Campus's strategic plan for 2017 to 2020.  I welcome the commitment of the board of management, stated in the Oberstown strategy, to working with me and the Department as we progress the common goal in the youth justice sector of supporting children to move away from offending behaviour and towards making a more positive contribution to society.</p><p> The committee is aware that Oberstown has gone through considerable change in recent years, with the amalgamation of the three detention schools into one campus, the development of new buildings, staffing issues and a number of serious incidents at the campus.  Oberstown is now a more stable environment than it was at the time of the serious incident in 2016.  The issues relating to the buildings are mainly resolved and staff are now deployed throughout the new units.  In addition, as far as practicable and in accordance with international best practice, young people on remand are kept separate from those young people convicted and serving a sentence.</p><p> Other developments relating to the campus include an increased focus on, and awareness of, health and safety and greater focus on ensuring the safe and secure care and work environment for the children and staff.  The assessment consultation and therapy service, ACTS, is a specialist service provided by Tusla.  It provides on-site multidisciplinary therapeutic services for the children in Oberstown.  ACTS has been reviewed by Tusla.  It is an opportunity to develop further the service in Oberstown, including the incorporation of HSE mental health services.  A communication plan has been adopted and launched by the board of management to improve internal and external communications among staff, young people, their families and all stakeholders.</p><p> As the committee is aware, the HIQA inspection in March 2017 identified areas that required improvement.  An action plan to address these areas was agreed between HIQA and Oberstown.  I understand work in this regard is progressing in line with the timetable agreed in the action plan.  It is important to point out the HIQA report also identified a number of positive improvements at the campus.  The inspectors observed kind, warm and appropriate interaction between staff and children in what was generally a relaxed atmosphere in the units and during activities.  For me as Minister this is really important.  It also highlighted that the overall provision of health care had improved, with dental and psychiatric services now being provided on campus.  It also observed the availability of nursing services has increased, while other important changes in the management structures were noted.  As I mentioned, I very much welcome the comprehensive action plan to address the areas identified by HIQA that require improvement.  I will keep the implementation plan under review.</p><p> With regard to restrictive practices, issues were raised by HIQA in its most recent report on restrictive practices, which include, as the committee is well aware, single separation and the use of physical restraint and handcuffs.  It is the Department's policy that the use of any restrictive practice should be a measure of last resort and part of a continuum of planned interventions.  The decision to separate a young person must, at all times, be a proportionate response to the risk posed by the young person.  A review of the restrictive practices, including the separation policies for Oberstown, took place earlier this year and a revised single separation policy was approved by the board in April 2017.  I am assured by Oberstown management that a process to ensure greater monitoring of single separation has been put in place.  An improved system of record keeping on the use of such practices, the extension of single separation and the types of restraint used have been informed further by the audit review.</p><p> It is, course, widely accepted that supporting and training staff on behaviour management and the concerns raised on the use of separation and restraint cannot be addressed in isolation.  Meeting the complex mental health needs of the children in detention and supporting staff to develop therapeutic relationships with children is an essential component of addressing the current difficulties in addressing the use of restrictive practices.</p><p> The committee is aware of the recent High Court judgment relating to single separation in Oberstown.  It was found the constitutional rights of the applicants were breached in so far and for so long as they were deprived of daily exercise and any contact with their families during the period of separation, and by the failure to provide the applicants with some form of opportunity to make representations.  It was also found there was a lack of procedural safeguards relating to separation, in particular the formal written recording of decisions was found to be unconstitutional.</p><p> For the sake of accuracy I confirm it was not found that the duration of the separation was unconstitutional or that the conditions of detention during separation in their totality amounted to inhuman and degrading treatment.  Importantly, it was noted in the judgment that while the response "may have gone too far in certain respects, and failed to observe procedural safeguards, the overall context was one of trying to make safe an institution which had just been through a major upheaval".</p><p>I know that there has been a lot of learning in Oberstown from this incident.</p><p> I wish to comment on the bail supervision scheme and take this opportunity to inform the committee of other measures that will impact on the detention of young people.  I was happy to launch the bail supervision scheme on 12 June 2017 on a pilot basis.  The programme provides the Dublin Children's Court with the option during remand proceedings to grant bail to a child rather than detaining the child.  The option offered to the court would be to release the child on bail with conditions set by the court.  This would involve intensive supports being provided to the child and his or her family.  The pilot is for an initial two-year period, during which a review and evaluation will be conducted to determine the future path of the scheme with the intention of it being rolled out nationally.  The approach is in keeping with the principle that the detention of a child should only be imposed as a last resort.  A proposal for an extension of the scheme is currently being examined by my Department.</p><p> Since 31 March of last year no new children have been detained in adult prisons.  Signing that order was one of the most important highlights for me as Minister so far.  Since then, all 17 year old boys referred by the courts are detained in Oberstown and now finally the policy to end children being detained in adult facilities, which I have attended, has been achieved.  The policy has had long-standing support in the Oireachtas and among organisations and people who actively promote the rights and welfare of children.</p><p> The key to achieving the policy goal of ending children being detained in adult facilities was the completion of the capital development project at Oberstown and the subsequent amalgamation of the three children detention schools in June 2016.  While these changes have brought great advantages, they have also inevitably brought many challenges.  The key to overcoming these challenges and maintaining good progress has been the dedication and co-operation of the key stakeholders, in particular, the children, staff, management and the board of Oberstown, who are supported by my Department and in particular by the Irish Youth Justice Service.</p><p> It should also be kept in mind that our paramount objective in our work is the safety and well-being of the children, while they spend their time in Oberstown, as well as the staff and people living in the local community &ndash; that has been a focus of ours as well.</p><p> I wish to underline my commitment to the further development of the youth justice system in Ireland.  I wish to acknowledge the dedication of the staff and management.  I commend them, the director and the board on their work in addressing the daily challenges.  I thank those responsible in HIQA &ndash; I meet them as well - for the valuable work they undertake in highlighting issues that, in turn, allow us to achieve higher standards of care for young people.</p><p> The key to all of this is co-operation among all those involved.  My Department and I are fully supportive of working with all parties for the smooth operation of Oberstown.  I am happy to take questions from the committee.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister for her presentation.  I fully acknowledge that there has been major progress in Oberstown.  However, I am still deeply concerned over certain areas.  When Mr. Bergin was before the committee, many of us expressed concerns.  I am keen to know whether progress has been made on certain points and, if not, I want to know about the timeframe for progress.</p> <p>  We have often spoken about separation, whereby a child is separated due to difficult behaviours.  We have discovered that when they are separated there is no exercise, communication or family contact.  I do not believe anyone has any idea about the serious impact this has on a child.  Something as simple as taking an iPhone from a child at home in a normal environment can have serious consequences, to the point where sometimes the child contemplates suicide.  Separation is really a terrible experience for these children and it is inhumane for them to have to go through it with restraints.  What progress has been made in this regard?  The term "as a last resort" is often used.  What are the criteria for "as a last resort"?  Have we looked at other countries where the authorities are in similar situations but handle things differently?</p> <p>  I welcome the fact that the Minister is meeting the young people.  That is wonderful.  I imagine everyone is aware that a report or review of adults will be singularly different from a report or review of children.  One of the things I urge the Minister to talk about when she meets them is restraints.  What is that like?  What would they prefer to see happen?  It is crucial that we involve our children.  They know that they might have to be constrained in some way, but they should be allowed to be involved in that particular thing.</p> <p>  Complaints arise, like when Mr. Bergin was before the committee last time and we spoke about our serious concerns.  What length of time does any of us have to see that real progress will be made on such issues?  Is there a timeframe?  Can we have follow-up on a more regular basis in respect of how progress is and can be made?</p></speech>

I fully appreciate and affirm the experience out of which Senator Freeman has raised all those questions.  It was clear from the HIQA report and the other reviews that there was room for considerable change in respect of the use of single separation with children in Oberstown.  That is the first thing to say.  There is an acknowledgement of that.</p> <p>  There are two aspects, as I understand it, in terms of the way those responsible are approaching the implementation of changes.  The new policy developed and approved by the board of management is now being implemented.  There is now an absolute approach to more careful systematic recording of decisions taken for single separation and why those decisions are taken.  There is regular monitoring and record keeping of when children are separated.  Enhanced arrangements are now in place to enable the senior management to oversee the process on a 24-7 basis, if and when it arises.  New procedures and careful recording of what is going on have been put in place.  This is closely observed and monitored by management as well.</p> <p>  I am aware that these things are happening.  I have held conversations with some of the staff and, more recently, with the director.  I believe the new approach and process enables a more careful assessment, response and awareness of how this separation is impacting the child or young person.  I sense that is especially where Senator Freeman's question is coming from.  I am going to suggest that, as part of that process, the staff who are working with the young people are present to that.</p><p>I hope that empathic presence, which has been supported through additional training to improve staff safety and confidence in being with the young person, and training on how to behave with that person, will make a difference for that young person if he or she is in the position in question.  That is really important to acknowledge.  With the changes in processes and oversight of management, I hope for and expect an impact on the experience of the young person.</p></speech>

As she said, since the end of March 2017, no child has been held in an adult prison.  This is very significant and has been a long time coming.  Well done to the Minister in that regard.</p> <p>  Let me touch on single separation.  At the last meeting, I made a point to the director of Oberstown that I had really serious concerns about the use of single separation.  While I and all other representatives here understand the need for it to be used in a limited set of circumstances, we were all really concerned about how frequently it was being used.  The HIQA report issued in March found there were 3,027 incidents of single separation in 2016.  All of us here find that deeply worrying.</p> <p>  I raised with Mr. Bergin the fact that the HIQA report noted concerns were raised over the prolonged periods in which children were held in single separation.  I want to raise this with the Minister also.  I and others here were very unimpressed with the response we got regarding a child who was held for nine days in single separation.  Let me quote page 20 of the report: "[I]n the case of one child, the first record of the child getting out for fresh air in the yard was on the day eight after initial separation."  We all agree that, with the poor quality of record-keeping at the campus, it is very hard for us to draw conclusions.  The child could have been out on other days but, because there were no records, we do not really have visibility as to what is actually occurring.</p> <p>  In the Minister's opening statement, she said progress has been made and that the unit managers are monitoring single separation and have put measures in place.  The Minister said this includes an improved record-keeping system.  This is welcome.  Does the Minister believe the current guidelines on the use of single separation are sufficiently robust?  Is she confident that, in any future reports from HIQA, there will be a massive improvement in that regard?</p> <p>  The Minister made reference to the High Court case that found a limited breach of constitutional rights for young people and single separation.  Following that ruling, the Irish Penal Reform Trust called on the Government to introduce a legal framework governing the holding of children in single separation.  Is this a matter that the Minister has considered and pursued?  What is her opinion on it?</p> <p>  Page 23 of the report concerns Tusla and the reporting of incidents in respect of child protection.  Three reports were sent to Tusla from the DLP at Oberstown.  I find it very concerning that Tusla did not acknowledge receipt of these complaints.</p></speech>

I accept the point and share the deep concerns.  It is good that the Deputy is raising them again, even now, on the basis of the report.</p> <p>  There was a revision of the single separation policy as of April of last year.  Are the guidelines in the context of that policy sufficient?  I hope and expect they are on the basis of the review.  HIQA was pointing out the agreement between it and management regarding the implementation and identification of new practices.  Having said that, the Deputy is correct to ask her question.  A certain amount of time has now passed and we are into a new year.  Regular monitoring is required.  I have indicated that regular monitoring is occurring and that the results are coming to my Department and me.  On that basis, I will be seeking in the relatively near future a report or discussion, in the context of my Department, specifically on this issue so we can be satisfied with the way in which the new processes are being implemented.</p> <p>  Perhaps Mr. Tony O'Donovan will make more specific comments on the implementation of the new processes and practices in order to indicate the changes to the committee members.</p> <p>  With regard to Deputy Mitchell's question on communicating with Tusla and whether there was a response, I do not know.  I will be seeing Tusla representatives later today.  I will certainly raise the question asked by the Deputy and revert to her and the other committee members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.121" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony O'Donovan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018012400002#G00800"><p>With regard to the development of national policy, policy is percolated down to Oberstown.  The area of most concern that HIQA raised concerns the procedures in implementing the policy.  In Oberstown, there has been a lot of work since the issuing of the HIQA report on policy and procedures development.  I refer to the policy and what needs to be done.  There are now many more operational procedures for staff concerning what they should do.  These include the review period.  In other words, if a young person today is separated from the group, for whatever reason, there is a certain level of management involvement within the first two hours.  If it goes beyond two hours, there is another level of management involved.  It goes from unit manager to deputy director to director.  Moreover, because of the new structures in place, we now have a deputy director who is specifically responsible for care services.  We have another person for staff development and health and safety.  We have allowed staff more access to directors on a 24/7 basis, as the Minister said.  There are systems in place.  Either there is a director or deputy director on campus or available at the end of the telephone line.  Therefore, if there is a review to be carried out, it is carried out much quicker than it was heretofore.  For this reason, there is much less drift, meaning the case of a young person who is separated is more likely to be approached straightaway.  The ideal is that if a young person is separated, for whatever reason, he or she is given a timeframe for discussion.  The discussion is had and, based on that, the risk assessment is reviewed, a decision is made on whether the person may come out and join the group again, go out to exercise or meet his or her family.</p></speech>

I will do that.</p></speech>

I would like to focus on the operational review that was carried out in October or November 2016.  Dr. Niall Muldoon, the Ombudsman for Children, appeared at our previous meeting to discuss the review.  He said that it was like working in a vacuum because the review had not been published.  Who made the decision not to publish?</p></speech>

The board of Oberstown commissioned the operational review and, following a detailed, careful and lengthy process informed by independent legal advice, it was decided that it was not safe to publish the review for legal reasons.  As a result, it was not my decision.</p></speech>

Can she understand why the Ombudsman for Children said that the report should be published and why we are asking so many questions?  We are operating in the dark.  The Minister had just been appointed in July 2016.  It was a troubled time in Oberstown, which featured in the media on a continuous basis.  There were issues at the centre but the independent operational review was commissioned following presentations to the committee by the Minister and the chairman of the board of management.  We all welcomed the review because, as Mr. O'Donovan said, it would highlight the gaps in the policies and procedures.  We know the picture but we do not know how the jigsaw has been built because we do not know how low a base we have come from.  That has been left to one side but an action plan is being put in place relating to policies and procedures.  We should learn how low a base we are coming from.  It is important for Oireachtas Members and for the public that the report should be published.  What is the Minister's opinion on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.126" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1358" speakername="Katherine Zappone" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2018012400002#H00500"><p>I deeply appreciate the questions the Deputy is raising.  First, she outlined the commissioning and process of the review and its importance, as well as the hope regarding what that could provide to us as we move forward in our job and, most importantly, in respect of what is going on within the campus to raise the standard of care and safety for the children and young people and for the individuals who work there.  She also outlined the importance of the review in the context of other reviews, which I acknowledged that at the time.</p> <p>  Second, the review was conducted and recommendations were made.  Recommendations were published and they became part of a group of hundreds of recommendations from the various other reviews that were compiled and synthesised to develop an action plan.  They are being implemented by an oversight group that I put in place to do that.  The recommendations that came out of the review have been attended to and they are being addressed and implemented in the context of that work.  We have some light that we are working with in respect of the author of that report as distinct from complete darkness.</p> <p>  Third, with regard to the publication of the full report as distinct from the recommendations, the board received legal advice that it would not be safe to do so.  I also sought legal advice from the Attorney General and the advice was that prior to the report being published, due process would need to be followed by way of considering publication.  My understanding is that the director now has a copy of the report and due process will be followed.  I will then seek additional advice to ensure due process has been completed and when that happens, I will ask for the report to be published.</p></speech>

A great deal of good work has been done.  That can be sensed from the comments of Mr. Pat Bergin and Professor Ursula Kilkelly from the board of management during their appearance before the committee.  Reading between the lines, there is a great deal going on.  However, according to the HIQA report published last August, the centre was not compliant with eight out of the ten recommendations in some form or another. There was significant non-compliance with two recommendations.  However, the inspection took place in March 2017 and significant work was still being undertaken.  I still have ongoing concerns about the HIQA report.  How does the Minister feel about non-compliance with eight out of the ten recommendations seven months after the initial story broke about the roof incident?</p> <p>  I ask the same question every time Mr. Pat Bergin and Professor Ursula Kilkelly appear before the committee.  How are they getting on with the OPW?  Have they sufficient funds?  The Minister announced increased funding for Oberstown in the past two budgets.  A fundamental recommendation related to doors but when they appeared before the committee last, they replied that the doors still had not been installed.  Somebody along the line is not co-operating.  The doors were a big issue and they still had not been put in.  Is the OPW slow to release funding?  Where is the problem?</p></speech>

At the same time, huge change has been taking place over the past two years in Oberstown.  First, the centre did meet a number of the standards when HIQA went in.  HIQA is doing its job, which is good.  Some of the issues the authority raised that needed immediate attention and change were addressed as a result of the report.  An action plan was developed and an agreed timescale is in place.  The Oberstown staff are responding and making changes on the basis of that.  Second, I have also indicated that in light of all the recommendations from the various reports, the working group I established to implement them amalgamated them into 120 recommendations.  They are also being implemented and monitored.  Third, HIQA judges the activity, practices, etc., on the campus and new standards are being developed.</p><p>Children have had a voice in feeding into that.  We are moving towards finalising these standards and publishing them in a relatively short time.</p><p> Everything I am describing indicates an ongoing dynamic environment, particularly considering the context.  It is disappointing when they do not make the standards, particularly in that time.  The review conducted by the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, in 2017 was important.  We have the action plan and implementation of the other recommendations.  I hope that when we move towards other inspections, there will not be as many standards that are not reached.  At the same time, it is a dynamic environment with some of our most challenging young people.  I acknowledge the incredible commitment and openness to implementing change on the part of the campus director and his team.  We have positive indications from the changes through the reduction of significant incidents over time.</p><p> There have been challenges with the issue of the doors but there have been improvements.  New and better doors have been installed in one unit and this will be extended to the other units soon.</p></speech>

It was a case of trying to get the right doors for the right environment without them being prison-style doors.  That is what took much of the time and further development.  We have sourced appropriate doors.  Unit eight is now completely fitted out with these new doors, along with other necessary alterations completed.  The unit is now occupied by a group which has transferred from another.  We will continue the progress.  We intend working through all six units in that way.  It will take up until September, depending on the demand for places from the courts.</p></speech>

The mental health and well-being of the children at the campus is, obviously, a high priority.  What percentage of the children there come from backgrounds which are the most deprived according to the national deprivation index?  I imagine it is extremely high, which makes their mental health needs more complicated with more demands.  What happens when there is a diagnosis of mental illness and how is it dealt with on the campus?</p> <p>  Is the bail supervision scheme for the Dublin Children's Court to be extended to Cork?  How many have availed of it since it was launched?  When we went to the campus last summer, we met the first child who was to avail of it.  I hope he is doing well.  I look forward to the interim data on it and the two-year evaluation and review of the scheme.  Has the Minister an update on the scheme?  Where are the children released to?  I imagine the majority are released back home.  Are there other services into which they can be released?  What age bracket does the bail supervision scheme cover?  What is the lowest age involved?  How many times has the court used this option?</p> <p>  When we visited the campus, underneath the veneer, it was at times quite fraught.  Some of us got to talk to the staff.  There was a lot of disquiet.  I accept that will happen in any place in the middle of change.  Would it be possible for the Minister to talk to the staff again when she visits the campus next?  They might be freer to discuss issues of the culture change and whether it has brought along the majority of staff.  It makes for an extremely unhappy and dangerous place when staff do not feel ownership of a new culture or management system.  I hope this has begun to heal at Oberstown.  I suggest the Minister meets with the staff separately for feedback and to see how matters are progressing.</p></speech>

The Senator's suggestion is good and I will do it again.  When I did it before, there was a respect for my request from the director and management.</p> <p>  There is a provision on-site for a multidisciplinary approach in supporting children's mental health needs.  There is better availability for psychiatric services and supports for young people.  It can become integrated with other professional services which are part of the assessment consultation therapy service, ACTS, which is on offer to these young people.  Before we attended the committee, my team and I were discussing the different activities in which these children are engaged.  We learned they are actually raising money for charities.  I was impressed with that because this is behaviour we would associate with being normal.  This impacts on their own sense of who they are and their identity.  Other young people do this and they want to do it too.</p></speech>

Out of the 69 young people on the campus, 38, that is, 55%, had a mental health need.  In addition to those 38 people, 22 have had a past or current diagnosis of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD; 32 had been involved with CAMHS at one stage of their lives; 24 of them were referred to ACTS while in Oberstown; 21 had been in care; and 17 were classified as having child protection concerns.  Those are significant statistics which is why these specialised supports are so important to these young people.</p><p>Were there some other questions?</p></speech>

To date, 25 young people and their families have been supported by the bail supervision provisions.  There are nine active cases at present and 16 cases have been closed.  The results are showing increasing compliance with the bail conditions, a reduction in the breaches of bail or any new criminal activity and the return to education has been very impressive.  By maintaining this number of young people in the community on the bail supervision scheme, there is a reduction in the need for detention places.</p> <p>  A proposal for the extension of the scheme has been submitted to the Department and we are examining it.</p></speech>

It was an eye-opener for me.  Oberstown is in my constituency and during my recent visit, I had a very thorough engagement with the staff and young adults.  I want to thank the staff in particular for their hospitality and the young adults who engaged with me.  It is incredibly disappointing that a detention centre of this nature was not designed as detention facility.  If it had been designed as a detention facility, we would not have had the basic design flaws of access to both exterior and interior first floor spaces.  The design of the doors was flawed and this is inexcusable.  The expertise is available in the State and I do not know why this expertise was not engaged to design the centre.  It obviously predates this Government.  Oberstown has been in existence for many years but some of the buildings are relatively new additions.  We have to pick up the pieces, which is both disappointing and expensive.</p> <p>  I will now elaborate on the quality of care that is being provided in Oberstown.  In some areas it is very good but improvements can be made in other areas.  Great improvements have been made in the health care provision on campus.  I refer to the availability of personnel at the appropriate levels of training on site and little things that were highlighted within the HIQA report, such as the staff not being trained up to administer an EpiPen injection or something along those lines.  It is important to have GPs on call or on campus or both.  </p> <p>  It is important that there is ongoing engagement by Oberstown with the surrounding community.  I know this was not covered in the HIQA report but I commend Mr. Pat Bergin, his staff and the team on the level of engagement with the community.   However, I personally have concerns about the security outside the campus boundaries that is provided at great cost to taxpayer, which is completely unnecessary.  I think we need to nip items such as that in the bud.  We can install improved camera systems or even feedback for the community with a liaison person, rather than spending a great deal of money on employing a man in a van, pointing in the wrong direction when I arrived and left.  I even saw this when I passed it recently.  I think this is unnecessary.  I was informed that such activities are being ramped downwards but we should be looking at them better.</p> <p>  The Minister is to be complimented on the implementation of the policy to ensure no young person has been placed in adult facilities since March 2017.  That is a significant achievement by the Minister and her officials.  It is a basic principle to which the State should adhere.  The fact that this has been managed on the Minister's watch is important.</p> <p>  The only other matter I wished to raise was single separation, which to be fair has been covered.  I appreciated the circumstances that were described to me while I was standing in a cell that is used to isolate an individual.  I appreciate entirely the circumstances that staff might find themselves, having repeatedly tried to resolve an issue.  I have no expertise in this area, but as a parent, a person who has been in a classroom and even was present during a fracas, I can understand the reason that such a facility would be important.  The prolonged use of single separation, however, is nothing short of inhumane.  I do not find it acceptable or excusable that HIQA was forced to highlight that horrific set of circumstances that were endured by an individual child.  I sincerely hope the Department and staff have learned the lessons that have to be learned in that case and that we attempt to minimise the implementation of that in the future. </p></speech>

As the Chairman has focused on the issue of single separation, it has increased my commitment and motivation to have a direct conversation on this issue with the young people when I visit there.  I will be happy to revert to the committee and have further discussions in terms of the views and feelings of the young people on their experiences in Oberstown and on whether in their view, things have improved.  I think that is a key way of learning.  We have not done that part yet in terms of moving this on.</p> <p>  I am aware that the Chairman represents that constituency and has commented on the safety issues from the community's perspective.  The Chairman has been gracious in his comments on the meeting with the director and his staff.  Certainly the next time I go to Oberstown, which as I said will be relatively soon, it may be possible for the Chairman and members of the community to join me.  I would be very happy to continue those conversations with the Chairman and his constituents.</p></speech>

When we last met some months ago, I outlined a series of measures that had been put in place in time for September 2017.  These measures were aimed at reducing the cost of child care for families and improving access to quality child care for those families who need it most.  They included, for the first time, a non-means tested universal subsidy of up to &euro;1,040 per year for children under three years of age.  They also included significantly increased targeted supports for families to assist with child care costs, facilitate return to education and employment and, where needed, intervention for children and families that need such support.  The timeframe for the implementation of these measures was tight and relied in no small part on the co-operation and engagement of child care services throughout the country.</p><p>I am delighted to report that the measures have been a great success.  To their credit, 88% of applicable child care services signed up to deliver these affordability measures.  I recognised this effort and the administrative contribution made by child care services in delivering these changes by sanctioning an additional &euro;3.5 million in non-contact time payments to child care services.  This brings the total amount paid to early years care and education services in recognition of non-contact or administrative input to &euro;18 million in 2017.  I have secured &euro;18 million in my base again for 2018 and onwards.</p><p>The information campaign to raise awareness of the new measures among parents has achieved its aims.  Across the full suite of measures, as of 12 January, almost 66,000 of our estimated 70,000 children, or 94%, are now registered for supports.  This number will continue to grow throughout the year as the door remains open for both parents and providers to sign up.</p><p>On the universal subsidy, of the 33,000 children estimated to be eligible, almost 31,000, or 94%, have registered to date.  This means the families of almost 31,000 children are now gaining a financial benefit on par with what they will receive when the full affordable child care scheme launches.</p><p>On the targeted measures, slightly more than 35,000 children are benefiting across a range of schemes, receiving as much as &euro;145 per child per week, which is a substantial increase on what was previously available.</p><p>Last April, I promised to ensure that the funds secured to provide these benefits would be delivered to families in 2017.  I am delighted that, through the hard work of child care providers, with officials from my Department and Pobal, we have been able to fulfil that promise.  I continue to encourage the small number of outstanding additional providers to sign up.  I also encourage parents with children under three years in registered child care to apply for the universal subsidy, which can amount to the equivalent of six weeks free child care based on the average figures nationally.  Parents can log onto our dedicated website, <i>affordablechildcare.ie</i>, or contact their local county child care committee for further information.</p><p>Alongside improvements to affordability, I am committed to ensuring that quality child care is also inclusive and accessible to all families.  We have made good progress in achieving this objective.  In the past three budgets, we secured a cumulative increase in the budget for early years of an unprecedented 80%.  I also commissioned an independent review of the cost of delivering quality child care by the firm, Crowe Howarth.  This report will be available by the end of the summer and will inform my proposals for further investment in the sector in budget 2019.  I regularly remind the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, of this.</p><p>We have taken tangible steps to make child care services more inclusive.  Since its introduction in 2016, our access and inclusion model, AIM, has provided targeted supports to almost 5,000 children.  Its universal measures have benefited thousands more and will continue to do so.  Equality, diversity and inclusion training is being rolled out across the country and has now reached 2,750 early years staff.  A total of 847 inclusion co-ordinators have received specialist qualifications under the leadership for inclusion programme and a further 857 early years staff have enrolled for the programme this year.</p><p>Packs of special sensory toys are about to be delivered to over 6,000 preschool rooms across the country, and training in practical skills, such as sign language, sensory integration and other specialised training is being offered free of charge to the services.  We have also ended decades of uncertainty by commencing mandatory reporting as part of the full roll-out of the Children First Act 2015.  These changes are child-centred and tangible, and will leave a legacy for our children and our society in the years to come.</p><p> While advancing these initiatives, we have also worked intensely on preparing the various components for the introduction of the fully-fledged affordable child care scheme, ACS.  We have been working on the technical, administrative and legislative aspects, and I am happy to report that significant progress has been made in the scheme's development on each count.  On the legislative components, the Childcare Support Bill 2017 was published on 12 December alongside a regulatory impact analysis of the scheme.  The Bill is an essential element in the development of the affordable childcare scheme, ensuring that it operates on a robust, rigorous and transparent statutory footing.  From the outset, I am very grateful to the committee for its participation in supporting moving it to that point.  It also enables the sharing of data with the applicant's consent, which in turn facilitates a fast, user-friendly and innovative approach to automated assessment and approval of applications.  </p><p> A key priority for me during the coming weeks and months will be to support the passage of the Childcare Support Bill 2017 through the Houses of the Oireachtas in a timely manner.  The early passage of the legislation is important in order to limit potential risks to the information and communications technology, ICT, development timelines and costs for the scheme.  This is because any potential changes that may arise during the legislative process could affect the requirements already set out for ICT development.  The earlier the legislation is passed, the more security can be given regarding ICT development timelines.</p><p> Since announcing the creation of the ACS, I have been constant in my belief that the development of this system must meet the highest standards of scrutiny and testing so that it can form the basis for generations of investment in child care in Ireland.  To this end, we submitted our plans for the development of the main IT system for the ACS to scrutiny by a peer review group at the Office of the Government Chief Information Officer, OGCIO.  This is to ensure that we are meeting the best standards across a range of measures and that mistakes of previous national IT projects are not repeated.  We passed the first stage of the peer review group process in September of last year.  I am delighted to announce today that the OGCIO has now approved the request for tender, RFT, stage. The RFT stage is a critical one and has required intensive input from all parties to get it right.</p><p> Although it is great news that the RFT has now been approved, we have experienced some delays during this stage.  Originally, we had proposed to procure the IT system via a framework agreement.  However, after detailed legal scrutiny of this agreement by the Chief State Solicitor's office, we concluded that it was not suitable for this particular development and, accordingly, an alternative approach is now being progressed.  This entails a full open tender procurement process which is, by its nature, lengthier and more complex than procuring services under a framework agreement.  The Chief State Solicitor's office gave us priority and has worked intensively with us to ensure that a rigorous, quality procurement process is conducted in the shortest possible timeframe.  My Department, in turn, is working closely with Pobal regarding the subsequent awarding and management of the contract.</p><p> Before I discuss the timeframe for the ACS, I would like to add a further point regarding the management of the project.  It may be worth noting that the programme review group, PRG, has provided positive feedback on the quality of documentation provided and the project management and governance structures that have been established and are being implemented in the process of the development of the scheme.  The PRG also confirmed its positive views on data protection measures planned for the ACS.  In regard to administrative and other components, I note that other aspects of the scheme&rsquo;s general development, such as governance frameworks, data protection policies and procedures, communications strategies and administrative arrangements are also progressing as planned.</p><p> While much has been achieved, it is not possible to set out a definitive timeline for the scheme&rsquo;s launch at this time.  As I discussed with the committee previously, this is because the timeframe is dependent upon ICT development.  We will publish the RFT in the next couple of days.  Once we have completed this stage of the IT element of the project and have the successful developer in place, we will be able to confirm and communicate a timeline for the full introduction of the scheme.  I am committed to updating colleagues on this as soon as possible.  However, given the predetermined timelines involved in an open tender process, I can confirm that the present suite of supports for families, that is, the measures introduced last September, will continue in September 2018.</p><p> The introduction of the full ACS marks a radical redesign of the legal and technical infrastructure underpinning the government&rsquo;s subvention of child care in this country.  The scheme will provide a flexible, sustainable and high-quality platform for future investment and for future generations.  It is, therefore, a system that deserves to be robustly designed and developed and rigorously tested to ensure we get it right the first time and that it serves us well over the long-term.  Families in Ireland and providers of early years care and education deserve no less.  While we continue this critical work, I want to remind the committee that the vast majority of those who will be eligible for support via the ACS when the full website and all the other aspects are in place are already receiving comparable supports through the interim measures put in place by my Department from last September.  In other words, I have sought to fast-track many of the benefits of the ACS without compromising on the rigour and time needed to develop and launch this landmark new scheme.</p><p> Budget 2018 also enabled a focus on quality measures, as outlined previously, including an increase to early childhood care and education, ECCE, capitation from September of this year to further support early years providers.  I will be happy to answer any questions.</p></speech>

It is not an easy role, and I think the Minister is doing a good job.</p> <p>  My first question on the ACS concerns the review.  I welcome that, and I am looking forward to seeing exactly what will be contained in it, as are many others.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, was mentioned.  If it is the case that the cost of child care is a lot more than what is currently being provided, which I think will be the result, does the Minister foresee measures in the next budget to deal with this?</p> <p>  My other question relates to the providers and the workers in the sector.  As the Minister knows, it is an issue that I feel very strongly about and have raised on several occasions.  More and more in my own constituency, child care facilities are being forced to close.  It is due to the fact that whatever they are getting in capitation, which I appreciate was increased in the last budget, is just not enough to help them run the business.</p><p>Staff wage increases are out the window.  Many people are leaving the sector to go into childminding in their own homes because that is more affordable for them.  Many quality staff are being lost and if we are not careful there will be a further crisis in this area.  In my constituency it is very difficult to get a child care place.  It is a strange situation because there is massive demand for such places but, unfortunately, providers are unable to keep going and often unable to retain staff.  I ask the Minister to comment on those issues.</p><p> On the childminding sector, there are some links between Childminding Ireland and the working group but would the Minister consider strengthening those links such that Childminding Ireland would encourage more childminders to register?  I understand 120 are currently registered with Tusla.  Much of the fear for childminders is that if they come out of the woodwork, for want of a better phrase, there might be tax implications relating to what they have been earning.  Childminding Ireland is well placed to be able to reassure childminders and the links with it could be strengthened.</p><p> As regards the access and inclusion model, AIM, training, it is possible it has changed but I understand there is a lottery system for people to attend it.  There are many facilities which would really benefit from that training and could use it straight away, while people from other facilities that perhaps do not need it as urgently are being trained because of the lottery system.  What is the Minister's view in that regard?  It is possible that was an initial way of introducing the training and it has since changed.</p><p> What are the guidelines in terms of getting a special needs assistant, SNA, for children in the pre-school year?</p></speech>

As regards her first set of questions, concerning the costs and work of the sector and staff remuneration, she knows I am in full agreement with her in that regard.  She also knows I have raised these issues with the sector and my colleagues in Government in the context of the importance of finding ways to address them and that the providers and people involved must be a significant aspect of the focus of investment, in particular in terms of the next budget, in the development of this radical new approach to child care, the framework and the structures for generations to come.  As the Deputy knows, that will form a significant aspect of the detail of negotiating measures in the budget for that part of my portfolio.  I do not yet know exactly what we will do differently in terms of looking for investment specifically for the sector because there is still much work to be done but that is going to be a significant aspect of my focus.  I wish to very strongly say that the sector responded very positively and professionally to the past couple of budgets and the investment in the providers and, in particular, the cost for families, with which we must also deal.  Providers have been patient in terms of recognising that much of that investment is to address the affordability issue.  This budget is our chance to address the issue of staff remuneration and that is what I have to find investment for at this time.  I understand how difficult it is to keep staff and to what extent people in the sector have upgraded and educated themselves in terms of qualifications, etc., with the support of my Department and the Government.  Such staff have been willing to step up to the plate with, and for, us and I must convince my colleagues that requires appropriate remuneration and that there will be serious consequences within the next year or two if that is not done.  I can see that coming to the same extent as Deputy Funchion and am very cognisant of it.  There is much work to do and the independent review of costs will be a key aspect of it.  That will provide us with numbers, rationale and international comparisons, etc.</p> <p>  The Deputy identified that some child care facilities may be forced to close.  The Deputy knows how upset that would make me and that my Department is available and has worked with many such facilities to ensure they do not close.  If the Deputy is aware of any facilities that have closed or are about to close and have not worked with my Department, I ask her to point them in our direction.</p> <p>  As regards the question on childminding, I have in the past few days received the report of the childminding working group of the early years forum and I will be meeting it within the next two weeks to discuss that very hefty, strong and good report.  We will take some time to go through it and begin work on an action plan for its implementation in the short, medium and longer terms.  I expect that action plan will address as much movement as possible on the issue and the support for the childminders.</p> <p>  I ask Ms McNally or Ms McGarrigle to deal with the detail of the questions regarding AIM training and the lottery system.</p></speech>

That would broadly cover most early years settings.  We were overwhelmed by the huge response in the first year of LINC.  Deputy Funchion referred to a lottery.  We tried to ensure there was a geographical distribution and so on and to take an equitable and objective approach to it but some people were disappointed.  We have now opened the second year to huge interest once more but it is probable that fewer people have been disappointed.  Some 857 graduated last year and approximately 850 have started the second year.  There will be at least another two years of LINC.  I hope that every service committed to inclusion will be able to access the course, which won an award for best online training and has been a great partnership-----</p></speech>

AIM is about identifying a child's needs and the setting needs and there are seven layers of support.  The final level of support is to reduce the ratio in the pre-school room.  The pre-school leader rather than a person with a lesser qualification may end up working with the child.  We may facilitate an additional adult in the room to assist the leader spend more time with the child who has needs, etc., such that there could be two similarly qualified people in the room.  We appreciate that staffing issues are being experienced around the country and that the difficulty in accessing staff is an issue and is impacting on AIM but we have made that funding available.  Over 2,000 children accessed supports to have an additional adult in the room last year and we are continuing to work very actively on implementing that and addressing the staffing issue which we know exists.</p></speech>

I share the sentiments expressed by Deputy Funchion and Senator Freeman regarding the progress that has been made to date.</p><p>I believe the Government is really trying to tackle the area of child care, which had been neglected for many years, looking at it not only from a societal point of view but an economic point of view in light of the changes in this area down through the years.  Child care was one of the main issues raised with us on the doorsteps in 2016.  I am sure members of the Opposition received the same feedback.</p><p> On the development of the IT system, it was stated that this will be done through a full open procurement process as opposed to a framework agreement.  Am I correct that the Department has chosen to go that route because it has to be more flexible given that there may be changes in legislation?  Perhaps the witnesses would clarify that.  It was also stated a full open procurement process would be a lengthier process.  What is the proposed timeframe around the putting in place of the necessary legislation and the installation of the new IT system?  </p><p> It was also stated that the current suite will be used in 2018.  I assume that when the new model is in place there will be a migration from the old model to the new one.  As a member of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care I support what the Minister is trying to do.  I am positive that what is being done will be done correctly and that we will get this right.  We all recall the debacle ten or 12 years ago surrounding the installation of PPARS.  I would ask the Department to be mindful of the mistakes made in that regard.  I want to see this succeed for the good of the country, such that it can be used as the benchmark for future models.  As a member of the Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care I know that the IT systems being used in the mental health services are archaic and real timing reporting is a problem.  IT systems are important in terms of user activity and addressing waiting lists.  I believe that this new system, when implemented, will not only be of assistance in terms of what we are doing in the child care space but it will also have a knock-on effect in the mental health care services area.  As I said, I have a vested interest in mental health care services.  There is potential for this system to be used in areas other than child care.  I ask the health authorities to keep a close eye on its implementation so that it might be used a benchmark for future models.</p></speech>

His last point is an excellent one.  I agree that development of this major IT infrastructure programme, which will bring together information from the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners and, thus, bring us into the 21st century in terms of infrastructure for Government services, will bring about learning for the development process for other IT initiatives, be they to amend what already exists in the mental health arena or to create something new.  It is important we do not repeat the mistakes of the past and that we get this right so that the pay-off will be not only child care infrastructure but will be beyond that indicated by Deputy Neville.  The people who are overseeing this process, including officials from my Department, the peer review group and members of the other groups established in this context, and providing us with expertise in this area may be able to offer us expertise on how to shorten timeframes as we move forward on other initiatives in the future.</p> <p>  The process of procurement that we have adopted for the website developer team has contributed to the increase in the timeframe for the development of this project.  We propose to move from a framework agreement in terms of procurement of developers to a full open tender process.  A tender document comprises more than 1,000 pages.  It will take a couple of weeks to read a tender document of that size.  We have opted for an open tender process as distinct from the framework agreement put in place by Pobal.  We also considered other framework agreements.  A full analysis was undertaken of the entire open tender process versus the framework agreements process and it was ultimately decided that an open tender approach to the procurement process was necessary to ensure the most robust procurement for a large-scale IT project.  That is the approach we were advised to take and we ultimately decided to do that.  The project will be put out to open tender and applicants will have just under 50 days to submit an application.  The applications will then be reviewed and we hope and expect that we will have a contract in place within 25 weeks and work will commence in July 2018.  I hope that explains the reason for the approach we have taken and the expected  timeframe of the process of procurement.  As I said, once the contractor has been selected we will be in a stronger position to identify when the development of the processes will be completed.  In this regard, the indicative timeframe is May 2019.  However, this cannot be confirmed until such time as a contract has been agreed, etc..  We expect to be providing subsidies for September 2019.  As I indicated, as of September 2018, families may apply for their subsidies in the same way as they did in September 2017.  As we move towards September 2019, there will be a migration to the new model and this will be fully communicated as the process progresses.  </p></speech>

We have already started that journey.  We will have national roadshows.  We had eight roadshows last year on the September measures, so there will be huge communication with providers and parents several months in advance to prepare them for that transition.  I would reiterate what the Minister has just said, that this scheme is going to deal with a range of different family needs and so forth.  In terms of the 1,000 pages to which the Minister referred, there are very detailed functional specifications set out to assist the tender, identify and give us exactly what we need.  A huge amount of work has been done on that to make sure that there is no creep and that the developer knows exactly what is required.  The advice was that we could have looked at the Pobal framework, the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, framework or the open tender option.  The latter was deemed to be the best in terms of giving us the most robust procurement.  The Minister has set out the timeframes already.  The May timeframe to which the Minister refers is indicative purely for the request for tender, RFT.  The project board, that is the governance structure over the affordable child care scheme, ACS, would say that it does not want to confirm a timeframe as of yet because good practice is to wait, as the Minister said, until the vendor is in place and has had an opportunity to look at everything and determine that it is realistic and reasonable.</p></speech>

We do not want to see a power shift to the outsourced vendor who could then hold us to ransom.  I am not saying that the vendor would do that but I am just flagging the risk.  We must think ahead in terms of two or four years.  We must make sure that there is a shift towards the Department in the context of knowledge transfer and training so that the State is in full control of that system.  I understand that maintenance and so forth will require the input of the vendor but the balance of power must lie with the Department.  It is important from an ownership and usage point of view that the Department would call all of the shots.</p></speech>

It is fair to say that in building on the initiatives of recent years, including the free scheme, tremendous progress has been made in the relatively recent past on which the Minister and her Department must be commended.  Moving us away from having the most expensive child care service in Europe towards having one of the most affordable systems for both parents and the State is entirely positive.  I am heartened to hear that funding is in place for next year for the existing arrangements on affordable child care.  I would operate on the assumption that such funding is guaranteed until such time as the universal child care subsidies are in place, although ultimately that is a matter for D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  The expenditure commitments that I would like to see are very important to that overall objective, as the Minister herself has inferred on a number of occasions.</p><p>One such commitment to which I wish to draw attention is a percentage of GDP target or average.  In the area of overseas development aid, for instance, there is a long-standing commitment to commit a certain percentage of our GDP to overseas aid which we have failed miserably to reach, repeatedly.  Indeed, we have not even come near to reaching it.  In terms of the overall objectives of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, this committee and the Government, I would like to see us spelling out our commitments with regard to how we propose to afford to get ourselves to a reasonable level of <i>per capita</i>spending on child care services and the importance of doing same, not just in terms of a conducive environment for children but also in terms of facilitating parents to do other things, whether that be education, work or otherwise.</p><p>The legislative process is something upon which the Minister can comment in terms of timelines.  I appreciate that the legalities of the tender are something about which she cannot comment.  The Bill that the Minister mentioned, which is on First Stage, is due back in the House this month, if I am not mistaken.  That is clearly an important part of this and I would ask the Minister to confirm that there is only one Bill involved or whether there will be several legislative elements to this suite of measures that she is attempting to implement.</p><p>I am assuming that the tender process is going to have the usual cool-down period, on the assumption that a tenderer emerges, of course, because this is probably incredibly complex.  Has the Department looked at other jurisdictions and how they tackle this issue?  Has it looked at how have others operated in terms of pinning together various Departments that would have the knowledge that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs would need to access to determine, from a means test perspective, who is eligible for what, how the scheme is going to be implemented and what effect it will have on child care service providers in certain communities who might have an overconcentration of parents with huge eligibility or very limited eligibility?  Crucially, has the Department given any consideration to examining commercial rates?  I appreciate that rates are not directly within the Minister's remit but commercial rates are one of the biggest bugbears of service providers to whom I have spoken.  The knock-on effect of commercial rates is an increase in costs to the user.  There is incredible disparity from one county to the next.  Some local authorities are very good with regard to setting rates while others are punitive.  As a former entrepreneur and sole trader, I see commercial rates as a cost of doing business but I also recognise that the margins are pretty tight in the child care field.  Is the issue of commercial rates one that the Minister will consider?</p><p>Aside from just throwing cash at service providers, on a per child basis, is there something that the Minister could look at structurally that makes child care businesses more viable?  Will there be some sort of national approach to this so that local authorities still get some, but not enormous, benefit?  At the end of the day, I appreciate that businesses are being run, profits are being made, staff are being paid and so on.  However, child care is such an integral part of our communities that perhaps it is time for the Government to look at this in a way that recognises that child care is not just a commercial activity but is also about the child, about education and about affording parents the time to do other things.  In that context, it is important to look at it in a slightly different way from other businesses.</p></speech>

I take on board his remarks about reviewing our targets in terms of the percentage of GDP spent on child care in the context of negotiating funding for increased investment.  Many Deputies have referred, in response to the last few budgets, to the importance of moving towards increased investment as a percentage of GDP.  Of course, if our GDP goes up then even if we do not increase the target in percentage terms, we spend more.  I am glad that the Deputy reminded me of that point and I promise to look at it in the context of preparing for the next set of negotiations.</p><p>We have been thinking we are very far behind in this context and what we need to do to catch up, but we will look at it more realistically and ensure those arguments are brought to bear in the next set of negotiations.  I agree with the Chairman on this aspect and I believe it is worth renewing our focus on that.</p><p> We will have one Bill and regulations.  My understanding is that the process will probably start in the D&aacute;il on 31 January, which is great.  I expect the co-operation of all members of the committee to move it quickly through the D&aacute;il.  We will do that together.</p><p> On the question around procurement and getting a provider or developer, the timeframe I mentioned includes a cooling-off period.  Our ICT steering group has considered best practice in this area.</p><p> Regarding the commercial rates issue, I certainly have looked at that previously.  The Chairman is right to raise it again.  It is a very important issue regarding costs.  My officials have engaged with the Department of Finance, Public Expenditure and Reform and other relevant Departments to discuss this issue.  My understanding is that such change would require a legislative change.  I will be raising this with my Government colleagues.  There is a strong case to be made for this.  As the Chairman put it, the purpose of such provision may not be fully commercial, which is part of the argument in terms of the educational aspect.  There should be scope for change.  At the very least we should have another go at this and we have been engaging on it, but it would require a legislative change.  That is another aspect we would need to consider.</p></speech>

One question I have relates to a matter Deputy Neville raised.  What role will the child care providers play in the ICT roll-out of the scheme?  I am concerned about their involvement in the new ICT set-up.  Is that being factored into the way the scheme will be rolled out in regard to data or will they have a role in it?  The Minister might answer that aspect.</p></speech>

When approved for a subsidy, they will receive a unique reference number which they will take to the provider of their choice.  The provider, in agreeing to provide services to that family, will, in turn, log on to the website and register the child using that unique number.  In that way the system will be able to join up the approval of the subsidy with the payment of that subsidy to the parents' chosen provider.</p></speech>

I thank Ms McGarrigle for that clarification.  I have two question about the heads of the Bill.  It relates to the 15 hours provision in the case of low-income parents where both parents may not be working for whatever reason.  There was a big conversation around this last year.  What is the position on the 15 hours provision?  Has that remained under the heads of the Bill?</p></speech>

The way the policy paper was developed in the first place was that the 15 hours came from evidence that exists that children benefit from 15 hours of care and education etc.  Beyond that, we know, for example, that very long hours in low-quality services may not be good for children.  Therefore, that was a consideration.  The Bill certainly allows that where there are children who may be vulnerable for one reason or another, be it homelessness, teenage pregnancy or a variety of other reasons, sponsor agreements can be entered into with Tusla, the HSE, the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Justice and Equality.  We can make a facility that children will receive much more than 15 hours.  It could be 40 hours.  That is very much central to the legislation.  The 15 hours provision would be set in the regulation.  There is the possibility in it of changing that if required.  We would pull back to the type of evidence that exists on this.  We want to do what is right for children across a range of issues.  We want to get the best outcomes for them.  That might include, on some occasions, assisting the parents into employment and avoiding them getting into a poverty trap.  It is a complex area.  That is our rationale here.  There are a number of children in this context whom public health nurses etc. have referred.  The sponsor agreement will be very much set out in the legislation.</p></speech>

Once people have identified the need, who would they approach?  I am just trying to understand the ring-fencing of the funding.  Have the witnesses got to the stage of working out that part of it?</p></speech>

We  are still working through on that.  Currently, the budget is with us.  The CCCs administer certain elements on our behalf but the budget is currently with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  We are working this through with the other Departments.</p></speech>

Generally speaking, the intention is that the funds to support the sponsor agreements are within the overall budget for the affordable child care scheme.  In other words, if it is decided that a child should be getting 40 hours of child care a week under these agreements rather than, say, 15 hours, that would be funded.  That subsidy would be provided through the affordable child care scheme budget.  That said, we will need to work out the sponsor agreement with each agency because there could be nuances within that depending on whether an agency is also contributing something towards the child care cost.</p></speech>

There is a definition of work and study in the Bill.  Some of the child care that will be made available is not only for parents who are working but for parents who are engaged in training.  We need to keep a good wide definition of training because it may very structured training but sometimes it may be more informal.  It is about how people are doing their best and struggling to get a job etc.  There will be a definition of work and study in the Bill which will provide for people being brought into the scheme through the mainstream route and the sponsor agreements will be for slightly different groups of children and families who might be in a slightly more vulnerable position.</p></speech>

We have received apologies from Deputy Brophy and Senator Leyden.  I remind members and others to switch off their phones.  We are honoured to have an engagement today with Mr. Kevin Cardiff from the European Court of Auditors.  I welcome Mr. Cardiff on behalf of the committee.</p><p>I also welcome his colleagues, in particular Mr. Janusz Wojciechowski, the Polish member of the court, and Mr. Tony Murphy.  This is the final time we expect to engage with Mr. Cardiff as his mandate finishes at the end of next month.  The committee started having an annual engagement with the European Court of Auditors some time ago and it has proved very useful for us in gaining a deeper understanding of how European money is spent and what issues are emerging.  We hope to continue with such annual engagements.  As part of the engagement last year, Mr. Cardiff suggested sending us reports issued by the court and arranged for the committee to be put on the mailing list.  Members now receive a copy of all such reports in the committee papers, which is a small but useful initiative.  <br/><br/>Mr. Murphy was nominated by the Government to replace Mr. Cardiff after an open competition and although he is here today in his current role, we welcome him and hope this is an engagement he is prepared to continue with in the future.  Mr. Murphy was last week endorsed by the European Parliament, with 592 MEPs voting to support his nomination and 56 voting against.  He won that one.  It is now up to the European Council to decide on the appointment.  We very much appreciate that the witnesses can engage with us today on the European Court of Auditors' annual report for 2016 and the EU's use of public funds.  <br/><br/>Before Mr. Cardiff gives his opening statement, I must remind all present of the rules on privilege in this Parliament.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  <br/><br/>I invite Mr. Cardiff to make his opening statement, after which I will ask members for their contributions and questions.  I again thank the witnesses for their attendance.  It is much appreciated.</p></speech>

It is our pleasure to be here and present to the committee.  This is my fifth time to appear before it.  In the first year of our engagement we did not visit the Houses but, rather, the previous committee visited us, and there is a standing invitation for the committee to visit the Court of Auditors if it has the opportunity to so do.  The Court of Auditors has a policy of trying to gradually deepen our engagement with national parliaments, some of which, such as this one, are interested in doing so although one or two others are less interested in doing so.  However, that is our policy and we are quite happy to engage with the committee at almost any time and in any way that suits it.</p> <p>  As members know, the European Court of Auditors is the independent external auditor of the European Union.  We have three roles in that we consider the accounts of the European Union, whether the spending has been legal, regular and in accordance with the rules and whether the spending has been effective.  In other words: are the accounts right, was the money spent legally and properly and did it have the intended effect.  Our annual report, which is on the budget of the European Union rather than our activities, mainly concerns the first two issues.</p> <p>  We have a number of products, including the annual report we are going to discuss, opinions on issues such as questions by the European Parliament on new legislation, special reports about effectiveness and annual reports on not just the Commission but also the various European agencies.  As members know, there are over 40 European agencies and eight or ten joint undertakings and so on.  That is all within our remit.  We also compile an annual activity report on our work, although we are not here to discuss that.</p> <p>  The current annual report on the budget of the European Union relates to 2016.  The European Commission produces its accounts in the middle of the year and we then have two or three months to prepare the annual report.  Our report on the Commission's accounts for 2016 was published in October.  We gave a clean opinion on the reliability of the accounts.  If this was a company audit, we would stop at that point, conclude that the accounts are a true and fair account of the business and walk away.  However, we also consider whether all the transactions were legal and regular.</p> <p>  As regards revenue transactions, involving money taken in, there was no question of irregularity and everything, taken as a whole, was legal and regular, as has been the case for many years.  As regards expenditure transactions, there has been a sustained improvement in the level of error we have estimated in recent years.  In 2016, it was over 3% but in previous years it had reached up to 7%.  In 2015 it was 3.8% and in 2014 it was 4.4%.  Members can see there has been some improvement in that regard.  In 2016, a significant part of audited expenditure, that is, on entitlement programmes such as the single farm payment whereby people receive a single payment or a payment as of right, was not affected by a material level of error.  We could not find sufficient errors to deem worthy of reporting.   For the first time since we began to provide a statement of assurance in 1994, we issued a qualified opinion.  We said that for this part at least, the error level was sufficiently low that it need not be worried about, but, unfortunately, there were some errors in another part.  Members can see a graph on screen which displays a trend.  Members can see we work within a certain level of confidence, similar to an opinion poll that allows a margin of error of plus or minus 3%.  We also work within those parameters.   However, the trend seems clear.</p> <p>  Entitlement payments are not a big problem.  Spending under the natural resources heading formed the biggest part of direct aid to farmers and there was an estimated level of error of 1.7% in that regard, which is below our threshold.  The level of error in respect of administration was 0.2%, which is below the threshold.  The levels of error in respect of reimbursements such as rural development programmes, cohesion programmes and so on, whereby individuals do something and then have to go back and claim for it, are far higher, being close to 5% in respect of rural development, for example.  We stated there are still problems that the European Commission needs to address in respect of that part of the audit.</p> <p>  Members can see where the money is spread, involving expenditure of &euro;15.2 billion on competitiveness, &euro;36 billion on cohesion and &euro;58 billion on natural resources, which is still the biggest area and of which rural development accounts for &euro;14 billion.  Global Europe, which accounts for all of the European Union's interaction with the wider world, including neighbouring countries, involved spending of approximately &euro;8 billion.  There is spending of &euro;63 billion on entitlement and administrative payments and the level of error in that regard is low.  We will be focusing our future efforts on reimbursement payments, which still involve a relatively high level of error and require further attention.</p> <p>  I will not address in too much depth the slide that is currently being displayed because it is a little too detailed but members have the provided literature and can see the error rates in each specific area.  Revenue totalled &euro;150 billion.  EU revenues derive from a number of sources, including a portion of VAT collected by national governments, which is then passed on to the EU.</p><p>Customs duties are mostly EU duties.  Each Government keeps a proportion of the customs duties as payment for administering the system.  However, the bulk comes from a payment made by each member state that relates to the economic activity in the country.  The more economic activity a member state has, the more it pays.  For Ireland, this is something of an issue.  If we mis-measure or if the gross domestic product and gross national income measures are not shown to have the same relevance to Ireland as to other countries, it does not matter: we still pay according to the GNI figures and not separate Irish measures.</p><p> I will run through the slides quickly.  Members can see the areas of greatest spending.  For Ireland, it depends a little on what we count but we have paid out more than we have received in recent years.  Since we joined the EEC, as it was then, we have received more, sometimes a great deal more, than we paid in.  Now, we are a little into positive territory and we are net payers.  The greatest share of our spending is under the natural resources heading of agriculture and rural development.  As members can see, were it not for that number we would be big net payers.  The reason we do not get moneys under cohesion, for example, is because our level of economic development is far higher than in many countries to the east and south east.  Such countries probably need that funding a little more.  All member states pay in according to GNI.  Ireland contributes approximately 1% of the total.</p><p> Each year for the annual report we send auditors, literally, all over the world.  They spend thousands of days of audit time in total, mostly in European countries but in other countries that receive EU money as well.  They track and test individual transactions that are taken on a random basis from the whole.  It is like a sampling approach.  We do not make findings about specific countries.  This is because even if we have thousands of transactions in total, there might only be eight or ten transactions for Ireland.  We cannot really reach conclusions about a country on the basis of ten transactions but we can reach conclusions about the whole system on the basis of thousands of transactions.</p><p> The overall picture is that the levels of errors and problems in member states and the European Commission have been decreasing.  The European Court of Auditors believes it has to reflect that improvement by issuing a different opinion this year in respect of 2016 than for every previous year.  The opinion is that for approximately half of the expenditure there is no material problem.  However, for the other half there continues to be problems that have to be addressed.</p><p> For Ireland, a relatively small number of individual transactions have been tested in recent years and there is no specific problem.  There are errors.  They tend not to be major but they exist.  However, compared to other countries there is nothing specific to say.  Indeed, I recall saying for the 2015 report when I was here last year that we found no errors from eight transactions.  In the random sample this year, there were only two or three transactions for Ireland.  There was an error but it was nothing that would make my hair stand on end or make me think there is anything special about Ireland.</p><p> That is it, really.  We can conclude there, save to say that I will explain who we have here today.  Tony Murphy has come along because he is the new member designate.  Mr. Wojciechowski is here.  He is the Polish member of the European Court of Auditors.  He is an agriculture expert and a former member of the European Parliament Committee on Agriculture and Rural Development.  He is also a former auditor from Poland.  Since we had an engagement with the agriculture committee this morning, it was useful to have him present.  He presented two of his special reports.  That is something we can do for this committee as well if members so wish.  We can present special reports as well as the annual report.  Mr. Enright works with me.  Mr. Welsh is a combination expert.  He deals with agriculture now but until recently he was the court's leading expert on the annual report.  If there are any really hard questions, I will probably ask him to answer them.</p><p> I wish to draw the attention of members to two audits we have completed.  I was in charge of them and that is part of the reason I am so close to them, but they are important for Ireland.  It is ten years on from the start of the banking crisis.  Europe has done a great deal to try to address these.  The European Court of Auditors has been looking at the systems that the euro area has set up to deal with banks in crisis in future.</p><p> I commend these audits to the committee as work that might be worthy of consideration at some later stage.  We find that the systems in place are better and new but that there are still some important technical issues that might hamper them in a future crisis and as a result they should be addressed.  In fairness, the two bodies concerned have said they will address them.</p></speech>

It is good to see everything laid out and explained in some detail.  It is important for us and the work that we are doing to be in tune with what Mr. Cardiff has been doing with the European Court of Auditors.  His replacement is Tony Murphy.  We wish him every good luck with his important role.  We look forward to keeping up the level of engagement and co-operation we have had during Mr. Cardiff's tenure.  These are appreciated by all members.</p> <p>  I welcome Deputy Mattie McGrath.  He had told me already that he was involved in another meeting up to now.  He will get a copy of the report.  We will hand over to Senator Richmond.</p></speech>

The first relates to more than 2016.  Mr. Cardiff remarked that, for the first time, Ireland has crept into the net contributor column when it comes to membership of the various European bodies.  Is there any way to work out the overall balance of Irish payments during the past 45 years of membership?  Ireland is now a net contributor.  How much has it received directly over 40 years from the European Union?</p> <p>  I hope my eyesight is good enough to see properly the slide on contributions by member states.  It is difficult not to recognise the contribution shaded in light green by the United Kingdom.  I think it reads 16% or it could be 15%.  How can this be addressed when the hole needs to be plugged come 2019?  That might be more of an issue for Mr. Murphy rather than Mr. Cardiff, who will get to leave before this becomes a problem.</p> <p>  I might have a supplementary question but I will let our guests start with those questions.</p></speech>

In particular, I welcome our Polish colleague.  I wish Mr. Cardiff's successor well.  I hope Mr. Murphy gets over the final hurdles to his appointment &ndash; I imagine he will.</p> <p>  I really have no questions.  It is a good report.  The citizens of Ireland and the EU can be reassured by this report.  Certainly, things seem to be improving.  There is a general view among citizens, especially Eurosceptics, that the EU is wasteful and so forth in respect of many of the things that it does.  That is not the problem of the European Court of Auditors.  The court is handed the schemes to audit.  The issues of waste and expenditure generally are probably more policy issues.  The court simply audits the schemes handed down.</p> <p>  I was going to ask about Ireland and whether there was anything specific to Ireland that we should be concerned about.  Our guests have answered that in the presentation.  I note that there is an issue in respect of reimbursement payments and that the court is taking measures to deal with that as well.</p><p>We are reassured by the report.  While the European Court of Auditors is not a glamorous institution and while we discuss major issues in the committee, including nothing less than the future of Europe, what the court is doing is extremely important.</p></speech>

What early work has the court done on Brexit and the future funding of the EU after the UK leaves?  My father always taught me to take everyone's advice and guidance especially when it comes to people of experience like the witnesses.  As such, is there anything they would like to point out to the committee in relation to the position after the UK leaves?  In short, the report is clear that there are improvements to be made but overall there is nothing really to worry about at present.  Do the witnesses agree that there is nothing we should be waving a red flag about at this stage?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.218" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018012400002#D00400"><p>I will take the questions in reverse order.  As to whether there is nothing to worry about, credit must be given to the European Commission for managing to reduce the level of errors in transactions.  However, when we do special reports - effectiveness reports - as to whether a programme has delivered what it was supposed to, we find many problems.  These are human systems which are about delivering money to people and so forth.  It is like any governmental or private sector entity in that it will not get 100% value for every penny spent.  However, we still find significant areas where the objectives of programmes are not being fully met.  Sometimes that is a question of programmes being overly complex.  As such, we tend to recommend quite often that something needs to be simpler.  For example, if one has a small business, farm, charity or NGO which one expects to deliver something, one reduces the value if one makes the process very complicated.  If applicants spend half their time on administration, it will reduce effectiveness relative to cost.  It is also the case that if people do not understand the rules and what is to be delivered, it makes things more difficult.</p> <p>  At government level, individual member states do not specify very well in many areas what they want to get out of each spending programme.  The European Commission often does not specify very well what it wants.  Sometimes there is an implicit agreement that everybody wants money to go to a particular sector.  What we audit against are the objectives laid down for a programme.  We discussed the young farmers' scheme this morning, for example.  I do not object to younger farmers getting an additional payment, but the scheme has not been demonstrably delivering more young farmers on farms.  As auditors, we ask, if the objective is not just to pass on money but to change behaviour, whether that has been delivered.  Often, we find it has not.  As the Commission and European system generally reduces the amount of problems in terms of technical errors, waste, fraud and so on, we have more time to think about how well programmes perform in delivering their objectives.  It is hard to point to particular areas, as this happens almost everywhere.  That is why we produced 25 to 30 special reports on effectiveness this year.  As the committee has individual areas of interest, it might find some of those reports useful.  We can happily be in touch and tell the members what we found in particular areas if that is useful.  That is the next area - how well programmes perform.</p> <p>  As to when the UK leaves, the one thing that is clear is that the system will be different.  For Ireland, and leaving my auditor's hat off for a moment, this is a potentially major game changer.  We know that.  I am not going to say anything people do not know because that much is evident.  The real question for a committee like this is not just whether the major policy work is being done, as we see the big negotiations and statements, which are really important.  However, there is a huge amount of purely technical work that has to be done to avoid errors and the problems that can arise where a business has a Northern Ireland and a Southern Ireland operation, for example.  We have to avoid situations where, for purely technical reasons, such a business cannot pass its raw materials back and forth without a great deal of customs' administration.  We have to avoid the danger that our goods in transit across the UK might move more slowly than they do now.  We have to avoid all of the potential pitfalls of failing to have all the rules checked for Brexit impact - Brexit-proofed, in other words - and then adjusted as necessary.  The danger is that dealing with the big questions is so difficult and important that it sucks time away from the other important job, which is to look at all of these technical issues one at a time across the whole system.  I do not audit in Ireland so I do not know how well advanced the Irish system is, but I would have thought this is the crucial thing, not just that big questions are addressed, but that these smaller but very important technical matters are dealt with on time.  Whether that is possible, I do not know.  However, one of the issues the bigger discussions are covering is whether there should be transitions and so forth.</p> <p>  We have not done much early work on Brexit because we do not yet have anything to audit.  We do not know what the deal is or what arrangement will be put in place.  An auditor typically goes in and asks how such and such stands against the rules and expectations.  So far, it is not clear what the rules and expectations will be.  When it comes to calculating the bill, however, some of that will be done on the basis of what the audited accounts say and we are the auditors.  As such, we will be paying a great deal of attention to ensuring the accounts are right for that purpose so that people can rely on our work.</p></speech>

I am sure it is, but we could not give a figure right now.  In general, the Commission publishes its interpretation of the net balance for each member state and it is possible to go through the reports for a number of years to come up with those figures.  Speaking as a British citizen at this moment, it should be borne in mind that working out the net contribution and working out the benefits and costs of being a member of the Union are not quite the same thing.  There are lots of benefits which are not budgetary.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.220" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018012400002#D00600"><p>Mr. Cardiff spoke about young farmers and proofing schemes and programmes.  I will give an example of how the delivery of funding can go very far off the rails.  One could go to an agricultural college 30 years ago for a period of not even 12 months.  One started in September and did one's exam in June and one got one's green certificate.  All that was required of one was to get one's green certificate.  To get one's green certificate today, one has to go to agricultural college for two years and one must go to a placement farm for 12 weeks.  One must really jump through hoops to come away with the same piece of paper that one could get very easily 30 years ago.  The amount of money and benefits that were in place 30 years ago were far greater for that young farmer than today.  One has to do a lot more today to get this magic piece of paper but one gets far less as a result.  That is what upsets people in the farming community.  I know it is not under Mr. Cardiff's remit, but the court is proofing the money and the various programmes.</p><p>However, members of the farming community in Ireland are treated like criminals.  If a farmer makes a mistake filling out a form, or doing anything, a big finger of suspicion is pointed at him or her.  If anyone else makes a mistake filling out a form, that is called a mistake.  When one is involved in farming and receiving money, one is treated like a criminal.</p><p> I will give a further example of how crazy the whole thing has become.  I am currently dealing with a commonage in which there were eight farmers.  For three days, the eight farmers fought to keep a fire out of their land.  The fire brigade was there every day, and they did their best to fight this fire and stop it from coming onto their land.  It eventually did come onto it, and their land was burned.  Legal restrictions applied at this time of year.  Remember, they had been killing themselves trying to keep it out.  What was the first thing the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine did?  It stopped their payments.  </p><p>  I went to the Department and said that this was crazy and wrong.  I pointed out that the Department was penalising people who were coughing and choking in the attempt to keep this fire out of their land.  They did not start it but they did try to stop it.  The Department's answer to me was that the officials were terrified of being audited.  They were afraid of the consequences if it came to light that this land was burned illegally and money had been given without the farmers lodging an appeal.  Even though the Department knew that the farmers should have received their money, it stopped the payments.  That way, the only thing the farmer could do in response was submit an appeal, and the Department would have its paperwork right it was audited.  That is what it was down to; being ready for an audit.</p><p> Where does common sense come into situations like that?  That is the reality.  The witnesses are doing their job excellently.  They are charged with making sure that there is value for money, that there is no wastage and that the money is properly received.  Sometimes, however, the things that happen in the middle lose all touch with reality.  The incident of the commonage fire is a classic example of bureaucracy gone mad.</p><p> The other public representatives here, especially people who represent rural areas like my own, really know what I am talking about.  I am sure the witnesses do too.  I am sure they have heard these examples throughout their careers, but it is an interesting thing for them to know.  I ask Mr. Murphy in his new role, when dealing with people who might not have the same common sense as him, to try to impart a little bit of it upon them.  He can always give them the example of the farmers fighting a fire for three days only to have their payments stopped.  They still have not been paid.  That is just an example. </p></speech>

Mr. Cardiff commented that he has not seen a rise in the number of young farmers following the European Union's investment.  That is true.  I am a farmer myself, and it is a battle for us to keep our young people in farming.  The first reasons for this are the anti-social hours and seven-day working week.  During the boom, there were much more lucrative opportunities elsewhere.  Some young people have returned since then.  However, it is a huge hurdle to get them into the farm colleges, to get them on placements, etc.  The biggest killer of all is bureaucracy.  Deputy Healy-Rae and I are taking up this issue in our own Parliament.  I mean no disrespect to my colleagues here.  There are huge issues around farmers not receiving payments.  The penalties were mentioned.  They are huge and very excessive.  I refer to 100% penalties.  Yesterday, Deputy Healy-Rae mentioned a farmer participating in a slurry scheme.  He raised capital from leasing instead of being financed from his bank, and a 100% penalty was imposed.  That is criminal behaviour on the part of the people imposing the penalties.  This is a special scheme.</p> <p>  In the same way, many payments have been outstanding for two years.  The only excuse the Minister can give for this is to cite computer glitches and errors.  The Taoiseach said he would raise it with the Irish Farmers Association, IFA, at its annual general meeting.  The IFA is the main farming organisation, whose AGM the Taoiseach was attending that evening.  Meanwhile, if the farmer makes the mistake, he is criminalised.  Massive penalties are applied, and if the issue is anything to do with taxation, punitive interest and penalties apply.  For his payments, however, he has to wait.  This affects the small businesspeople and small suppliers who are supplying these farmers.  These are honest, decent people who want to pay their way and always do.  They cannot do so because of a computer glitch.  This is happening in a minority of cases, but those cases are real.</p> <p>  I refer again to penalties and schemes.  The latest one I saw was when I was speaking on climate change.  A colleague arrived and sat beside me.  He opened his laptop, and a picture of a tractor and a plough appeared.  That always catches my eye because I am a ploughman, a farmer and a man of the soil.  Not a bogman, I note, but a man of the soil.  I learned then of a new EU directive stipulating that farmers could now only plough uphill.  I do not know who thought of that, or where he came from.  Deputy Healy-Rae will know of many areas in Kerry where one could not plough uphill, as a first objection.  Second, that will cause far higher emissions and carbon monoxide output through use of diesel.  We cannot use a horse because the EU will not allow us.  A horse could break wind and cause air pollution.  It has gone bonkers.</p> <p>  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, said during the budget debate that a scheme which forced women out of the workforce when they got married was bonkers.  Many of the things that come from the EU are bonkers, and to a lot of them are added Irish statutory instruments which are even more bonkers.  We are even more zealous in tying ourselves up in red tape, but we keep complaining that there are no young farmers and no production agriculture, only ranches.  This must be dealt with.  Fair play is fine play with me.</p> <p>  I am not talking about people who deliberately make false claims on commonage, as has sometimes occurred.  They must be punished.  The ordinary farmer, however, is struggling with machines and equipment.  He is trying to upskill himself and his family and keep his farm viable and in the family.  Family farmers are the backbone of this country, and they must be supported and protected.  They need no special favours, but they must be allowed to breathe, and not be smothered with bureaucracy and farm inspections.</p> <p>  During the talks to form this Government, there was talk of a system of yellow cards and red cards for inspections.  Inspections on farms are carried out on the mornings of funerals, when someone has died.  That would never happen in the countryside because everyone respects the dead, and a funeral is meitheal.  This applies especially in the northern part of my own county.  It is atrocious.  I live in the southern region, where it is not half as bad.  Over-zealous inspections are literally terrorising people who are trying to do their best.  The same is true with the restrictions on spreading slurry under Council Directive 91/676/EEC, the nitrates directive, which operates according to calendar dates.  It is nonsensical.  There can be the finest of weather outside of allowed dates, and a farmer cannot spread slurry.  </p> <p>  These schemes were never in the bog or on the farm.  </p></speech>

He was talking about the protection of the schemes from a financial point of view and delivering results on the ground.  He said it was important that they provided value for money, and that it means something to the recipient of the money at the end of the line.  He also said it was important that the recipient would not have to spend so much money that the payment would not actually be worth their while.  That is the way I understood it.  It is good to have this level of engagement about all aspects of the issue.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.239" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1319" speakername="Michael Healy-Rae" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018012400002#E01900"><p>It is great to broaden a debate, especially with our guests.  It is our chance to let them see the type of problems that we, as representatives, deal with among the people who are affected, either positively or negatively, by the different funding streams.</p><p>Do the witnesses see and understand the type of problems that we as representatives encounter when we are dealing with those who are so affected, positively or negatively, by the different funding streams that come through?</p><p> As we are talking about family farms, I want to make one small point.  The witnesses are all aware of the tradition going back over hundreds of years that, if there were five children in a family, the eldest child would inherit the farm.  There might have been a little bit of envy on the part of the other siblings because the eldest would have a way to make a living and would be set up because he or she would have the land.  However, now we are living to see the most unusual thing; the eldest children do not want to get the farm.  They want to be the first out of the traps to go away and get a job, leaving the other siblings at home.  It is the youngest ones who are left holding the can.  Before, it was an honour and a great thing to inherit a farm.  Now, there is a generation of young people growing up who do not want to inherit the farm because they do not see it as a viable way of making a living, especially if it is a small farm.  As Deputy McGrath said, we cannot all be big ranchers.  That is how far gone we are now in Ireland, especially with the small, traditional family farms.  The children feel they cannot afford to be farmers.  That is an awful sad reflection on all of us in Ireland and over in Europe.  It is a sad day.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018012400002#F00200"><p>Deputy McGrath's points are very interesting.  In Ireland, we might do eight inspections in a year.  Those auditors who might be turning up on a funeral day for an inspection - they are not us, just to be clear.  We do often say to the European Commission that it needs to get the rate of errors down and be tighter around controls sometimes.  At the same time, we are calling for simpler schemes so that it is harder to make accidental mistakes and so that people do not need to do a third year of agricultural college just to understand the scheme.  People should be able to engage better with the schemes, so that they do not claim simply because it is too much trouble.  All of these things undermine the potential for a scheme to deliver what it is supposed to.</p> <p>  On the young farmers, we do not, as a court of auditors, object to money going to young farmers.  That is a policy choice of the European Union.  It is a democratic decision and we would never challenge it.  What we are saying is that money to support young farmers should be delivered in a way that actually supports them.  At the moment, it might not make any difference to a decision, for example if a young person is trying to decide whether to become a farmer or a family is trying to decide how to distribute a farm.  This payment should make a difference.  It should not be something that one will get either way.  It should not be something people will just find a way around.  It should make a difference to behaviour if it is to be effective as an incentive.  We did not find that it was an effective incentive.  Perhaps it is too widely spread or not targeted enough.  It was not actually changing the behaviour of individuals very much.</p> <p>  In Ireland, we deal with the kind of farm structures that are here.  In some of the other countries where we do audits, the average farm size might be 3 ha or 4 ha, not even 10 h, 15 h or 20 ha.  Each country has a different set of problems and the European-level schemes will always be at a loss to cope with national-level problems.  There needs to be a good, effective policy-making step at the national level as well, when individual agriculture Ministries are deciding how to apply the flexibility they have been given at the European level.  Every country is really quite different and therefore needs to have and use a level of flexibility.</p> <p>  I will let Mr. Wojciechowski speak because he is much more expert than I.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.242" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Janusz Wojciechowski" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2018012400002#F00300"><p>I fully agree with my colleague.  I also agree with Deputy McGrath that bureaucracy is a very big problem in the European Union.  This is one of the conclusions of our report which was presented to the agriculture committee today.  In respect of the Rural Development Programme, RDP, the European Commission requires too much.  In the financial period 2007 to 2013, the average size of the programme document was 400 pages.  In the next period, it was 700 pages.  It contained a lot of data that was interesting for academic discussion but not for the farmers.  The Irish RDP was one page shorter.  In respect of absorption of the RDP, Ireland is in second place.  Finland has 43% absorption and Ireland has 38%.  The average size, four years into the current financial period, is 21%.  It is therefore a better situation in Ireland.</p> <p>  I presented two reports about the RDP and the young farmers scheme.  We have very serious problems with agriculture in the European Union.  During the last decade, we have lost 4 million farms.  We have lost almost 20 million in respect of land declared by the farmers to the Common Agricultural Policy, CAP.  We have a very difficult problem with the generational situation among farmers.  Some 80% of farmers are older than 45 and one third of European farmers are older than 65.  In a country like Portugal, over 50% of farmers are aged over 65.  My country of Poland has one of the best situations.  Interestingly, this positive result in support for young farmers in Poland was achieved by support for the old farmers.  There is a special pension system and there are other supports for them.</p> <p>  We have two levels of bureaucracy, European and national.  I made a similar presentation to today's at the Polish Parliament.  I presented the young farmers report, for which Poland was one of the countries audited.  I would say that the European Court of Auditors has nothing against Polish farmers.  There are no abuses or irregularities.  However, a representative of young farmers who was there said the Polish authority had a lot of objections against them.  Some 3,000 farmers were forced to reimburse part or all of the funding.  It was surprising.  The national authority created additional requirements to those of European law.  From our point of view, everything was okay.  From a national point of view, there was a big problem.</p> <p>  The main problem of European agriculture is a lack of long-term vision for the future, beyond the next seven years.  We are used to planning agriculture policy over seven-year periods.</p><p>It is necessary to have a long-term vision of what European agriculture will be like from 2040 to 2050.  How many farms will there be, how many farmers, and what will the model of farming be, whether family farming or industrial farming?  This is a political choice.  It is a necessary discussion about the long-term vision of agriculture, not just for seven years, which is not enough.  It should be the vision for a longer time.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I thank them for attending the meeting.  The format of the meeting is that each chief officer will be invited to make a brief opening statement which will be followed by questions and answers.</p> <p>  Before beginning, I draw the witnesses' attention to privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p> <p>  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I ask members and witnesses to ensure their mobile telephones are switched off or placed in flight mode as they caused considerable disturbance with the broadcasting equipment last week.  Mobile phones interfere with the system and make it difficult for parliamentary reporters to report the meeting.  In addition, television coverage and web streaming may be adversely affected.</p> <p>  Any submission or opening statement made to the joint committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  I invite each of the chief officers to make their opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.253" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018012400002#B00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to attend today's meeting.  I am joined as a witness by Dr. Brendan McCormack, executive clinical director for mental health services.  I am the chief officer of CHO area 7 and I am responsible for the management of Health Service Executive services, excluding acute hospital care, in this area.  I report to the national director for community operations.</p> <p>  CHO area 7 includes County Kildare, west County Wicklow, most of south County Dublin and most of the Dublin City Council area south of the Liffey.  The area had a population in 2016 of 697,000, an increase of 33,175 or 5% on the 2011 figure.  A total of 43% of the population are below average on the deprivation indices.</p> <p>  The mental health service reports to me through the head of service.  There is one executive clinical director and one area director of nursing.  The mental health management team also includes allied health professionals and service user representation.  A separate management structure is in place for the Kildare area, with a clinical director and director of nursing reporting directly to the head of mental health. </p> <p>  The mental health service in CHO area 7 operates across a number of specialist domains, including general adult, old age, child and adolescent, and mental health of intellectual disability.  The general adult services are community oriented, with an emphasis on delivering secondary care in the community.  The access team provides mental health services to the homeless population in south Dublin.  In addition, a perinatal service is provided to the Coombe hospital.  Rehabilitation teams are in place in Kildare and Tallaght, with recruitment under way for a team in the St. James&rsquo;s sector.</p> <p>  The HSE national counselling service, NCS, provides counselling to adults who have experienced childhood abuse.  The counselling in primary care service, CiPC, delivers short-term counselling to those with mild to moderate mental health issues who have been referred by their general practitioner.  The service is currently available to general medical scheme, GMS, card holders only.</p><p> In total, there are 905 whole-time equivalent staff, WTEs, employed in mental health services in CHO 7.  That is outlined in the appendix to our statement.</p><p> The mental health service in CHO 7 has a budget of &euro;93 million in 2018.  That has increased from a budget of &euro;74.69 million in 2012.  The budget is split between pay and non-pay expenditure by a ratio of approximately 70:30.</p><p> There are 12 general adult community mental health teams, which form the core of service delivery.  These include three teams in the St. James&rsquo;s sector, four in the Tallaght sector and five in the Kildare and west Wicklow sector.  Referrals are mainly from primary care GPs and provide a range of interventions, often long term.</p><p> There are three psychiatry of later life, POLL, teams, and hospital liaison services are also provided.  There is one rehabilitation team in each of the Tallaght and Kildare services, with a third to commence in the St. James's sector in 2018.  A Vision for Change recommends that mental health services for people with an intellectual disability should be provided by a specialist team.  Under the chairmanship of Dr. Brendan McCormack, a new management team, including the HSE and voluntary agencies, is in place to oversee this development.  These will be catchment area-based services.</p><p> The HSE Linn Dara child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, has seven community mental health teams.  They are supported by an adolescent day hospital team based at Cherry Orchard.  However, services in Tallaght, Templeogue, Rathfarnham, Crumlin, Drimnagh and Walkinstown are provided through the Lucena Clinic service, which is under the governance of CHO 6.</p><p> There are 132 adult acute inpatient beds in CHO 7, with access to another ten beds in Midland Regional Hospital at Portlaoise.  Some 52 beds serve the Tallaght sector, 51 beds serve the St. James&rsquo;s sector and 29 are in Naas.  There are eight hostels catering for 100 residents, and an additional 70 low support and medium support places are also provided.  The 24-bed Linn Dara CAMHS inpatient unit is one of four inpatient units in the country.  It also has an integrated school.</p><p> The CHO 7 mental health engagement area lead was appointed in 2017 and sits on the management team.  There are local monthly forums in place across the CHO.  These structures will be developed further in 2018.  Learning from the views and experiences of service users, family members and carers ensures they are central to the design and delivery of services.</p><p> There are three resource officers for suicide prevention.  Our Connecting for Life action plan will be launched next month.  Work will continue to reduce the levels of self-harm and suicide in close collaboration with statutory and voluntary partners.  Approval has been given for five additional posts in 2018 to develop a seven-day service in the St. James&rsquo;s sector.  That will mean that all sectors in CHO 7 have seven-day cover.</p><p> In addition, funding has been provided in 2018 for 16 assistant psychologists and four staff grade psychologists.</p><p> A regional specialist community eating disorder team for child and adolescent patients will commence this year.  Work is also ongoing on a new attention deficit hyperactivity disorder, ADHD, clinical care pathway service in south-west Dublin.  The new children&rsquo;s hospital is located within CHO 7 and includes 20 mental health beds, eight of which will be for eating disorders.  The operational arrangements for these beds are currently being worked through.</p><p> Recruitment and retention of staff is a significant challenge in CHO 7.  Many staff members commute long distances.  Shortages of medical staff have led to agency usage.  Nursing recruitment particularly impacts on all services.  The physical infrastructure for many of our services is poor.  Capital planning to replace the Lakeview unit at Naas General Hospital is currently under way.  St. James&rsquo;s Hospital's  acute mental health unit is currently being refurbished.  A lack of long-term care options creates pressure on acute beds and the cost of private placements is significant for the service.</p><p> Other priority developments for the service include a home-based treatment team for Kildare and enhanced rehabilitation services in Dublin South-Central.  I refer also to the need to further develop psychiatry of later life services.  Bids have been submitted for additional funding in 2018 to address these areas.</p><p> That concludes my statement.  I have also included some information in the appendix to my written remarks.  I am grateful again to the committee for its consideration of these matters, and I am happy to assist further in any questions.</p></speech>

I am joined by the head of mental health services at CHO 8, Ms Siobh&aacute;n McArdle.  Ms Anne Kenny, the head of finance, is also in attendance.  I am the chief officer of the HSE midlands, Louth, Meath community health care organisation, referred to in documents submitted to the committee as CHO 8.   I am responsible for the overall management of all HSE services in the area, excluding acute hospital care.</p> <p>  The HSE midlands, Louth, Meath CHO area covers six counties, namely, Louth, Meath, Longford, Westmeath, Offaly and Laois.  The region has a total population of 619,281 per 2016 census figures, which represents a 4.5% increase on 2011 figures.  While the CHO has the fourth largest population when compared to other CHOs, it has the highest number of children and young people.</p> <p>  The CHO was established in 2015 and comprises two previously separate health service areas, the midlands and Louth-Meath.  The mental health service of the CHO is one of four divisions which make up the community health care portfolio.  The other divisions are primary care, social care, including for older people and those with a disability, and health and well-being.  Acute hospital services in the CHO region are provided by three different hospital groups, namely, the RCSI Hospitals Group, the Ireland East Hospital Group and the Dublin Midlands Hospital Group.  Those hospitals are referred to in the appendices attached to the documentation submitted. </p> <p>  The mental health service in the midlands, Louth, Meath, CHO operates as two service entities, with shared governance for the overall service operating through the office of the head of service, Ms Siobh&aacute;n Mc Ardle, who reports to me as chief officer.  There are two executive clinical directors, Dr. Maurice Gervan in the midlands and Dr. Emir Niyazi in Louth-Meath.  There are also two area directors of nursing.  All mental health management teams in the region are multidisciplinary in membership and include occupational therapy, psychology, social work, speech and language therapy, dietetics and most importantly, service-user representation.  This reflects the multidisciplinary nature of modern mental health services.  A broad range of services support the mental health and well-being of the population of this CHO.  Specialist mental health services are provided through child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, general adult mental health teams and psychiatry of old age teams across the region.</p> <p>  The mental health service in our CHO has made a strategic commitment to embed recovery within everything we do.  This vision will be achieved collaboratively using the expertise of people with lived experience, HSE staff, non-governmental organisations, NGOs, local authorities and other stakeholders relevant to the experience of the recovery journey.</p> <p>  There is a total of 1,081 staff employed in the midlands, Louth, Meath CHO mental health service.  Services are provided through multidisciplinary teams.  This is consistent with best practice and in line with government policy as detailed in A Vision for Change.</p> <p>  The mental health service in the CHO has a budget exclusive to mental health services.  In 2018 this is set as &euro;95.517 million, which represents an increase of 21.3% from the 2015 budget of &euro;78.735 million.  I know that the Chair was anxious to get figures on CAMHS that I had not included in the report.  I have them now and can provide them.  The CHO's budget for CAMHS is &euro;11.6 million.  That represents 12% of the mental health budget for the region.  The mental health budget represents 18% of the overall CHO budget.</p> <p>  The programme for Government development funding has been provided to the CHO to develop the new acute mental health facility adjacent to Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital in Drogheda and to develop child and adolescent community mental health teams across the CHO along with general adult community mental health teams.</p> <p>  There are 17 community mental health teams providing services to the general adult population with moderate to severe mental health disorders.  Five of the teams are fully staffed per A Vision for Change.  The remainder are operating with approximately 70% of recommended staffing levels.  Again, I have included this information in the appendices.  Recently opened primary care centres in Mullingar and Kells provide accommodation for community mental health teams alongside their primary care colleagues.</p> <p>  There are five psychiatry of old age teams in the CHO providing community-based and residential services to older people with mental health difficulties.  In this service, only one of the teams is operating with less than the recommended staffing levels.  Specifically, that is the service in Meath.  There are 11 child and adolescent mental health teams in the CHO providing community-based services to children, young people and their families.  The service currently operates with only 60% of the recommended members of the multidisciplinary team.  The development of the CAMHS teams is ongoing.</p> <p>  Specialist mental health services are provided through a range of specialist teams, including teams for mental health intellectual disability, rehabilitation and recovery and liaison services.  It is important to note that the developments in this area have been slow, and there is a need for further investment and development of these services.</p><p>Community teams are supported by day hospitals and inpatient units where necessary.  There are 116 acute beds provided in three inpatient units in the midlands, Louth and Meath.  Ten of these beds are used to provide services to people from Kildare, as Mr. David Walsh mentioned.  There are 108 continuing care beds in three approved centres in the region, including services provided by psychiatry of old age.  In addition, the service supports people with high, moderate and low-support needs to live in the community.  Services work closely with local authorities and housing agencies to support those with housing needs.<br/><br/>The mental health service is responsible for the provision of counselling in primary care, CIPC, and the national counselling service, NCS.  The CHO funds a number of agencies to provide supports to the population in the area, for example, Mental Health Ireland.  There are three resource officers for suicide prevention in the CHO who co-ordinate activities in respect of suicide prevention.  This office is the first point of contact for those affected by issues associated with suicide and self-harm.<br/><br/>I will now speak on some of the specific initiatives we have been working on and our achievements in recent years.  The mental health service appointed an area lead for mental health engagement in 2017.  It is important to acknowledge that this individual has been the leader in encouraging user engagement with services.  We are committed to ensuring that service users, family members and carers are central to the co-production, design and delivery of mental health services.  This builds on the foundations laid by the mental health services consumer panel in Louth Meath.<br/><br/>Our CHO has been successful in securing moneys from the service reform fund in order to refocus existing services to a recovery-based model.  Our three-year plan will facilitate the advancement of recovery initiatives and the enhancement of employment opportunities and will allow support service users to transition from accommodation by the HSE.<br/><br/>The CHO is committed to the full implementation of Connecting for Life, Ireland&rsquo;s national strategy to reduce suicide.  The launch of our CHO Connecting for Life plan will take place in March 2018.  This multi-agency plan has been developed in partnership with service users, family members and carers across the region during 2017.  The plan was informed by a public consultation process involving staff, members of the public and key priority groups.<br/><br/>The CHO has been allocated additional funding to develop and enhance community-based seven-day mental health services for existing users of the services provided by general adult community mental health teams.  This is a positive development through which service users can access appropriate services at the weekend instead of presenting at accident and emergency departments.<br/><br/>One of the challenges we face relates to the difficulty of securing sufficient recurring funding for a number of services in our CHO.  The programme for Government funding is used to develop and implement A Vision for Change.  Given that the policy A Vision for Change<i></i>is now over ten years in existence, it does not reflect changes that have occurred in HSE community health care in recent years.  There is a challenge in funding services not described in A Vision for Change.  Funding does not cover the additional cost of employing agency staff while waiting for permanent staff to be recruited.  Non-recurring funding for 2018 is &euro;5 million or 5.2% of the budget.<br/><br/>The three areas that are being discussed today have experienced the highest increases in population due to being in or on the commuter belt.  There has been significant and consistent population growth in the CHO in recent years.  This has created a corresponding increase in demand for all services, particularly CAMHS, across the region.  All teams are working to ensure that targets relating to waiting times for services meet national key performance indicators.<br/><br/><b><i></i></b>My colleague, Mr. Walsh, has already discussed recruitment, so I will address clinical accommodation.<b><i></i></b>The rate of capital investment in permanent clinical accommodation has not kept pace with staffing increases in our mental health teams across the region.  Delays in the development of primary care centres in key urban areas have resulted in an over-reliance on leased or shared accommodation.  This gap impacts on productivity and staff retention.<br/><br/>Specialist mental health services for adults and children with an intellectual disability are underdeveloped in our CHO.  The service welcomes any additional investment in these teams to ensure equitable access to mental health services for children and adults with an intellectual disability.<br/><br/>I thank the Chairman and members for their attention and for their interest in the mental health services in CHO 8.  I acknowledge the strong commitment of all staff working in the mental health services and in the national division who support us.  Through them, we are committed to providing safe, high-quality, recovery focused person-centred services.  My colleagues and I are happy to assist with any questions or clarifications members may wish to raise.</p></speech>

I thank the Chair and members for the invitation to attend.  I am joined by Ms Angela Walsh, head of service for mental health in CHO 9.<br/><br/>I am the chief officer in CHO Dublin north city and county, which is the best description of the area, rather than a number.  Similar to my colleagues, I am the accountable officer for the provision of community services.  I am committed to integration between primary and secondary care.  We work closely with acute hospital services in a co-ordinated way around the assessed needs of the client.  This is done in conjunction with Beaumont Hospital, Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown, the Mater Hospital and the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street.<br/><br/>CHO Dublin north city and county is one of nine community health care organisations in Ireland and is responsible for providing care services to a population of 621,405 within the geographical district of Dublin north city and county.  I have included details of the area in appendix 1.  There are high levels of need within the inner city as a result of socioeconomic and ethnicity reasons.  The population of CHO Dublin north city and county has seen an increase from the last census of approximately 6.9%.  One of the fastest-growing constituencies in Ireland is Dublin Fingal and the Dublin City Council area has experienced a population increase of 4.8%.  Population growth has been a considerable factor in increasing demand for services in recent years and presents a significant challenge in the context of service planning and delivery in Dublin north city and county.<br/><br/>From a governance perspective, as chief officer, I work closely with the national director of community services, Ms Anne O'Connor, and her team in implementing the national priorities.  This is managed through a series of performance meetings with the national divisions.  As head of service for mental health, Ms Angela Walsh, chairs the CHO mental health management committee, which has representatives from all disciplines to ensure there is a wide range of expertise who can represent the views of service users, carers and family members.  The governance structure is in appendix 3.<br/><br/>I will expand further on service provision for CAMHS.  In CHO Dublin north city and county, there are eight child and adolescent mental health teams providing mental health services through assessment and treatment at outpatient clinics and in the day hospital.  These teams are operating, as set out in A Vision for Change, staffing levels at an average of 66.5%.  The CAMHS inpatient 12-bed unit, St. Joseph&rsquo;s, is operated by St. Vincent&rsquo;s Psychiatric Hospital in Fairview.  The CAMHS consultants provide 24-7 cover to the inpatient unit of the latter and to the emergency department at the Children&rsquo;s University Hospital, Temple Street.<br/><br/>There are 20 general adult mental health teams providing mental health services to the population.  Four of the 20 adult teams are fully staffed as set out in the policy A Vision for Change<i></i>and the remainder are operating at an average staffing level of 65%.  General adult acute inpatient care is provided in four locations, with a total of 125 beds.<br/><br/>There are two psychiatry of old age teams in CHO Dublin north city and county.  These teams are operating at 53.3%, as set out in A Vision for Change.  There are 12 acute assessment beds - six in the Aishlin centre at Beaumont Hospital and six in St. Vincent&rsquo;s Psychiatric Hospital, Fairview.<br/><br/>There are a number of day hospitals, eight general adult, one CAMHS and three psychiatry of old age day hospitals with service user led recovery-based hubs within CHO Dublin north city and county.  In addition to the day hospitals there are sub-specialist services including four rehabilitation psychiatry teams and three liaison psychiatry teams reaching into Beaumont, Connolly and the Mater and one homeless community mental health team.<br/><br/>We have one a mental health intellectual disability service, which is operated by the HSE's St. Joseph&rsquo;s service in Portrane in partnership with two section 38 agencies, providing assessment and treatment to clients attending their services.  It is important to note that St. Joseph&rsquo;s intellectual disability service, although providing mental health and intellectual disability, MHID, services is funded through national social care.  I have given significant detail on the totality of the bed capacity for continuing care in appendix 4.<br/><br/>The overall staffing for CHO Dublin north city and county mental health service is 1,232 whole time equivalent as at November 2017 census.  The single biggest challenge for mental health services in terms of recruitment is mental health nursing.  Since 2013 there has been an average of between 35 to 45 whole time equivalent on-going vacancies that remain unfilled in mental health nursing across all services.<br/><br/>The overall budget for CHO Dublin north city and county mental health services in 2017 was &euro;114.458 million, which included an allocation of &euro;14.233 million for St. Vincent's Psychiatric Hospital, Fairview, the section 38 service provider.  The allocation for 2018 has been increased by &euro;2.6 million, or 2.35%.  The budget for the mental health is provided in appendix 6.  I am aware the committee wish to have some level of details on funding and this is the best breakdown we can give in terms of CAMHS, general adult community mental health and psychiatry of old age.  I can discuss that further if they so wish.<br/><br/>CHO Dublin north city and county received programme for Government funding of more than &euro;2 million since 2013 for recruitment to posts under A Vision for Change and new developments in line with the HSE clinical programmes for mental health.</p><p>These additional posts have been welcomed in enhancing service delivery with a focus on recovery.</p><p> I will address the challenges and opportunities for a moment.  The population growth within my and my colleague's area has resulted in an ongoing increase in referral rates to child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS, which brings a significant challenge in terms of our ability to meet the resultant timelines.  In response to this, a robust quality improvement plan commenced in CAMHS in my area in 2017 to focus on children who were on the "greater than 12 months waiting list".  That list has been eradicated and we are now focusing on further lists.  This remains a continuing focus in 2018.</p><p> As Mr. Bennett alluded to, capital development is critical.  Having appropriate infrastructure to support the effective delivery of service is paramount.  A detailed capital plan has been devised to meet the growing demand on services over the next five years in my area.  A significant number of our mental health teams are co-located or are due to relocate to primary care centres, which leads to a better interface with GPs and our other colleagues in primary care.</p><p> We have been awarded &euro;230,000 from the service reform fund.  It is intended to utilise these funds to assist service users to maximise their recovery and support them in seeking employment.  This fund will also support service users to articulate their views and fully participate in mental health management teams.</p><p> A strong focus for us in 2018 will be on the Connecting for Life strategy.  The implementation plan for our area is in its final draft stage and is due to be formally launched in the first quarter of this year.  There are two resource officers for suicide prevention who provide information and support, as well as co-ordinating suicide prevention initiatives in the community.  I am happy to say there has been a reduction of 50% in the number of suicides in my area between 2006 and 2015.</p><p> CHO Dublin north city and county is committed to providing a high-quality, standardised, patient-focused service that best meets the needs of the population we serve.  We support integrated health services that meet the diverse health and social care needs of the community and treat each person according to his or her needs.  We work with all stakeholders in our area, both statutory and non-statutory, to achieve high-quality health and social care services to ensure that our service users are supported to recover from their mental health illnesses and are treated with dignity and respect.  A key focus for our area is positive engagement with service users, families and carers, who can assist us in planning and developing services into the future.</p><p> I thank the committee for the invitation to address it.  I have included some information in the appendices.  My colleague and I are happy to assist with any question or clarification members may wish to discuss.</p></speech>

Regarding the questions and answers session, we have asked committee members essentially to represent the witnesses' areas.</p> <p>  I apologise to members for last week.  I let the meeting get out of hand.  We overran by an hour.  That was my fault.  Can we try to have a bit of discipline, through me, this week?  It will be seven minutes each.  We will start with Senator Devine, who will ask questions relating to CHO 7.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.265" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1388" speakername="Maire Devine" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018012400002#E00300"><p>I am usually brief but do not quote me on that.  In the interests of brevity, I will only ask questions, although I can make statements.  I thank Mr. Walsh and Dr. McCormack for their briefings on CHO 7.  The Chairman will discuss the issue of money, as not being able to discover what the budget is has got us around this table numerous times.  I will ask different questions.  Some are specific to CHO 7 while others are more reflective of an opinion.</p> <p>  The main issue that I raised almost every day in the Chamber last year was that of the closure of Linn Dara.  Is it fully operational now and what impact had its closure on the waiting list?  There are 93 young people on it.  Is that worse or better?  There has been a knock-on effect.  The organisation worked hard to reduce waiting times to 12 months, but the six-to-nine-month and nine-to-12-month lists must be worked on now.  The closure had an impact on those as well.</p> <p>  There are three suicide prevention resources officers.  Where are they based?  Are there measures of outcomes and successes?  Ms Walshe stated that CHO 9 saw a 50% reduction with just two resource officers, which is commendable and the right way to go.  Are there data on how effective they have been?</p> <p>  My next question is on IT.  We have been debating reform and Deputy Neville and I attended a committee this morning where IT systems were discussed.  "IT" seems to be a scary term in the world of mental health services.  Are there plans for a state-of-the-art IT system?  It would cut back on administration and be efficient.  There could be apps that members of the general population could click on to find out where their cases stood.  The national children's hospital is planned to be high-tech in that regard.  A new system could be piggybacked on the state-of-the-art IT system that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs is tendering for in respect of affordable child care services.  Perhaps CHO 7 could learn from or buy into that success.  It is a large area of work, but it is the area of the future and will make everything much more manageable in the health services and guide front-line workers.</p> <p>  A Vision for Change is done and dusted but it has never been implemented in its entirety.  Adult services and, to an extent, old age psychiatry are steady enough even though there are many vacancies.  The Ombudsman for Children has stated that A Vision for Change's chapter on children - chapter 10 - is at the back of the book and no one really gets that far.  We give up half way through.  In the witnesses' opinion, would it be better for us to develop A Vision for Change or a stand-alone sister policy in respect of children?</p> <p>  Our urgent care model is accident and emergency.  That is usually the only way that people in distress can attend out of hours.  Could other models of care throughout Europe, the US and Australia be considered?  There is a different approach to urgent care in Australia, in that it is semi-separate from the accident and emergency system and is not caught up in it.  It is dedicated to those in mental distress.  Considering it would be good.</p> <p>  We used to have many rehab units and A Vision for Change did not foresee the need for medium-to-long-term care.  Mr. Walsh alluded to the potential need for more units.  Are there plans in that regard and how many more would be needed?</p> <p>  I am curious.  Perhaps I am just being suspicious, although I am not normally.  Dr. McCormack is heading up a group comprising the HSE and voluntary agencies to develop a mental health and intellectual disability team.  It will be an in-house team run and directed by the HSE, as opposed to section 39 and voluntary agencies.  Will Dr. McCormack comment on this matter?  I might be reading too much into it.</p> <p>  In light of the discussion that the Oireachtas and country will have over the next few months on the sexual and reproductive health of women and girls, does Mr. Walsh believe that dedicated mother and baby facilities need to tie into an overhaul of sexual and reproductive health services for women?  While the Coombe hospital provides access to a neonatal doctor, there is not a single bed in the country for mammies and their newborns.</p></speech>

The list in the appendix refers to those awaiting outpatient appointments in the community.  The Linn Dara unit is currently fully open.  As of today, it has 23 residents and while it has a maximum capacity of 24, I am advised that due to the mix of patients it is currently deemed to be full with those 23.  Work is ongoing and in particular, the reconfiguration of teams in Kildare and Lucan this year will help us to address the longer waiters for community outpatient appointments.  We expect that those 23 patients who have been waiting for more than three months will be addressed in the coming months because obviously that is too long.</p> <p>  Two of the three suicide resource officers are currently on duty and one is on leave.  They cover the entire CHO.  I will ask Dr. McCormack to elaborate on their work on the Connecting for Life programme once I have answered the other questions posed.  In terms of IT systems, there is a huge gap.  The mental health division is currently working on a programme to introduce a comprehensive IT system that cuts across all of our community services including mental health and primary care.  The aim is to improve the ability to communicate between GP, community mental health and acute services.  The IT gap has an impact on our efficiency but there is a project under the auspices of the project management office of the mental health division which is examining it and we all support that.</p> <p>  In terms of A Vision for Change for children, as people within the service delivery system we implement the policy that comes down to us and we welcome any direction on policy.  I will ask Dr. McCormack to address the question on urgent care.  Regarding rehabilitation units, CHO 7 is an area that did not have major institutions in the past so it does not have huge resources that can be reconfigured into newer forms of service.  For that reason, we have spent quite an amount of money on placements with other agencies, including private nursing homes and private long-term care facilities to try to address our needs.  The appendices contain details of our hostels but there is a gap there in terms of meeting the needs of chronic, long-term patients.  I understand that the mental health division intends to source a resource during 2018 that may help to address that but we would see it locally as a very significant gap.  </p> <p>  I will ask Dr. McCormack to talk about mental health and intellectual disability.  In terms of mother and baby facilities in the context of mental health and motherhood, we provide a perinatal service in the Coombe Hospital but that is an area that needs to be further developed.  As a medical practitioner, Dr. McCormack would be better placed to talk about that.</p></speech>

I will begin with the question about the suicide resource officers.  There is one officer based in the old Meath Hospital campus in the centre of Dublin and the other is based in Kildare.  The third officer is currently on leave but will also be based in the Meath Hospital site.  Does that answer the Senator's question?</p></speech>

Locally there has been an increase in suicide rates in some pockets and areas which is quite a concern.  This has been a focus for the suicide resource officers as well as the local teams.  Most of those cases were people who had not been in touch with the mental health services which is of particular concern.</p></speech>

The Senator also raised mental health and intellectual disability.  Here we are referring to the development of a new service which is being driven nationally.  A national steering group was set up under the mental health division.  Resources have been provided for the last three to four years with a view to establishing community based teams for each catchment area for people with intellectual disabilities.  Until now, such services have been provided on an <i>ad hoc</i>, somewhat haphazard basis and have been provided mainly by the voluntary agencies.</p></speech>

I am going to try not to repeat any of the points made by Senator Devine but there may be some degree of overlap.</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the documentation provided and the huge level of detail therein.  That level of detail was something we were seeking from national representatives.  In terms of finances, I am particularly interested in the ratio of pay to non-pay items.  Obviously we need to have the best of professionals and that must be acknowledged.  We must also ensure that there are other elements at play.  We must also acknowledge the very difficult job that all of the witnesses have in terms of providing a sustainable and highly standardised system across the whole area.</p><p>We are dealing with a society where there are very diverse health and social needs within all our communities and within the communities the witnesses serve, particularly in the area of mental health.  We must examine preventative measures and areas where early intervention and acute intervention are needed.  There are many levels to be considered.  I would put a great deal of focus on preventative measures in terms of work that can be done by community organisations working with schools and helping community organisations whose volunteers do a great deal of work.  I would mention the Hope (D) service, with which I am sure Mr. David Walsh and Dr. Brendan McCormack are familiar, which does a great deal of work before people reach a crisis point, the Samaritans, which have their regional base in Newbridge and which does incredible work, and the Mojo service, and I have seen at first-hand the terrific work it does.</p><p> Senator Devine asked a question about the suicide prevention officers.  I am particularly interested in how they do their work in terms of suicide prevention.  I welcome the fact that funding is being spent on the Lakeview unit in Naas.  That is badly needed and I would like to hear the timeline for that.</p><p> I would like one of the witnesses to tell me about the monthly local forums that have been established, and I am particularly interested in area 9.  The sharing of the views and experience of service users and families in trying to identify the gaps that exist is hugely important and will help in designing the best delivery systems we can have.</p><p> From having spoken to constituents and friends of mine, I would acknowledge that the whole area of eating disorders is a major one in terms of mental health issues.  I note a regional team will be commencing this year.  That is to be welcomed but I would like to know how the roll-out of that will happen, and we need to make sure that it will have an impact in every area.  I would also mention the home base treatment team and it is good to note the priorities that are emerging.</p><p> The child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, is one of the areas about which I have a concern.  I genuinely regret to say that I do not hear many positive comments about CAMHS.  I am always conscious when we are dealing with professions and public servants that it is not good for mental health for public representatives to start to give out about them because everybody must be respectful of one another.  </p><p> However, I have genuine concerns and I would mention the experiences of three random constituents of mine.  One parent contacted me advising their child has been in the system for ten months and that they rarely get to see somebody and they have never seen the same person twice.  There is no consistency across the service.  That is very wrong.  We all know what it is like to have to build up trust with a young person.  The fact that different professionals deal with the young person every time is not right and that certainly should not be way the system works.</p><p> Another parent contacted me whose child who was attending school and was deemed to be too severe for CAMHS and they were completely caught out.  Luckily in that case, the matter rectified itself in a number of months.  I also spoke to a parent who was desperately trying to do the best for their only child.  They said that they would pay for private assessment as there was such a long waiting list to get an assessment but they were told by CAMHS that if they went privately for the assessment they could not come back into the system.  I highlight those cases-----</p></speech>

Briefly, I would like a breakdown of the costs involved in paying locum and agency staff.  With respect to the waiting list for CAMHS, the waiting time in my area is average but we need to be able to improve the waiting times.  Does community health care organisation, CHO, 7 ever return funds to the HSE?  I know that happens in some cases.  The witnesses have outlined their priorities for 2018 and they might indicate if there are any more of them.  They referred to having a team in place to deal with older people.  I am glad some improvement has been made on the day care centre in Monasterevin.  Day centres provide a vital place for older people.  Do the witnesses have a timeline in that respect?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.286" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Chairman" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018012400002#G00400"><p>I call Mr. Walsh to reply and I ask him to be as concise as possible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.287" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Walsh" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018012400002#G00500"><p>I thank the Deputy for raising those issues.  Regarding agency staff, the total spend last year on agency staff was &euro;8 million and, of that, &euro;6.3 million related to general adult services and the rest was across child and adolescent and psychiatry later in life services and that is split between nursing and medical staff.  Agency nursing staff costs are very high and growing.  It reflects the problem we have in recruiting and retaining staff within the service.  For example, we have got 184 service development posts since 2012 and we have filled 143 of them but we have only 34 more staff because we are leaking more staff out the backdoor.  That is a real issue.</p> <p>  That leads into the Deputy's issue around consistency.  If a child or an adult comes back for their next appointment and they do not recognise anyone who is there, that is a problem.  In terms of the medical staffing, that has begun to stabilise even though the problem has not been completely addressed but with the nursing and allied health professionals the high rate of turnover remains a problem.  </p> <p>  On the question of CHO 7 giving back money, we generally do not.  In 2016, we overspent by in or around &euro;3 million and, in 2017, having got much more support from the mental health division, we came very close to breaking even, but the difference was in or around &euro;100,000 or &euro;150,000.  That reflects the fact that we have more than 14% of the population but we only have 10% of the budget.  That is an immediate stressor within the system.</p> <p>  With respect to the psychiatry of later life services, the service in Kildare only started in the past few years and it is building.  The Deputy will note that from A Vision for Change figures.  They are very low in terms of the psychiatry of later life services.  In terms of the figures across Tallaght hospital and St. James's Hospital sectors, the professionals within them provide a very good service but they are still very much below the bar in terms of A Vision for Change targets.  With respect to Monasterevin, I will broaden it out beyond Monasterevin and point out that we need to make better use of all our health care facilities beyond having merely a 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. service.  I expect to have a firm design around Monasterevin that I would be happy to share with the Deputy over the next month or so.</p></speech>

The discussion has been very helpful.  This is a very important committee.  Many people have different perceptions of this area but we are learning increasingly more from the evidence that is coming through and that will help inform the document we will produce at the end of this process.  What is very clear from all the people who have presented in recent months is the level of commitment that exists to help people who are experiencing mental health difficulties.  There is no question about that existing at every level.</p> <p>  I have an observation and a number of questions.  I welcome the area lead on mental health engagement.</p><p> Will the mental health youth lead be appointed?  If so, when?  What will the remit be?  I am very interested in the area of youth mental health.  We talked about A Vision for Change but social media have suddenly appeared on the horizon and have become a significant issue in a very short space of time.  This was not really addressed in A Vision for Change and I perceive the role of the youth mental health lead to be important in this regard.  Art therapy has potential for young people.  Would this be considered as part of the remit of the youth mental health lead?</p><p> Reference was made to the challenges associated with agency staff and to how the costs were not reflected in A Vision for Change.  Roughly how much is being paid out at any one time for agency staff?</p><p> A point was made on the lack of primary care centres.  Mr. Bennett noted their slow development is preventing the delivery of the kinds of services they want to provide.  Linked to this is the number of nurses listed, which stands at 510.  How many of these are suicide crisis assessment nurses?  Are they linking in through the general practitioners and primary care centres?  How is this achieved?</p><p> My next point is on the capital requirements.  Along with facing primary care centre difficulties, do the representatives face difficulties regarding the provision of specific houses that people might require, depending on their mental health care needs?  They may not be able to function on their own.  Is planning an issue where there is a desire to put in a particular facility?  Are there objections on the part of locals who may not understand what the witnesses are trying to achieve?</p><p> My next question is on an issue that is somewhat specific but has come across my desk recently.  It concerns the psychological disorder Prader-Willi syndrome.  It is not very prevalent in the population.  Are the education and medical systems tuned in sufficiently regarding this disorder?  There is a difficulty in accessing services because the disorder may be considered more physical than psychological.  Perhaps there is more emphasis on the physical.</p></speech>

It is a really important role.  The lead is based in Louth-Meath and she has been working across the area.  She has been involved in the Connecting for Life strategy and in local fora.  We can give the Deputy more detail on that, including on consultations in which she will be involved.</p> <p>  On the youth mental health lead, I understand we do not have funding for 2018.</p></speech>

In each of our CHOs, we have not yet got the funding for that but we understand it is a 2018 commitment.  We would welcome that.</p></speech>

It is provided on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis in a number of areas, where it has made significant improvements.  It is a medium through which people can feel very comfortable communicating.<br/><br/>In 2017, the agency cost was &euro;7.8 million for CHO 8.  That points to the significant challenge that exists.  We listened to all the hearings last week on recruitment challenges, particularly on the medical and nursing sides.  I refer to significant money for ourselves because we are paying one third more than what we would be paying our own staff.  There are significant costs involved here.  That is a major issue.<br/><br/>On the primary care centres, there has been good progress.  In some areas we are waiting for planning permission or for the developments to be completed.  We sometimes have to lease premises, which is not ideal.  The idea behind the primary care services is to improve the integration of services and the linkages with general practitioners and the other services.  Again, however, there is a significant move in respect of a number of centres, including that in Tullamore, which should be ready in the first quarter of next year.  I can give members an updated paper on the development of the primary care centres right across the CHO.  I will be happy to do so after this meeting.<br/><br/>On the suicide nurses or scan nurses, there are two in our area who link with the general practitioners and the primary care centres.  They also link with the hospitals.  Can Ms McArdle elaborate on the scan nurses?</p></speech>

It is specific to Laois-Offaly and our CHO.  In addition, we have delivered self-harm nurses, who work in emergency departments in our acute hospitals.  We have seven in total across the midlands and Louth-Meath.  Therefore, across the whole six counties, we do have access.  There are different pathways but we work very closely with our GP partners and acute hospital services to ensure there is good integration with the community mental health teams in any of those areas.</p></speech>

We have had some infrastructural developments in the midlands.  Some of our high-support need houses have been redeveloped.  Part of our service reform fund policy concerns enhancing housing options for people with mental health difficulties and working closely with local authorities and housing agencies to ensure it is not just the HSE that is supplying housing but that people can be given sustainable tenancies like any other member of the public, such that they are not defined by their diagnosis and can live in the community.  We do not have experience in our area of people objecting because we are working more closely with the local authorities to ensure people are living full lives in the community.  It is just about getting tenancies.  There are no special accommodation requirements for somebody with low or medium support needs.  It is just about getting housing and sustaining it through tenancy support.  Obviously, for people who have continuing care needs, we provide a higher number of beds together, although not in a complicated setting.  The individuals live in the community and are supported by support workers, who ensure people are engaged in community settings.</p></speech>

For those who need a specific service, there is a service gap.  I understand this is being considered at national level.  The former national clinical lead, Dr. Margo Wrigley, has been considering this at national level.  I understand there will be some recommendations.  I could be corrected on that.  I have had some discussions with Dr. Wrigley on this.  I am happy to look into that a bit further and provide information later.</p></speech>

I notice that the CAMHS team has 60% of the recommended staff members.  For another of the teams mentioned, the figure is 70%.  Is this attributable to the population increase or qualified staff leaving?  Alternatively, is it attributable to the fact that we are not directing enough young people who are making decisions on careers into the very valuable and important career in question?  Do we need to be considering this?  Is it a combination of everything, such that we should be considering connecting with the education system and career guidance teams, suggesting the various levels?  Is that part of it?  It must be so frustrating to be bringing in agency staff continually when one would much prefer to have full-time staff and make better use of the funding.</p></speech>

It is not just a population issue.  This is both a national and an international problem, particularly in regard to consultants in the child and adult mental health services, CAMHS, but also specialised nursing staff.  We are working with universities in terms of placements, looking at post-graduate programmes, etc.  Some of it is around lifestyle choices.  When people finish training, many of them want to travel and see some of the world.  Some of it is to do with the fact - one of our colleagues mentioned this last week - that our systems are underdeveloped and therefore people might not want to come into the environment without having a full multi-disciplinary team around them.  There are a number of challenges there and for us to grow services, we will have to make sure we have permanent staff in place.  The previous speaker mentioned the inconsistency of people turning up and seeing a different person every time.  That is very difficult because to get that connection with a young person in particular takes time and energy, which can be lost.  There are a number of factors.  It is not always about wages and conditions, even though that is a factor.  There are other factors as well.</p></speech>

It is a marvellous first point of contact.  We all have a responsibility to try to highlight, in terms of parents who might be concerned about their children or anybody who is a bit below par, the fact that there is a great deal of information available.  I very much welcome that and will certainly promote it.  Do the witnesses find that that type of technology is a good way of accessing the general population in terms of trying to help them almost in their own homes because things have changed to a huge extent?  I was talking to a parent recently who gave me an example of her child who was connecting with the counsellor online.  That was marvellous because the parent did not have to drive the child somewhere, and they were able to connect.  That is a tremendous step forward in terms of efficiency and all sorts of cost savings, as well as benefit to the individuals.</p></speech>

My own children will often look up stuff online with regard to illness and other difficulties, so the Deputy is absolutely right.  It is time-saving but it is also more comfortable for them in terms of the engagement process.  It is very important in terms of developing that.  As Senator Devine said earlier, the development of a good IT system is vital.  That is one of the real positives of social media.  One of the criticisms expressed over the years was the negative impact of social media on people's mental health but this is positive in terms of that type of professional engagement and support.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the offer of information and support.</p> <p>  Deputy Corcoran Kennedy raised the issue of staffing, which was one of the questions I intended to ask, in terms of CAMHS only working at 60%.  She highlighted the possibility of that being for various reasons.  I will not ask the same question she asked but I have two other questions on that.  First, what proportion of the 120 assistant psychologist positions allocated by the Government in last year's budget for this year will come to the community healthcare organisation, CHO?  Have they been advertised and how many have been filled?  If they have not been advertised, why not?</p> <p>  Also, on staffing, I presume the problem is not all about salaries.  One of the comments made to me by two members of staff, not in our CHO but in a different one, was that there is not enough support or consideration for the staff's own mental health and well-being.  People are finding that they are very overworked.  Email and IT facilities are great but people find that in using email they can off-load their work onto somebody else.  They may think their job is done but it is piled on to somebody else.  That was a comment from two members of staff from a different CHO but it probably is an issue that affects staff in our CHO and I would like to hear about staff in that regard.</p> <p>  In their opening statement the witnesses said the service had been allocated additional funding to develop and enhance community based, seven day mental health services.  Can they tell us more about that and what it actually involves on a day to day basis?  I had a case some years ago of a lady who on three occasions had her husband drive her to present herself as being suicidal to a facility in CHO 8 and she was sent home each time.  She did not even get past admissions.  That was outrageous.  I had her husband on the phone telling me he was doing a 24-hour watch because she said she was suicidal.  That is not good enough.  That happened in 2015.  What does it mean when the witnesses say they have been allocated funding to develop and enhance both the community based and in-service?</p> <p>  Regarding finance, &euro;95 million goes into the service.  It shocked me that when the witnesses were before the committee on the other occasion they could not tell us how that money was spent.  I am very curious about money that is paid to other organisations that provide a service on the service's behalf to people who need it.  Some of them are excellent people who do exceptional work way beyond the call of duty but for illustration purposes, if I were to say to the witnesses that &euro;100,000 was paid to Organisation X to provide a service, could they tell me exactly how much of that &euro;100,000 reaches the service user and how much of it is lost in corporate events and other things that go on in organisations, including in the Health Service Executive?</p> <p>  I have many questions but I will conclude on this one.  Appendix 4 has a table outlining the 1,081 staff, which includes medical, which is self-explanatory, and nursing.  Specifically, what is general support and patient and client care, and how do they benefit the service user on a day to day basis?  The witnesses can then have the rest of the day off.</p></speech>

Staff are stressed.  The non-filling of positions in recent years and positions disappearing has had a huge impact on them.  There is an employee assistance service within the service but it is the responsibility of managers as well to support their staff.  We would encourage staff to go to managers with particular difficulties they might be experiencing.  Many of them are not work related but to do with outside work because of the other pressures in life.  The Senator is right, however, that it is something we need to put in place because mental health staff are users of mental health services as well.  There is a reality in that respect.  The Senator has made a very good point and she has put into my psyche the need to be a bit more forthcoming on that issue because it is very important.  I will have a look at that.</p> <p>  Regarding the seven day mental health service, I will ask Ms McArdle to take that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Siobhan McArdle" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018012400002#J02000"><p>Across the CHO we have a seven day service but it is at a basic level for all service users who access our rehabilitation and recovery services.  For clients who have enduring mental illness, the rehabilitation and recovery teams provide weekend supports.</p><p>However, we are conscious that the service needs to be extended to all people who attend our general adult or community mental health teams.  There is national recognition of this as well.  The Midlands, Louth, Meath Community Healthcare Organisation has a home-based team skeletal service in the Louth-Meath area.  The funding allocated in 2017 will be used to enhance the service in that part of the CHO.  In addition, the funding allocated will be used to open day hospital services in the midlands to allow service users who access day hospitals during the week to have access over the weekends.</p><p> That is a welcome development.  It will mean that if someone wishes to contact or access the service, he or she need not turn up at an admissions unit or emergency department.  The person will have contact with staff who are familiar with the care of that person and the case.  The staff will be available to assist these people over the weekends or assist their family members.</p><p> The staffing allocation is a small amount.  We would like to see the home-based service rolled out throughout the full CHO area.  We would also like the day hospital model to be rolled out throughout the rest of the CHO area.  It is a work in development but it is most welcome.</p></speech>

The formal answer and process is that we have service level agreements with the organisations under which they outline budget requirements for the year.  Normally, 11% or 12% goes towards administrative costs and support.  Most of the rest should be on direct services.</p> <p>  Several of the groups we fund in mental health are advocacy organisations.  Much of their work is on campaigns, advertising, promoting and networking events.  They are not real service deliverers in the sense of mental health services; they are advocacy organisations.  There is an ongoing monitoring process with these organisations.  I suppose we could be more forensic than we have been, to be honest.  We need to look at that.  However, the service level agreement is the template we use for the grants.</p></speech>

This is where a person comes to us who is suicidal.  I advise these people to go to their general practitioners, GPs.  The GPs send them to hospital and the hospital sends them home.  What should a politician do in that situation?  Where should I send someone?  The person I have in mind was sent home three times from a hospital and is suicidal.  What is a person physically to do in that situation?</p> <p>  Is there assessment of the outcomes in respect of the other organisations used by the HSE?  If the CHO gives &euro;100,000 to an organisation, is an assessment carried out at the end of the year to see what outcomes emerged and what value for money was achieved?</p> <p>  I will give the HSE representatives a half-day after my last question.  Can they explain some of the references in appendix 4, for example, "general support" and "patient-inclined"?</p></speech>

The idea is that the person would be clinically assessed and the decision would be made by a clinician.  It is difficult to say after that.  It is a decision that the clinician has to make.

We carry out assessment at the end of the year on outcomes.  We go through a process and that informs the decisions around funding for the following year.</p> <p>  The reference to "general support" staff includes porters, catering and housekeeping.  The reference to "patient-inclined" care includes health care assistants and multi-task assistants.  Again, I would be happy to give a list to the Senator after the meeting.</p></speech>

Sadly, the member from this area is not present.  Consequently, I will ask some of the questions.  I will be aided by Deputy Buckley and Senator Devine.  I will start off with particular questions about funding and recruitment.  I may also extend the questions to the other CHO areas.</p> <p>  I wish to advise the witnesses that we will be giving them specific questions we would like them to follow up through correspondence.  I said the same to the CHO area representatives before the committee last week.  While I have so many things to ask, I will be brief and perhaps you can reply in black-and-white with brief answers, if possible.</p> <p>  My first question is for Ms Walshe.  You have spoken about how in particular you have a difficulty in recruiting psychiatric nurses.  I have noticed one thing about all CHO areas.  You referred to serious difficulties in recruiting medical and clinical staff.  What are the others doing?  Ms Walshe referred to 1,232 employees in CHO 9.  There is another figure of approximately 944.  What are they doing?  Ms Walshe may not be able to answer me but I have put the same question to all the CHO areas.  We need a breakdown.  If the CHOs cannot recruit, what are they doing?</p></speech>

I acknowledge there is a discrepancy between the figure of 1,232 and the figure in A Vision for Change, which relates to the community mental health teams in the community.  We need to give the committee a breakdown of the staffing in the approved centres, because that is where the significant discrepancy arises.  It looks like we have all these staff and people may ask where the rest of them are.  Significant numbers are in residential centres.  For example, I have four approved centres, including the Ashlin Centre in Beaumont Hospital.  There are acute beds in St. Vincent's Hospital, Fairview, the Mater Misericordiae University Hospital and Connolly Hospital.  There are child and adolescent mental health service beds in St. Joseph's unit in St. Vincent's Hospital.  The discrepancy relates to the numbers in the community teams.  One figure for numbers of staff relates to our approved centres and those in psychiatry of old age.</p></speech>

I am sorry for picking on Ms Walshe but it is simply that she is responsible for the area on which I am focusing.  What is the managerial structure breakdown for each area and overall?  I have asked for an overall managerial structure from the top down.  Who does what?  Who are officials reporting to?  Who is accountable?</p></speech>

I am the accountable officer for both the oversight of that spend and the management of more than 6,000 staff within the area.  Ultimately, I operate delegation further down to the heads of service.  For example, Ms Angela Walsh, who is on my left, has the delegation of responsibility in respect of the total management of &euro;114 million in mental health services.  It is similar for primary care and social care.  The appendix I supplied has the structure within my area, including the heads of service, their names and who reports to them.  The detail of who sits on the mental health team under Ms Walsh is in appendix 3.</p></speech>

I have two brief questions and then I will pass on to Deputy Buckley.</p> <p>  Ms Walshe stated she is responsible for the overall budget.  When she allocates money towards children's mental health services, does she make the decision?  On what is it based?  Is it based on an assumption of having three child consultant psychiatrists in a given year?  How do you allocate funding?  If is the worst-looked-after area in all our mental health services, why is the allocation of funding so poor?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Walshe" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018012400002#L00100"><p>There are historical base budgets and additional development funding has come in since 2013.  The determinants for that are related to the national service plan and the priorities within the relevant divisions.  Currently, the budget is defined as in the total budget and then there is a breakdown for mental health, primary care and social care.  No funding is transferred within any of those divisions.  The allocated mental health budget is set at an 80:20 mix, or thereabouts, regarding pay and non-pay.  Those are fixed because the staff are based in child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, general adult, mental health intellectual disability, MHID, and so forth.</p> <p>  The issue concerning developments is based on the priorities in the national service plan and the additional development funding.  We have significant engagement with the national division in determining our bids.  We may look for 20 new development posts.  Some of those may be between CAMHS, psychiatry of old age or general adult.  One is making the determinant in some ways depending on the activity and the data one has.  For example, we have eight CAMHS teams and 12 networks.  We have responsibility to provide service to 145,000 children under 18 years of age in my area.  The ideal would be that a network should be providing services for primary care, mental health and older persons and people with disabilities within that area.  We are in a little bit of a better position than my colleagues in that we are at 66% regarding A Vision for Change and ideals with regard to the make-up of the CAMHS teams.  We put in a bid every year and it is determined in the negotiation with the national division as to what is funded.</p> <p>  Sometimes we get funding for posts which we are not able to fill.  For example, it could be for an occupational therapist, OT, in MHID when we would be more successful if we had a social worker.  Sometimes one has to have that level of flexibility to determine where one feels the priority could be met.  We have been lucky in our area.  We had a difficult past 18 months when we had significant deficits and had to use agency consultants for CAMHS.  We spent over &euro;5 million on agency staff last year.  We are fortunate that many of our nursing deficits are filled by overtime, which gives a level of safety in that one has experienced staff doing overtime.  While it is not ideal for their health and well-being, at least we have stability on the safety side of the service.</p></speech>

We have asked for a breakdown but we have been given percentages.  We will be writing to all the witnesses for the actual breakdown of the 11%, what it means in monetary terms and how it is divided.  We were a little bit surprised we were not provided with the monetary figures.  Anybody who has a business and has been given money from a bank must supply details on how it has been spent, down to the last penny.  The witnesses may have given the committee an overall breakdown but they did not give a detailed one.  It is important.  How can we ask for more money for CAMHS when we do not know what the HSE is spending or paying for?</p> <p>  We are actually here to help.  We are not trying to poke holes in the provision of mental health services.  We are trying to see what is wrong.  This is the first time there ever has been a committee on mental health care service provision.  The witnesses should not see us as the enemies.  We are genuinely here to aid the officials.

I thank the witnesses for appearing before the committee.</p> <p>  Today, I want to highlight some of the good news.  The good news is normally not one of the best sellers when it comes to any part of the health service.  We cannot be negative all the time.  I welcome the approval of five additional posts for 7/7 services in the CHO 7 area.  I also welcome the fact an extra 16 additional psychologists and four grade staff psychologists will be appointed in this area.  A positive step in another area, CHO 8, is the appointment of an area lead for mental health engagement.  It is first time in 11 years that we actually have seen a 50% reduction in the number of suicides, which is to be welcomed.</p> <p>  Today is not pick on Ms Mary Walshe day.  However, she spoke about having eight CAMHS teams.  Instead of breaking them into percentages, is there 11 or 12 on a team or is it index-linked to specific areas?  Last week, the committee heard one team was at 113%, another at 97% and another at 18%.  If one team is oversubscribed, can one not take from that to bring the other teams up to be fully staffed?</p> <p>  The committee is not anti-agency but there is an issue around retention and recruitment.  Ms Mary Walshe made a valid point earlier about paying overtime and having stability in a team.  A team needs to fully staffed.  One needs harmony and happiness in a system with everybody working with each other.  We have seen that there is friction between permanent staff and agency staff.  There is no harmony.  It aggrieves me that we have a problem with the hiring and retention of staff but we can still afford to take on agency staff.  We cannot afford to pay our own staff more and give them a better package to retain them in this specialist job but we can pay more to agencies.  It probably is twice as much because the agency staff get a higher fee and the agents are paid more.  How are we going to move away from that?  Do we have to revisit the whole area of staffing and new contracts?  If we are to train people in this area, must we ensure they have a guarantee that they will have a proper secure job, properly paid and possibilities of promotion?  There does not seem to be harmony in this area.  In most of the CHOs, 49% are HSE staff and the rest is made up of agency staff.  It does not seem to work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary Walshe" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2018012400002#L00800"><p>Our first port of call from a nursing perspective to ensure safety and stability in a team is overtime.  We have to monitor that because we also have the European working time directives regarding hours of work.  We also have to ensure that staff health and well-being is looked after.  We appreciate it when experienced staff put themselves forward for overtime.  Due to the cost of living in Dublin, staff living within the Dublin circle tend to do some shifts on overtime.</p><p>From that perspective, we really welcome that and the team appreciates that.  It is important that we look after staff health and well-being.  We had a staff health and well-being week in November.  It was very well attended by staff.  They really appreciated the fact that we acknowledged it.  Mindfulness courses that were offered were booked out.  We appreciate that it is really important.</p><p> In respect of nursing in particular, we have produced the numbers relating to increasing the student numbers.  Someone working in London has a London weighting.  We do not have that in Dublin, which would acknowledge the increased cost of living in Dublin, such as housing.  This may need to be looked at not just for nursing and the health service but the public sector in general.  It is something that may be helpful to retain people in Dublin because people are moving outside it to buy housing.  Even though our colleagues in the other areas are picking up very experienced staff, the fact is that there is still not enough for even down the country.  It is a problem in Dublin.  Someone working in London has a London weighting, which may be something that needs to be looked with regard to retaining experienced and skilled professionals within the public service.  We have looked at recruitment abroad to ensure that nurses meet the register requirements from a mental health point of view.  They are not there in mental health nursing in comparison so they will not be eligible to register on the nursing register.  That is an issue whereas our acute hospitals and other areas have been able to recruit from India, the Philippines and so on.  That is all being reviewed and looked at as well.</p><p> We have put additional funding into ongoing education and training because that does retain staff.  People do want to do higher diplomas and masters.  A number of nurses in our area are doing PhDs and we have encouraged and supported that.  Again, it is about retaining skilled people and valuing them within our service.  We have had Christmas campaigns at the airport in our area because it is very close to us.  We have done all the local recruitment.  We have done what we can to retain it.  As Mr. Walsh has said, we got more than 111 development posts over recent years but it only resulted in 83 whole-time equivalent additional on the census in 2017, so it is an ongoing piece.  We have lost quite a lot of senior nurses from the system because they could retire at 55.  That has been closed off but we have lost quite experienced nurses from the system because they were able to retire at 55.  That has just changed but we have certainly lost quite a lot of people over recent years.  I might defer to Ms Walsh with regard to the queries on the teams.</p></speech>

As Ms Walshe outlined, we are trying to reconfigure our teams to the health and social networks, which will align them to primary care, so we have some legacy teams where we had full staffing and we are dividing the population, so that piece is what is causing the irregularities when one looks down at the percentages as per A Vision for Change.  That will be a fluid process because as Ms Walshe also said, our population increased in 2016.  We think we have the population right and then it increases so we will need more staff.  Sometimes that can reflect in us looking like we have fewer staff than are required.</p></speech>

As a chief executive or the chief manager, how much autonomy does Ms Walshe have?  She mentioned that she had a lovely week for her staff, which is a brilliant idea and totally essential.

Within that, a piece of that is centred on our own staff.  We did not run something as sophisticated as that described by Ms Walshe in CHO 7 but we do run wellness clinics for staff fairly regularly using our own psychology staff and sessions to help people deal with stress.  The Healthy Ireland plan is putting a structure around it but before that, it was up to each area to do its own thing.</p></speech>

Members of the Committee on the Future of Healthcare and this committee have seen that some areas have really good best practice in some areas but it seems to be almost like silos in that it does not seem to spread to other areas.  Do people in the different CHOs talk to teach other about best practice or does it have to go up the chain and back down again?  How does that work?</p></speech>

As chief officers, we meet every month to ensure consistency among ourselves.  Again, we are working off best practice and our best practice guidelines nationally as well, so there is consistency around that.  The Deputy is right.  There have been differences in the past but things are far more integrated now across the system.  The likes of standard operating procedures help us with regard to having a measure.  There has been significant improvement in that area and it is something we are going to continue to develop.  It is an evolving process.</p></speech>

The Dublin weighting is probably a problem.  We have been pushing it as a union for a long time but the Minister for Finance is not listening to us very well.  Tony O'Brien's yellow pack graduate nurses and his quote "we forced them out" are significant.  They never got over it because he never apologised for that.  In respect of getting generic training nurses, there was a threat to psychiatry in its specialty.  That has abated for now but I understand the problem internationally because many countries would have generic training nursing, although the research shows it is very poor for psychiatric patients.</p> <p>  One Deputy, or it might have been one of the witnesses, spoke about going into the colleges.  We are waiting for the new children's hospital and its recruitment process and strategy.  They are actually going into the schools so it is catching fourth or fifth year students prior to their making decisions on what they will study.  It will take at least 15 to 20 years to regenerate the nursing and medical staff we need because we are losing them now.  They are dropping off like flies.  I know the unions will probably come after me and I will never be allowed to join the union but I have a comment about the reconfiguration of the entire restrictive practice of professional assessment and diagnosis.  At the moment, it involves the consultant psychiatrist.  Perhaps we should throw out those kinds of ideas out and look at what a team means and what responsibilities and skills a person needs to produce an assessment, diagnosis and treatment plan.  We are moving a bit away and taking in nursing involves nurse prescribers and advanced midwife practitioners but we need to open our brains.  I know people will not be very happy.  People will feel they are left on contracts but we are going to have this significantly for at least the next generation so maybe we should think outside the box.  Not everybody needs a consultant psychiatrist to make a diagnosis.</p></speech>

Other jurisdictions use other approaches and certain team approaches work well.  Indeed, it works within our services as well.  In child services, for example, some diagnoses are carried out by people who are trained in autism.  The use of the autism diagnostic observation schedule, ADOS, is an example.  A person trained in the use of the ADOS protocol who is a psychologist or psychiatrist can make the diagnosis.  That is an example of interdisciplinary work.  Models exist here and in other countries.  We have advanced nurse practitioners.  That area could potentially be developed further.  They have the ability to make diagnoses, depending on their specialty.  Certainly, that is something to be looked at.</p></speech>

Members will recall that we held a meeting on this matter on 8 March last year.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Muiris O'Connor, Mr. Kieran Smyth, Ms Judith Szlovak and Mr. Sean Howlett of the Department of Health.</p><p>I wish to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise that any submission or opening statements made to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>That is the housekeeping out of the way.  I welcome all the witnesses.  Mr. O'Connor's opening statement is quite lengthy, so I ask that he summarise it.  I am sure all the committee members have read it.  We want to get to the questions and answers session as soon as possible.</p></speech>

I am assistant secretary in charge of the research, development and health analytics division in the Department of Health.  I am joined by Kieran Smyth, Judith Szlovak and Sean Howlett from the international unit in my division.  I will begin by outlining the programme of work undertaken by the Department of Health and developments since our last appearance before this committee.  I will then discuss objectives at that time and what has been done to meet those objectives, specifically the Department&rsquo;s response to the recommendations made by the committee in its report, but I might abbreviate that section because I expect it will be of interest in the questions and answers.  I will also use my opening statement to outline the Department&rsquo;s current objectives and work programme.</p> <p>  I will start with developments since our last meeting.  These provide the context for both the objectives we have met and the current work at hand with regard to the implications of Brexit for the health sector.  The Minister of Health and the Department of Health lead on dealing with health related issues involving Brexit.  In this capacity we feed into the Government's response and negotiations led by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  We also oversee and co-ordinate the work of the Health Service Executive, HSE, and other agencies in the health sector in dealing with the many challenges resulting from Brexit.  The work at Cabinet level is being prepared through cross-departmental co-ordination structures.  These represent a frequent and active channel through which Departments are providing their research, analysis and overall policy input to the Government&rsquo;s wider response to Brexit, including its priorities for the ongoing negotiations.</p> <p>  For the Department of Health, the maintenance of the common travel area, CTA, was identified as a vital component in avoiding disruption to our health services as a consequence of Brexit.  The Department of Health fully supported the Government in the intensive work with the EU task force and EU partners to ensure that the CTA issue, along with Ireland&rsquo;s other unique concerns, was fully understood and reflected in the EU&rsquo;s negotiation position.</p><p>It was this level of co-operation, of which we were a part, that helped yield results in December.  The joint report from the EU and UK negotiators of 8 December includes a recognition that Ireland and the UK can continue to make bilateral arrangements between themselves relating to the movement of people between their territories, while respecting Ireland's EU obligations.  There is a commitment to the continuation of the common travel area, CTA, and associated rights.  In plain terms, this means that across sectors, including health, there will be no change in the right of Irish citizens to move freely North and South, east and west and to live, work, study and access health and social benefits in the UK on the same basis as UK citizens.  Reciprocal arrangements will apply to UK citizens in Ireland.  Particularly important from a Department of Health perspective is the commitment on the maintenance of the common travel area in terms of access to health care and allowing the freedom of movement that we currently have for Irish and UK citizens.<br/><br/>I will now outline the Department's important role in the work on maintaining the CTA.  The Department of Health worked successfully within the cross-cutting Government structures to ensure that the rationale for reciprocal health entitlements and health co-operation being a core part of the CTA was understood and accepted.  Ensuring that the EU and the UK, including Northern Ireland, had a common understanding of the health dimensions of the CTA and of their importance was a key objective for the Department.  The Department has been involved in bilateral discussions with its UK and Northern Ireland counterparts, first, to ensure that there was a shared understanding of the health aspects of the CTA and, second, to reach agreement at a high level on maintaining them.  Now that a high level agreement has been reached on maintaining the health aspects of the CTA, the Department will undertake further detailed work with the UK, including the steps necessary to maintain the existing arrangements.  The Department has also worked closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to ensure that the EU has had a full understanding of what was involved and of its importance in the context of the first phase of the EU-UK negotiations. <br/><br/>Since we were last before the committee, the Government has secured clear and strong commitments on the Border.  The UK has given a guarantee that a hard border, including any physical infrastructure and associated checks and controls, will be avoided and has committed to how this will be achieved.  The UK's intention is to achieve this through the wider EU-UK future relationship agreement, which is also our preference, or through specific solutions.  If these do not deliver on the overarching commitment of avoiding a hard border, the UK has committed to maintaining full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the customs union necessary to protect North South co-operation, the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement.  This brings us to a good place in respect of the freedom of movement issues and the access to services which featured prominently in the committee's report.  As members of the committee will know, health is a very significant focus for North-South co-operation so clearly this commitment is important across a range of issues, including food safety, procurement and regulation of medicines.  This is welcome and the Department of Health is now deepening its engagement with other Departments, the HSE, the Health Products Regulatory Authority and the Food Safety Authority of Ireland to ensure that detailed health issues are covered fully. <br/><br/>The agreement on citizens' rights in December is also important from a health perspective.  This agreement means that the rights of EU citizens already living in the United Kingdom or of UK citizens already living in the EU 27, who meet the qualifying residency criteria, will remain the same after the United Kingdom has left the EU.  In effect this means, for example, that a qualifying Irish person resident in the UK at the date of withdrawal will continue to have a right to access health care after the UK has left the EU.  The withdrawal agreement will copperfasten these.  There are two key messages we wish to give from a health perspective.  First, currently there are no changes to patient care, as the UK continues to be a full member of the EU.  Indeed, it is important to reiterate that until the UK formally withdraws from the European Union, it remains a full member with all its existing rights and obligations.  Second, we have in principle, through securing agreement on the common travel area, avoided the worst case scenario, so long as the commitments are followed through, including the detailed work to maintain the operational arrangements in this next phase.<br/><br/>The Department's response to the committee's recommendations are set out in the opening statement.  I will skim through them.  There are a number of important issues which will arise during the question and answer session.  The Department welcomed the report produced by the committee following our last appearance.  It not only captured the key issues, but raised awareness among stakeholders of the importance of Brexit for health and of health for Brexit.  The committee made seven recommendations to the Department of Health in its report.  At this point I wish to provide a response to these and I hope to show how the recommendations have been addressed.<br/><br/>The first recommendation related to the committee's request that we get full capture and reporting for a proper handle on the quantum and scale of services currently being provided under the treatment abroad scheme and the cross-border directive.  In June last year, we submitted a detailed report on those figures and in advance of today's meeting we sent the committee a further update of the figures.  We are happy to return to that during the questions session.<br/><br/>The committee's second recommendation was that the Department make an informed estimate of the total number of residents of Ireland who receive health care in the United Kingdom each year and plan for alternative provision of that care in case availing of health care in the United Kingdom becomes significantly more difficult.  The agreement reached on maintaining the common travel area and associated rights is very important in this context as it allows Irish citizens to travel freely to the UK, and <i>vice versa</i>.  The further technical work conducted by the Department of Health with its UK and Northern Ireland counterparts on the maintenance of bilateral health co-operation under the common travel area and associated rights, referred to earlier, is allowing these issues to be fully examined.<br/><br/>Third, the committee recommended that in the case of the introduction of border checks between Ireland and Northern Ireland, we were to devise a system to ensure that border checks do not cause delays to travel for health care purposes, as such delays could impact negatively on health outcomes.  Again, the agreement in December, with the clear and strong commitments on the border issue and the avoidance of a hard border or any associated checks and controls, provides the reassurance that those delays would not materialise.<br/><br/>Fourth, the committee recommended that the Department ensure the continuation of cross-border health care agreements which are working well and saving lives, even in the case of significantly curtailed freedom of movement.  The agreement that has been reached on the continuation of the common travel area and associated rights as it currently operates is important in this context as arrangements for Irish citizens to travel freely to the UK, including Northern Ireland, will be maintained.  That agreement also facilitates the maintenance of the extensive co-operation on health that takes place between Ireland and the UK on a North-South and east-west basis.  While further detailed work needs to be undertaken in this context between the Department of Health and counterparts in the UK and Northern Ireland, both sides are committed to maintaining bilateral health service co-operation into the future.<br/><br/>Fifth, the committee recommended that the Department pursue further co-operation with Northern Ireland in terms of public health policy, health promotion and health research, despite the UK&rsquo;s impending withdrawal from the EU.  We are responding very proactively here.  The Department of Health continues to deepen and develop co-operation on health with cross-border stakeholders and the Department of Health in Northern Ireland in these and other areas.  Certainly we need to be cognisant of the impact of Brexit in this context.  Regarding public health policy, we have a very strong track record of co-operation around services, for example, the new radiotherapy unit at Altnagelvin hospital in Derry, which offers cancer patients from Donegal access to radiotherapy across the Border in Derry, reducing their travel time significantly; the new hybrid cardiac catheterisation laboratory which opened at Crumlin hospital in Dublin in July 2016 and which provides emergency surgery to babies born with congenital heart disease in Northern Ireland; and the primary percutaneous coronary intervention, pPCI, services in Altnagelvin hospital to which Donegal patients having a STEMI heart attack now have 24-7 access.  This is critical in terms of providing highly specialist services in Donegal and the Border region.<br/><br/>Work has taken place under the North-South Ministerial Council to identify further opportunities.  Contacts continue and are positioned to develop further in the context of the re-establishment of the executive.  Irish researchers and research funding agencies have developed much collaboration internationally which provides important opportunities to leverage expertise and funding, to develop joint working between researchers within academia and with industry and to collectively tackle major health challenges.  There is currently a significant level of engagement between the UK and Ireland, for example, through funding programmes, policy initiatives and organisational memberships.  The EU INTERREG funding has been a key enabler of North-South health co-operation.  As regards INTERREG, there is security in respect of the current programme and a positive shared commitment that possibilities for future support for future programmes will be examined favourably by both the EU and the UK.  That is in paragraph 49 of the joint report and gives us encouragement.<br/><br/>Sixth, the committee recommended that the Department minimise disruption which could be caused by divergence in registration and recognition of health workers across jurisdictions.</p><p>The Department of Health acknowledges the importance of the issue of the mutual recognition of health professional qualifications, which is a part of the wider issue of the mutual recognition of qualifications more generally.  It has been engaging with the professional bodies such as the Medical Council and CORU, which regulates the health and social care professionals on the issue.<br/><br/>The agreement achieved on citizens' rights in the joint report has addressed one aspect of the recognition of qualifications.  Paragraph 32<b></b>provides for the &quot;grandfathering&quot; of qualifications which were recognised before the withdrawal date or where applications are in process on that date.  This means that qualifications recognised before the withdrawal date remain recognised for those EU citizens resident in the United Kingdom and for UK citizens resident in a member state.<br/><br/>The Department of Health is working closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, the Department of Education and Skills and other Departments to see how best the issue of the mutual recognition of qualifications not covered under the joint report may be advanced in the next phase.<br/><br/>Seventh, the committee recommended that the Department should minimise disruption which could be caused by divergence in regulation of medical products across jurisdictions.  We have set out in some detail in the written statement the way that is being done and how it is being led by us, in conjunction with the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, and the Health Service Executive.<br/><br/>As well as the work at European level, at a national level the HPRA is taking a proactive approach to Brexit preparations, with a focus on protecting the availability of medicines for Irish patients and the integrity of our medicines market, even if the UK fully exits current regulatory systems in March 2019.  Over the past year, the HPRA has stepped up its engagement with pharmaceutical companies and other stakeholders, offering practical support in managing the regulatory challenges of Brexit.  Among other measures, the HPRA is investigating opportunities for joint labelling of medicines with other markets, increasing its commitment to medicine assessments within the centralised EU network, and working directly with companies looking to transfer some or all of their operations to Ireland.<br/><br/>The EU&rsquo;s negotiating position on this also reflects that the withdrawal agreement should address issues arising from Ireland&rsquo;s unique geographic situation, including transit of goods to and from Ireland via the United Kingdom.  Discussions on the land bridge, which is an important issue for the pharmaceutical and medical devices sector, are continuing during phase 2 as part of the Irish-specific strand of issues and the Department of Health is playing and will continue to play its role in this context.<br/><br/>Regarding current objectives and our work programme, it is noted that the next phase of the negotiations will see an intensification of preparations for the discussions on the framework for a future EU-UK relationship.  This is hugely important for Ireland.  The European Council guidelines reaffirm the EU&rsquo;s desire to establish a close partnership with the UK.  This is very much in line with Ireland&rsquo;s objective of having the closest possible relationship between the EU and the UK.<br/><br/>The Department of Health will continue to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s exit, as part of and in parallel to work in Brussels.  This includes contingency planning for all possible scenarios.<br/><br/>Brexit is specifically identified in our business planning process.  The Department's Management Board and its Subcommittee on Brexit continually review the implications of Brexit.<br/><br/>Brexit is also specifically identified in the HSE's service plan for the year ahead.  The HSE has established a steering group to prepare for the UK&rsquo;s withdrawal from the EU and its EU-North-South unit has taken on a project management role.  It has a number of work streams that are set out in the statement and it contains a full and comprehensive approach to Brexit preparations across the Department and all our agencies.<br/><br/>Following last month's agreement that the common travel area, CTA, can continue, work is ongoing with a view to ensuring that the arrangement and its associated rights and entitlements, including in the health area, will remain effective and function at a practical level post-Brexit.<br/><br/>The UK has committed to maintaining full alignment with those rules of the Internal Market and the customs union necessary to protect North-South co-operation, the all-island economy and the Good Friday Agreement.  How exactly this will work will be the subject of the UK-EU negotiations as the process moves into the next phase.<br/><br/>Engagement with stakeholders is an important pillar of the Government&rsquo;s domestic response.  Within the framework of the All-Island Civic Dialogue on Brexit, three plenary dialogues and 20 sectoral dialogues have taken place in locations across the country.<br/><br/>Since we were here last, we have intensified engagement with stakeholders.  The Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, convened an all-island civic dialogue on Brexit and its implications for cross-Border health co-operation in Dundalk in September last year to discuss and share views on the possible implications of Brexit.  The sectoral dialogue meeting was very well attended, with over 80 participants from the North and South.  Participants were from a wide range of backgrounds including health service delivery agencies, service commissioners, business associations, patient representative organisations, local authorities and non-governmental organisations active in health and social care.  The Minister gave the opening address at the dialogue and participated in five break-out discussions, taking the opportunity to sit with each of the five groups and listen to the points raised regarding the implications of Brexit for cross-Border health co-operation.<br/><br/>By way of conclusion, we are in a better position in terms of the Government securing concrete commitments on the maintenance of the common travel area as well as clear and strong commitments on avoiding a hard border.<br/><br/>The agreement reached in December is very significant for everyone on the island of Ireland, the UK, and our fellow members of the EU.<br/><br/>From a Department of Health perspective, we are pleased to be able to report progress in ensuring a comprehensive appreciation of the depth of health services co-operation on a North-South and east-west basis and a fuller understanding of the reciprocal rights associated with health care as part of the common travel area.<br/><br/>Working directly with health counterparts in London and in Northern Ireland, as well as with the EU taskforce through the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, we have established a shared understanding of the scope of health rights and health co-operation and, importantly, we have explicit commitments to maintaining the service-level co-operation and the reciprocal rights that apply between Ireland and the UK.<br/><br/>Looking ahead, the Department is continuing to intensify the work as the negotiations move into the next phases.  This will involve deeper examination of the issues, identifying contingencies and continuing liaison with all relevant stakeholders.<br/><br/>It has been agreed that Irish specific issues will continue to be taken forward in a distinct strand of the negotiations in phase two.  This will ensure that they will not be overlooked in the next phase and that work will continue on how to protect the Good Friday Agreement and the peace process and avoid a hard border, based on the agreements reached in phase one, in parallel with the wider negotiations on scoping out the EU&rsquo;s future relationship with the UK.<br/><br/>The committee can be assured that the Department of Health will play its part in ensuring health related issues are fully understood in this phase.<br/><br/>Again, I want to say that we genuinely recognise the valuable work of the committee captured in its report and I thank the members for the opportunity to be here again today.  We look forward to the views and questions of the members.</p></speech>

As is the practice, I will take the questions in groups of three.  The first three will be myself, Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony and Senator Colm Burke.  If Mr. O'Connor can respond, I will call Senator John Dolan and Senator &Oacute; Donnghaile.</p> <p>  I have some questions.  It is very welcome that Mr. O'Connor has more information for us than he had on 8 March because I am sure I was not the only person who was deeply disappointed at the level of engagement we had at that time.  My first question concerns the staff.  How many staff in the Department of Health, and Mr. O'Connor can express it as a whole time equivalent, WTE, if that would be helpful, are employed full time to work on Brexit?  I fully appreciate it may not be their full-time job but how is that work being divided?</p> <p>  In his submission Mr. O'Connor made reference to the Department of Health deepening engagement.  There is a lot of use of the words "deepening" and "intensifying" but in plain terms, what does that actually mean?  When he says he is deepening an engagement with somebody, does it mean the Department is stepping up the number of meetings?  Does it mean that the quality of the discussion is enhanced or that there is more output?  Mr. O'Connor might clarify that for me.</p> <p>  Can Mr. O'Connor give us a list of the members of the HSE steering group, and are they the people who are engaging with the stakeholders?  If they are, Mr. O'Connor might identify the stakeholders for us.  He made a point that the Minister attended the meeting and sat in on the working groups but how will that translate into hearing what people say and turning it into a plan?</p> <p>  Practically, is Mr. O'Connor in a position to guarantee continued investment in the radiotherapy services and the cross-Border arrangement between Donegal and Altnagelvin hospital?  Can he give a guarantee that people in Donegal will continue to benefit from those arrangements?  I can tell him that when they saw that this issue was down for discussion here, we received a huge number of calls, obviously through Senator P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn and Deputy Pearse Doherty, but they are coming back to us.  They want to know if that guarantee is in place.  One of the issues raised with me was the potential chill effect on building capacity.  We all know it is a good arrangement and that people are benefiting from it but the fear is that as Brexit moves closer it will have a chill effect on our success and being able to build on that.</p><p>Deputy Murphy O'Mahony and Senator Colm Burke are next.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.376" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1262" speakername="Margaret Murphy O'Mahony" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018012400002#F00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for giving their time.  I represent a very rural constituency in Cork South-West.  Up until the meeting last year, when I thought about Brexit it was to do with how it would affect farming, fishing and tourism.  It has already affected tourism in west Cork because of the uncertainty.  I never thought how it would affect anything else, particularly health.  The witnesses have focused my mind on the fact that Brexit will have effects all around.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Connor said there are currently no changes to patient care, as the UK continues to be a member of the EU.  What changes does he envisage could happen?  Does he see any change in the orphan drug situation with regard to availability or to more or fewer trials?  Are the witnesses aware of whether the pharmaceutical companies are thinking about what changes could take place or making any plans to deal with Brexit?  A steering group has been put in place.  Who are the members of that group?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.377" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018012400002#F00300"><p>I thank Mr. O'Connor for his comprehensive presentation.  On the cross-border health care directive, the figures show that something like 86% of those reimbursed were treated in the UK.  The UK health system is facing a lot of challenges at the moment.  There has been a huge reduction in the number of nurses coming into the system since the vote on Brexit.  Is it possible that, should the UK health system come under pressure in the future, they would prioritise the care of their own citizens?  Could Ireland suffer as a result?  I am aware of the numbers and that some 1,741 were reimbursed in 2017, which is a very small number in the overall context of the UK health system.  However, it appears that the UK health system will have challenges.</p> <p>  Are the Department of Health and various medical organisations in this country doing anything to look at alternatives to the UK system?  We seem to have a huge reliance on it where care is not available here.  There is a great deal of sub-specialisation going on now in every area of health care.  Maybe we should be considering other jurisdictions as regards developing important connections.  We are very focused on the UK in the area of transplants, for instance.  That is always a challenging area.  Are we making any effort to make direct links with any other health care systems for instance in Germany, France, Belgium or the Netherlands?  </p> <p>  There are many doctors and nurses in the Irish system who at some stage in their careers have either worked or trained in the UK.  Could there be a change in that regime in respect of training?  I am aware of the whole common travel area issue.  How might Brexit affect the supply of medical practitioners?  We are facing major challenges in that area in Ireland, as is the UK.  Are there connections between the various educational bodies and institutes of medical practitioners?  Do they envisage any changes because of Brexit?</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's question on the issue of drug supply, the Irish population is very small compared to that of Germany or the UK.  We are very much tied to the UK in respect of the supply of drugs.  Once the UK is outside the European Union - provided that is what will happen - will the pharmaceutical companies approach the British market differently?  Could the Irish health system lose out in the process?  Has there been any discussion of that challenge with pharmaceutical companies?  Even simple things like packaging might be affected if what we get is geared towards the English market.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Muiris O'Connor" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2018012400002#F00400"><p>There is quite a lot there.  I will take the Vice Chairman's and Deputy Murphy O'Mahony's questions.  I will ask Mr. Smyth to address the cross-border health care directive and the issues of training and qualifications.</p> <p>    In terms of the number of full-time staff at the Department of Health on the issue of Brexit, we have a comprehensive, whole-of-Department approach.  The international unit that Mr. Smyth heads up plays a co-ordinating role.  There are seven people in the international unit, of whom four are working full-time on Brexit.  The other three are drawn in regularly in very comprehensive ways.  Our model is to decentralise.</p> <p>  The committee's report pressed us to go from higher-level international diplomacy issues to the nitty gritty detail of the current co-operation and service provisions, which required us to work with the subject experts at different levels.  The head of the medicines unit is working very proactively with the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, on Brexit.  I would say that comes close to full time for a number of people in that division.  The HPRA would have a number of people working actively on Brexit to go through and look at the medicines.</p> <p>  We have a sub-committee of our management board, chaired by deputy secretary Colm O'Reardon.  There are three of us from the management team directly on that as well as key principal officers from around the Department.  We also have the head of primary care from the HSE on that sub-committee of the management board, to create a link with the HSE.</p> <p>  In turn, the HSE has its own steering committee on Brexit.  I do not know the full membership.  I took part in a meeting of the group before Christmas.  There are the heads of primary care, emergency services, and procurement.  We are very satisfied that we have the right people at the right level on that.  The HSE has its Brexit work organised into a number of work streams, including the continuation of the current patient and client health services; cross-border and frontier arrangements, including co-operation and working together, COWT, crucially; emergency health services including ambulance, transport costs and the coast guard; and public health matters.  The continuity of supply of goods and services is being looked after and managed by the head of procurement.  Procurement arrangements themselves are a key issue for the next phase of negotiations and the HSE has a strand on that.  Workforce issues and the recognition of qualifications is another strand.  These are not just dry structures.</p> <p>  Our strategic priorities around Brexit are reflected in the service plan.  What are we doing in a concrete sense?  A big part of the contingency planning is brokering partnerships between the health services North and South to share ideas.  There is serious concern on both sides.  It is a collective engagement on the challenges.  We are working on developing practical solutions to common health challenges and new ways to improve health and social care services for the well-being of people on the island.</p><p>As already stated, there is a commitment from the UK - it came earlier than December - to continue support for the current rounds of INTERREG and PEACE funding.  We want to ensure a very successful implementation of the projects to which I refer under the INTERREG programme and with our partners in Northern Ireland.  The undertaking of those projects, which involve co-operation on mental health, e-health and other issues, are being used by us and others to bottom-out what are the implications for Brexit in the context of the continuity of those programmes.  Importantly, in the December agreement, the UK and the EU committed to looking favourably at future rounds of that, and that would be critical for services on a cross-Border basis.</p><p> We want to support key structures, including Departments, the North-South Ministerial Council, the special EU programmes body, and continue to conduct with the full support of the HSE detailed analysis on the implications of Brexit.  It sounds tired, like we are continuing contingency planning, but this is a moving target and we need that sort of contingency planning.  Even the committee's report pushed us to bottom-out the more extreme scenarios.</p></speech>

In that regard, I would be a little worried in that the Department seems to be pinning all of its hopes on the maintenance somehow of the common travel area.  I am not convinced that there is a fallback option.  I apologise for the interruption.</p></speech>

It is an objective shared with the UK and with the services, the HSE and its counterpart in the North.  The commitments agreed in December provide a favourable context for its continuation.  The movement of people and their associated rights to access services on either side of the Border on an equivalent basis to residents and local citizens will very much help.  It is underpinned by a service level agreement that was signed originally in 2014 for a period of at least 25 years.  It is the outcome of a shared investment of capital to create the facility.  It was always intended to be an ongoing part of our key service provision.  It is the only way we can plan appropriately for highly specialist, time-critical services for the population of Donegal.  That is understood by all and there is very strong commitment.  The key in the next phase is to monitor, for example, the alignments that are necessary, even regarding matters such as radiation and the regulation of medicines, and the equivalence that would be desirable around the recognition of qualifications.  We are confident that these will be sustained.</p></speech>

At the dialogue, there was this concern that the pause, the interregnum that Brexit was creating, would flatten some of the momentum.  I suppose we are vigilant in respect of that.</p> <p>  As regards the people of Donegal, their access to services in Northern Ireland has improved.  That is what it is.  We are not only preserving something.  We are protecting a trajectory of progressing and deepening co-operation.  Letterkenny has entered into a number of further service level agreements since we were here in March last year on a range of specialist services that we can provide details on.</p></speech>

That is a given.  The service level agreements that I have seen in respect of these additional services are on three-to-five year timeframes.  That is not reflecting any pessimism beyond that.  It is merely a manageable natural point of review and taking stock and it will allow us to see past the immediate phases of Brexit negotiations at the wider EU-UK level.</p> <p>  What changes could happen was a key concern.  I suppose a key part of our work under the common travel area was to ensure the full awareness of the extent of the depth and breadth of health service co-operation North-South and East-West and the extent of the reciprocal rights.  As part of the travel area and the Good Friday Agreement mapping exercise, we were able to reach a comprehensive shared understanding with the UK and our Northern Ireland health counterparts on what compromised the current co-operation and we reached high-level agreement that our shared objective was to protect all this as the UK departs from the European Union.  Our objective is to maintain the full suite of services.  As I stated, what we are trying to protect - we do not like the word "preserve" because it suggests something static - is a trajectory of deepening co-operation.  Often, it is merely sensible, practical co-operation on a community basis.  Also, we want to protect the East-West aspect because, as came up with Senator Colm Burke, we have relied heavily on the UK in terms of the treatment abroad scheme for specialist services, many of which are not available here.</p> <p>  As well as moving to ensure full engagement and a shared understanding and shared commitments with the UK, we are, of course, looking at how we can expand our links into mainland Europe.  Sweden, the Netherlands and Germany are countries one sees in the statistics.  We have probably 30 or 40 people going there.  We would need to explore with those hospitals what additional services could potentially be available.  It is important to note that the UK is leaving the European Union; Ireland is not.  All of the European Union's health facilities will remain available to Irish citizens into the future.</p> <p>  In terms of pharma, it is important to note that the regulation of medicines and medical devices is very much a European-wide concern rather than a purely national concern.  Our national regulator, the HPRA has been active in preparing for Brexit and its implications for medicines availability in Ireland.  The HPRA is very much plugged in to the EU regulatory system via the European Medicines Agency and the Heads of Medicines Agencies network and its strong relationship with other national regulators.  The HPRA is strongly represented at the EU and Ireland is very well regarded in terms of its regulation of medicines and contribution to the European approach to the regulation of medicines.  In addition to that strong relationship with Europe, the HPRA enjoys a particularly strong working relationships with its UK counterpart, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency, MHRA.  It fully intends to maintain this relationship, both before and after Brexit.  Only last week, the MHRA, the British regulatory authority, issued a statement to pharmaceutical companies on its preparations for Brexit clarifying that the UK position on medicines regulation is that it will continue to work closely with its European partners in the interest of public health and safety.  It is encouraging that the UK's regulators recognise the importance for them of maintaining the equivalence, and even their ambition to continue to trade in medicines would necessitate that from their own perspective.  This follows on the joint report presented by the EU and UK on phase one of the negotiations which made clear that goods placed on the market before withdrawal would be allowed to remain on the market so that there would be no meltdown on the day itself.  We will just have to monitor it.  My expectation is that the UK will regard maintaining equivalent regulation as a necessity for itself.  That is exactly the position we would want to maintain but we have to watch this.  This is subject to broader EU-UK negotiations.</p> <p>  On the orphan drug situation, the Minister, Deputy Harris, has played a leading role internationally in this regard.  The larger countries tend to have a look-after-themselves approach to these matters and that is what makes it so challenging for the smaller countries.</p><p>Therefore, in our international relations, our key approach has been to find like-minded health authorities in the European Union beyond Britain.  The Benelux countries have an interesting set of ongoing co-operations to negotiate with-----</p></speech>

The UK was not an obvious partner for this kind of thing.  The UK, Germany and France tend to have an "I'm all right, Jack" approach to the supply of medicines.  Our organisation, the HPRA, is looking at matters such as the scale of the Irish market, packaging and so on.  Again, the best of all possible scenarios is the UK maintaining equivalence with the medical regulations pertaining in the European Union and the packages remaining the same.  However, we are already working with other countries in mainland Europe to explore dual-language packaging and guidance leaflets.  As the committee recommended in its report, any changes or developments in this regard, or even no developments, should be accompanied by public awareness-raising, education and reassurance about safety.  I ask Mr. Smyth to respond to the question about the cross-border health care directive.</p></speech>

It is really important to understand that the dimensions of this concern not only health, but also travel, education, rights to study and so on.  It is really important to understand the significance of that for the health system for Ireland, the EU and, indeed, the UK.</p> <p>  Senator Colm Burke is right about the cross-border directive.  The directive's focus in terms of Ireland is on Northern Ireland and the UK.  One thing we need to do in the context of the common travel area with the UK is to see whether we could put an alternative arrangement in place.  We also need to look at other countries.  As a result of the fact that I work in the international unit, I deal not only with Brexit but also with international engagement more generally.  Therefore, we deal regularly with ambassadors from other EU countries and we would certainly be very minded to look to see whether there could be opportunities in other EU member states for us to have health arrangements.</p> <p>  Regarding the issue of training and so on that was raised, workforce planning is a global issue.  The World Health Organization predicts a global deficit of 18 million skilled health workers by 2030.  I think the common travel area will be very important in this regard.  It should facilitate a continuance of training arrangements.  That is very important.  The Department produced a national strategic framework for health and social care workforce planning.  It is a key feature of the issue of recruitment and retention of staff.</p> <p>  I hope that clarifies the points raised.  If there is anything else I-----</p></speech>

Are we progressing this, in particular in respect of Sweden and Germany?  There is much more sub-specialisation there in what we could only dream about here.  Have we made that connection and are we continuing to grow it?</p></speech>

Regarding any specific initiatives, we will need to look at the contingency in the future but, from my experience of the ongoing contacts with ambassadors from EU member states and other states, there is certainly an opening and an opportunity that could be explored around those issues.</p></speech>

I will start by referring back to the engagement we had last March.  One thing I mentioned at that stage was the risk that we would be all over the place or very busy and that everyone would be doing a lot but not actually steadying up and doing an up-to-date risk analysis.  I wish to come back to that now because there is that old adage that one measures twice and cuts once.  We only have one go at this.  Perhaps my comments are very old-fashioned, but we need to go over the ground assiduously a number of times in order to double-check and to involve others in that double-checking.  That can be difficult for us to do at times.  Mr. O'Connor placed some emphasis on the good news of the agreement in December.  Then there is talk of moving to the next phase.  Would it be possible to set out in a sort of matrix or graphic, rather than a narrative, what those key risk areas are and what kinds of actions are being taken to mitigate them?  It is a matter of moving from talking about certain groups being set up.  We can easily keep talking about things.  That is just human nature.  That is one question to the witnesses.</p> <p>  Another key point I wish to raise is that there are two parties here.  The EU is involved in this as well, but north, south, east and west are very much about Ireland and the UK and Northern Ireland.  In that context, there are two entities, namely, the Irish and UK Governments.  It strikes me that Ireland is quite clear about and united in its objectives in respect of this project.  I do not have the sense that the entity with which we are negotiating has the same top-level unity of understanding or purpose.  One is better off negotiating with someone when one knows that that person knows what he or she wants.  One might not like what that person wants, but at least one knows.  That is, to some extent, an issue in this.  It is important to raise it here but it is an issue that goes beyond this forum.  At the same time, Mr. O'Connor mentioned, for instance, the issue of the regulation of medicines.  It would seem to make sense that the UK would not want to be in a different regulatory regime from that of the rest of Europe.</p><p>It would be useful to have a list of what would be the fairly strong interests of the UK.  What would be less so?  Knowing this would help us to do the risk analysis and marshal our work and activity.  There may be matters about which they are a little more indifferent and which might not be the big issues.  It is important for us to know those factors.  It is about getting down and dirty.  Perhaps I should not say "dirty" but rather down and detailed and forensic.</p><p> I come from the area of disability and people with chronic conditions.  This is not foreign to any of us and people have been talking about such matters.  There is a two-way street.  Ireland, and even the island of Ireland, is small in a population sense when compared with the UK.  Mr. O'Connor mentioned one area where Northern Ireland requires services that we have here.  In the polio area, people come from Northern Ireland to Beaumont Hospital.  All that makes sense.  On the other hand, we have in cases traditionally gone to the UK for all sorts of supports.  Senator Burke mentioned looking at other locations or, as I would describe it, flying over the UK.  It was correctly mentioned that we are entitled to all the European Union, EU, health facilities.  There is a sort of cultural and language issue coming into play.  It is soft but other countries are foreign to us in a way the UK is not.  We can rhyme off parts of London and Manchester and we have kith and kin.  We share a language.  It might seem a soft issue but it is an issue nonetheless.  How would one get used to going to Sweden or elsewhere?  This will affect a small number of people but these are practical matters for people and families.  It is critical they are able to do this.  We find it hard enough to make it easy for people to go to the UK.  This could be a very different space for people at a terrible time in their lives.  It should be examined.</p><p> I raised the matter of rare conditions before and others have also raised it.  It is a growing area, like so many areas in health.  At the start of the Department's presentation last year, the witnesses spoke about the principal impacts of Brexit for the health sector, covering a number of areas, including free movement, rights to health services and regulatory issues.  They must all go into breaking down the risk analysis.  I am glad the question was raised about the HSE establishment of the steering group.  When was that done and what is it getting into?</p><p> There has been mention of other Departments dealing with education, foreign affairs and trade etc.  Who is minding the determinants of health piece that is not the direct responsibility of the Department of Health?  Are there other entities with whom we should have a chat in here?  The Department of Health can communicate with others but it may not have a lien on them.  It is important as there are elements in other Departments that would have an impact on people's health.</p></speech>

What is the degree to which the Department has identified the main areas of potential threat after Brexit?  Have they all been covered and are there areas not mentioned?  A so-called walk away scenario has been mentioned across the water on more than one occasion but that is that country's choice.  We certainly did not ask them to do it.  Has that scenario been examined?  Has the Department examined the extent to which the prices and costs of medicines we must avail of compare with manufacturing costs in other EU countries?  I hope the UK will have a trade agreement with the European Union, although some of the negotiators on the UK side have suggested otherwise.  In the event that it turns out otherwise, has the Department made the necessary provisions to ensure we do not find ourselves in an isolated position as an island off an island, despite being members of the European Union?  I hope we will still have the full benefits of membership of the European Union.</p> <p>  To what extent will medical science knowledge be exchanged and exchangeable after Brexit?  Will it be possible to avail of advances in medical science in the likes of case conferences?  To what degree has the Department examined the ongoing availability of such procedures after Brexit in the event of a walk away scenario?  What other countries are most likely competing with Ireland for the British market in pharmaceutical exports and other medical science advances?  To what extent has the Department isolated them?  What are the conclusions and is the Department satisfied, again in the event of a scorched earth policy, that we will survive and not be disadvantaged as a result of somebody else deciding to leave the European Union?  Somebody else could go at a later stage on the basis of a success or failure in the British exit.</p></speech>

I have read over it and a couple of my questions have already been asked.  I will not engage in repetition but I will make a couple of observations and ask quick questions.  They are probably well-rehearsed observations.  We all know and appreciate that Brexit is bad for one's health and nothing shines a light on the folly of Brexit and partition than issues of health and health service provision.</p> <p>  There were points earlier that concerned Altnagelvin and service delivery across the Border.  I appreciate fully the uncertainty of Brexit but communication with patients is critical.  One reason Brexit is bad for one's health is that if someone is suffering from cancer or a degenerative illness, uncertainty and a lack of awareness is not good.  Whatever information the Department can provide to patients in co-operation with colleagues North of the Border would be vital.</p> <p>  Strand 2 of the Good Friday Agreement identifies health as an area for North-South co-operation.  We have mentioned at length the issue of the Border and the potential for a hard border.  Much like the Chair, I do not necessarily share the confidence in the retention of all of those elements of the common travel area etc.</p><p>When we speak about our ambulance network, it does not just apply to land.  It also applies to the air, and there are unique issues regarding access to airspace as a result of Brexit.  Is this part of the considerations about our ambulance network which operates throughout Ireland and is it factored into the discussions at that level?</p><p> With regard to the contingency plan, Senator Dolan made a fair point on hearing some of the views.  Far be it from me to tell my granny how to suck eggs, but it might be of benefit to the committee, if it has an opportunity and if it has not done so already, to hear from British officials directly and engage with them, given the uniqueness and the strand two element we must consider as Oireachtas Members.</p><p> While I appreciate that the committee wants to get into the nuts and bolts and the nitty-gritty of health issues, there are bigger political and diplomatic issues.  Mr. O'Connor has said the UK will leave the EU.  It is important to point out for the record that I am being taken out of the EU and, potentially, 1.5 million Irish citizens North of the Border who benefit from all-Ireland co-operation on health are being taken out of the EU against their wills.  We need to ensure we do everything we can to uphold, protect and defend the rights of those Irish and EU citizens, and ensure there is no alteration, not least to the strand two element of the Good Friday Agreement and the very positive, progressive and growing cross-Border co-operation and service delivery.</p><p> My question is primarily on the issue of the air ambulance and the impact on another all-Ireland body, which deals with food safety promotion.  What are the considerations with regard to the impact on people's health?  A number of EU programmes are delivered along the Border corridor, with a particular focus on health outcomes, whereby communities in Lifford, Strabane, Monaghan and Crossmaglen are working with a specific health delivery remit.  I appreciate that was a bit vague and opaque, in keeping with the spirit of Brexit, but it is the best I can do at this stage.</p></speech>

Regarding medicines and dual registration products, there is an arrangement between some English-speaking countries to have shared patient information leaflets and packaging on some medicines.  The UK tends to be the biggest buyer in these markets.  It tends to be the UK, Malta and Ireland that share licences on products such as Ventolin inhalers.  I am concerned about this.  Has the Department considered there would be a potential massive price increase if the arrangement ceased?</p> <p>  My next question is on population health and immunisation.  On the previous occasion the Department appeared before the committee we spoke about viruses and bacteria not recognising borders.  From a human health point of view, there is not much point in us having a very comprehensive vaccination programme for MMR and the roll-out of HPV vaccine on the island of Ireland if the same is not being reciprocated across the Border.  It would diminish the effect of such initiatives.</p> <p>  With regard to the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines to which so many medical professionals and pharmacists turn, if there is a hard Brexit or a full Brexit how will these guidelines be recognised?  Will they just be the UK's guidelines and will we have to look to somewhere else?  Have we looked at this issue?</p> <p>  These issues also feed into animal health also.  We have the eradication of TB from our food supply and regulations on the removal of spinal cords in meat factories with regard to CJD and mad cow disease.  Have we looked at this?  What are we doing about it?</p></speech>

I will try to deal with most of the questions myself and I will ask Mr. Smyth to take the interesting questions on the determinants of health, our interactions with other Departments, food safety and the continuity of ambulance co-operation.</p> <p>  Senator Dolan asked whether we are too busy to conduct a proper risk analysis.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate his instincts.  In a way, Brexit is a moving feast and it has evolved.  The Senator spoke about clarity in respect of the destination desired by the United Kingdom, and this is a difficulty.</p> <p>  In terms of matrices, in the interdepartmental arrangements there is a plethora of templates and matrices.  As last year developed, on the back of inputs from the committee and others, there was a realisation that while we wished for benign outcomes we had to plan for the worst and work back from there.  Disorderly Brexit templates have been filled out and assessed by all Departments.  They are not shareable but they deal with a collapse in negotiations scenario and the contingencies and fall-outs that would happen.  They have come in from all sectors.</p> <p>  Many of our worst fears have been alleviated to an extent by the commitments made in December.  There were strong concerns in the committee's report of last May with regard to freedom of access and continuity of co-operation and we have come a long way in this regard.  It keeps coming back to the common travel area, but we put a lot of store on the enduring rights that will apply to citizens and residents of Ireland and the UK to come and go to work and avail of social security and health services.</p> <p>  With regard to engagement we can do all the work on templates at our desks, and we are doing so very comprehensively, but the best approach to contingency planning is engagement with stakeholders and service providers.  An awful lot of the co-operation of which we are most proud and which is most meaningful to citizens, particularly in a cross-Border area, have operated between the services and trusts in Northern Ireland and the HSE in the Border area.  We have looked at all the various service level agreements, SLAs that apply, and we have come across 30 SLAs that operate in respect of the Border area.  Some of these are very substantial, such as the North West Cancer Centre's 25 year time frame and huge shared capital investment.  Others deal with a place for an individual in a better facility, which is more approximate to his or her home, in the disability sector or in the social care sector.  We are looking at all of these.</p> <p>  With regard to the point on the lack of clarity of destination by the UK, this remains the case.  As I understand it, the UK is being given the first quarter of this year to clarify its desires on an end game and future relationship.  The EU is shoring up the withdrawal agreement on the basis of phase one, and the UK will set out its intentions.  This will give us a lot more to work with in terms of reaching the desired destination.</p> <p>  It is not an easy thing to expect us to leapfrog the UK and bounce into European health care environments.  It is probably not just about the cultural affinity and kinship we have with the UK.  There is also the language.</p><p>It is probably also the case that clinician to clinician relationships are quite strong, which builds on the fact that often the people involved were classmates at some point and now have very good relations.  I do not want to give the impression in any way that we are looking beyond the United Kingdom.  Our key focus has been on deepening our engagement with health authorities in the United Kingdom.  We have been reassured by their commitment to continue to allow access to their services, but there is an EU context in which we operate and we will have to look at whether a more bilateral arrangement is needed.  That work is being done on a whole-of-government level to give effect to the commitment to continue to allow access to UK services.  We will do both; we will deepen our links with European health facilities and work very closely with UK counterparts to maintain the access patients in Ireland have had.</p><p> Dealing with rare conditions brings home the very real benefits of the European Union as a whole.  The 28 member states derive much better value, an impact and scientific progress from collective engagement in dealing with some of these challenges.  As members are aware, he United Kingdom has played a critical role in leading a lot of the consortia in dealing with rare conditions.  It is another one of those areas in which I presume it sees it as being in its own interests to maintain that engagement, but the level of its involvement is be determined.  We will support having the closest possible connection between the United Kingdom and the European Union, but we will also deepen our engagement with European facilities such as bio-banking and clinical research facilities.  We have it on our agenda to make sure Ireland will sign up fully and engage centrally in the European Union.</p><p> Deputy Bernard J. Durkan asked whether we had examined all of the risks and whether there would be a collapse.  We have looked at the worst case scenario and stepped back from there.  It is a concern that the United Kingdom will leave us in a position where there this will be an island off an island.  I have heard it said Ireland is more exposed to the impact of Brexit than even the United Kingdom.  We are very conscious of this.  As well as the positive developments in respect of the common travel area and there being no hard border, there is an important paragraph many might not have noticed on this being an island off an island.  In that context, the concept of a landbridge arises.  We are looking further into it in the context of the importation of medicines at a high level.  Somewhere between 10% and 15% of the drugs we use are imported from the United Kingdom; therefore, we are not as exposed as one might think.  It is not like the position in agriculture.  Only 6% of our pharma exports are to the United Kingdom as the industry is global.  As I said, we are looking further into the matter because while there might be a modest amount imported from the United Kingdom, I presume the majority of medicines come through it on freight trucks.  There is a live strand of negotiations between the European Union and the United Kingdom on a landbridge to facilitate the transportation of goods from mainland Europe to Ireland.  On a practical level, it could involve the use of sealed containers that would not be opened while passing through the United Kingdom.  Such practical issues are being addressed.  It is reassuring that the negotiations on Brexit are getting down to the nuts and bolts which corresponds with the committee's push to have us get busy on what matters.  We have done a little of it.</p><p> Deputy Bernard J. Durkan also inquired about medical science.  We have enormous respect for the calibre of those involved in medical science in the United Kingdom and their leadership.  We hope they will not seek to disengage from the European scientific community.</p></speech>

We have examined our exposure in terms of the number of projects in which we are involved and the number of consortia led by the United Kingdom or in which it is involved.  The connections are extensive.  There is an opportunity for Ireland in the sense that some grants are mobile and if the principal investigator was to relocate, the money would also move.  That is one of the few chinks of light in the context of Brexit, but we would not want to lose our engagement with the United Kingdom.  Science Foundation Ireland and the Health Research Board are proactive in seeking to maintain the links with it.</p> <p>  Ireland is very strong in the pharma industry on the back of the multinational base.  As regards our competitors, I would have to look at the figures again, but I think the Netherlands is also very strong, as are some of the Nordic countries and Germany.  We will keep an eye on that issue.</p> <p>  Gabhaim m&iacute;le bu&iacute;ochas leis an Seanad&oacute;ir Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile as a cheisteanna.  He is correct in what he says about health inputs.  I do not know what people expected initially when Brexit was a theoretical concept, but health issues have really acted as a reality check.</p></speech>

As the Senator is aware, it is the case that our national ambitions and aspirations at a high level have a practical and community dimension.  Our contribution, as a Department and a sector, since our last outing at the committee has deepened and grounded the sense of reality of Brexit.  The implications for patients are front and centre of our considerations.  It is difficult because of the changing nature of the negotiations to propose communicating with patients, but we will do so as much as we can.</p></speech>

A question in that regard was asked by the Chairman.  There are people in counties Donegal and Derry and further afield who could be affected.  There is no doubt that the services provided in Altnagelvin hospital are first class.  I appreciate that there is a resource element involved. but there would be merit in contacting patients, even to let them know what Mr. O'Connor had told us.  I fully understand the position is fluid, but patients are enduring enough trauma and concern about the potential detrimental impact on their health without having further uncertainty or worry placed on them.  There would be merit in taking such an approach and perhaps it is something the committee might explore down the line.</p></speech>

I can understand the imperative surrouonding it.  Health is one of the key strands of the Good Friday Agreement and a good bit of our energy in the third quarter of last year went into taking part with the EU 27 in a comprehensive mapping exercise.  Again, it took Brexit from being a highfalutin concept to a reality check.  There was a day-long meeting in Brussels involving the EU 27 across the table from their counterparts, including those from Northern Ireland.  It was a very productive session that deepened the awareness of the EU 27 and that of the United Kingdom.  There was a proposal to communicate with patients on the breadth, scope and benefits of co-operation.  We detailed the level of co-operation and our shared commitment to maintain it.  We also tried to float issues with a wider significance.  Even a simple thing like a prescription being recognised on both sides of a border presumes a certain equivalence in the regulation of medicines.  One also presumes there is recognition of the qualifications of the signatory to the prescription and the pharmacist.  On each of these little things we have shown the corresponding higher level issues and one can see some of the results of that work coming through.  A certain amount has been agreed and we will outline how we can give effect to the commitment to continue to allow access to services.  There are key issues the United Kingdom, in particular, has to face in its approach to the recognition of qualifications and the regulation of medicines and medical devices.</p><p>It is encouraging that the UK's regulators clearly recognise the merits of equivalence, but disclosing that is probably a political matter.</p><p> The ambulance network is being considered.  We do not have any issue in that regard.  Blue lights at the Border was probably one of the first issues cleared at meetings, in that it will not be a border.</p></speech>

The crucial issue of Irish citizens in the North will be centre stage in the next phase of negotiations.  There is some reassuring language around no diminution of their rights in the grand European context.  That is hopeful.</p> <p>  Before I pass over to Mr. Smyth, I will address Deputy O'Connell's point.  Shared packaging between the UK, Ireland and Malta has served us well.  We share the English language.  Shared packaging presumably gives us good bang for our buck and reduces prices.  The Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, is working closely and proactively with other European countries on dual-language packaging so that we can replicate the kind of arrangement that we have with the UK with another large market, for example, France or the Netherlands.  The impact on pricing, currency inflation, the tariff that might apply in a collapse, the tariff that might apply in benign circumstances and all other scenarios are being considered under the procurement strand.</p> <p>  The quantum of medicines that are produced in and come directly from the UK is less than I had presumed at the outset, but we need to examine what drugs are involved as well as potential alternative markets.</p></speech>

Everyone among the health authorities is facing in the same direction in this regard, but there remain queries in the next phase about the regulatory alignments and commitments to ongoing co-operation.  I suspect that co-operation on health protection, notifications of infectious diseases and so on are something that the UK will wish to achieve and on which the EU 27 will insist.  They apply well on EU borders as matters stand, so it would be a good thing.  We want to sustain the existing deep co-operation and alignment.</p> <p>  We have benefited a great deal from the UK's National Institute for Health and Care Excellence, NICE, guidelines.  We have leaned on the UK's regulatory system in a sense.  A part of the reason that the guidelines have been so helpful is that the UK's system has given practical expression to the EU directives and regulations.  That is the umbrella that we share.  We will look into this matter closely.  We will adhere to all EU directives and regulations, and it is our sincere hope that the UK will recognise that doing so is in its own interests as well.  Deviations from EU regulations by the UK would be problematic.</p></speech>

One of the main advantages of a whole-of-government approach to Brexit is being able to deal with the full range of issues within that structure.  From a health perspective, we are minded to ensure that the range of issues, including direct and indirect health issues, is taken into account in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade-led process.</p> <p>  Regarding determinants, it is important to focus on the issue of regulatory alignment.

I also welcome the representatives from the Equality and Rights Alliance and IBEC.  It is very important to get perspectives from outside the Houses on the legislation, which has gone through Second Stage, before we bring forward amendments on Committee Stage.</p> <p>  I will give members a very brief overview of what is proposed in this short but important legislation.  At present, equality law in Ireland is governed by measures introduced since the 1990s, namely, the Employment Equality Acts and the Equal Status Acts.  The former provides for a prohibition on discrimination in respect of employment and access to employment.  The latter deals with a prohibition on discrimination in respect of what can generally be referred to as services or the offer of services to citizens in the State.  Both Acts contain prohibitions in respect of discriminating against individuals on what are referred to as discriminatory grounds.  One cannot treat an individual less favourably than a person who is not so associated, on the basis of the discriminatory grounds.  One cannot discriminate against a person on gender grounds - because the person is a woman - in an employment context.  One cannot discriminate against a person because he or she is a Traveller in terms of permitting access to a public house or institution such as that.</p> <p>  It is important to remind members there are nine discriminatory grounds in legislation.  They are gender, that is, one person is a woman, the other a man; civil status; family status; sexual orientation; religion; age; disability; race; or membership of the Traveller community.  Those nine grounds are set out in section 6 of the Employment Equality Act and section 3 of the Equal Status Act.  In respect of any such discrimination, it has to be acknowledged that it is extremely difficult to prove whether, for example, in the employment context, an employer is discriminating against an individual on the religion ground or the gender ground.  One does not really know the thought process behind a potential employer's decision to employ one person and not to employ another.  Let us not be under any illusion that it is easy to prove discrimination because it is not; it is extremely difficult.  The benefit of the legislation is that it sets out very concisely and clearly that discrimination on these grounds is prohibited.  It sends a message to the community when people see legislation introduced by the Oireachtas which says one cannot discriminate against individuals on these nine grounds.</p> <p>  The legislation introduced by Deputy O'Loughlin and I would add a further ground, namely, the disadvantaged socioeconomic status ground, to those already in existence.  It sounds complicated.  I will tell the committee the thinking behind it.  Very many people have come into my constituency clinic and informed me - I was surprised when I heard it first - that if they are from certain local authority estates or estates which have a reputation, unfairly or undeservedly, of being areas where there is anti-social behaviour or high crime, they do not put down the address in their estate when they apply for a job.  The reason is that communicating their addresses in certain well-known estates or local authority housing areas deters employers.  I was astonished when I heard this.  It obviously happens because it has been mentioned to me on numerous occasions.  I will not give examples of local authority estates but it is the case, unfortunately, that discrimination takes place against individuals looking for jobs when they put down in their curricula vitae or application forms that they are from particular estates.  Everyone in this room will agree that such forms of discrimination should not be permitted.  It is simply unacceptable that an employer would prejudicially assume that a person who is from such an estate is less capable of doing the job than anyone else.  That is how it applies in the area of employment.  Similarly, under the provisions of the Equal Status Act, it would be wholly unacceptable if people were being prevented from having access to a public house or restaurant because they came from a certain local authority estate.  Pubs and restaurants are perfectly entitled to have a dress code or any type of code they wish.  I hope Deputy Wallace is not offended by that.</p><p>One thing they are not allowed to do is turn around and say that they do not want particular groups or individuals coming in because they come from such and such an area in the State.  This legislation proposes a tenth ground that one cannot discriminate against people in employment or against people in the equal status legislation if they have a disadvantaged socio-economic status.  That is difficult to define but the Bill proposes to insert a new definition of disadvantaged socio-economic status, which I believe to be most appropriate, namely, "'Disadvantaged socio-economic status' means a socially identifiable status of social or economic disadvantage resulting from poverty, level or source of income, homelessness, place of residence, or family background;&rdquo;.  I am aware there have been reports on this before and that the Minister has some concerns about it.  I have thought about it and I believe the proposed amendment is worthwhile, as does my colleague Deputy O'Loughlin.  Like all of the other grounds, it will be difficult to prove, but I believe that everyone in this room agrees there should not be discrimination against individuals on the basis of where they are from, if they happen to come from a disadvantaged socio-economic background.</p><p> It will also add some vigour to equality law in this jurisdiction.  Sometimes, perhaps unfairly, equality law is seen as being a rather niche interest that applies to certain interest groups.  I suspect there is a lot of discrimination in this area.  This legislation would benefit significant numbers of people in our society and, more than the fact that it could be identifiable before the courts, it would send out a strong message that one cannot discriminate against people because they come from a poor background or from certain housing estates that are perceived to be associated with anti-social behaviour.</p><p> This is the opening I wanted to give and I am happy to take questions.  Most importantly, I want to hear the views of others and I want to hear the views of IBEC and the Equality and Rights Alliance.  The witnesses must feel free to say what they want in this regard.  The committee want to hear the criticisms of the legislation.  It has not yet reached Committee Stage and any suggestions or amendments that are made will be considered on Committee Stage.</p></speech>

We bring our statement on behalf of more than 170 civil society groups and individuals who are involved in equality and human rights issues.  There is huge interest in and welcome for the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2017.  We congratulate and acknowledge the initiative of Deputy O'Callaghan.  It is timely and important.</p> <p>  The new ground will be important in underpinning and strengthening the links now created between equality and human rights with the establishment of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission.  This is important because we need to align our equality legislation with our international human rights commitments, which already contain a prohibition on discrimination with regard to social origin and socio-economic status.</p> <p>  The new legislation can take advantage of the integrated multi-ground equality, diversity and non-discrimination systems adopted by many public and private sector organisations since the enactment of the Employment Equality Act and the Equal Status Act.  Those Acts presented a real challenge to these organisations, in moving from one ground to nine grounds.  There was a significant burden in gearing up for that legislation.  There is no significant burden for private and public sector organisations in gearing up from nine grounds to ten grounds.  It is merely the addition on one ground to the already developed multi-ground equality and diversity systems.  The proposed legislation can serve as a valuable and necessary complement to social policy in this field.  For too long we have lived with the contradiction where we allow discrimination on the socio-economic status ground to undermine our aspirations regarding poverty policy and social policy in that field.</p> <p>  The proposed legislation is not a surprise.  It has been argued for since the Employment Equality Act 1998.  In that legislation the response to the demand for more than nine grounds was made by the Minister at the time by including a review clause requiring the Minister to assess, within two years, the need to add further grounds.  Already the pressure was there that it was not sufficiently comprehensive legislation and there was a need to go further.  As part of that review, in 2002 the former Equality Authority proposed the introduction of a socio-economic status ground, highlighting high levels of socio-economic discrimination in the labour market, as Deputy O'Callaghan has just done.</p> <p>  In response to the proposal from the former Equality Authority, a research report of 2004 commissioned by the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform suggested that a socio-economic status ground would serve the objectives underpinning the equality legislation.  Importantly, the report also pointed out that it would allow a more sophisticated intersectional approach to its implementation.  Many of the grounds do not operate alone in incidences of discrimination.  They combine to produce a cumulative disadvantage.  Research from the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC, has shown that socio-economic status affects the exposure to discrimination and responses to discrimination.  Most of the grounds intersect with the ground of socio-economic status.  It is crucially important, even in protecting the other grounds, that we include the ground of socio-economic status.</p> <p>  The Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2015 introduced housing assistance as a new ground into the Equal Status Act in order that people in receipt of housing assistance and social welfare payments could not be discriminated against in the provision of accommodation or related services.   This was the beginnings and the foundation for the socio-economic status ground.  This Bill will complete and build on that foundation.</p> <p>  As for the history of the Bill, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, in a 2015 submission to the UN, highlighted the need to prohibit discrimination on the basis of socio-economic status in equality legislation.  The UN committee noted its regret that Irish legislation does not provide protection against discrimination on all grounds of discrimination prohibited by UN human rights covenants.</p> <p>  The case for the enactment of the Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill has been well made over time.  In this regard, most assistance has been given by the CSO&rsquo;s regular quarterly national household survey, QNHS, equality module, which is produced every four years.  This has highlighted a significant lack of comprehensiveness in the coverage of our equality legislation.  We can also look to developments across Europe and the European Union, where provision for such a ground is increasingly evident in equality legislation.  The analysis of the 2014 QNHS equality module highlighted high levels of discrimination; 12% of the population aged 18 or over reported experiencing some form of discrimination in the previous two years.  This is a high figure even in comparison with other EU countries.  Within this figure the survey identified very high levels of discrimination beyond the coverage of our existing legislation with 29.6% of those who reported discrimination stating that it was on grounds other than those covered by the current equality legislation.  This is a major challenge if we want our equality legislation to function and to meet its goals.</p><p> In an analysis of the previous quarterly national households survey equality module, the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI, and the then Equality Authority identified that this other ground, this 29.6%, is most related to income, location or address.  To the extent that was possible on the data that was there, the evidence was that the missing ground is that of socioeconomic status.  Looking across Europe, our research noted that in 2015 the European network of legal experts at the European Commission identified that equality legislation now provides protection against discrimination on the ground of socioeconomic status in 20 of the 35 European countries they cover.  Ireland broke new ground with the Employment Equality Act 1998 and the nine grounds it covered.  We were the leaders across Europe.  We are now the laggards.  One of the areas in which we lag behind relates to socioeconomic status and the introduction of that ground.</p><p> We also note that research by Equinet, the European network of equality bodies, found that it takes time for this ground to become embedded and understood, as Deputy O'Callaghan has pointed out.  However, it has shown its value over time, with increased and more comprehensive casework.  These cases now cover the fields of employment, social services, public and private housing, health care and social protection.  We have no reason to believe that Ireland will be any different from other European countries in that regard.</p><p> Finally, I will address the question of definition.  The definition of the socioeconomic status ground does present challenges.  Everybody has acknowledged that.  However, it is not unique to this ground.  The definitions of the race ground and the disability ground, in particular, have presented challenges in the past.  This has not proved in any way to be an impediment to their implementation, both through law and through practice of public and private sector organisations.  Equality legislation has never worked on the basis of large numbers of cases coming forward.  Every time we introduce new grounds, there is a prediction that it is going to open the floodgates and there will be thousands of cases.  That never happens.  Equality legislation, for various reasons, functions on the basis of a small number of strong and successful cases that serve to generate a culture of compliance.  That reflects what we are trying to do with equality legislation; to build a culture of compliance so that discrimination does not happen in the first place.  That is why this ground is so important.</p><p> We need to be careful not to define the ground too narrowly so that it does not play that role.  The definition needs to be broad enough to encompass those who experience the discrimination.  It needs to be specific enough to allow for action to prevent such discrimination, which is the ultimate goal, and to enable cases to be brought forward.  We believe the definition outlined in the Bill matches this requirement, but also matches the proposals already put forward in the past and reflects current practice across the European Union.  The Equality Authority suggested using a number of indicators to establish socioeconomic status, in a similar way to the definition in this Bill.   These include family background, geographical location, home ownership, educational background, and economic situation.  The 2004 report of the Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform noted the use of the following indicators in defining the ground: level of education; level of literacy; homelessness; geographic location; source of income; level of income; type of work or profession; and employment status.</p><p> Finally, in our research, the Equality and Rights Alliance noted four clusters of indicators in the provision on this ground in equality legislation across Europe.  These include the focus on social origin in Belgium, Croatia and Hungary; the focus on social status, social position, social condition or social class in Bulgaria and Croatia, and in a proposal before parliament in France, wealth income, property, economic situation or financial status in Belgium, Bulgaria Croatia and Hungary; and education in Bulgaria.  We have found that the most effective approaches to resolving the definitional issues involve a situation-specific analysis, which is why these indicators are so important, and an asymmetrical protection focused on the issue of disadvantage, and those in a disadvantaged socioeconomic situation.</p><p> We believe we have the infrastructure in place to ensure the effective implementation of this ground.  We have an Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, which is now well-established and well-resourced.  This is very welcome.  The commission has a key role in awareness-raising around such a ground, and in providing guidance to employers and service-providers on the indicators that might be covered by it.  We have in place a functioning Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, which is increasingly improving its performance on equality cases.  That body is there, along with the courts, to provide necessary interpretations.  That is the way legislation has always worked.  We have the infrastructure to make this work.</p></speech>

I will commence by noting that IBEC is very keenly aware of the challenges that individuals face in accessing good jobs and the quality of life that is associated with secure employment.  To be clear right from the get-go, we do not necessarily believe that the measure proposed in this Bill is the appropriate way of achieving these goals, and we see that there is significant potential and risk that this particular proposal may increase social stratification and stigmatisation.<br/><br/>IBEC is of the view that a fully integrated labour market activation approach to education, training and employment needs to be formulated, so that all individuals can have the same chance to compete for jobs and opportunities within the labour market.  We absolutely recognise that business has a central role to play in tackling issues such as long-term unemployment and youth activation, and that business can play an important role in opening up workplaces to persons who are unemployed and helping develop links to the world of work.<br/><br/>In this regard, IBEC has been proactively engaged in the promotion of diversity and inclusion for over a decade, working with employers and other stakeholders to support early years intervention and labour market activation.  I will come back to this point.<br/><br/>I would like to address some of the key points in this particular piece of legislation with which IBEC has considerable concern.  The Bill defines disadvantaged socio-economic status as meaning: &ldquo;a socially identifiable status of social or economic disadvantage resulting from poverty, level or source of income, homelessness, place of residence, or family background&rdquo;.<b></b>The breadth of this definition and the lack of clarity around it give rise to certain concerns for businesses and employers generally.  The first concern is that the Bill may unfairly stigmatise certain districts or postal addresses as disadvantaged or in some way undesirable.  We believe that the Bill also risks stigmatising the reliance on social welfare for a period, which is unlikely to be of assistance in achieving the broader goal of greater social integration and mobility.<br/><br/>Given the lack of clarity within the definition, there is a strong risk that it will include individuals not intended to be protected by this piece of legislation.  Fundamentally, the definition provided for in the Bill provides no assistance to employers who wish to ensure that they comply with their obligations under employment equality law.<br/><br/>In fact, we believe that the definition will create more questions than it will answer.  The Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy David Stanton, has already identified some of the flaws in the definition in a recent D&aacute;il debate.  From personal experience of 15 years as a practitioner in front of the Labour Relations Commission, Equality Tribunal, Employment Appeals Tribunal and now the WRC, I am very conscious of how we need to present this information.  Several questions will arise for employers.  How will a disadvantaged income level be defined?  Will such a definition be relative to a specific income threshold?  Will everyone on a social welfare payment be considered disadvantaged?  Would the definition include persons living in a rural area, who are not necessarily poor, but have more limited opportunities to access employment, or perhaps limited access to broadband?  Given that the equality legislation requires us to demonstrate who our comparator is, how would the comparators who are not so disadvantaged be identified?  Would this question be relative to a specific income threshold?  Would those individuals not in receipt of a social welfare payment automatically be regarded as an appropriate comparator?<br/><br/>The reference to family background is particularly ambiguous, and would certainly pose a huge difficulty for employers.  For employers, this turns on its head the requirement with which we generally operate, the requirement to prove a case.  In this instance, we would almost be required to prove an absence of knowledge in order to be able to demonstrate whether or not there had been any question of discrimination.<br/><br/>The Employment Equality Acts quite correctly provide for significant redress for employees or job applicants who are subjected to discrimination in the workplace, or in the course of accessing the workplace.  Given the really wide definition of discrimination, and the financial impact of falling foul of the legislation, it is crucial for employers to be able to precisely understand their obligations and what constitutes discrimination.  <br/><br/>Legislators have a responsibility to ensure that statutes are clear, certain and precise.  Those who are expected to comply with legislation should be able to understand what it means and who is captured by it.</p><p>Legislators also need to recognise that employment equality legislation provides for very significant redress, including compensation of up to two years remuneration for every breach as well as potential reputational damage.  That is a very heavy onus on a clear understanding of what that legislation requires someone to do.</p><p> IBEC is of the view that more targeted measures are required to address the issues which are the subject of this Bill.  We have already had very significant engagement in trying to address measures to increase labour market activation.  Intreo on the Employment and Youth Activation Charter is one such example.  This business-led initiative enables employers to sign up to a charter to commit that at least 50% of candidates considered for interview will be taken from the unemployment register.  In addition, employers commit to a selection of other measures aimed at addressing long-term and youth unemployment.  There are currently 430 companies signed up to the charter. </p><p> While not operating at the moment, the Ballymun pilot Youth Guarantee is another good example of how this activation works.  It was a partnership of public employment services, employer and trade union representatives, education and training providers, local development organisations and youth organisations.  It aimed to guarantee that all of those on the unemployment register would be supported to secure or receive work experience, training or educational opportunity within a short period of becoming unemployed.  If we are serious about addressing inequality, focus needs to be on supporting on the well-documented learnings and reform proposals coming from this project.</p><p> There is a compelling economic and social case for new initiatives to raise levels of education skills.  In our broader submission we have already sent to the committee, we have set out some of the detail on the correlation between education and work.  Levels of earnings and security in employment are clearly adversely affected by low levels of proficiency in basic skills.  In our view effective education policies and programmes are critical to achieving positive economic and social outcomes that deliver for individual citizens and the country as a whole.</p><p> We acknowledge that there are matters of social justice which need to be addressed.  We recognise that there are concerns about the stratification of Irish society.  However, the employment equality legislation, and specifically this initiative, is not the vehicle to achieve greater socioeconomic equality.  This needs to be done by way of a strong State education system, effective labour market activation measures and other social supports, particularly early years intervention.  </p><p> In reality, many of the barriers to employment that exist in Ireland relate to the absence of required levels of work experience, qualifications and skills rather than by reason of discrimination because of an applicant&rsquo;s background.  IBEC is happy to continue to engage with all stakeholders on achieving socioeconomic equality.  We are available at any time to discuss any of the other initiatives we already support in this regard.  However, the Irish business community cannot support a Bill that proposes such an inappropriate method of dealing with the issues it proposes to address. </p></speech>

I will certainly reflect on everything that has been said and I know that other committee members will also reflect on it before it reaches Committee Stage before the select committee.</p> <p>  I want to emphasise that we cannot just be satisfied with equality legislation that is on the Statute Book and which we do not believe needs to be reviewed and updated on an ongoing basis.  Sometimes politicians are satisfied to state that we have equality legislation in place and that ticks the box.  It is important for us to continually review and update it.  I was interested by what Mr. Niall Crowley said about comparators in other countries.  Obviously the last thing I would want to do is introduce something that might have a significant negative impact on business or individuals who were trying to secure employment.  People who deal with this on the WRC are sensible people who can interpret the purpose behind the new ground being introduced.  Unfortunately this type of discrimination occurs and there is a responsibility on us, as legislators, to take steps to try to ensure that does not occur.  We have to do it in such a way that it does not impinge too much on or cause any difficulties in the area of business.  Just because there are some fears about it that is not sufficient to suggest that we should not proceed with it.</p> <p>  I thank people for their contributions and I know we will all reflect very carefully on them.</p></speech>

It is a reality that discrimination on a socioeconomic basis happens; I would say it is quite widespread.  I acknowledge that legislation is not always a panacea.  The Equality (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2005 included housing assistance as a new ground.  While that was welcome, unfortunately people will find ways around it.  At least it has made discrimination on the basis of HAP or rent supplement more difficult even though many Deputies will be of the view that it still happens anyway.  Legislation clearly has a role but it is not a panacea.</p> <p>  Mr. Crowley's point that a small number of cases can encourage a culture of complaints is a point well made.  The Bill does not simply apply to employment, but also applies to services.  I dare say that public bodies are equally culpable or potentially as culpable as employers in discriminating.  Unfortunately in our constituency offices we also come across discrimination against people on the basis of who they are, where they are from or their background in accessing public services.</p> <p>  I do not agree with the point made about stigmatisation.  I hope this would empower people.  A point was made about places being identified as disadvantaged.  The State identifies places as being disadvantaged.  It is a recognition of reality and where properly done - sometimes it is not - it involves additional resources and supports.  It is important to recognise the reality on the ground where communities are disadvantaged and that we work with them on the basis of that.</p> <p>  I have the following question for both the Equality and Rights Alliance and for IBEC.  If somebody felt they had been discriminated against on the basis of their address or on the basis that they applied for a job and somebody less qualified got the job - perhaps it was a job within a legal firm and the son or daughter of a lawyer got the job and a more qualified person who was the son or daughter of an unemployed person was unsuccessful - under what grounds would they be able to take an action?  How would they be able to make a case that they had been discriminated against?  Is there space within the nine grounds or within other legislation for them to say, "I believe there has been discrimination here on the basis of who I am, where I am from or what my parents did.  I can prove it."  If it can be proved, under what grounds is that actionable?</p> <p>  There has been a fair bit of talk about the definition.  The Equality and Rights Alliance believes it should not be defined too tightly.  While I agree with that, it is important to strike the balance between broadness and precision.  I put this question to IBEC also.  How closely does the definition in this legislation resemble international comparators?</p></speech>

If I omit anything, please let me know.  A point was made, including by colleagues, that a small number of cases would lead to a culture of compliance.  That is often the aim of legislation and, in certain circumstances, it may be effective where we can readily identify the issues and people can in future examine cases and outcomes, see what a particular ground means and apply and understand the legislation.  In that type of environment, it can be easier to have a small number of cases leading to a culture of compliance.  However, the question of socioeconomic background is so broad that every case would be challenging.</p> <p>  As to the practical reality on the ground and some of the issues that arise, I will first address the question of stigmatisation that Deputy O'Callaghan raised.</p></speech>

In order to prove that issue, we potentially must define that estate as an area of socioeconomic disadvantage.  We must then inform employers that it is an area of socioeconomic disadvantage, who may then have to consider that circumstance for every applicant from the area.  How would we manage that?  Would the local authority estate be in a different postal district, for example?  The challenge is determining how anyone would know what the socioeconomic background was in advance of someone coming through.</p> <p>  When we consider the practical reality of how to prove-----</p></speech>

How would an employer ever prove this point?<br/><br/>Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire asked how a person could take an action if someone less qualified but who was the child of two highly professional parents got the role.  The requirement on employers is to be able to demonstrate in any interview process what their criteria were for the role and how they scored one candidate against any other.  From our experience, we get plenty of requests for feedback on how people have interviewed.  An employer is obliged to have a transparent process in place.<br/><br/>It would be difficult for any claimant or employer to prove whether discrimination took place, given that every individual comes with a different set of skills, qualifications, fit and enthusiasm for the role, which are legitimate aims for an employer to consider in an interview context.  The challenge is to be able to define how discrimination took place.<br/><br/>In light of the fact that our society is becoming more diverse and more people are joining it, which is great, how do we determine whether any recruiter or employer has knowledge of an individual's background?  Where the case is made that discrimination has happened based on family or socioeconomic backgrounds, how would any employer ever know in the first instance?  We would be under an obligation in front of third parties to prove that we did not know a piece of information as opposed to we did not actively discriminate based on that information.<br/><br/>I will cite an example from my experience.  I grew up in Dundalk.  I do not understand the school system in Dublin.  People talk about this school and that school and how they went to one or the other.  It does not mean anything to me.  As an employer hiring someone, I would have no knowledge of one school being different from any other.  I would be considering someone's background, qualifications, education and presentation.  Many people will simply not have those.  In an interview, I would have no indication of someone's social or family background.  As more people enter our society from various EU countries and elsewhere, they will have no knowledge or understanding of what might be considered socially disadvantaged.  The Deputy mentioned that some of these issues are well known out there and that people understand, but many do not understand.  From Donegal to Kerry, people do not understand what may be a socially deprived area in any other county.<br/><br/>The width of this definition and the requirement to prove to a third party that a person did not know something and factor it in pose a significant challenge.  Once the <i>prima facie</i>case is made that there may be a ground for discrimination, the burden falls on the employer to demonstrate that he or she did not discriminate.  How could the employer prove that?<br/><br/>We keep coming back to the question of what the threshold for the areas of discrimination would be.  How would I know if someone was on a social welfare payment?  How would I know if someone was in receipt of housing supplement or family income supplement or had been out of work for a time and was in receipt of social welfare?  Even if social welfare is the marker, maternity payments count as social welfare, as do carer's leave payments.  There are many social welfare payments that we would have to enumerate in terms of whether they should be included or excluded for the purposes of determining someone's income and background.<br/><br/>There are simpler and more pragmatic ways of addressing some of these points.  Most of my younger colleagues have no memory of ever putting an address on an application form or CV because people use their email addresses now instead.  No one posts them a form to fill out.  Everything is done by email.  Most employers will never see a person's address until after they have made a job offer, in which case that job offer has already been made.  If someone has a concern about education, there is no requirement to state what school that person attended.  Someone simply needs to outline his or her educational attainment and work experience on a CV.  The ways to address the points that the Deputy raised are evolving.</p></speech>

The Deputy asked what could be done now where discrimination on this ground occurred.  There are many barriers to accessing work based on socioeconomic status and discrimination legislation alone will not deal with all of them.  Good labour market activation is important, but it does not deal with the significant barrier of discrimination.  It is the same regarding people with disabilities.  Labour market activation supports people with disabilities to enter the workforce, but anti-discrimination legislation is necessary to complement it and ensure that it works.</p><p>Second, business does have role in this regard in terms of the steps outlined.  Business can takes steps to prevent discrimination on a socio-economic status ground and the better businesses do.  IBEC plays an important role in supporting businesses to do that and it is exceptional at a European level in this regard.  We all know that not all businesses take steps to prevent discrimination occurring.  There is not a level playing field for business in this regard and, therefore, anti-discrimination legislation that pushes all businesses to take the preventative steps is good for businesses.  In the absence of legislation, people can do nothing about that discrimination.  In circumstances where people can do nothing about that type of discrimination, it breeds alienation, a sense that change is not possible and that this type of discrimination is normal and we have to put up with it, which is not good for society and our economy.<br/><br/>In regard to the definition, I did not suggest that it should not be drawn too tightly, I said it should not be drawn too narrowly.  It is important that the breadth of the definition is good, as is the case in the current draft.  All studies elsewhere, in terms of this ground, suggest that if the definition is drawn too narrowly it will not work.  It should be tightly drawn, and I believe it is in comparison with other European countries.  There are three tests in the definition: socially identifiable, although I am not sure how necessary that test is, social or economic disadvantage, and the various indicators in that regard.  The definition is drawn significantly more tightly than it is in all other jurisdictions where it has been found to work without problems for those making complaints or those against whom the complaints are being made, or potentially made.  Looking at this issue in terms of the challenge to employers, it is important to say that employers do get a lot of information, more than service providers, in relation to job applicants in terms of CVs and job application forms, so there is a lot of knowledge available to them.  The first burden of proof lies with the person who is being discriminated against.  He or she faces the difficulty and must make the <i>prima facie</i>case.  It is only when he or she has made that <i>prima facie</i>case that the burden shifts to the employer to prove there was no discrimination on the specified ground.  Also, cases are rarely fought to the end.  The better employers, when it is pointed out to them what has happened, resolve the issue well before it goes to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, and a sanction is applied.  There is a lower sanction applied in job application cases.<br/><br/>It is accurate to say that legislation of this nature could stigmatise areas, people or groups.  I do not think women, people with disabilities or black minority ethnic people have been stigmatised by anti-discrimination legislation.  In reality, they are empowered by such legislation and they can become agents of change in their own situations because of this legislation.  That is why it is so important and so good for society.  It is invigorating for society.  The reality is that it is stigma that already exists that is breeding this discrimination.  Legislation to counter this discrimination will break the stigma.  It will show people in a different light.  It will show them as agents of change in their own lives.<br/><br/>The points made by IBEC in regard to the cases could have been said about any of the other grounds, particularly the disability ground, which is more broadly drawn than is the case in any other European jurisdiction.  It includes the term &quot;other medical condition&quot;, which I welcome.  It is important and it works.  It has worked and it does contribute to a culture of compliance.  We have in place an infrastructure which, again, is unique at a European level.  In many of the European countries that have this ground, provision is made only for a tribunal-type body to hear and resolve cases.  They do not have a promotion-type body like the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to provide guidance and support to employers and service providers.  Ireland is uniquely well placed to put this ground into place effectively because not only do we have an institution to deal with the cases when they occur, we also have an institution to support employers and service providers to ensure they do not happen in the first instance.  I think we are well placed to move ahead on this ground.</p></speech>

In some ways this is so obvious there is almost nothing to say.  I do not mean that in a derogatory sense.  Everybody would agree that this discrimination has existed from time immemorial.  We all know that people who come from particular areas feel they cannot disclose it because it will result in their being treated less favourably.  It is almost instinctive in some ways in attitudes.  There are cultural problems also.  That almost 30% of people who are discriminated against are outside the current grounds verifies this.  In terms of the statistics available, I am sure we would all agree that this is a very real problem.  What we are discussing now is how best we can address it and whether the legislation before us will do that.  We will not solve all society's ills by way of this legislation but we need to consider whether it helps or hinders address of the issue.  Based on what I have heard, I believe it helps.  I say that conscious that other legislation brought in has not culturally changed things.  For example, in regard to the housing payment, we are inundated with representations from people who believe they are not being provided with housing because they are on the housing assistance payment scheme or on rent allowance and so on, even though current legislation clearly states that that is not on.  The couple of test cases that have been taken will help to bring about change in this regard.  That is all we can do here.  To me, this is a good measure.</p> <p>  Mr. Crowley spoke about stigma, which is one of the issues I wanted to raise.  Many areas are stigmatised, and by including this clause we are helping to educate people.  Is it not the case that the absence of knowledge is a ground for defence?  Does knowledge not have to be proven in cases of discrimination?  For example, a person could fill out an application form and not state in that application where he or she comes from and then say he or she is being discriminated against because of where he or she comes from, but if an employer can demonstrate that he or she did not have that knowledge then he or she would be home and dry.  That is just one example.  Also, the point was made that an employer would not know that a person was in receipt of social welfare benefits, but if there was a five-year gap in terms of employment or study on the person's curriculum vitae, then the employer would know the person was long-term unemployed.  Presumably, if a person does not have the skill set or experience required because he or she has been long-term unemployed, the employer is not obligated to employ that person.  That is my understanding of it but I would welcome a little more clarify around that issue.</p> <p>  To me, it obvious we should have this although I do not think it is a panacea.  I do not think it puts an onerous burden on employers.  From the point of view of access to services, similar to Traveller discrimination in terms of access to pubs, a publican could choose to refuse access to people from a particular estate because the view is that everybody who lives in that estate is rough or because they dress in tracksuits and the pub requires a particular dress code.  There are ways around this.  As I said, it is not a panacea but it does help to raise cultural understanding and from that point of view it is good.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maeve McElwee" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018012400002#K00700"><p>The point was made about the ability of the tribunals to make decisions on complex and widely defined grounds under the equality legislation, such as disability, but even in the case of disability, generally, somebody can rely on a qualified medical opinion to be able to make that decision.</p><p>That means there is a qualified ground there if there is a dispute or question as to whether someone has or does not have a disability or has one of the particular grounds under the Act.  A qualified opinion can be sought to help everybody to decide and for the WRC to use to make its decision on any case.  That will not be effective in terms of many of the grounds that will be captured under this proposed tenth ground of socio-economic status.<br/><br/>On the absence of knowledge, I can clearly see where Deputy Daly is coming from and, in some cases, it may be a defence to say that it was not on the applicant's CV and the employer did not know.  However, what am I to do in the case of a claimant who asserts, for instance, that someone in human relations knows his or her mother and hence knows where he or she lives?  It is those types of ambiguities and broader issues that make it very difficult to be able to determine whether some form of discrimination has taken place in that instance, because it would then have to be proven that nobody or anybody knew, or if someone's address was known, that it was also known that it was an area of socio-economic disadvantage.  While the claimant does have to provide the <i>prima facie </i>case, that is, quite rightly, a relatively low bar in being able to present that, with the defence then falling back to the employer.  In principle, we are not at odds in any way that we need to address the issue of socio-economic status, but addressing it under equality legislation, where an employer's hands are tied in many ways in terms of knowing in many circumstances across a wide range of criteria whether somebody ticks any of these boxes or anyone in the team has that knowledge, and then to prove that, is extraordinarily difficult and at a very high cost if discrimination is found to have occurred.  It is a real challenge.<br/><br/>The member is correct, and I could not disagree, that if somebody has been unemployed for five years and has no independent means of wealth obvious to an interviewer, it may be obvious that the person is on a social welfare payment or unemployment benefit.  The challenge remains to say whether they were judged on skills and ability or whether there was indirect discrimination in terms of skills and ability in that he or she has been out of the workforce for five years and the person who was hired has not been, so the fact they were on social welfare meant there was indirect discrimination.  How would an employer manage a claim of that nature?  The complexity within the legislation and the burden of proof that would fall is very significant and challenging in this area.  That is why we feel this tenth ground gives no certainty at all to an employer as to how they would apply the legislation.<br/><br/>We have lots of other challenges.  When we return to clarity of areas that are designated as disadvantaged, I reiterate the point that many people will not be aware of that unless we pin up a notice to say that these are areas of acknowledged disadvantage and regularly update them.  We also have many people from other countries who have come here to work.  I would guess that there are very few people who know what an area of disadvantage is in, say, Lithuania, Poland, France or Spain and how we would identify that for a candidate from a different jurisdiction who is coming here to work.  We would have no knowledge necessarily, even if it was declared in an address or different format, that somebody has experience of one of these socio-economic grounds.  That may not be understood here.  Where would the obligation lie on an employer to determine whether any of these pieces of information provided in an application are grounds that the employer must consider under the equality grounds?<br/><br/>It is not the principle of what the legislation is trying to achieve but the absence of certainty in the legislation with which employers must comply and to which they must conform and how we would do that.  How do we set the income thresholds?  What is an income limit that makes someone part of a socio-economic disadvantaged group?  How would I know that?  Test cases will differ because an income limit in Dublin city centre might be very different from family income supplement in Monaghan, Cavan or somewhere in the midlands, for instance.  There is a difference between what that income and background may be, and when we move out into a family background, the possibilities are innumerable.  We can say that we know things intuitively, but intuition is not an adequate point of law when a case is being prosecuted or defended.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-24a.483" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Crowley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2018012400002#L00200"><p>It is important to bear in mind that this absence of certainty has not been an impediment to the introduction of other grounds of discrimination or to employers taking effective action to taking effective action to prevent discrimination in the other grounds.  It is very evident in the religion ground, in race in terms of ethnic origin, and it is most evident in the disability ground.  Not only is it broadly drawn in terms of other medical condition, which is not defined but has some indicators around it, but there are also issues of hidden disability that are not evident, such as mental health issues, where there have been successful cases in that regard.  Consider the complexity of disability yet how effective and important a ground it has been.  Consider how effective it has been in terms of people with disabilities being able to assert their rights not to be discriminated against and how effective it has been in the cultural change that Deputy Clare Daly spoke about in terms of how we view people with disabilities and their situation.<br/><br/>Looking briefly at indirect discrimination, first it must be acknowledged that there are very few cases, and even fewer successful cases, of indirect discrimination.  They are very hard to prove.  The data are usually not available, statistics are difficult to get, but also there is a defence that if the employer can objectively justify the policy or regulation, there is an exemption that indirect discrimination cannot be found.  It is about groups rather than individuals.<br/><br/>That brings us back to how cases are dealt with and how they are argued, whether direct or indirect.  &quot;Do not know&quot; and &quot;Did not intend&quot; are not good defences in cases, even if they can be made.  There are much more effective defences which are used by employers.  The applicant would have to prove first a <i>prima facie </i>case that he or she was less favourably treated.  The employer then has to show that there was another reason that the applicant was treated less favourably.  That is the way in which is happens.  To take a very simplistic case, say a woman goes for promotion, proves that she was less favourably treated, and the employer shows that while she did not get the promotion, it was because the person who got it was more qualified.  When I was in the Equality Authority we won many cases where the employer could not prove that and where the person who got the job was less qualified and therefore the case was won.  That is my final point.  When discrimination happens and is found to have happened, it is almost certain that the employer or service provider does know.<br/><br/>The arguments that IBEC is making relate to the complexity of anti-discrimination legislation and proving cases but we are well tried and tested in that regard, having had nine grounds over such a long period.  Dealing with one further ground which is as complex as the other grounds, but no more complex, is not an argument for not introducing it.  We have a capacity to do it, employers have done it on grounds of disability, race, and religion, and we have the capacity to support them to do it with a very strong and well-resourced equality and human rights body and with an increasingly effective Workplace Relations Commission.</p></speech>

On grounds and how we define them, let us take the example of mental health grounds. If somebody says that he or she has a mental health difficulty and asserts that he or she is being discriminated against on those grounds, it is open to the individual and the employer to ask for a qualified medical opinion, and when that has been determined, it allows us to proceed from there with some certainty around what we are dealing with.  Looking at the example which Mr. Crowley has given of a male and a female and an allegation of discrimination in terms of access to a particular role, the employer will be familiar with the fact that the female has a female background and that may be an area of discrimination.</p><p>It is for the employer to be able to demonstrate that, all else being equal, the appropriate candidate won the day on the basis of skills and ability.  If either of two male or female colleagues were disputing an appointment on the basis that the decision not to appoint was taken based on his or her family background, socio-economic status or income, who will tell the employer at what point the income threshold becomes a disadvantage and against what comparator that disadvantage is to be weighed up?  How would a person know this and if, for any reason, it was known, how would it be possible to demonstrate whether it had been used as a factor in a decision between two candidates competing for promotion in the same place of employment and in whom the employer has clearly invested?  In addition, both candidates will have clearly met the criteria or threshold to allow them to apply for the promotion and both will, therefore, be valued employees.  Again, this comes back to the other grounds for discrimination.  We need some structure in terms of what level would be regarded as discriminatory in order that some kind of determination can be made.  The problem we have with the socio-economic grounds is in determining who would set the bar and in what circumstances one would determine that a certain level of income places a person at a socio-economic disadvantage.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the current protections, I can say we can never have enough protection.  During my years as a Member of the Oireachtas, I can recall two cases involving women in specific employments who acknowledged they had experienced an episode of depression in their lives.  The outcomes in both cases were wholly unsuitable and the women were most certainly discriminated against.  It strikes me every May when I wear the green ribbon aimed at helping to end the stigma associated with mental health issues and encouraging people to speak up that, all too sadly and with relatively recent echoes, these protections are not in place.  These cases, one of which involves a woman in State employment, have been a cause of significant concern to me and I have raised the matter at every appropriate level.  I am sharing this because I feel compelled to place it on record.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting there is no discrimination in society or employment.  As we stated, it is appropriate that there are some significant penalties for discrimination in the Employment Equality Act.  Despite these, unfortunately and regrettably, discrimination continues.  The challenge for the vast majority of employers who wish to comply with the legislation is that they need to be able to understand how they can possibly comply with something that has no limits or structures around it.  How will we define these?  It is not a case of not supporting a more equal and accessible workplace.</p></speech>

There will always be different views on legislation of this nature.</p><p>I have employed a few thousand people in my time and I personally did most of the interviews for employees.  I see the challenges that will arise in areas such as this.  Although I now live in Dundalk, I lived in Dublin for a long time and the discrimination in this city is so blatant as to be frightening.  I have seen it all my life and I see inequality increasing.</p><p>I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan that legislation needs to be revised and updated.  We need only consider the financial implications of the Finance Bill.  No sooner had we removed the double Irish than the double malt appeared as a means of avoiding taxation.  There is a reason the Oireachtas makes amendments to legislation and introduces new legislation in various areas.  As legislators, it is part of our job to do this and it is clearly necessary that we do so in many areas.</p><p>To take as an example schools in Dublin, a person looking for a job in a large financial institution will enjoy a major advantage if he or she attended a private school.  A person before the courts will also be at an advantage if he or she attended a private school.  He or she will only need to put on the old school tie.  We see this every day.  Mr. Crowley pointed out that tinkering with legislation such as this helps to build a culture of compliance and challenges the <i>status quo</i>and we have done this in some areas.  For example, a Minister got in trouble in the Houses a few months ago because he asked a woman in a job interview whether she was married or had children. Such questions would probably not have been a problem 20 years ago but they are now and the same applies regarding the need to legislate in this area.</p><p>I respect that some of the witnesses have issues with the legislation and I accept that employers will sometimes be wrongly accused of discriminating against someone.  On the other hand, sometimes employers will get away with discrimination.  I lost a case for unfair dismissal in which I believed I was in the right but was found to be in the wrong.  That is how the system works sometimes.</p><p>Legislation of this nature is progressive and will play a small part in addressing discrimination and rising levels of inequality.  I am in my 60s and I have never found society to be as unequal as it is now.  Perhaps I was not as aware of inequality in the past but we have a serious problem with rising inequality.  While I accept that is a much broader area, small measures such as the Bill before us will go some way towards addressing it.</p><p>It is important to listen to both sides of the argument and tease out the legislation.  We should have an open mind and listen to both sides of the argument.  While we will not always agree, we should listen to each other.  I apologise for leaving the meeting in a hurry.  I am due to ask a question in the D&aacute;il.</p></speech>

If a qualified medical practitioner says the person has a disability, the employer has to accept that because that is a professional medical opinion.  The employer is not a professional medical practitioner so we have to work from that point.  If a person is a member of the Traveller community, has a particular sexual orientation or has a particular family status as we currently understand it, there are ways in which we can understand what those grounds mean and how they apply to the individual who is making a claim.  This new proposed piece does not have that clarity.  The availability of clarity around this issue is very difficult.  We are asking people to comply with a law that carries a very significant penalty.  One must bear in mind that most employers in this country are in the small employer category and this type of award is enormously significant, both in terms of reputation and financially.  In that context, they need to be able to understand the grounds, how they apply them to a particular individual and what is their level of responsibility in terms of knowing what those grounds mean.  If it is the case that they know that socioeconomic grounds can be taken to mean a particular address, are employers obliged to know what that address is or would it be better if they did not know?  If employers do not know what the address is, should they have known?  Could employers possibly be culpable if the person interviewing with them knew the address, even though it may not have been stated?  Do employers need to know that it is a socially disadvantaged area?  Do they then need to consider whether the individual is actually socially disadvantaged or has come from an advantaged background but, in this current housing market, happens to have bought a property in an area that is designated as socially disadvantaged?  If there is an income threshold, is the individual's income curtailed because he or she has a massive mortgage, is in negative equity, has an exceptionally large family or is on social welfare?  At what point will employers be able to determine, in the way that one can determine that someone has a mental or physical disability or a gender issue, whether a person has a socioeconomic ground?  How far do employers have to go in terms of knowing or not knowing and what limit do they apply to it?  If a person has an issue around income or family background, how far do employers need to go into that before they can securely say they did not discriminate against that person.  Ultimately, when that low bar is reached - we have no disagreement with the fact that it is a relatively low bar - the burden of proof is very detailed and appropriately rigorous on employers.  In terms of this ground, how would they meet that bar?  That is what I am asking this committee, as legislators.  The challenge is that in defining legislation, recommending it and proposing it, one must be confident that it can be understood, be complied with and that it is reasonable to comply with it.  In no way am I suggesting that we do not need to do something about socioeconomic grounds but when-----</p></speech>

In all circumstances, employers are always looking to increase labour market activation, to improve access to the workforce and for people to come through and into the labour market.

I would also highlight the complexity of the religion ground, which refers to "religious background" and "religious outlook".  How clear is that?  Have we heard any complaints about the religion ground?  No, we have not.  How clear is the Traveller community ground?  How do I prove that I am a Traveller?  Have we heard of any difficulty with that ground?  No, we have not.</p> <p>  First, the level of clarity or certainty sought by IBEC seems to be unreasonable.  The second point is that the level of clarity and certainty that is provided is quite significant when compared with other European equal treatment legislation which has much more limited definitions.  In some cases, the term used is "social origin", while in Belgium "wealth" is used.  That legislation, which has much more limited definitions, has been seen to work very effectively once it settles down.  It took a year or two to settle down.  The same was true with regard to the HAP scheme, for example.  It took a year or two for that to settle down for both sides and for cases to begin to emerge and a culture of compliance to build.  It is no less certain than at least three of the other grounds in our current legislation.  It is more certain and more clear than the way it is dealt with in human rights covenants to which we have signed up and in other European legislation.  </p> <p>  In reality, provisions like this do not catch good employers who are concerned about equality and diversity.  Good employers who are thus concerned do not deploy irrelevant characteristics, whatever they might mean, in their selection of people.  They select them on the basis of clear and necessary characteristics.  They do not get caught on issues like family background and not knowing what that means because they choose the candidate who is the best person for the job.  I agree with IBEC that many employers have geared up very effectively to the nine ground equality legislation.  It is not going to require a change of mindset for them to keep in mind that there is another set of irrelevant characteristics that should not be taken into account.  Those characteristics are quite well laid out and are signalled more clearly than in many other European countries.  I do not see that there are issues of certainty or clarity in this.  </p> <p>  It is hugely important for the people who experience this discrimination to have this ground in the law so that they are empowered to challenge the situation and to be agents of their own destiny.  It is also hugely important for society because when we begin to treat different types of discrimination differently we create tensions and divisions in society; tensions and divisions that we can see clearly in other European countries at present.  If one looks at Brexit in Britain and the socioeconomic status versus identity status debate that is going on, that is hugely destructive for society because there is a perception that some groups get treated differently from others.  It is important for our society that we break that before it begins here and include ten grounds in our legislation.</p></speech>

I am playing devil's advocate here and asking how far an employer would have to go to discover a substantive ground?</p><p>What would be the threshold information?  Is it about building a culture of compliance or changing societal expectations?  Is this the Equality and Rights Alliance's view on it?  I would like to get both sides.</p></speech>

The onus on employers is about treatment and less favourable treatment.  That is the argument they will make.  If a case comes against me as an employer I will not be discussing the grounds, I will be discussing the basis for my decision, which has nothing to do with any grounds or any relevant characteristics.  That is the way it is set up because of the fact these cases are difficult to approve and difficult to defend.   It is not just with regard to this ground.  It is set up in a way whereby I, as the person who feels discriminated against, must put forward a prima facie case.  I must select the ground on which I will fight the case and the comparator of which I will make use.  I must also set out a prima facie case of less favourable treatment.  The employer will not come back and state I was less favourably treated but that he or she did not know the ground, or that I was less favourably treated on another ground.  He or she will come back and state it is nonsense and that the decision was made because of relevant characteristics.  That is the way it works.</p></speech>

What about the points raised by Mr. Crowley regarding religious background or a person from the Traveller community?  IBEC has said employers would seek out a medical practitioner with regard to medical grounds.  How do the witnesses respond to the points on these two principles?  Is there a more specific level of detail than in existing principles?  As I have said, IBEC's argument can be thrown into every ground if it wanted to do so.  How do the witnesses specifically respond to the two grounds Mr. Crowley mentioned?</p></speech>

On the grounds of religion or Traveller status, people will declare these are their religious beliefs or their Traveller background status, if that is the case.  Equally they do not need to declare this until such time as any issue comes up, but in the determination of any discrimination people must put forward some ground that they have been discriminated against in this way because they have declared their religious affiliation or Traveller status, in which case there is evidence and it can be determined whether the people are of the religion they say they are or that they are a member of the Traveller community.  It is more clearly defined.  The question of whether someone has a socioeconomic status based on his or her level or source of income is much more difficult to determine.  An employer will have no knowledge of this and cannot ask a person to produce evidence of his or her bank account or from where a person's sources of income come.</p></speech>

We have had a lot of discussion about this in Ireland with regard to the census and whether a person is Catholic or not.  I do not think it can be determined if a person is a Traveller or not a Traveller.  I cannot think of a proof.  Likewise, I do not think it can be determined with certainty whether a person is a member of an ethnic group.  At what point do I stop being a member of an ethnic group if I have parents from two ethnic groups or grandparents from four ethnic groups?  These are all uncertain.  The legislation is set up to deal with uncertainty.  This is why employers come back and state a decision was not based on an irrelevant characteristic but on the basis of A, B and C and the candidate got it with X, Y and Z and that is it.  Where they cannot prove this they get into trouble, because then irrelevant characteristics are at play.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for this opportunity.  I was at another meeting, unfortunately.  I look forward to listening to the contributions from the witnesses and it will certainly inform us.  I will not comment on what has been said because I heard a small piece from Mr. Crowley and IBEC.  The genesis of this was the fact that I and my party recognised, as many of us do, that there can be often discrimination based on a person's socioeconomic status.  We want to put something in place that would alleviate this. Having a conversation about this is also extremely important.  We have no doubt people who live in poverty and are from disadvantaged backgrounds possibly have limited access to justice and rights.  We also acknowledge there is protection at European and international level, and the aim of the Bill is to try to bring us up to an international norm.  I look forward to listening, later this evening or tomorrow, to the playback.  I will then have an opportunity to comment further.  I thank the Chairman for the welcome and the opportunity to say a few words.</p></speech>

I thank them for their respective contributions and their attendance.  I thank committee members for their participation.  There is other business in the House and, on the screen, I see Deputy Wallace is in the D&aacute;il.  We understand why we are down to small numbers at this point.  </p> <p>  Before adjourning I remind members of the joint committee that next week's meeting is a joint committee meeting on the ombudsman and the week after we will have a select committee meeting to continue our address of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill.</p></speech>
