Are the minutes agreed to?  Agreed.  On matters arising from the minutes, last week we decided to publish the three reports that are now available.  Members are invited to the audiovisual room for the launch of the reports at 2 p.m.</p><p>  I refer to correspondence received since Thursday, 25 September 2014.  No. 3B is individual correspondence.  No. 3B.1 is correspondence, dated 22 September 2014, from an anonymous source regarding the Department of Education and Skills undermining the code of governance in the vocational education committee-education and training board sector, to be noted and forwarded to the Department of Education and Skills for a note on the issues raised.</p><p>  No. 3B.2 is correspondence, dated 24 September 2014, from Nollaig Mac A'Chnoic regarding works carried out by Galway County Council in Connemara, to be noted.  This is a letter to the Minister.  As local authorities fall outside our remit, it is a matter between the Minister and Galway County Council.  Should we expect a reply from the Minister?  Out of courtesy, he should keep us up to date on it.</p><p>  No. 3B.3 is correspondence, dated 26 September 2014, from Brendan T. Muldowney and Company Solicitors regarding the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's special investigation unit, to be noted.  I raised matters of concern in respect of the special investigation unit at the previous meeting.  We can deal with this when the Vote of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine comes before us.  I will ask the clerk to contact Mr. Muldowney in order that he can send further details and the court findings related to this case.  I received a number of pieces of correspondence late yesterday in respect of this and other matters relating to the special investigation unit.  We will deal with it under correspondence next week.  When is the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine due to come before the committee?</p></speech>

Members can raise this matter at today's meeting</p><p>  No. 3C is correspondence relevant to today's meeting.

My comment on the Mental Health Commission is the routine pointing out of the non-application of FRS 17.</p><p>  In relation to Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge, there is a disclosure in the accounts drawing attention to the fact that Government consent was required for the director general's contract but which was not obtained.  It is in the course of seeking consent to that contract.</p><p>  There are references to fraud instances in relation to the Sustainable Energy Authority of Ireland in its financial statements.  Attention is drawn to a suspected fraud that occurred in the National Library of Ireland and also to the appointment of temporary staff without the necessary sanctions.</p><p>  In regard to Shannon Free Airport Development Company Limited, which is due to come before the committee next week, I point out that due to changes in legislation and the structure of the company, these financial statements are the last financial statements of the company that I will be auditing. </p></speech>

What happens when the Comptroller and Auditor General puts a note on the audit, in particular in regard to suspected fraud?  Does the organisation have to do a separate report to the Comptroller and Auditor General?</p></speech>

In a situation where there is fraud, the expectation is that management would report the matter to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there would be an appropriate investigation into that.</p></speech>

We suggested to the organisations that they needed to draw attention to that in their statement of internal financial control in order that the matter would be on the public record.</p></speech>

It would be no harm to examine those issues at that time.</p></speech>

Its main functions are to encourage the promotion, development and co-ordination of competitive sport and to facilitate and promote increased participation in sport.  The Council is almost exclusively State-funded from the Vote for Transport, Tourism and Sport.</p><p>  In 2012, grant income - including some deferred pension funding - totalled &euro;45 million.  The Council generated other income of &euro;553,000.  Expenditure in 2012 was &euro;45.4 million.  The Council had a surplus for the year of &euro;87,000, compared to a deficit of &euro;477,000 in 2011.  The Council&rsquo;s administration costs in 2012 amounted to &euro;2.7 million, with payroll and pension costs accounting for &euro;2 million.</p><p>  Almost 90% of the Council&rsquo;s programme expenditure is accounted for by grant payments to sports bodies and individuals, with grant allocation decisions being approved at council or council sub-committee level.  Figure 2 on the documentation shows the main categories of grant payment in 2012.  The largest single area in relation to grants paid is grants to national governing bodies for sports, which totalled &euro;11 million.  Grants for field sports - that is, grants to the FAI, the GAA and the IRFU - totalled &euro;8 million.  High-performance grants, which are also paid to national governing bodies, totalled &euro;6.4 million.  The remainder of the council&rsquo;s expenditure - &euro;4.6 million - was accounted for by a number of programmes it operates directly.  This included expenditure of &euro;1.3 million on the Institute of Sport, just under &euro;1 million spent on anti-doping measures and &euro;0.9 million spent on programmes aimed at increasing participation in sport.  The Council&rsquo;s financial statements for 2012 received an unqualified audit opinion.  The fieldwork for the audit of the 2013 financial statements was carried out in June.  The results of the audit are currently being reviewed, and I expect to receive the file for examination shortly. </p></speech>

We are responsible for planning, leading and co-ordinating the sustainable development  of competitive and recreational sport.  In 2014, a total of &euro;42.5 million will be invested by the public, through the council, in the areas of anti-doping, coaching, governing bodies, high performance, participation, national trails and the Irish Institute of Sport.  A total of 92% of the council&rsquo;s funding will go directly to programmes.</p><p>  The council has 35 full time staff, 19 of whom are based in Dublin and a further 18 in Limerick following Coaching Ireland&rsquo;s integration into the Irish Sports Council in January 2013.</p><p>  To support our mission, the council prepares a three-year strategy statement.  For the period 2012 to 2014, the council's priorities are advancing the participation strategy, developing the capacity of the national governing body sector and sustaining high-performance systems.  Participation in sport in Ireland continues to grow at an unprecedented level.  The latest statistics announced yesterday from the ISC, published under the title of the Irish Sports Monitor, indicate that 47.2% of people participated in sport in 2013, compared to 44.8% in 2011.  In real terms, that is 1,700,000 people participating in sport on a weekly basis.  That is up 85,000 in the last three years.  This positive trend is reinforced by the continued decrease in sedentary lifestyles, falling to 12.6% in 2013 from 13.8% in 2011.  Sport is also playing a significant part in closing the gender gap.  The research released yesterday highlights that between 2011 and 2013, women&rsquo;s participation in sport grew from 40.9% to 42.7%.  This represents roughly an additional 32,000 women taking part in some form of sporting activity.  Closing the gender gap is hugely important for our participation levels.</p><p>  The council continues to lead in the area of welfare and the protection of young people in sport.  We play an advisory role on this for the sporting organisations.  The code of ethics and good practice for children's sport provides support to those involved in sport for young people to provide a safe, positive and nurturing environment where children can develop and enhance their physical and social skills.</p><p>  In the area of high performance, Ireland continues to excel on the world stage.  In 2013, Ireland achieved an unprecedented 67 medals at world and European level.  To put this in context, in 2000, following the establishment of the council, six medals were achieved at world and European levels. In London, we achieved our most successful Olympic and Paralympic games, returning a record five Olympic and 16 Paralympic medals.  It was far beyond our own expectations of what could have been achieved.  We published our targets the year before the Olympic Games and we exceeded them.  This year, 2014, is set to be another phenomenal year on the track, in the ring, on the road and in the water. The success of athletes such as Martyn Irvine, Mark English, Jason Smyth, Katie Taylor and Michael McKillop represents the most successful sustained period in the history of high-performance sport in Ireland.</p> <p>This is due to sustained investment over a long period, which is how we build a high-performance system.<br/>This success is also based on high-performance strategies we have developed and continue to develop.  In 2001, we launched our first strategy.  In 2014 we will work with 19 governing bodies of sport on development of their high-performance plans.  Eighty-five athletes will be directly supported under the international carding scheme based on the criteria for podium, world class and international athletes, while nine golfers will be supported under the Team Ireland golf trust programme.  We are also implementing the recommendations of the independent review following our London performance and have successfully implemented the transition of the international carding scheme to athletics, sailing and swimming, as recommended in the review.<br/>At the Irish Institute of Sport, we are providing high-performance athletes and coaches with an environment to perform on the world stage through the delivery of world-class supports, people and systems.  In 2013, 183 athletes from 20 sports attended clinics at the institute, with over 2,600 hours of support services provided directly to athletes.  In the context of high-performance sport, it is important to ensure we deliver world class services in Ireland for our athletes so they do not need to go overseas.  Plans are in place for development of a high-performance system at our sports campus, and this will ensure our athletes will have world-class support here. This is another important milestone in the development of a high-performance system in Ireland.<br/><b></b>Underpinning the success at both elite and grassroots level are the national governing bodies of sport, NGBs.  We work closely with over 60 governing bodies.  With their member clubs and affiliates, national governing bodies organise and administer most of the organised sport in Ireland.  They train and deploy coaches, organise representative level sport and provide sporting opportunities and pathways from local sport to national and international competition.  Our investment is used to support NGBs in the areas of strategic planning, administration, information technology, competitions, equipment, coaching and core activities, including the code of ethics and anti-doping programmes.  We are also implementing a capacity-building programme with the governing bodies and offer a myriad of programmes through which we can upskill the sector and professional people within the organisations.  We also offer corporate governance support for boards of NGBs.  This support is provided directly if required or if we see the need for it.<br/>In 2014, membership across the sporting sector reached record highs.  Membership in athletics has increased 62.7% since 2010, to 49,000, while cycling membership has increased by 207.2% since 2010, to over 20,000.  NGBs are putting themselves in an appropriate position to help people participating in sport and to provide sustained involvement to members of clubs.  It is vital that this work continue.<br/>The Irish Sports Council is encouraging all funded bodies to sign up to the governance code for the community and voluntary organisations.  As the first State agency in Ireland to encourage the adoption of the code, we are looking to empower funded bodies to achieve excellence in all areas of their work, ensuring their sustainability for the future.  In 2013, the then Minister and Minister of State, Deputies Varadkar and Ring, asked Mr. Paul Turpin, governance specialist with the Institute of Public Administration, to examine the Irish Sports Council&rsquo;s procedures in regard to conflicts of interest on the part of members of the council and to assess whether it meets the requirements of good corporate governance and to make such recommendations in regard to improved corporate governance in the Irish Sports Council as might arise from his examination.  Mr. Turpin submitted his report to the Minister in December and it was published in January 2014.  The Irish Sports Council welcomed the report, which found that the council's procedures are &ldquo;in line with norms and practices prevailing within the State and public sector bodies,&rdquo; and furthermore that &ldquo;the current written Irish Sports Council procedures correspond with the main principles of good governance&rdquo;.<br/>On the issue of anti-doping, our commitment to clean sport is relentless.  Our world class anti-doping programme is internationally recognised by the world anti-doping agency.  In 2013, 868 tests were conducted as part of the national testing programme, with three anti-doping violations recorded.  We will probably carry out a similar number of tests in 2014 and are on track in that regard.  Our programme continues to be intelligence-led, including the development of quality-led targeted blood testing.  We work with representatives of the Irish Medicines Board, the Garda national drugs unit and the Revenue Commissioners' customs service to further establish the intelligence programme within the anti-doping unit.<br/>I hope I have been able to give the committee some flavour of the work of the council.  In the context of participation, numbers are increasing significantly and we see an impact in terms of the work of the local sports partnerships, LSPs, and national governing bodies, with the co-operation of the Departments of Health and Transport, Tourism and Sport, in terms of ensuring we are all on the same message to encourage people to participate in sport for the sake of their health and well-being.  This will save the country money.  In the high-performance area, we are a cut above the rest and are doing extremely well.  Our institute of sport is developing nicely and developing world-class services for our athletes.</p></speech>

I still remember watching him win his silver medal in the Olympics.  Appropriately, I was in Waterford when watching that event.  The fact that I remember an event that happened in 1980 indicates the pleasure sport gives to many people.  I thank all those involved in sport who give so much pleasure to the rest of us.</p><p>  I will begin by asking about the grants to the GAA, the FAI and the IRFU.  How does the Irish Sports Council work out what grants those organisations get?  Does the grant relate to their ability to raise funds?</p></speech>

Most of us are aware that approximately 88% of children in primary school participate in sport.  The main deliverers of those sports are the three main field sports organisations, the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI, which deliver the programmes in primary schools.  We would like to see more happening in terms of physical education in primary school, but that is not the reality.  The three main field sports work with the primary schools to get kids involved.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.56" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014100200005#D00600"><p>Yes; much of the money goes to that.  I will give the Deputy a flavour of where the money goes shortly, but the big impact is in that area.  For every euro we invest with the three main field sports, they put in from &euro;3 to &euro;4 into those programmes.  Therefore, the State is getting very good value for its buck.  It would be nice to have a physical education system in primary schools which the State supports, but that does not happen.  To a large degree, these three field sports and the governing bodies sector move in and provide for sport in schools and outside of them through extra support.</p><p>  In regard to the GAA, the funding goes to the national grassroots programmes.</p> <p>They are essentially development officers who are on the ground with the clubs going into the schools and supporting those programmes.  There is also hurling development where we work to develop hurling throughout the country, which was an initiative by Government.  We also give funding to the Dublin board, which is at &euro;686,000.  Again, the GAA itself decides where that money goes.  We give it a budget and it comes back to us and tells us how it is going to spend the money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014100200006#E00200"><p>Does Mr. Treacy keep fairly close track of that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.59" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014100200006#E00300"><p>We keep extremely close track of that money.  We would give the GAA an allocation and it would come back to us, tell us how it is going to spend the money and the funding would then go to it.  We would audit the big three field sports every three years.  We would send in our auditors, who would verify that the moneys we have given to the sporting organisations were expended for the purposes for which they were given.</p><p>  The governing bodies themselves would also come in to the council to outline their work, which happens on a regular basis.  One of the three field sports would come in on an annual basis or we might have two or three of them in during one year.  They would make a presentation to the council in terms of how that money is spent.  At the end of the year we would get a full report in terms of what targets were hit and their outline of plans for the following year.  We have set very clear objectives and there are very clear measurements which the sporting bodies give back to us.</p><p>  The committee members have been given a copy of the details.  The graph shows the outputs for the State of those three national organisations.  I firmly believe the taxpayer gets very good value for money for our investment in those three field sports.  Our funding has been reducing over time and is down about 25% since 2007 or so.  It is the three main field sports that have taken the brunt of those cuts - in fact, their funding is down 40%.  In fairness, they have taken the brunt of the cut, which the other organisations have been spared.</p></speech>

The CEO of the FAI has a new contract for &euro;360,000 a year.  It seems a very large sum, nearly twice what the Taoiseach is getting.  To some extent, is the Irish Sports Council paying that indirectly?  Has Mr. Treacy any control over that situation?</p></speech>

We are very careful and clear that any of our funding in not going to any salaries of executives.  We are very clear that the funding we give goes to salaries of people involved in the under age participation programme.  That is where the policy direction is, namely, to support under age participation.  We are not providing any funding in regard to any CEO's salary.</p></speech>

In regard to the FAI, it strikes me as an observer and from my work as a Deputy that, of the three main field sports organisations, it is the least well organised.  The GAA and the IRFU strike me as being very well organised but we have a situation where football clubs come and go all the time, certainly if my own constituency is anything to go by.  Is there anything Mr. Treacy can do to bring a better and more effective organisation into being in the FAI or is that entirely in its hands?  Can he encourage it in that direction?</p></speech>

Therefore, the structure is not very strong with regard to having a base and the club structure is a little weaker than the other two main field sports.  In saying that, however, without a shadow of a doubt the FAI works relentlessly in socially deprived areas and it gets into areas that a lot of other sporting organisations cannot go near.  As I said, it does not have a very strong capital programme around the country-----</p></speech>

I absolutely accept the point Mr. Treacy is making but it would be even more advantageous to those areas if the FAI had a stronger organisation.</p></speech>

Obviously, it is developing the League of Ireland clubs around the country with capital support from our Department.  Some work is going on around that as well.</p></speech>

Mr. Treacy has given us some idea through his comments about the GAA, FAI and IRFU as to how he monitors their spending of resources.  Does this apply across the board?  It is probably difficult for the smaller sporting organisations in any case.</p></speech>

The council has a budget that it allocates to the NGB sector.  We would basically prepare evaluations for the sub-committee of the council that evaluates the grants for those smaller NGBs.  We would be looking at what they achieved the previous year, what their targets for that year are, what their strategy is, what organisational capacity they have and where their boards are.  We would look at all of those things and those recommendations would then go to the board of the Irish Sports Council.  The smaller NGBs would then come back to us with a mid-year report where they would outline to us what they have achieved in the first six months and the progress they are making.  If they are falling behind with their progress, they would outline that to us as well.  As part of that, before they would get the second moiety of funding from us, they would send in their financial accounts to us and these would be signed off by auditors.  If the sums are over &euro;200,000, they would have to state that the money is expended for the purposes for which it was given, so we are very clear around that as well.  That process would go on.  When we have our financial accounts signed off by the AGMs of these bodies, we would then release the second moiety.</p><p>  What we also do as part of the process is to carry out audits with those governing bodies of sport.  We would carry out up to five audits a year with those smaller NGBs.  As part of that, our auditors would go in and would probably look at two areas in particular - corporate governance and the financial procedures that are in place.  They would then come back with a series of recommendations.  For the most part, the audits are fine but, occasionally, they will come back with recommendations.  If there are significant recommendations, the council would set up a liaison process with those governing bodies of sport.  A council member, an executive member and I would normally be part of that.  When we have our recommendations, we would ask the NGB to come back with how it is going to implement the recommendations.  We would work through those with the NGB during the course of a year.  When we are satisfied it has worked through all the recommendations of its audit, we would cease the liaison process.  That is the process.</p><p>  Occasionally, if we hear some, I suppose, noise in the system, and we occasionally do hear noise in the system, we would send in the auditors to take a look at what is going on.  That would sometimes reveal things and we would then set up a liaison process to work through some of those issues.</p></speech>

The proposal would consider funding bodies around common governance and best practice parameters around leadership.  This would be the leadership of the organisation, the chief executives, the board, the structure of the board and how it is led, the control mechanisms it has in place, the accountability it has in place, the effectiveness of the organisation, and the transparency and the integrity of that organisation.  We are just starting the process with the organisations.  We will issue a questionnaire to those governing bodies of sport and give them a checklist.  They will come back with a self-assessment around how they are doing in terms of the various parameters.</p></speech>

The council obviously has a code of ethics and good practice relating to children's sport.  We offer advice to the NGBs.

The vast majority of governing bodies have got it around corporate governance.  From the audits we have carried out, we would be quite satisfied that many very good procedures are in place.  That being said, we are now taking it to another level.  What we want to do is make sure that sport leads the way around corporate governance.  We are embarking on this process with them.  It will probably take two to three years to ensure that all the organisations are fully signed up and can comply with the governance code for the voluntary sector.</p></speech>

We work very closely with the organisations on a daily and weekly basis.  It is not a case of putting a gun to people's heads and saying they must do this or that.  It is about encouraging them and for the most part, the organisations comply with what we recommend.</p></speech>

Mr. Treacy mentioned an involvement with and an encouragement of the development of national trails.  Could he tell me a bit about it?  The reason I ask this question is because just over a year ago, I had a Private Members' Bill before the D&aacute;il about access to the countryside.  There are areas in Ireland where access to the countryside is difficult while it is not so difficult in other areas.  Any support we could get on that front from the council would be welcome.  What is the council doing to actively promote that aspect?  One of my concerns is that some of these national trails end up being partly on roads and rural roads of a secondary nature are often the most dangerous roads in Ireland because of their twists and turns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.79" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014100200007#F01200"><p>We are involved with the inspection and development of the trails.  We work very closely with local authorities in ensuring that there are safe trails around the country.  The issue of access is a thorny one.  I do not think anyone is going to solve that overnight but we try to work with and talk to farming organisations to make sure that agreements are in place.  It is a case of working in co-operation rather than having rows about it.  It involves cajoling people to provide access and people then obviously being responsible when they are on these trails.</p></speech>

It is about talking and working in partnership.  Some very good work has been done around this area.  We are predominantly involved in developing inspections and putting the trails on a register.  We are about to launch a trails strategy, which we would like to see put in place over the next ten years.  The council feels that Ireland can certainly lead the way or be a major player in terms of trails development in Europe and the world.  We have the finest countryside in the world and we need to exploit it more.</p></speech>

I will quote one example.  The Fife Coastal Path, which has been opened up on the east coast of Scotland, yields something like &pound;28 million per year for the local community and about 500 to 600 jobs are sustained by that.  I do not think we are sufficiently hooked into the advantages of that for us.</p></speech>

It is because we need to have a couple of high-profile trails that would bring people into the country.  We really do not have a high-profile trail at the moment so we need to develop it.  This strategy is about identifying an area where we can make a high-profile trail that we can develop in the country.  That would be a very good starting point.  I agree with the Deputy that we are behind and we need to catch up.  The potential for Ireland is huge but it will involve investment in trails over the next ten years.</p></speech>

Obviously, boxing is our greatest area of success in the Olympics.  I note the very good work done by boxing clubs.  At the same time, it strikes me, based on my own experience of dealing with boxing clubs, that in many ways some of them might benefit from more administrative competence and getting to a situation where they can have satisfactory premises and so on.  I would have worked very closely with the Neilstown Boxing Club.  For a long time, it had no premises.  Fortunately, it now has premises.  Based on my experience, boxing clubs have a tremendous concern and focus on looking after boxers in their care and from what I have seen, they do a fabulous job.  However, I think they might benefit from developing greater administrative skills.  Perhaps I am generalising too much from the particular but I can see situations where boxing clubs would benefit from that and getting better premises or even appropriate premises where they do not have any.  I am not just talking about that boxing club but others.</p></speech>

Certainly, when the programme was first established, we used to be invited to Russia to spar with the Russians.  That invitation is not coming any more because Ireland is now second in Europe in terms of boxing and they are doing extremely well.  The conveyer belt of producing talent continues to happen.</p> <p>We have world-class coaches, including people like Billy Walsh, who are doing a fantastic job of nurturing young boxers and giving them the expertise they need.</p><p> We carried out an audit of boxing about two years ago and some recommendations were made on financial procedures.  It has now hired a very good chief executive who is in place and has brought a rigour to financial procedures.  It has also hired a new financial officer.  At national level, it is beginning to put structures in place.  That is the critical factor in investment in the organisation.</p></speech>

I accept what Mr. Treacy said in terms of coaching, the care of boxers and so on.  As someone who is not from that background, I was struck by how well the participants are looked after.</p></speech>

We also have, as we would see it, a very good chief executive leading the organisation.  He is available to the clubs and his job is to work with them to upskill them in order that they can apply for capital grants.  The help is available to the clubs which require it, in particular at local level.  Our local sports partnerships can offer individual help to local clubs.</p></speech>

It was a Government initiative led by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and our Department to put the breeding and sporting side together.  That happened.  A legal agreement was signed by HSI and EFI whereby assets, liabilities and staff transferred to HSI.  Yesterday we received a letter from the international body which stated that all the responsibilities went to HSI in 2008.  There was a clear transfer of undertakings in terms of HSI.  That issue has been dealt with as far as we are concerned.</p><p>  The other issue concerns funding of sporting events.</p></speech>

It must be remembered that this was a Government initiative, supported by policy and ourselves.  The reason it was done was because, at the time, EFI was broken and there was a lot of disquiet within the sport.  Bringing the two pieces together was important.  We got funding of &euro;1.7 million in 2006 as part of the Estimates process, which was announced by the then Minister John O'Donoghue.  That money went into the two organisations in 2007 to ensure there was a smooth transition of responsibility over to HSI.  The board of the sports council was fully informed throughout the process.  HSI became the governing body for equestrian sports at that time.</p></speech>

Camphire is an example.  Mr. Treacy is aware of the event, being from west Waterford.  It has been built up over the past 14 years and has international status.  I understand there are only two other three star courses in Ireland.  I understand HSI provides a home international hosting grant of approximately &euro;5,000.  I do not know if the figure increased over the past year.</p></speech>

We have been relatively successful over recent Olympic Games.</p> <p>When I look at the Olympics and at our relative success over recent games, the equestrian area really stands out.  For a very significant horse trial event, &euro;5,000 seems like a very small sum.  Should the Irish Sports Council consider funding these events, such as the Camphire Horse Trial, directly?  I make the case that a more significant sum should be contributed to an event like that, which is an international event, considering the level of success we have seen and the success those who have attended such trials have gone on to achieve internationally, not just in the Olympics but in other world-class events.</p></speech>

It is a sport that fits with our natural environment, which is why the Government initiated the work in 2007.  The unfortunate thing is that our funding has been reducing, which has had a knock-on effect on Horse Sport Ireland whose funding is down perhaps &euro;400,000 over recent years.  HSI currently allocates &euro;84,000 to events throughout the country.  They are broken down to about eight different events, as part of which Camphire gets &euro;5,000.  It is never enough in terms of some of these events which are huge and very important to local economies.  It is the nature of things, however, that funding is down.  The funding was higher in the past, but it is down now, which is a reality of life.  There is huge demand in regard to some of these shows.</p></speech>

I make the case with regard to the equestrian field, however, that for something like this, which has grown over 14 years and become such an international event, &euro;5,000 is a paltry sum.  Given the success and the way in which the Irish equestrian area has grown, the ISC should consider how it can help these events a little bit more.</p></speech>

Obviously, we will encourage HSI to invest more money in these shows.</p></speech>

Mr. Treacy mentioned in his opening statement the Team Ireland Golf trust programme.  I understand it was started in 1999 for young professionals, male and female.  Peter Lawrie, Shane Lowry and Michael Hoey have been funded under the scheme.  I read somewhere years ago that there are more people registered as golfers than there are in some of the larger sports.  At almost 300,000, it is the highest in Europe as far as being registered goes.  I look at the amount ISC gives to the Golfing Union of Ireland, which is &euro;375,000, and then at the Team Ireland grant allocation of &euro;139,000 for 2012, which figure I got from the ISC website.  Mr. Treacy and I are golfers, and people who hear these young professionals are on tour, even the Challenge Tour, think they are making a boatload of cash.  It is not the case and many of them are struggling.</p><p>  I look at the Ryder Cup and the success of Paul McGinley and P&aacute;draig Harrington, that class of golfer.  The enormous success Irish golf has had internationally is amazing.  Across America and the world, when one thinks of golf, one thinks of Ireland.  When I look at &euro;139,000 for 15 young professionals, it does not seem like a great deal of cash.  Should we invest more considering how many people are registered to play golf, the degree of effort being put into young golfers and clubs, and the success they are achieving?  In the area Mr. Treacy and I come from we have Gary Hurley and Seamus Power from West Waterford Golf Club.  I know Mr. Treacy is a member of Dungarvan Golf Club, but not if he is a member of West Waterford.</p></speech>

That is the case I make.  Does ISC provide a block grant to GUI which then decides how much it allocates for the coaching of young golfers or does ISC have a hand in deciding how much young golfers get for coaching?  Does ISC separate that out?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.137" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014100200009#H01200"><p>I am happy to answer those questions.  The number of golf club members has been falling.  From our sports monitor yesterday, it was probably one of the sports that was in the limelight due to reducing memberships which people can no longer afford.  It is the first thing to go.  The golfing unions have a challenge to ensure they become relevant to their clubs and support the clubs to attract members.  They are looking at that through the golf federation.</p><p>  There are a number of pieces to our support for the golfing unions.  We give approximately &euro;200,000 to the governing body of the sport for core activities.  We provide approximately &euro;375,000 on the high performance side, which is for our amateur players.  It is around putting high performance coaches in place and making sure training camps are available.  They have availed of Carton House, where there are fantastic facilities.  They have a great relationship there.  They have a high performance environment there.  It is also about putting coaches with those golfers and ensuring they are exposed to international competition at the appropriate age.</p><p>  This is another organisation that has been hugely successful.  The Rory McIlroys and Graeme McDowells of this world, who were out last week in the Ryder Cup, are a product of the GUI and its coaching systems, the coaches on the ground and the club coaches.  Our amateur golfers recently won a silver medal at the European championship.  They are very successful at what they do.  They have criteria in place around funding the amateur players on the Irish teams which we have approved.  The maximum grant they can give the amateurs, however, is &euro;5,000.  When players decide they are going to go professional, we have the golf trusts we established.</p> <p>We gave approximately &euro;120,000 to that.  F&aacute;ilte Ireland put in about another &euro;30,000, and we also got a small amount of funding in the past from the commercial sector.  In essence, we had about &euro;180,000 or &euro;200,000 to spend on young aspiring golfers, and those young aspiring golfers have to meet criteria before they are funded.  It is not a case of someone turning 18 years of age and saying that they are going to be a professional.  They need to meet criteria.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.140" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014100200010#J00300"><p>By and large, the criteria will outline to the young golfer whether they should apply.  They should have won a major, be recommended by the governing body of sport or have accumulated points.  We have to be careful because we do not want young golfers turning professional too early.  If they do it at the appropriate age, the golf trust kicks in.</p><p>  In the past the Irish Sports Council administered that but in the past year that transferred to the Golfing Union of Ireland, GUI, because we are clear that the people who know the sport best are those in the governing bodies of sport.  We have a council representative who sits on that committee, and it allocates the money to the aspiring professionals.  It is a good initiative, with the Golfing Union of Ireland taking responsibility.  Similar to what is happening on our carding around athletics and swimming, it is allocating funding directly to those athletes.  We will transfer more responsibility to the governing bodies of sport when they are ready to take that responsibility.  The GUI is a well-run organisation, and it is ready now for that responsibility.</p><p>  Without that &euro;20,000, and I have heard this from people like Peter Lawrie, a person would not be able to turn professional because it meets their expenses when they go on tour.  It might cover the cost of flights or hotels.  When they try to turn professional and they are on the challenge tour or whatever they are on, it is a difficult journey but that funding goes a long way.</p><p>  Similarly, we have supported women who have turned professional, and there is even less money for them.  I have met international golfers from other countries and they were singing the praises of the Irish Sports Council for putting like that in place for young female golfers.</p><p>  There is a lot done but more to do.  I agree with the Deputy that this is a sport in which we can excel on the world stage, and we have excelled.  We must make sure that we continue that and that we have the assistance in place to support aspiring golfers who have the talent to perform on the world stage.  We must make sure that nothing gets in their way.</p></speech>

The transferring of decision-making to an organisation like the GUI is interesting.  It shows a lot of confidence in the systems of the GUI but also from the standpoint of Mr. Treacy's agency.

We have a board member, Bernard Allen, who sits on that and an executive member as well.  We keep a close watching brief on it.  With the transfer of responsibility for direct funding to the athletes, we have a transition, as part of the London debrief, to athletics and to swimming.  We anticipate that we will be transferring that into the Paralympics also in the next year.  If we feel the governing bodies are fit for purpose and ready to take up their responsibility, have good performance directors who can put plans in place and clear criteria so the athletes know what they have to do to get funding, and we have the confidence in the organisation, we will transfer that responsibility because no one knows these sports better than the sporting organisations themselves.</p></speech>

I come back to the one raised by Deputy Dowds on the GAA, the IRFU and the FAI.  From the figures presented, I note that approximately 20% of the organisation's budget is spent on those three big operations.  What is the basis of the allocation?  They are allocated roughly &euro;2.5 million, &euro;2.7 million and &euro;2.8 million.  There is a world of difference between each of those organisations.  The GAA is a purely domestic organisation.  The other two are international as well as domestic.  Is the allocation made on the basis of need, size or achievement?  It seems the GAA is a very profitable organisation.  The State has already made a massive grant investment in the region of &euro;200 million for the Croke Park stadium development, which Kieran Mulvey would well know from his engagement there and the good work he did trying to sort out the Garth Brooks concerts and the relationship between the local people and the GAA.  This is now a major commercial facility.  It is a limited company that brings in a huge amount of money every year.  Regardless of whether the books of the GAA are available to the Irish Sports Council when the funding is made available, that company, having paid off all the debt on that facility, will now be a money-making and commercial entity to a large degree.</p><p>  Focusing on the other area, soccer clubs around the country are operating on a shoestring, by and large.  They need a restructuring to a considerable degree because of the manner in which they spring up around the place and then disappear in some areas as quickly as they appeared.  Rugby can get massive sponsorship, as is the case with the GAA to a degree.  There is a world of difference between the domestic and the international dimensions and the cohort of people who play those games.  The cohort who play rugby is not the same as the cohort who play soccer.  The game played exclusively in my constituency in Dublin Central is soccer.  There is virtually no GAA games or rugby played.  There is a need factor in that respect.  How is that need factor, in terms of a people profile, built into the equation when the allocations are made?</p></speech>

It does tremendous work.  The State owes it a huge degree of gratitude for the work it does on the ground.</p> <p>We do not really have a PE system in primary schools.  We should have PE in schools for an hour a day but that is not the case at present.  The sporting bodies step into that vacuum, ensuring that children get plenty of exercise.  These team sports play an important role in primary schools, teaching children the basics of these sports.  All three sports have different strengths: the GAA excels around the country in rural areas and in primary schools; the FAI excels in getting children in the inner city and in disadvantaged communities involved, and the IRFU excels in another sphere, with secondary school children.</p></speech>

That goes without saying.  I was asking if the Sports Council has some criteria based on need in terms of the background of the people involved in a particular sport.  I would extend that to boxing as well.  Boxing is the other sport which is played by the Travelling community and people from disadvantaged backgrounds more than anywhere else, yet it does not get the same amount of funding as the big three.  In terms of success at international competitions, we won five medals in the Olympics, four of which were for boxing.  Therefore, on an international stage where we are competing with world athletes, 80% of our medal haul comes from boxing, as well as the fact that it is strongest in areas where there is obvious need because of the background of many of those involved in the sport.</p></speech>

I see this through my involvement with certain clubs in Dublin.  They are supplying a tremendous social need and filling a social gap, particularly in what are euphemistically called working-class areas of the inner cities, and indeed the outer cities.  They provide twilight games in such areas, in which the Garda has also been involved, and they run schoolboy leagues between the hours of four and six, so that the young people are minded.  I think of one particular club which is exemplary, and I am involved in it to some extent myself - Cherry Orchard.  They do tremendous work, which is replicated in other towns, and I agree with the Deputy that there is a social issue that we must address in the promotion of sports.  The catch-all model does not always work; we must also balance the commitments between the organisations to some degree because they represent different constituencies.  The GAA represents three of our national games specifically, but the Deputy is right that boxing, the FAI and the IRFU, which is at the other end of the scale, are extending around the country as well.  We must examine this issue in terms of the criteria we apply.</p></speech>

I am sure it has nothing to do with our eminent Taoiseach, who has also highlighted this sport, but a couple of elite sportspeople recently signed for the Sky team in cycling and are also in receipt of funding from the Sports Council.  I would have thought that once that level of achievement was reached, the funding would no longer be necessary.</p></speech>

It is considering a merger between Bohemians and Shelbourne.

It seems amazing that out of 868 tests conducted under the national testing programme, only three anti-doping violations were recorded.  On an international basis, and from anything one might read about the area, that seems an incredibly low figure.  There seems to be far higher ethical standards among the Irish athletic community than seems to be the case internationally.  I wonder whether this is related to the fact that the testing takes place during competition but there is no out-of-competition testing.  It is much easier to avoid detection when the test is taking place, but random testing outside of competition times is more effective.  To what extent is the council dealing with that side of the equation?  We have very high performance athletes at both amateur and international level and it seems that the level of testing that results in a violation occurring would not be anywhere near any international standards.  Are we doing the job in the most effective manner possible?</p></speech>

On a percentage basis, more than 50% of our testing is out-of-competition testing.  The Deputy is correct that it is by far the most effective type of anti-doping testing.  We also carry out blood tests out of competition.  Our testing programme is rigorous.  We have an advantage in that Ireland is a small country as it is more difficult to hide.  As part of the programme, the athletes have to give us their whereabouts.  We have an hour a day when we know we can test these athletes and we use that information.</p><p>  On an international comparison, our level of testing is around 3%.  We funded some research last year that helped uncover some international positive tests in the past.  We are at the cutting edge and work very closely with the World Anti-Doping Agency.  Our staff on the anti-doping side are highly regarded.  Dr. Una May is highly regarded on the international scene and would have been involved in previous Olympic games and world championships for the World Anti-Doping Agency.

Currently, we have a lease through the OPW in the area of Blanchardstown which costs about &euro;180,000 per year.  In terms of the campus, there are plans afoot to locate the new agency in Abbotstown House but money has to be found for it.  As the cost will be about &euro;5 million, I think we will be waiting for a while.  I do not anticipate any additional costs in terms of moving office as we are all in the same area.  It is a purely administrative type merger.  As there will be one board and one chief executive in place, there will be savings in that area.  The legislation outlines the various functions.  We are happy that all the functions of the Irish Sports Council are being retained.  A sub-committee will be set up by the council to deal with coaching, high performance and anti-doping and there will be the campus development.

That is where the idea for merging the two organisations came from.  There will not be any massive savings on it.  Mr. Treacy has already indicated that the Irish Sports Council has fewer than 40 staff and campus staff number about 4.2  The savings means there will be a reduction in the board but there will not be any staff losses.  As Mr. Treacy said, it is an administrative process with the functions of the two organisations being brought together.</p></speech>

In the context of the most recent discussions last year on the budget, we were facing the case where a succession of cuts were coming in.  The Ministers were able to retrieve money from other allocations within the Department so we came out with approximately &euro;43 million.  There was an indication of what the council was to do; for example, that the women in sport and older person in sport programmes would be protected, along with smaller NGBs.  We were not told a precise figure but it was indicated that we should try to keep things at the levels from last year.  We had an outline cut with the budget we had, and we had to decide whether to hit the bigger organisations for &euro;10 million or smaller organisations for &euro;5 million.  After discussion with the Minister, we would get a certain policy direction and reallocate the money.  The budget decisions are ours.</p></speech>

We do two pieces.  With <i>The Irish Times </i>we do an end of year women in sport awards which costs about &euro;50,000.  That acknowledges many of the smaller organisations and acknowledges the women in those organisations.  We also provide &euro;110,000 to RTE which is broken up in terms of support for the end of the year awards on television plus ensuring RTE covers some of the minority sports at international events.  There is a piece of work that goes into that as well.  We are all the time in the business of trying to highlight some of the smaller sports that may not necessarily ever be covered by television.  We make sure they are represented.  We also use that money to send photographers to international events to ensure pictures appear in the sports pages.  We are all the time trying to ensure smaller organisations are highlighted and their athletes get on the front pages and on television.</p></speech>

Deputy Collins asked whether the council would meet him, which is fine.  If I read the letter coldly, I would be concerned about the issues that Dr. Reed raised, particularly the details he gave in terms of his view on the legislation.  I know it is only his view and there is the other side of it.  He also asked various questions on the role HSI has or should have or what he perceives it should have.

Discussion took place about sponsorship of a considerable amount of US dollars.  There were also discussions on support for the event within Ireland.  It did not take off and did not happen.  Why?  It was a huge world event.  I thought this was the idea of the Irish Sports Council and Horse Sport Ireland.</p></speech>

It is a huge undertaking.  The income stream for the country from it is not that strong.  It was considered in the past.  It was awarded to Ireland in the past and Ireland had to hand it back because we could not stage it at the time.</p></speech>

The cost of hosting the event was stated to be $25 million, most of which would have been put up by a company sponsor.  Efforts were made locally, according to the article, by interested parties who would like to see this huge event fill hotels and guest houses, but nothing happened.  Why was this?  The Irish Sports Council stated it spent money promoting all this.  This event came knocking on Ireland's door and we did not take it.</p></speech>

It was in the infancy of Horse Sport Ireland, when it was being established.  It was probably not a priority for it at the time because it was trying to put its administrative structures in place.  The first thing that would need to be done is a feasibility study on the cost-benefit analysis of the event, but it never got to this point.  It would mean a huge cost to the State.  When Ireland tried to host it previously, the numbers did not match up.</p></speech>

I am interested in this because of the spin-off it would have had for small businesses and many others.  Did Horse Sport Ireland consult the Irish Sports Council?  The newspapers state an RTE interview was the first time Pearse Lyons made it known publicly he was willing to underwrite the entire event.  Was the Department involved in it?</p></speech>

Horse Sport Ireland approached the then Minister, Martin Cullen, with this proposal.  It was a sports tourism event so it was handled by the tourism side of the Department.  As I understand it, the figures did not stack up.  Mr. Treacy referred to the previous experience when the event was awarded to Ireland and we had to pull out because of the costs.</p></speech>

We are speaking in this regard about a company that is promoting Ireland and Irish showjumping and associated events which attract international visitors and competitors.  It appears to me from the correspondence I have been given that it receives little support or acknowledgement from Horse Sport Ireland.  That it takes three weeks or longer to get a response from that organisation to basic questions is unacceptable.  Some of the questions relate to decisions taken around funding.  Is it the policy of Horse Sport Ireland to set out in a transparent manner how its decisions relevant to funding are reached?</p></speech>

They include the star rating of the international event, the number of international athletes who participated in the previous year, the ranking levels of international riders, the level of participation of Irish riders, the strategic importance of the events, and innovation and sustainability.  Also stated is that organisers may be required to submit a copy of event accounts.</p></speech>

The e-mail was sent on 18 February.  I consider this to be important for Ireland, the taxpayer and the SME sector.  That a reply was not issued until 12 March does not show a great deal of interest in the promotion of an international event.  It took another week to get a reply to a further e-mail sent on 7 March regarding criteria for the grants, which response was incomplete.  To more direct questioning on 27 March about the irregularities in Showjumping Ireland's annual accounts and referencing previous e-mails, no answer is given.  to further correspondence regarding receipt of hard copies of decisions made, no reply is given.  This goes on and on.</p><p>  This is the type of service being provided by Horse Sport Ireland, which receives at least half of its &euro;5 million per annum in funding from the taxpayer, is giving to a company in the industry trying to promote Ireland and showjumping and related events.  Surely, as part of the governance procedures of the Irish Sports Council, it should take up this issue with Horse Sport Ireland.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.452" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014100200016#P01200"><p>No, SJI is not part of the Irish Sports Council.  The chief executive, Mr. Treacy, is more familiar with these matters, but as I understand it, all the affiliates representing equestrian Ireland, from pony clubs to showjumping to equestrian events and so on, come under the umbrella group of Horse Sport Ireland, HSI.  It is an amalgam of a considerable number of bodies.  I think there may have been 19 in total which, as stated by Mr. Treacy, in 2007 came under the remit of the agency known as Horse Sport Ireland.  All these bodies retain a degree of autonomy over their section of the horse sport industry in Ireland.</p><p>  I would expect that decisions on grants - I hope this is the case and I will check it out - met by way of Exchequer funds are appropriately, properly and transparently accounted for, such that inquiries about any decision and how it was arrived at can be responded to.  While the person inquiring may not agree with the decision, he or she should at least be told the basis for it.  That is what is practised by the Council.  As the national funding body, I would expect that level of transparency would apply in decision-making.</p><p>  Deputy Deasy raised a similar issue in terms of how grants are allocated.  There are historical and current methods in terms of Showjumping Ireland and the horse shows that take place, including inter-classification.  As I understand it, and I am subject to correction on this, in terms of applications for international shows in the showjumping or pony classes, we have to go through the F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Equestre Internationale, FEI, which is the international accredited federation in this area.  We have told Horse Sport Ireland, in terms of its looking to hold these shows, that we support this in so far as the shows can be funded and carried out expeditiously at no cost to the taxpayer.  The events this year were very successful.  The European Championships held at Millstreet this year was a very successful show.  It was effectively managed with the co-operation, I would hope, of everyone concerned.</p></speech>

How was that individual to know whether he is on the right or wrong track regarding an application for funding for an event that would be beneficial to Ireland?  That is the issue.  From a governance point of view, Mr. Mulvey and Mr. Treacy need to ensure those who are associated in any way with their organisation conduct their business in the way that they have described their own conduct.  Perhaps they might check with the various bodies that are part of their organisation to ensure all of their accounts are up to date and that any governance issues that might arise are addressed.</p><p>  The other outstanding matter for HSI is the question they thought I was going to raise.  Is an amount of money outstanding or in dispute between HSI and a company that asked for funding?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.464" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Mulvey" time="12:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2014100200017#Q00700"><p>We are obviously under absolute privilege here.  I was invited to use my good offices to mediate between a certain event location in the south of Ireland, which I think I am at liberty to identify as Millstreet.  This venue is owned by Noel C. Duggan, who has a tremendous track record in facilitating international and national eventing in a tremendous location in Millstreet.  I have visited the location on several occasions and have met Mr. Duggan and his son.  A matter remains outstanding between Millstreet and the Duggan family, and Show Jumping Ireland directly and Horse Sport Ireland indirectly.  The issue is historical and goes back a number of years.  There has been considerable angst between them.  The issue arose initially out of decisions made by Show Jumping Ireland around Millstreet's qualification to host certain national or international events.  There were differences of opinion between Millstreet and Show Jumping Ireland, and the then leadership of that body, regarding the funding of those events, who could participate in them and the terms and conditions under which they would be recognised.</p><p>  This is an ongoing dispute.  I have been involved for the best part of 12 months trying to understand it and I have had a number of meetings with the parties concerned, including one meeting lasting eight hours with both parties.  We have not yet resolved the dispute.  Millstreet is of the view that it got a competition ruling which indicated a decision by the Competition Authority that the rules applied by Show Jumping Ireland were inimical to its interests and that the rules were contrary to Competition Authority regulations.  It got an opinion to that effect from the Competition Authority.  Show Jumping Ireland subsequently issued an apology and I understand it has changed its rules.</p><p>  An issue also arose involving an insurance case in respect of which Millstreet felt it was not adequately covered by Show Jumping Ireland's universal insurance and there were issues around cost.  It was also claimed that Show Jumping Ireland and, by extension, HSI were not giving Millstreet sufficient recognition for what it was achieving or support for its applications for national and international competitions.  The issue then arose with Show Jumping Ireland and, by extension, HSI as to whether Millstreet was affiliated and would abide by the changed rules.  This has gone all the way up to the international body and back down again.</p><p>  It has been a sharp learning curve for me in meeting them because they are both to a large degree very strong on their respective opinions.  I have tried to mediate a settlement and an offer has been made by Show Jumping Ireland to resolve the dispute on the basis of suggestions I have made.  That has not succeeded yet.  I left the mediation in abeyance while Millstreet was holding its international competition.  My view, which I have expressed to Show Jumping Ireland and HSI, is that as much support should be given to Millstreet as possible.  This is an international competition and the country was on show.  The Duggan family had invested a considerable amount.  I have been over the grounds with Noel C. Duggan and his son.  They have developed a tremendous campus for international competitions on the lands they own outside of Green Gables and otherwise.  This year's competition was very successful and it brought plaudits from everybody.  I congratulate them again on that.  They do things with finesse.</p></speech>

If they want to settle, they will, and if they do not, they will not.  Sometimes in mediation it is a case of ostriches.  There is no point in one person having his or her head in the sand and somebody else kicking him or her.  Both sides will have to come to a reasonable position.</p></speech>

I previously raised an issue with the Minister regarding the purchase of horses from Europe.  Apparently when show jumpers are imported into Ireland their passports are marked so that they have a certain number of points.  They may never have jumped a fence but their passports are marked up.  They may subsequently be exported as eventing horses even though they are not.  This is an issue for the horsey world and for Ireland because these horses are being exported as having participated in events when they have not.  For some reason they are marked up with points for events when they are imported into Ireland.  Apparently this is legal and due to some sort of anomaly in the system.  I raised the issue with the Minister for a response but there was no indication that the issue would be taken on board.  Surely Horse Sport Ireland would be interested in this given that it affects the perception from abroad of the quality and qualifications of the animals being exported.  I ask that somebody ask Horse Sport Ireland to investigate the matter.</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I welcome on behalf of RTE, Mr. John O'Kane, executive director, of RTE orchestras, quartet and choirs, Aod&aacute;n &Oacute; Dubhghaill Uasal, head of RTE Lyric FM and Ms Lorelei Harris, head of arts and cultural strategy.<br/>I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I advise witnesses that the opening statements and any other documents they have submitted to the committee may be published on the committee's website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>The purpose of the Bill we are considering is to give statutory status to the National Concert Hall in line with the governance and accountability regime that applies to other national cultural institutions.  Accordingly, we already have scrutinised the general scheme of the Bill today with the assistance of officials from the Department of Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht and representatives from the National Concert Hall.  Today, the joint committee will continue that scrutiny with the assistance of the representatives in attendance from Raidi&oacute; Teilif&iacute;s &Eacute;ireann.  The joint committee will then prepare a report on the general scheme of the Bill and present it to the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, Deputy Heather Humphreys.<br/>I now invite the witnesses to make their opening statement.</p></speech>

In order to provide a degree of context, our note describes the current relationship between RTE, in particular the RTE orchestras, quartet and choirs, and the NCH.  The relationship between RTE and the NCH is encapsulated in a formal, legal agreement which in effect gives us a licence for our activities within the NCH.  The fact that we have such an agreement reflects the significance of the relationship and the central position the work of each organisation represents <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the other.  There is a high degree of mutual reliance between the RTE orchestras and the NCH.  The significance of that can be understood easily enough if we look at very simple measures in regard to volume and expenditure.  The sheer level of activity promoted in the NCH by the RTE orchestras and of course subsequently broadcast nationally to a national audience from the NCH is of great importance.  The scale of RTE's financial contribution to the NCH's income is also significant.  By virtue of both the level of activity and the scale of expenditure, it is a unique relationship that demonstrates mutual reliance.<br/>Building upon that point about the close alignment of the work of the two organisations, we note that there are common challenges which everybody in the arts and certainly everybody in the music business faces: the question of how to promote music in the contemporary environment.  The marketplace for music and the arts, entertainment and culture has become increasingly sophisticated and complex and thus has become highly competitive.  The common challenge is to attract and engage the public.  It is important to see the mutual interest in facing into those challenges and we think that in so doing one can see that there are opportunities.  They lie, for example, in exploitation of the full implications of the arrival of the digital age.  This is not yet fully described or understood but it affords a great opportunity to reach many more people and to engage with the public in a different way than was heretofore possible.  We have already made some initial attempts in that regard but believe there is a lot more scope.  The second area that contains a good deal more scope is the potential to develop the NCH complex.  If the NCH were to develop the amazing premises that it has, it would acquire a good deal more operational flexibility and that in turn would have a direct impact upon its capacity and the capacity of RTE to serve the public more effectively and with a greater impact in terms of the public benefit.  <br/>We have offered a critique of the Bill from RTE's perspective, which stems from operational aspects of the relationship between RTE and the NCH.  We have done this as an appendix to our statement, which provides the specific commentary.  We would prefer if the legislation were to ensure that RTE's position was more explicitly secured for the longer term.  We have made a number of specific suggestions in that regard.  The first is that the discretion which the board of the NCH can exercise in regard to the RTE orchestras should be replaced with an obligation to sustain the relationship.  We suggest that RTE's position in the Bill would be reinforced by naming all of the RTE performing groups in the Bill rather than just one of them, as is currently the case. It would be better if the NCH were required to reach agreement with RTE on financial and other matters, rather than leaving the NCH as the sole determinant on those conditions.  In the event that an agreement on those conditions were not to be reached, it would be helpful if there were provision for independent arbitration.</p></speech>

It is a very large part of our business.  Most of our costs are absorbed in the people we employ.  Then we have a certain amount to deploy to put on concerts.  A large proportion of that is being invested in the relationship with the NCH.  It is very important to us and to NCH in terms of the proportion of their income derived from it.</p></speech>

In the division that I am involved with there are two orchestras, the RTE National Symphony Orchestra and the RTE Concert Orchestra.  They have 81 and 45 musicians respectively.  There is also a quartet.  This makes a total of approximately 130 full-time, professional musicians, and then there is some support staff which takes the figure close to about 150.  They are not all involved in the NCH but it is a very close relationship.</p> <p>There is a particularly close relationship with the RTE National Symphony Orchestra, NSO, the larger of the two ensembles.  That is because that orchestra rehearses in the NCH as well as giving concerts there.  It is very much based there and in fact the strapline the Hall uses is that it is "the home of the RTE National Symphony Orchestra", which I think is a fair account of it.  The orchestra rehearses there and gives concerts there, and its support staff are housed there.  We rent offices and storage facilities, and so on, so we have a strong physical presence in the NCH and it is a matter of our daily business.  It affects everything at all levels within the two organisations, so there is continuous contact between ourselves and the NCH at management level, at the level of the musicians and the production staff within the Hall, and at the level of the broadcasting teams.  Many people in both organisations work very closely together on a daily basis as part of this relationship.</p></speech>

In terms of the choirs, how many people who are now successful singers in their own right would have begun in the choir itself?  I am thinking of Eleanor McEvoy and others.

Eleanor started her career as a professional violinist and was a member of the NSO before going on to forge a career as a singer-songwriter.  She is an unusual character and a very interesting musician on account of that.</p><p>  The important thing to appreciate about the RTE choirs is that in contradistinction to the orchestras, the choirs are essentially non-professional; an amateur ethos governs the RTE Philharmonic Choir and the RTE C&oacute;r na n&Oacute;g.  The Philharmonic Choir is full of people who are music enthusiasts, with real jobs, who come along once a week.  They are deeply committed but their engagement comes from a love of music.  They are also attracted by the opportunity to perform with a professional symphony orchestra, which is unique.  They get to play big standard pieces of repertoire, great works of the music canon, which were written specifically for choir and orchestra together.  That is how we deploy the choirs.  It would be fair to say that the choirs are not really the natural career pathway for those who are interested in solo singing as a career.  We do work with many well-known household names, singers across all genres, but they would work with us in the capacity of guest artists rather than as members of the choir.</p></speech>

I welcome all three witnesses and thank Mr. O'Kane for his opening statement.  To put on the record, I am the director of the Abbey Theatre, which receives funding from the Arts Council.  The Abbey Theatre sits on the Council of National Cultural Institutions and therefore I share a particular room with the director of the NCH.  I say this for the sake of transparency and accountability; it does not mean that I am less qualified to ask any of these questions.</p><p>  There are a couple of issues I would like to tease through in the document.  This is a discussion on the general scheme of the Bill, so this committee has a role in formulating views or indeed ambiguities, which we present to the Minister.  The Minister will then come in and respond to that before the legislation is drafted.  As far as I can see, there is a complication.  The complication is that both RTE and the NCH are mixed economy companies; they are both dependent on commercial income and on State subvention through the licence fee on the one hand and the Department on the other.  There is a commercial relationship.  It is clear in Mr. O'Kane's statement that the relationship is not entirely symbiotic; sometimes the two are mutually supportive of one another, particularly around the NSO, and often they are competitors.  I am thinking in terms of being a promoter.  </p><p>  The committee must consider whether it is of value or of interest to advocate for the NSO or, as Mr. O'Kane suggests, all of RTE's performing groups, to be part of the legislation and also how that commercial relationship would be enshrined and might bind both organisations.  I would like to hear Mr. O'Kane's comments on that because he is very clear that he wants to expand the scheme to include all performing groups, that he advocates a return to the previous convention whereby a senior staff member is nominated as a director of the NCH, and that he wants essentially to strengthen the contractual obligation that the NCH might have on RTE.</p></speech>

There is a delicacy in it.  We would characterise the relationship in broad terms by saying that we are working towards objectives which are  broadly similar at face value.  There is a natural harmony, if I may use that word, between the aims of the two organisations.  Their interests are not exactly the same, however.  This derives from the imperative on both organisations to meet commercial targets and so on.  That is why we have this licence in place.  We are the NCH's largest client but it must also deal with many other clients.  That forces the NCH into a position where it must engage with us as the largest client but it must also engage with many other clients who want to present their concerts in the NCH.  In addition, the NCH wants to promote its own concerts.  Betwixt and between those three elements there is a degree of competitiveness because we are competing in the narrowest sense of the term in the same marketplace for audiences.  While I do not want to overemphasise the competitive dynamic in the relationship, our natural response when we see the provisions of this Bill is to see an opportunity to reflect the importance of RTE's relationship with the NCH.  Our motivation for that stems not only from our desire to succeed as best we can in every aspect of our remit but also from our recognition that there is a common public investment, as Senator Mac Conghail alludes to, in that the NCH is funded directly from the Department of Environment, Culture and the Gaeltacht, and that the orchestras are indirectly funded by the licence fee.  If the ultimate goal is public benefit, then we think that there is a strong case for making the position of RTE stronger within the scheme of things.</p></speech>

Members of the committee have a serious concern regarding the sweeping powers of the Minister to direct policy at the hall and on the board, particularly under head 9: "The Minister may give general policy directions in writing to the Hall/Board in relation to the performance of the functions of the Hall /Board with the exception of functions relating to artistic and curatorial matters".  That does not in any way limit the Minister in dealing with artistic and curatorial matters because running the National Concert Hall is a matter of dealing with artistic and curatorial matters and one cannot differentiate one from the other.  I raise this because that could have an indirect impact on RTE.  If its involvement in the hall is enshrined in legislation there could be a view that the Minister might be able to direct policy on RTE&rsquo;s role in the National Concert Hall.  I am concerned about the ambiguity around that although this is only a scheme of the Bill and it might come out differently in the draft.</p><p>  In respect of day-to-day programming how are RTE broadcasters, performers, conductors and the commission process protected from ministerial involvement?  I am talking about artistic freedom. </p></speech>

We do not believe that the provisions of the Bill are likely to impact on us.  We believe our autonomy stems from the statutory basis provided by the Broadcasting Act and we do not believe that the new Bill would significantly undermine our autonomy.  The provisions for how we operate our relationship with the National Concert Hall are described in our licence agreement rather than in legislation.  We have not picked this up as a threat to our autonomy.  We would be very exercised if it were because it is critical that any arts body is able to exercise full independence in how it fulfils its artistic function.</p></speech>

From the committee&rsquo;s point of view, however, the Minister of the day could conceivably issue a policy direction to RTE and its contractual relationship with the National Concert Hall and claim that it does not concern artistic or curatorial but rather commercial arrangements.  That is something we should tease out in our final report.</p></speech>

I am delighted that we are joined by Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, and Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, who were both elected to represent the Dublin constituency in the European Parliament.  We are also joined by Mr. Francis Jacobs, head of the European Parliament Information Office in Ireland.  I welcome all three to the meeting today which coincides with the Commissioner Designate Hogan's hearings in the European Parliament this morning.<br/>I am very pleased to see Ms Boylan and Mr. Hayes here today.  Some of our other MEPs are attending the hearings in Brussels.  Apologies have been received from Mr. Matt Carthy, MEP, Ms Nessa Childers, MEP, Ms Deirdre Clune, MEP, Mr. Luke 'Ming' Flanagan, MEP, Mr. Se&aacute;n Kelly, MEP, and Ms Mairead McGuinness, MEP, who are in Brussels.<br/>We will start with an update from Mr. Jacobs on what is happening in the European Parliament and recent developments since the election in May.  Then I will ask, in turn, Ms Lynn Boylan, MEP, and Mr. Brian Hayes, MEP, to update and brief us on their goals, objectives and what they hope to work on, during their term, over the next four and half years. <br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give this committee.</p> <p>However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

I know that just after the elections in June the committee held a session on what happened in the elections in terms of turnout and so on.  I will concentrate today on what has happened since the elections in terms of the structure of the Parliament and also the background to the involvement of the Parliament in the investiture of a new European Commission.</p><p>  First, to the structure of the European Parliament.  The most important question following the election is which political group the newly elected MEPs join because as this committee knows, the political groups are of huge importance in the European Parliament.  There was a lot of discussion in the run-up to the elections about the possibility of the structure of the Parliament being affected by a very good performance by anti-system, populist and Euro-sceptic parties.  Indeed, the two big political groups have a few less seats than they did in the past, but they still have 55% of the members of the Parliament.  The European People's Party, EPP, has 221 members and the Progressive Alliance of Socialists and Democrats, S&amp;D, has 191 members.  The question arose as to which group the members of the Euro-sceptic and populist parties would join.  </p><p>  There are a number of familiar groups which have been reconstituted.  The liberal group - Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, ALDE, lost quite a few seats but still ended up with 66 in the new Parliament.  The left wing socialists - European United Left - Nordic Green Left, GUE-NGL - of which Ms Boylan is a member, returned a pretty large total of seats, with the Greens and a number of regionalist groups joining together in one political family - the Greens-European Free Alliance, Greens-EFA.  </p><p>  The key question was what would happen to the others.  The group with the most power of attraction was the group of which the largest component is the British Conservative Party because it was seen as less extremist.  It is composed of a wide range of parties, some of which are not even Euro-sceptic.  The parties are mildly Euro-sceptic and the group is sustainable in the sense that it is well over the required threshold for a group.  In fact, there are two thresholds involved here.  The first is to have a minimum number of members, which is relatively easy to obtain.  The second is a minimum number of member states - nine - which is much more difficult to achieve.  Some of the new groups had great difficulty meeting the second threshold.  The conservative group - European Conservatives and Reformists, ECR - now has 71 members and is the third largest group in the Parliament.  Nigel Farage of UKIP managed to recruit the big party in Italy, Beppe Grillo's Five Star Movement to form a group.  That group is fragile in the sense that it only just managed to get the number of nationalities required and if one leaves, the group is in trouble.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.553" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Jacobs" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014100200003#B00300"><p>We have seen this happen on numerous occasions in the past.  When members leave a group which was just over the margin, the group is dissolved and no longer exists, unless it can manage to recruit members from elsewhere.  Marie le Pen and some of the other far-right MEPs were very close to forming a group but failed to do so in the end.  What that means is that we now have an exceptionally large number of non-attached members of the European Parliament, totalling 52 out of 751.  The majority, although not all of them, are from the far right.</p><p>  Once the groups have been constituted, the process of distributing members between committees begins.  That distribution is very proportional in the European Parliament and is based on the d'Hondt system, in contrast to the US Congress, where it tends to be winner-takes-all.  In the US, if one party has one more seat than the other, it wins all of the committee chairs.  </p><p>  Martin Schulz was re-elected President of the European Parliament, which was a remarkable development.  It was the first time that happened since direct elections in 1979.  Due to the large number of groups in the European Parliament, there was always a tendency to have a changeover after two and a half years so the re-election of Mr. Schulz was really exceptional.  Next was the election of Vice Presidents and Questors.  Ms Mairead McGuinness was elected as a Vice President of the Parliament, which is the second most senior post an Irish MEP has held since Mr. Pat Cox was President.  </p><p>  Membership of the various committees is very important and I am sure Ms Boylan and Mr. Hayes will speak about that later.  The role of committee chairperson is also very important but there is currently no Irish chair of a committee.  The delegation leaders have not been finally confirmed yet but is expected to be completed in a week or two.  </p><p>  An important question, apart from who becomes chair and vice chair of committees, is who will be the political group co-ordinators on a committee.  They are the people who represent their political group on each committee and take part in the decisions on what work the committee will do and who will draw up its reports and opinions.  They play a really important strategic role in the work of the Parliament.  There are two Irish co-ordinators in political groups.  One is Ms Liadh N&iacute; Riada who is the GUE-NGL group co-ordinator on the Committee on Budgets and the other is Ms Marian Harkin, the co-ordinator for the ALDE group on the Committee on Employment and Social Affairs.  We do not know yet who will be rapporteurs for the Parliament.  The rapporteurs are the people who are asked to draw up the Parliament's reports on all EU legislation and to prepare initiative reports.  Of almost equal importance is the question of who will be appointed as shadow rapporteurs.  A shadow rapporteur is appointed by his or her political family to deal with particular subjects.  Mr. Hayes, for example, is a shadow rapporteur on the capital markets proposal.   </p><p>  That is the basic background information on what has happened since the elections in June and I am very happy to answer any questions members may have in that regard.  Before concluding, however, I wish to deal with the Parliament's involvement in the election of the European Commission which is so topical this week.  </p><p>  The most important development before the elections was the fact that five of the seven political groups, for the first time ever, decided to put forward lead candidates whom they wanted to be President of the Commission if they won sufficient seats in the Parliament.  There was a lot of scepticism about it.  Some political leaders, including Prime Minister David Cameron in the UK, Prime Minister Viktor Orb&aacute;n in Hungary and others were very opposed to the system and even Chancellor Angela Merkel expressed reservations.  In the end, however, the five main groups in the Parliament decided that they would put forward candidates and the EPP candidate, Jean-Claude Junker was chosen at a meeting in the Convention Centre in Dublin.  I mention this because it has had an important impact in the sense that it has provided a greater buy-in than in the past between the European Parliament and the Commission.  That was made clear when Mr. Junker was elected, relatively smoothly, in the second July session of the Parliament.  He got well over the necessary majority.  The majority required is an absolute majority of the members of the Parliament, not a relative one.  A candidate needs to get 376 votes to be elected.  That was not the case in the past and some past Presidents of the Commission would not have been elected under the new rules, post-Lisbon.  Mr. Junker got 422 votes, with 250 members voting against him and 47 abstaining.  </p> <p>In many ways he got a rather good majority, all things considered.</p><p> Once the President is chosen, the next stage is member states putting forward their nominees, with the European Parliament considering not only those nominees, but the structure of the Commission as a whole.  A really difficult question for much of the summer was whether there would be a sufficient gender balance, as almost all the early nominees were men, and it looked as if the critical threshold that would have satisfied the European Parliament might not have been met.  In the end, nine female nominees were put forward and I am sure there will be a view as to whether there is sufficient gender balance; it was enough to defuse the issue.</p><p> Once the nominees were finally put forward, with Marianne Thyssen, MEP, being the final nomination at the very end of August, the next question was who would be allocated which job within the Commission.  When the Parliament votes, it does not consider individual Commissioners but rather the Commission as a whole.  It also considers the programme of a new Commission for the next few years and its structure, which will be put forward by Mr. Juncker.  I am sure the President of the European Commission will go into more detail later but he has chosen a structure which has never before been chosen.  In addition to the Commissioners with portfolios and specific director generals backing them up, there are also a number of Vice Presidents of the Commission with more of a co-ordinating role.  How that will work is a very difficult and important question.  The structure of the hearings is that potential Commissioners with individual portfolios are being grilled this week, with the Vice President nominees being grilled by the Parliament on Monday afternoon and Tuesday next week.  The entire process is supposed to end on Tuesday.</p><p> Why are there hearings in the first place?  In the early days there were no such hearings but after the Maastricht treaty came into force in the early 1990s, the European Parliament had a slightly greater role in the choice of the Commission - not as strong as now - and it felt that hearings would be a really useful way of finding out the quality of the individual nominees and in establishing a relationship between the relevant committees of the Parliament and the nominees for the next five years.  That had not happened in the past and it was felt to be a really good way of proceeding.  There were many reservations within the Commission about this and Mr. Jacques Delors, the outgoing Commission President, advised Mr. Jacques Santer, the incoming Commission President, not to go down this route.  Santer was in a rather weak position because he had only just scraped through his vote, and he felt it really important to get the Parliament onside, so he accepted the idea of the hearings.  These hearings have taken place since.</p><p> I will speak briefly to the process of having hearings on individual candidates.  The candidates are asked to submit written answers in advance so that committee members and any interested people can see replies to one or two general questions regarding European commitment, conflicts of interest and so on, as well as specific questions on a prospective portfolio.  When I functioned as secretariat of a committee, I experienced the problem of ensuring that all the committees with an interest in a particular nominee would be involved with the hearing.  There is a lead committee, and one or two candidates have faced representatives of up to four committees because there is so much overlap.  The climate and energy area would overlap a number of parliamentary committees, and there are other areas which have an even stronger reach.</p><p> Once this is decided, each nominee - like Mr. Phil Hogan this morning - would speak for a maximum of 15 minutes, with a question-and-answer session following.  They would typically start with the co-ordinators of the committee before going to other members of the committee or associated committees.  The rule has been established that one minute is allowed per question, with two minutes for the nominee to give an answer.  If the question time is exceeded by five seconds or the nominee responding exceeds the allocated time by ten seconds, the microphone is typically cut off by the chairman.  This permits a large number of questions, and Mr. Hogan faced 45 questions this morning.  At the very end, the nominee can give a five-minute summary.</p><p> The committee co-ordinators, which I mentioned before, would meet an hour or so after the hearing to judge how they feel the nominee performed, having sounded out members of their political family.  If necessary, they can also convene a full committee meeting and even vote on the issue.  They cannot individually reject a nominee but they can write a letter to the President of the Parliament, giving their views on the nominee.  The political groups are constantly in touch with each other to discuss how events are proceeding.  Several possibilities arise if people are not satisfied with a nominee.  One is the writing of a very negative letter, and on a couple of occasions nominees have been asked to answer follow-up questions, and perhaps there could be attempts to convene a follow-up hearing.</p><p> Decisions have to be taken on whether to approve a Commission as a whole rather rapidly next week, once hearings conclude.  The idea is to vote on the new Commission as a whole in the October plenary session, which is in the third week of October, with the new Commission coming into place in November.  In the past, that has not worked because the Parliament has been unhappy with one or more nominees and there has not been time to replace them.  In such cases there has been deadlock, and in the worst-case scenario, the process would be delayed for a couple of months.  This occurs rarely, although it has happened.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.555" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lynn Boylan" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014100200004#C00200"><p>I will begin by commenting on the structure of the incoming Juncker Commission and the reservations that I and some Sinn F&eacute;in MEPs have about it.  I will then speak about the two committees on which I work, as well as the work of being shadow rapporteur of reports.</p><p>  Regardless of individual personalities in the incoming Commission, there is a real concern about a move to put business before people.  One of the main concerns is that Mr. Juncker has moved responsibility for health technologies and medicinal products from the health unit to the area of the Internal Market and competitiveness.  This is being condemned by all health non-governmental and patient organisations, and it is a worrying trend that we are putting competitiveness in the area of health outcomes before dealing with a citizen's right to health care.  We are also concerned that there is no Commissioner with responsibility for sustainability, and we wrote to Mr. Juncker to demand that sustainability be made a cornerstone within his Commission, with Commissioner Vella to be assigned some sort of role dealing with sustainable development.</p><p>  With regard to personalities, there are a number of Commissioner-designates about which we would have real concerns.  Our concerns about Mr. Hogan are public knowledge but our committee also has reservations about Mr. Miguel Ca&ntilde;ete, the Spanish designate.  If he is successful, he will be the Commissioner responsible for energy and the environment, despite him having a 3% share in oil companies.  We consider that to be a complete conflict of interest and see him as the wrong man to be representing the environment and climate change efforts.  We will oppose Mr. Ca&ntilde;ete's approval and we hope the Spanish Government will return with an alternative nominee.  We also have some reservations about Mr. Jonathan Hill's links to banking and lobbying.  Across Europe, Irish people and European citizens feel disconnected from the European institutions and their faith in them has dropped to an all-time low.  The structure of the Juncker Commission and issues around transparency are not helping.</p><p>  At a hearing recently involving the environmental committee, I challenged a Commissioner-designate, Mr. Vytenis Andriukaitis, on conflicts of interest regarding the European Food and Standards Authority.</p> <p>Some 41% of people questioned across Europe have no faith in the scientists who sit on the board because of their interests in industry.  We were not satisfied with the answer to it and were going to follow up by writing to the Commissioner and asking for some concrete actions he could take to deal with the transparency around EFSA.  I am a full member of the Committee on the Environmental, Public Health and Food Safety, and this is how I got the opportunity to question the Commissioner designate for public health on Tuesday.  I am also a substitute member of the employment and social affairs committee.</p><p> I am shadow rapporteur on the very controversial GMO report on ensuring member states have the ability to restrict GMOs on their territories.  It has caused controversy and failed to reach agreement at European Council level.  As shadow rapporteur and representing the GUE-NGL group, I want to ensure member states are protected with very robust laws and enabled to stop GMOs being grown on their territories.  We have concerns around the Council and Commission&rsquo;s position on it because one of the issues is that member states and companies are put on equal footing.  Therefore a member state must request that a company does not grow GMOs on its territory.  This is wrong.  A democratically elected government cannot be on a level pegging with the likes of Monsanto and we object to it.</p><p> We are also concerned about the list of reasons a member state can use for opposing GMOs.  The reasons are too vague and both the Commission and Council&rsquo;s positions have no reference to cross-contamination or liability, which would be of particular concern for the island of Ireland.  I am not sure what our Government&rsquo;s position is because it is a little vague.  However, the British Conservative Government is very much in favour of GMOs and has been very open about the fact that it wants GMOs to proceed.  Where does that leave Northern Ireland?  How can we object to it and how can farmers in the Border region stop cross-contamination of their crops?  It has many implications, particularly for organic farmers retaining their organic status.  We also have concerns about the legal basis of this in that the Council and Commission propose that the legal basis for the regulations will be internal market, not environment.  Again, we have concerns because it puts competitiveness and internal market before environmental law.</p><p> The other report I am working on as shadow rapporteur is the one on novel foods.  It also failed to reach agreement under the previous legislature, probably because of the inclusion of food from cloned animals.  This has been removed from it and the novel foods report will take on board only foods from third countries, for example foods which would have been consumed in Latin America and which are coming into the European market after 1997.  There are safety aspects to these foods.  The novel foods report also includes nanotechnology.  Many people are unaware of nanotechnology in food and it is very difficult to explain.  It is about particles at a nano level that are being introduced into food.  Our concern is that there is no satisfactory, scientific method for testing the safety of these products.  The EU seems to be putting the cart before the horse by providing a mechanism to regulate these products to come on the market for European citizens to eat before we have a standardised procedure to assess whether the products are safe for human consumption.</p><p> The other report for which I will be rapporteur is a non-legislative report on the right to water.  Members might be familiar with it as the citizens&rsquo; initiative was hailed during the Lisbon treaty as a great step in democratising the EU and bringing it back to the citizen level.  We always had reservations about it because the wording in the Lisbon treaty was that the Commission would &ldquo;note&rdquo; any citizens&rsquo; initiative.  The first initiative brought before the Commission was the right to water, which was mostly organised by the trade union movement.  More than 2 million European citizens have signed up to the initiative, which asks that it be put on a legal basis that it is a human right to have access to clean drinking water.  In May, the European Commission rejected the initiative on the grounds that it would tie the hands of the future legislator.  We find this very disappointing.  The European Parliament has always backed the initiative to make the right to water a fundamental human right.  A report will go through this legislature which will, hopefully, reiterate the support of the European Parliament for citizens&rsquo; right to access to free water.  I will be the rapporteur on it and the process should begin in December, all going well.</p><p> In September, a delegation from the GUE-NGL group visited Palestine on foot of the Israeli Government&rsquo;s onslaught into Gaza in its operation protective edge.  Given the level of EU funding that goes into the region, we felt justified in sending a delegation on a fact-finding mission to assess how much aid would be required from the EU to support the people of Palestine.  Unfortunately, the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs rejected our request to enter Gaza.  We continued with the delegation and went through the United Nations to assess the level of damage.  The UN was very disappointed at the Israeli Government&rsquo;s refusal to let us enter Gaza, and met us in Jerusalem.  The UN has sent a clear message that it wants MEPs and politicians from member states to go to Gaza and see for themselves the damage that has been done and the war crimes that have been committed in the area.  On the fact-finding mission we met members of the Knesset and the Palestinian Authority.  We also met representatives of Israeli and Palestinian NGOs and victims of operation protective edge, and their message is that the world needs to stand up and take action against Israel on what it has done in Gaza.</p><p> We intend to pursue it in the European Parliament.  We believe the EU could do much more.  The laws are there, and must be enforced.  There should be an embargo on products from Israel and the EU should demand compensation from the Israeli Government because taxpayers&rsquo; money, including Irish taxpayers&rsquo; money, has gone into providing infrastructure in Gaza which has been repeatedly destroyed on a two-yearly basis.  During the most recent onslaught, the water and electrical infrastructure was completely destroyed so that Israel, once again, controls the water and electricity going into Gaza.  Some 400,000 people have no access to clean water as a result of the actions of the Israeli Government.  We will continue to ask the European Parliament to stand up and take action against Israel for its infringements of human rights.</p></speech>

It is a privilege to be here.  I congratulate the Ceann Comhairle, Oireachtas Commission and the Chairman on managing to have proceedings of the House and committees live on television.  There will also be a facility whereby various sessions of the European Parliament, either plenary or committee, can be viewed on the channel.  It is a very welcome development.</p> <p>It is important that as one of the 11 Irish MEPs elected for this State that we keep in constant discussion and engagement not just with the important Joint Committee on European Union Affairs but with the various sectoral committees.  Ms Boylan, MEP, has outlined the work she is doing in her area of policy.  It would be important in whatever area in which we are engaging that we would have discussion with the sectoral committees.  I have a few ideas that the members might be interested in hearing.  <br/>It is an extraordinary privilege to be elected by the people of Dublin as one of the new Irish MEPs and I am very grateful to them for giving me this mandate during the next five years.  As a former Member of  both Houses of the Oireachtas for more than 18 years, it is important that as an Irish MEP one is in the first instance an ambassador for one's country.  I regard myself as an Irish MEP first and a Fine Gael MEP second.  As we have only 11 Irish MEPs, it is crucially important that people work together and we put the interest of the country before that of our political parties.  That is important.  We are a small country and as Mr. Jacobs said, out of the 751 members of the European Parliament, Ireland has only 11 representatives.  It is important that colleagues work together for the interests of the country rather than marginal party political issues, which because of our adversarial system of politics sometimes get played out in D&aacute;il for all sorts of reasons.  The European Parliament is different, it works to a different degree and we should utilise it as 11 MEPs working together.<br/>This is a real Parliament with real power.  I have responsibility for the economic area on behalf of the Fine Gael MEPs.  Some 70% of all financial regulation of all financial law across the 28 members states of the European Union is determined in co-decision making between the European Parliament and the Council.  Irrespective of what happens in budgets in this country or in other countries, the great majority of law in how we organise our financial system across the eurozone and across the 29 members states as a whole is determined by the European Parliament and by the Council.  It is most definitely a Parliament with real teeth and real power.<br/>I am a member of the European People's Party, EPP, and it has 221 of the 751 MEPs.  Effectively we have an informal coalition with the Social Democrats.  It is sometimes ignored but it is worth saying that 70% of the Members of the newly elected Parliament come from a pro-European tradition when there is a commentary about En France <i>Front national </i>or UKIP or other populist neo-nationalist parties.  It is sometimes ignored that the great majority of European citizens who voted last May voted for pro-European MEPs, irrespective of whether they come from the Centre Right, the Centre or the Centre Left.  We need to keep that in mind.<br/>I am a member of the Economic Affairs Committee of the Parliament, the only full Irish member on this very important committee that deals with the vast amount of financial regulation that goes through it.  It takes up about 80% of my time.  I will set out the issues I am working on, comment on where we need to improve our relationship with the committee and speak about some of the big issues that affect the mandate we have for the next five years.<br/>I have a very simple view about what is coming down the tracks.  I asked the Irish Permanent Representative in Brussels to rate on a scale of five to one, five being the most significant and one being the least significant, what is important for Ireland.  I work on the basis that what is in important to Ireland should gain our attention as Irish MEPs.  We are not just there to create legislation across the 500 million citizens across the European Union.  We are also there to defend the Irish interest and the Irish position.<br/>When I came to the European Parliament, I worked very hard to get on the ECON committee.  Money markets reform is a crucial issue.  Let me explain it.  A third of all the money that comes into the financial services system in this country is money markets.  Money markets is a kind of financial warehouse, it provides short-term funding that the banks get to improve their liquidity.  The proposals put forward by Commissioner Michel Barnier, would have effectively brought to an end a third of all the moneys that are coming into Ireland, were they advanced last March and would have knocked out thousand of Irish jobs, especially in Dublin, our constituency.  When I discovered the importance of this issue, I worked within my own group to ensure that I could become the lead rapporteur for that file.  I acknowledge that we must resolve the problem, a liquidity problem for money markets but we must also do it in a way that does not adversely affect employment opportunities in this country.  I will stand up and defend every Irish job and do so unapologetically.  As the EPP rapporteur for that area, it was crucially important that I got that job.<br/>The second area I am working on with colleagues is the economic semester.  As members know country specific recommendations which come from the semester come through the Commission onto the Council and they are then made as recommendations, which the countries are asked to consider.  We recently had a good example of good parliamentary engagement.  The Chairman of the Finance Committee, Deputy Ciaran Lynch came to the ECON committee of the EU.  He presented the view of his committee, which was very clear, that there should be a greater period of time between the Commission's recommendations and the Council's acceptance of it, so that the members of the Houses of the Oireachtas could engage on the recommendations.  I am trying to get the recommendation that the Chairman of the European Affairs committee, through Deputy Lynch, as a central feature of the report that is going through my committee.  It is a small but good example of why we need to engage with each other to make sure that the voice of the national parliament is not overlooked in this deliberative process.<br/>I am involved in a monetary dialogue with the President of the ECB, Mario Draghi.  Members may have seen me last week putting very clear questions to him, arguing why the ECB needs to be involved in any banking inquiry that will take place in Ireland so that the ECB's role in respect of 2000 and 2008 in the decisions that were taken are held to account in this forum, so that Irish parliamentarians can hear from the ECB.  I have forcefully put that view to him.</p></speech>

I think the problem we have is that the then President of the ECB, Mr. Trichet, has said publically that he will not engage with our Parliament.  It is crucially important that the current President of the ECB, Mr. Draghi and the Governing Council make it very clear that they will involve themselves with papers, documentation and the personnel who may have been involved at the time.</p><p>  I have also worked hard on the question of tracker mortgages.  One of the major new initiatives that the ECB is announcing at 2.30 p.m. Frankfurt time, is in term of asset backed securities.  I am arguing that the ECB should use the tracker mortgages as collateral in terms of helping to get cheaper money into the Irish banks, which will help the SME sector.  That is something which Mr. Draghi is looking at on foot of my recommendation. </p><p>  We had an opportunity recently of visiting the European Investment Bank and I know that Sinn F&eacute;in colleagues met them as well over the summer.  One of the things they are doing on the back of a proposal I put was to consider funding for infrastructural projects on social housing.  This is a major issue in Dublin among my constituents.  Can we get funding for social housing initiatives from the EIB in the same way we have got funding for Grangegorman and for the Luas Interconnector?  They are considering that.  My job on the ECON committee allows me to do these things on behalf of the country.</p><p>  I will now comment on where we are falling down.  I do not think we have enough colleagues involved in detail.  These are complicated difficult files and we need more engagement on detail rather than on the Punch and Judy exchange that dominates our politics.  We have no early warning system as to what is really important for the country.  That is where we need to involve ourselves much closer with the sectoral committees.</p></speech>

We have 420 delegated Acts in my committee that we will be looking at in the next year involving secondary legislation on financial regulation.  I believe there is a role for the finance committee in working with me on weeding through the files to find out what my priorities should be on their behalf.</p><p>  We have 28 current files in ECON that are outstanding.  Ms Boylan, MEP, spoke about some of the files she is working on.  I would very much like to know the priorities of the Irish parliamentarians that I might take up.  That is where our engagement needs to improve.  Chairman, this is not a criticism, but we need to engage much closer with the sectoral committees, where we are leading on behalf of the people.</p></speech>

We are slowly putting in place the pillar blocks for banking union.  We need to get on to the jobs, investment and growth agenda.  President Juncker has proposed a radical plan where &euro;300 billion of new funding will be put into infrastructural projects in the next three years.  I understand the Irish Government needs to submit its proposals to the EIB by the end of October.  We should have a big discussion on that.  I want to see viable proposals because the EIB, at one level, and President Juncker, at another level, are adamant that we now need to get on to the investment agenda to deal with the unacceptable level of unemployment that exists across the Union.</p><p> In regard to capital markets, 80% of funding in Europe is by way of ordinary banks.  We need to move to a system where many public infrastructural projects are funded by PPPs and the private sector, a bit like in America.  To do that, we need a functioning capital market system, or non-bank lending as it is called.  That will be a crucial task over the mandate of this Parliament.  </p><p> We also need to have a single energy market, and not just because of energy dependency from eastern to western Europe and the issues in Ukraine.  We  need to put the infrastructure in place; President Juncker has spoken about that.</p><p> We need to complete structural reform.  Some 90% of the growth in the world in the next five years will not be in Europe.  Europe is getting old, flabby and uncompetitive and we must start to provoke the innovation agenda, get research back into our industries, recreate manufacturing and look at ways to do things a bit better and at how do we get more money into SMEs.  That is the real task Europe faces and that is why we must complete the structural reform agenda to ensure we come back strong.</p></speech>

All our guests made very comprehensive contributions.  When the committee was in Brussels earlier this year, we had a meeting with one of the MEPs who has a specific responsibility for the Balkans region.  He expressed surprise the committee was interested in the Balkans because he said no Irish MEP seemed to show any interest in it and that no Irish MEP was on the foreign affairs committee.  I looked through the list of committees of which we are not members.  It is not only the foreign affairs committee from which we are absent but we are also absent from the justice and home affairs committee, the women's rights and gender equality committee and the human rights committee.  Will the MEPs give us their views on how we can ensure Ireland's voice is heard and that we have some representation in those types of areas in Europe?</p><p>  On Monday and Tuesday, Deputy Ciar&aacute;n Lynch and I attended the article 13 conference on the ongoing monitoring of the fiscal compact.  It was attended by members of the national parliaments from across Europe as well as by Members of the European Parliament.  What was interesting was that when it came to the discussion about the financial instruments we could use to get out of the crisis, whether eurobonds, the European redemption fund or the new PADRE system, Germany, in particular, was very much against any use of, or any expansion of instruments, which may mean additional call on German national finances.  At a European level, how do the MEPs see us getting out of this crisis?  How do they see the developments in regard to the renegotiation of the multi-annual financial framework going?  They will remember that before their term, when it came to agreement of the multi-annual financial framework, it was agreed we would revisit this in a short number of years.  What is the potential of getting more money into the system so that we kick-start growth across the economy?  </p><p>  In regard to working together, in the past attendance of Irish Members of the European Parliament at this committee was sporadic at best and it depended on the subject matter and the date.  We changed the day of the committee meetings to a Thursday to try to accommodate MEPs, in particular Dublin MEPs, because I am sure Thursday afternoons are not a bad time for them.  We would like to see better engagement for all the reasons they outlined earlier.  Will they let us know what we, as a committee, can do to make it easier for them and their colleagues to attend meetings on a regular basis?  Local councillors who are members of the Committee of the Regions appeared before the committee.  We are trying to develop better relationships between the Committee of the Regions and the national Parliament.  If we could improve our relations with MEPs, that would complete the circle.  We would have European Parliament Members, national Parliament Members and local authority members speaking with each other on a regular basis, which would help to improve things.  Perhaps the MEPs will comment on those issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.567" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014100200007#F00300"><p>I have an appointment at 3 p.m. but I hope to return to the meeting.  I cannot miss the opportunity to mention the fact that two of the MEPs are based in Dublin South-West and I wish them both well.  Both MEPs know of the difficulties in the area, with high unemployment, in particular youth unemployment.  People will expect them to deliver and come up with the goods and some ideas.  Both MEPs have a huge responsibility in regard to this project.  We all know of the disconnect.  I agree with the Chairman in regard to the structures for meeting MEPs.  Let us be honest in that it did not really work with the previous group of MEPs but I hope we can improve that.  We need to look at different ways in which we can tie MEPs into this committee, whether through their attendance here, video-conferencing or otherwise.  I agree with the point about MEPs working together.  That is a given.  MEPs on this end of the island and in the North should also work together.  We come from the same island and many of the problems are the same.</p><p>  Mr. Hayes did not mention that he was a member of the delegation to Iraq.  I would like him to go into detail on that.  It is a huge area of responsibility and people are looking for answers in that regard as well as on the bombing of ISIS locations and so on.  We all accept there is a huge difficulty there among the Sunni population.  Promises were made to many of the groups in that area which were not followed through by the Iraqi authorities or by the Americans.  That is part of the disconnect there.  I would like to hear Mr. Hayes's ideas on what he can do there.</p><p>  In regard the Palestinian situation, will Ms Boylan explain to us what reasons were given for turning a delegation away?  There is talk of another group from Europe trying to get into Palestine through a different route.  What we saw on television horrified most people.  The calls from that region are for more European intervention.  They are clearly looking for the European Union and European governments to play a much more proactive role in that whole region.   Does Ms Boylan have any ideas in that regard?</p><p>  Some people are talking about a boycott of goods from the settlements.  That is not coming from governments but from grassroots organisations and it could be effective.  There was announcement the other day of more settlements going ahead in east Jerusalem and the worry is that it is more difficult to come up with a solution to the problem if there are more of these settlements, which are illegal under international law.  If we allow this to go ahead, how can any Israeli Government come up with a solution which will mean removing all these people from their land?  That, in itself, creates difficulties.  </p><p>  I am interested in Gaza, in particular, given what we have seen on television.  The expression used by the Israeli army was "mowing the grass".  There have been different campaigns of mowing the grass.</p> <p>Are the witnesses concerned, like everyone else to whom I speak to on this, about what will arise following this latest conflict?  As a country that has come out of conflict, are there lessons we can offer, not only in Palestine but in other regions around the world?  I am thinking in terms of the situation in Iraq.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.569" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1155" speakername="Kathryn Reilly" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014100200008#G00300"><p>Deputy Crowe mentioned Palestine and Ms Boylan mentioned the infrastructure issue.  One example referred to was the EU-funded airport which was opened in 1998 and bombed in 2001, 2009 and 2012.  There was also reference to other infrastructure that has been destroyed in recent years and which has left Gaza very dependent on Israel.  The EU has repeatedly funded infrastructure that Israel has subsequently destroyed during the last three operations in the Gaza Strip.  In light of what goes on in the European Parliament, is it important that Israel would be held responsible and made accountable at EU level for the destruction of EU-funded infrastructure?</p><p>  This is possibly being parochial but it is important.  Mr. Hayes mentioned he is first and foremost an Irish MEP abroad as opposed to the Fine Gael member of the EPP and that it is important to work together in the interests of the country.  As part of the programme of the Italian Presidency of the Council of the European Union, one of its priorities is European employment and economic growth.  Italy has stated it wishes to focus on financing growth and supporting investment in sectors that are key to the future of our children such as environmental protection.  Earlier this year, the environment committee supported an amendment for the necessity of an environmental impact assessment to be extended to the exploration and extraction of shale gas.  That was later voted down by the European Parliament in plenary session.  In terms of environmental protection and supporting investment in growth sectors, what is Mr. Hayes's opinion on fracking?  I am asking that because of the decision taken this week in the North not to renew a licence for exploration.  Is it important to have environmental impact assessments for projects which some people might say are beneficial in terms of making money but which could destroy landscapes or prove more detrimental to the natural environment, water and other such things in the future?</p></speech>

I wish them well in their roles.  They have a tighter geographical area than their colleagues representing the western region, or whatever it is called now, which is a huge geographical area.  It was formerly the midlands-west region.</p><p>  Mr. Jacob outlined the nomination process for Commissioners and noted that the full Commission is voted upon.  It seems strange that each individual Commissioner is not voted upon.  That was obviously decided by someone else.  If there are objections to individual Commission candidates, how is that highlighted to the relevant person?  What is the process?  If the majority of people or a significant number of people have an objection to just one individual candidate, it seems strange that confirmation of the full Commission would be delayed.</p><p>  The Chairman touched on the issue of committees of which there are no Irish members.  As a western Deputy representing Galway West, it is of particular concern that the Committee on Regional Development will have no Irish MEP as a member.  Given Ireland's concerns and ensuring Ireland's priorities are represented, how do the 11 Irish MEPs engage with that committee?  Is it within their groups?  Are they getting minutes of all meetings?  I presume so.  Have they representatives that sit in the gallery and find out exactly what is going on?</p><p>  On the hearings today with Mr. Phil Hogan, which I am sure Mr. Hayes was watching at some stage, there was an attempt to scupper his nomination. This goes against the grain of all Irish MEPs working in the common interest of the country.  I noted with interest that the Sinn F&eacute;in nominee objected to Mr. Hogan, as is his right, but the Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development in Northern Ireland had issued a letter to Mr. Hogan congratulating him on his role and hoping that they would work together and promote common issues.  There is a lot of commonality between North and South in terms of agriculture issues and it is a very important role.  Will Mr. Hayes comment on that?</p><p>  Ms Boylan mentioned the issue of Gaza and Senator Reilly touched on it as well.  That is a very serious issue considering the conflict there.  Can Ms Boylan tell the committee if there is cross-party commonality or cross-party support on the issue of EU projects being bombed by Israel?  Ms Boylan's group would be focused on the issue.  Are there other groups that are also focused on the issue?  Will Mr. Hayes also comment on that?  There was a comment by Benjamin Netanyahu some time ago that international support will be required to rebuild Gaza.  That is a little hard to take, notwithstanding the right of Israel to defend itself.</p><p>  On the UK referendum, I am not sure if there are many people in the UK who would be too concerned about how Ireland views the referendum.  Maybe some business people would be concerned.  The ordinary voter might not be too worried about what Ireland thinks about it.  If there is to be renegotiation of certain aspects of the treaty, does Mr. Hayes think this will open up the possibility of other countries similarly seeking renegotiation?  Does he think the fabric of the various treaties will fall apart?</p><p>  On the single energy market, we are losing competitiveness to the USA.  It is important we ensure we can continue to attract industry to Europe.  How is this progressing?  Do the witnesses think the instability in the Ukraine and the concerns about Russian gas and so forth has expedited this process?  Do they have any timescale on the issue?</p></speech>

I wish them well during their tenure in the European Parliament.</p><p>  To what extent are the Members committed to and to what extent can they be effective in mobilising opinion within the EU towards concentrating on a peace process between the Israelis and the Palestinians with particular reference to the need to establish an ongoing structure whereby the aggrieved parties on whatever side could regularly bring their grievances for a hearing and with a view to replacing operations such as Operation Cast Lead or the most recent intrusions, such being the much better option?</p><p>  On the financial services sector, what is the extent to which consideration is being given to a financial transactions tax?  What support is there for such a tax within the European Union?  Is it accepted that such a proposal would need to be universally accepted?  Acceptance in one country or a group of countries would result in serious decimation of the financial services in that country or those countries.  Are the implications fully recognised?</p><p>  What is the extent, if any, to which Ireland's 12.5% corporation tax rate is an issue for discussion in the European Union?  We have seen some misinformed and uninformed discussions of and comments on the subject that would be detrimental to our island's position in its attempt at economic recovery and as an international and central trader in the global market, having particular regard to the fact that 90% of what we produce in this country is exported and that we have had the benefit of a significant level of foreign direct investment.</p> <p>To what extent do the witnesses see themselves playing a role in that debate, which has to be fair, equitable, Europe-wide and Europe-based, but also conscious of the needs of our own economy?</p><p> Jobs, investment and growth are other areas that have been mentioned and are very important.  We have discussed them on numerous occasions as a committee.  With interest rates at an all-time low, it must be a good time to encourage growth through investment.  Job creation projects must be seen as important.  In that context, would it be possible for the EU to adopt a Europe-wide policy to identify areas that lack growth and economic promotion, irrespective of country or border, with a view to stimulating investment and growth?  In the first instance this policy should identify the extent to which infrastructure is required in those areas to facilitate growth.  There is a general feeling that the areas of largest population throughout Europe enjoy a greater possibility of economic recovery than other areas.  In this country, greater efforts have been made and greater success has been achieved in returning to some kind of growth than in most other countries within the eurozone.</p><p> The early warning system is of great importance in all aspects of European law, particularly in fiscal and economic areas.  It has to be possible and should have been possible for the red light to appear on the screen a long time before we tip over the edge and find ourselves in need of financial bailouts.  To what extent can the MEPs, individually and collectively, influence concentration on those areas with a view to ensuring no country in the EU finds itself in a position where economic crisis creeps up on it without an early warning system?</p><p> Certain objectives have been laid down in respect of Europe 2020.  I mention specifically our own Food Harvest 2020 because 90% of what we produce is exported.  That is a sizeable area of importance for us.  What are the MEPs' views on both these areas?</p><p> Energy is a critical element of European infrastructure.  Some parts of the EU have ready access and some do not.  We are especially isolated when it comes to a reliable energy source over which we have control.  To what extent do the MEPs see themselves as being in a position to play a role in developing alternative reliable energy sources, throughout the EU but in this country in particular?  I would hope that this could be done through the political groupings.  Going back to the old story, everyone says each country should have more influence on European policy, but with 27 or 28 member states, each country exerting more influence on European policy will beg the question of where it breaks down.  Does each country recognise the need for the others' existence?</p><p> There is a huge deficiency in housing in this country, which has been growing for many years.  We will find ourselves in a very serious position in a year's time.  It will come up much more quickly than we think.  The degree of homelessness and the threat of it is significant, in particular in the greater Dublin area but it is even worse in adjoining counties like Wicklow, Kildare and Meath.  When negative equity in respect of house prices begins to recede, it is of benefit to the lending sector but has the opposite effect on the unfortunate people who are hoping to be housed.  To what extent do the MEPs, individually and collectively, through Europe, encourage the early launch of some system whereby funding for that purpose can be provided?  Every one of the members present, including myself, has spent a lot of time working on this issue over recent years.  There is a difficulty because if something appears on the national balance sheet, it is a no-no.  However, there are other ways of doing it.  The positive side is that there is a reduction in annual expenditure on rent support which is permanently resolved.</p><p> There are many issues and I have no doubt that more will arise over the next years.  I, like all of my colleagues present, could go on asking questions for a long time.  We believe that policy in Europe can have a positive or negative impact on us.  We can have a positive impact on Europe and it can have a positive impact on us.  We are committed Europeans.  We cannot have influence in an institution the size of the EU while saying we are only half Europeans, that we do not intend to stay here except for a short while, or that we are just visitors to see what can happen for the time being.  Things do not work that way; we have to have a commitment.  Our commitment will determine the outcome of the modern Europe.  In the course of this Commission and this Parliament, Europe is going to see changes it has not seen before.  If it does not act with commitment, the European project may waver and crack.  The consequences of this for all European countries, within and outside the eurozone, will be catastrophic.</p></speech>

I had expected someone to bring up the subject of the transatlantic trade and investment partnership, TTIP.  This committee produced a report on TTIP a number of months ago after holding a number of hearings.  The report questioned the level of transparency of the negotiations.  This issue is shared by organisations throughout Ireland.  We recently had a submission from Tr&oacute;caire on it.  I mentioned that I attended the Article 13 conference in Rome earlier in the week.  One of my colleagues there described TTIP as the biggest social threat in Europe today.  There are significant concerns about the TTIP proposals and what they will mean for the social market.  What kind of feelings are the MEPs picking up, although they are not long in their positions, from across the political groupings at Parliament level about TTIP?</p><p>  There have been a wide range of questions.  I had said we would finish by 3.30 p.m., but that is probably ambitious at this stage.  I suggest we take it in the same order as when we started off, beginning with Mr. Jacobs, then Ms Boylan and then Mr. Hayes.  The witnesses need not feel they have to answer everything, but if there are some issues they would like to clarify or questions they would like to answer, they are welcome to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.574" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Francis Jacobs" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014100200009#H00300"><p>There was one question about what happens if the European Parliament does not like an individual and we do not have a vote on that individual candidate.  The process is relatively informal.  If there have been candidates with whom the European Parliament has not been satisfied, we have tried, working with the President of the Commission, to see if they could have portfolio reallocated or if the member state could replace that candidate.  That happened in the last two Commissions that member states withdrew one or more nominees and replaced them with others.  That has slowed down the process.  The key question for the European Parliament is political.  How many nominees have to raise problems for the Parliament to decide it does not want to vote on the Commission as whole?  This is the only formal lever it has, to refuse to vote the Commission until X and Y nominees are withdrawn and replaced.</p> <p>In this particular case, many questions may be asked of individual nominees and many individual problems may come up.  There is a little bit of a difference, however, in that the lead candidate system has meant that the organic relationship between the President of the European Commission and the European Parliament has been closer than it has been in past nominations.  I do not know how that will affect the process, but I am sure that Ms Boylan and Mr. Hayes would have views on that.  It is informal.</p><p> The final thing I would mention is what happens if the Commission is confirmed and then afterwards committees or Members of the Parliament are unhappy with the performance of individual Commissioners.  I do not think it will be modified this time, but in the past after each election the European Parliament has reached an agreement with the President of the Commission on a code of conduct governing relations between the Parliament and the Commission.  The member states have not always liked that.  One of the provisions in the agreement is that the Parliament can ask the President of the Commission to reallocate responsibility from an individual member of the Commission with whom the European Parliament is not happy.  Even after the vote, there are mechanisms for the Parliament to request the President of the Commission to respond to the Parliament on that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.576" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lynn Boylan" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014100200010#J00200"><p>I will try to get through as many questions as possible.  The first was about attendance by MEPs at this committee.  It is difficult because of the days on which the committee sits.  Even a Thursday afternoon is not ideal because some of us would have committee meetings.  From a practical point of view, there are constituency weeks allocated which MEPs spend in their constituencies and which would be best for any MEP to attend the committee.  The details of these weeks are available on the website.</p><p>  This engagement is very important for us.  Mr. Hayes has brought it up, not only in relation to this committee but also the sectoral committees.  Sectoral committees in the Oireachtas should pay particular attention to the sectoral committees on which Irish MEPs are not represented.  There is an Irish MEP on the Committee for Regional Development, Ms Martina Anderson, who is also a representative on the Committee on Constitutional Affairs, and I am sure she would be happy to brief the committee on her work on those two committees.  It is important for the sectoral committees to flag any issues they believe need the attention of the Irish MEPs at a committee on which we are not represented.  I invite committees to send an e-mail to flag it with us and we can monitor it.  It is impossible to monitor the minutes of all the committees.  Mr. Hayes can confirm that the number of e-mails one receives just from one's own committees is phenomenal.  Therefore it would be on the basis of Deputies keeping an eye on the relevant portfolios and flagging issues with us.  Equally, we can flag important issues at our committees with Deputies.</p><p>  There were a number of questions on the Palestine issue.  Deputy Crowe asked about the reasons given to refuse the delegation admission to Gaza.  When we first requested permission, the Israeli Foreign Minister said that they were only allowing access to people who were delivering aid to Gaza.  We appealed that on the basis that the European Union provides a significant amount of aid to the region and that to best assess what aid was required, MEPs had to go and find out that information first-hand.  That appeal was again refused on the basis that we were not delivering immediate aid to the region.  During our trip we went to the Red Crescent centre in Jerusalem and we saw two full warehouses of immediate aid equipment, including medical equipment, antibiotics, wheelchairs and crutches.  The Red Crescent was awaiting permission from Israel to bring that immediate aid into Gaza.  We therefore find the actions of the Israeli Foreign Minister repulsive because he used an excuse not to allow us in when they were actually also stopping immediate aid going to the area.  We do not believe that excuse and we intend in the GUE-NGL group to appeal this decision to the Israeli Government every month on the grounds that we want access to Gaza in order that we can best represent European taxpayers' money going into the area.</p><p>  Senator Reilly asked about taxpayers' money being spent on infrastructure which seems to be completely destroyed every two years with no consequences for Israel in terms of reimbursing the European Union for the destruction of this infrastructure.  A resolution was brought to the floor of the plenary session of the European Parliament on 17 September demanding reparations from Israel for the EU-funded projects destroyed during repeated aggression in Gaza and the West Bank.  This was, regrettably, voted down.  It seems MEPs are quite happy to waste Irish and European taxpayers' money by rebuilding over and over again.  This is something we will keep on the agenda.</p><p>  The boycott seems to be having some success, especially with G4S, the security company.  G4S has come under great pressure on this issue and many member states have pulled contracts with it.  I hope the Irish Government would consider doing the same because I know that G4S is tendering for contracts in the Department of Social Protection.  G4S has said it will not renew its contract with Israel in 2017 because of the pressure it has come under, so the boycott campaign is having an effect.</p><p>  On the peace process, we felt when we were out there that one needs a partner to peace.  We know from our experience in the North that both sides must be willing to engage and it appears the Israeli Government is not prepared to engage in a peace process at the moment.  The only way it will be forced to the table to negotiate is if it comes under intense pressure from the international community.  The European Union needs to step up to the plate on this by insisting that Israel ends the disproportionate aggression against the Palestinian people.</p><p>  There was also a question on youth unemployment and the Youth Guarantee.  The previous Commissioner gave a presentation on this topic to the plenary session in September.  There is a great deal of concern that it is failing in its purpose in that member states are not drawing down the money as expected.  We have put forward a proposal to have a full review of the Youth Guarantee scheme, paying particular attention to the programme countries, including Ireland, because we believe the Youth Guarantee was grossly underfunded from the start and did not have achievable goals.  We must also monitor how individual member states are monitoring the Youth Guarantee.  Certainly in Ireland we have concerns that there was no provision for facilitating single parents to get back into the workplace, for example, and a large number of them are unemployed.  There was no facility either for the 10,000 people with disabilities to access the Youth Guarantee.  We are hopeful that initiative will be taken up by the Committee for Employment and Social Affairs, of which I am a member, and I would be happy to report back to this committee on that.</p><p>  On TTIP and the other question Senator Reilly asked about fracking, we have very serious concerns about the transatlantic trade agreement.  Going on the feelings that were evident when this was debated in the plenary session two weeks ago, there is much concern within the groups about the lack of transparency in the negotiations.  We have serious concerns about the investor state dispute settlement mechanism which allows industry to bring a government to court.  We will oppose that at any level if it is part of the trade agreement.  It comes into play in terms of fracking, because American fracking companies have sued the Canadian Government, so we want to ensure there are robust legal protections for member states if they want to oppose fracking and we want to ensure they would be entitled to do so.  As I highlighted regarding GMOs, we cannot allow a situation where a democratic government wants to oppose something happening on its territory and industry can take it to court on the basis of competitiveness.  It cannot be tolerated.</p><p>  Regarding some of the other questions Deputy Kyne raised about the Commissioner, we stand over our objection to Phil Hogan.</p> <p>We think he is the wrong man for the job.  I am putting on the green jersey.  We heard earlier that Jean-Claude Juncker failed to meet the 40% target he set for female Commissioners.  The Irish Government really missed a trick in this regard.  Mair&eacute;ad McGuinness is over there.  While I disagree with her politics, I accept that she is absolutely competent.  Unlike Phil Hogan, there is no controversy around her.  She knows the agriculture brief inside out.  She is very familiar with the institutions.  We think Ireland missed a trick on this occasion.  The number of female Commissioners has not increased under Jean-Claude Juncker.  We have the same number of female Commissioners that we had in the past.  We have concerns.  Deputy Durkan spoke about the housing crisis.  I remind him that Phil Hogan cut the funding for social housing by 90% during his term in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p></speech>

We will have to disagree on that.  We certainly raised the issue of the funding of social housing when we met officials from the European Investment Bank.  We are investigating the very good examples they gave us of how that was done in Britain.  Sinn F&eacute;in has proposed the use of arm's-length companies to enable local authorities to access funding and thereby be in a position to invest in social housing.  When we meet the officials in question, we also raised the possibility of an increase in the European Investment Bank ratio from 50:50 to a lending ratio of 75:25 for the purposes of social housing or job creation.  We were told that there is no legal impediment to that.  We will pursue that possibility.  We believe the lending capacity of the European Investment Bank should be increased because its current capacity is too small.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.588" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Hayes" time="15:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014100200011#K01200"><p>I will begin by responding to the Chairman's remarks.  There are 24 committees.  As there are just 11 of us, we are not going to be on every committee.  In that context, I return to my initial point that there could be more co-ordination between the 11 of us.  That is something I would like to explore with all my colleagues, leaving party politics outside for a moment.  There is more work we can do.  Three or four members of our 11-strong delegation are on one committee, but we have no one on eight committees.  There is an issue there.  I am also on the Committee on Development as a substitute member.  Obviously, there is a kind of ying-yang balance between economics and development.  They are both connected, given what we need to see in terms of trade opportunities between the developing world and Europe, especially in light of the huge sums of money the European taxpayer is putting into humanitarian relief across the world.</p><p>  I would like to set out the key issue with regard to investment.  Of course we need investment, but someone has to pony up the money.  Investment in Ireland decreased by 20%, or one fifth, from the top of the crisis in 2008 to the bottom of the crisis now.  The question of whether this is the bottom of the crisis is an open one.  That is private consumption.  People talk about public sector money, but the real money that drives the economy is private sector money.  Of course capital money here, there and everywhere makes some difference.  Private sector money is the real money that encourages investment in small and medium-sized enterprises.  Mario Draghi has made the point that we need to return to the investment agenda.</p><p>  I came across a very interesting paper by Daniel Gros at a preliminary meeting of the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs the other day.  He made the point that such a wall of money has never before been put into the banks, or made optional to the banks, without the banks lending it.  He says that when something similar happened in the 1930s, there was a deflationary period for a decade after.  People psychologically remembered the crash in their own private lives and in their countries' lives.  They deleveraged, they paid down their loans and they decided not to take on more debt.  I think Europe is in a similar spiral right now.</p><p>  There is a simplistic top-of-the-head attitude that we need to get more money into the system, even though we have never had more money in the system.  There is a psychological problem with drawing down that money.  Some of the banks have said they are making money available, but it is not being drawn down.  When a small businessman who has three or four people working for him is told there is money available, he has to decide whether to do it now or to wait.  He might choose to pay down his existing debts, such as credit card debt.  That is the psychological problem Europe is in right now, largely because it took us so long to get out of the crisis.  We have had to retrofit the whole system of banking union.  We have had to put a resolution system in place.  We have finally got a sensible president of the ECB, following the departure of a rather single-minded and unsensible person.</p><p>  The new President of the ECB has done many things.  He has put the three-year money at 1%.  He has promised countries which cannot get back to the markets that he will keep buying their bonds, if they are unable to do so, as long as they can get two ten-year papers away.  He has announced that up to &euro;400 billion in asset-backed securities will be made available to the banks of Europe.  How much of that money will get into the real economy?  That is the question.  Something interesting happened when he came out with his proposal.  Europe is virtually in a period of quantitative easing at present.  I will explain the difference between what the Federal Reserve in the US is doing and what the ECB is doing in terms of monetary policy.  When the Federal Reserve has $100 billion to put into the system, it says to the banks: "Here it is; take it."  The difference between what Mario Draghi is doing now and what Mr. Wagner and others used to do is that they are expecting the banks to apply for this.</p><p>  The big impediment to investment, whether that involves the off-balance sheet bond buying that the Germans are in favour of or the straight investment of ECB money, is the upcoming stress tests.  I have been a public critic of the new supervisory mechanism.  I think it is holding back growth.  At a time when Europe needs investment of private sector money into the banks to get the lending and the multiplier effect going again, it is crazy that the stress tests have been put off on three separate occasions.  They were supposed to be done at the start of this year and then they were supposed to take place in March.  When I asked about the matter at last week's meeting of the European Parliament Committee on Economic and Monetary Affairs, I was told they will definitely be done by the end of October.  If one gives a huge sum of money to the banks to recapitalise them and if they know this test is coming down the line, it should not be a surprise if they hold on to the money.  We have created a monster through these stress tests, because it is taking the real economy a significant length of time to get this money.</p><p>  This is not going to be an easy nut to crack.  There are no simplistic solutions to this.  The reputation of our country has improved dramatically.  If one believes the GDP figures, our country has the potential to hit 5% growth this year.  Every 1% of GDP growth leads to &euro;1.6 billion in additional money coming in.  The big prize for Ireland goes back to the point made by Deputy Durkan.  It is not just about Ireland getting something from Europe.  There are many things we need to get.  It is also about telling Europe how we have managed to come through this awful period in our economic history.  Average earnings in Ireland are &euro;33,000.  Average earnings in Portugal are &euro;16,000.  Average earnings in Greece are approximately &euro;10,000.  They cannot be compared.</p><p>  The point I am making is there are things we can do now on foot of some extraordinary experiences.  For example, the public sector unions have accepted the kind of dramatic reduction led by the Minister, Deputy Howlin.  We have transformed the public sector unions.  This country has a much more efficient public sector than the great majority of EU countries.  I know that because I see a lot of Belgium these days.  We have a much more efficient public sector.  Our public sector led us through this crisis.  It was prepared to take one third of all the adjustments.  We have learning on procurement to explain to similarly sized EU countries.</p><p>  I think the way out of this for Ireland is to benchmark ourselves against similarly sized countries in Europe like Denmark and Belgium.  We should examine how they are doing by comparison with us.  That is how we can negotiate.  There is a great deal to be learning about the Irish experience.  When our colleagues speak of Ireland now, and this is not a kind of German-centric view, they do so in a very different way from how they did four or five years ago because of what we have come through.  Many people in Europe have a great deal to learn from us.  It is not just about us taking something; it is about us giving something back.  That is a very strong experience.</p><p>  The investment issue is very significant.  It is going to be led by the private sector.  It is not going to be done by the public sector alone.  As we are in a monetary union and therefore cannot change our interest rates, we need to foster a productive and competitive environment.  We have gone up in the competitiveness stakes in recent years.  Wage price inflation is a real issue now.  The unit labour price has come down in Ireland.  It is a much more competitive place in which to locate jobs.  The foreign direct investment sector is doing very well now.  We have a very good selling point in our country.  Ireland is a highly skilled, deleveraged and privatised country.  Ireland is much more northern European than southern European in its feel and its composure.</p> <p>We have to use what we have come through to our advantage.  I think there is a great deal of learning on all sides.  I am not going to discuss what happened today at the hearings when Phil Hogan faced questioning.  It is there for everybody to see.  I think Commission Hogan will be really good.  It is an example of the standing we now have that President Juncker asked an Irishman to take on this crucially important task.  The hearings speak for themselves.<br/>Deputy Kyne asked a really important question on the issue of the UK referendum.  I have taken a great interest in this, and members may have seen the articles that were published in the newspapers.  I recently spoke at the British-Irish Association in Oxford on this issue.  I think we can be a bridge of interpretation between now and 2017, should there be a referendum.  In a recent speech I said the genie is out of the bottle, whether the Conservative Party or the Labour Party win the next election there will be a referendum at some point in the United Kingdom.  I think that is good.  My personal view is that the sooner it happens the better.  That is not the view of the Government, but my personal view.  It will force the British to renegotiate a list of things that they believe is important.  We are an English-speaking country and we understand where the British are coming from, we have an opportunity of being a bridge of interpretation because there is goodwill in Europe to making sure that the British remain in Europe.  That is in Ireland's interest.<br/>It is in Europe's interest that Britain is at the heart of the European Union and I think they need to resolve their issues.  It will be a once in a generation referendum.  The British Labour Party tells us that it would only have a referendum based on future treaty change.  At some point there will be a treaty change, but I cannot say when it will be, hopefully not soon.  It is inevitable that there will be a referendum and it is better that it is done with their support and that we do it together.  As I said in my recent speech, we can be a bridge of interpretation to try to help the British to resolve that issue and equally that the continental Europeans can do likewise.<br/>Senator Reilly raised the issue of fracking.  I agree with her position and I think it is right and prudent that the Government would take its time and that we do not go in helter skelter in our response.  I fundamentally agree with an impact assessment.  The Senator is absolutely right on that.  We have a problem.  The problem is that the cost of energy in the United States is a third lower than across Europe.  One of the reasons that their manufacturing base is powering ahead in the past number of years is because they have found this alternative form of energy called fracking.  It is not all to do with that.  We have to weigh up all the issues but I think the Government is correct in taking its time on this issue and putting forward the arguments from an environmental perspective.  We have too much to lose.  I am very proud that the tourism product, be it in Dublin or elsewhere, is something we should be very proud of, North and South.  We should do it on that basis.<br/>I have said publicly that the response of the Israelis to Gaza has been totally disproportionate to what came from the other side.  We have a ceasefire now and it is very important that the ceasefire holds and that the international community works hard and persuades all of the parties to resolve this issue and that the European taxpayer is not left in hock again.  Some &euro;700 million has been spent by the European taxpayer in the past decade rebuilding Gaza.  It is a dreadful and appalling waste.  In these circumstances children are not in school today.  The European Union needs to speak with one voice.  That is difficult as the Chairman knows because of the realities of foreign policy in the Union.<br/>Ireland has an unique role to play and I commend the role of the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Flanagan, and others who have taken a fair approach to the issue.  Ultimately the two-state solution is the solution that we all need to back and support.  We know from our own conflict that it is only when the bombs stop and people are not being murdered that space is created for politicians to resolve the issue in a meaningful and impartial way.  I would like to see this happen.<br/>Deputy Crowe asked about Iraq.  I am soon to become the vice president of the EU Iraqi delegation.  It is a part of the world the EU will invest in very strongly.  I recently met the representatives of the Kurdish community and heard about what they have gone through under the terrible terrorist Isis threat.  We now have a new unity Government in Iraq.  I said recently in Parliament, and I stand over that speech, that we have an opportunity of involving Iran in a way to help resolve this issue in the region.  I think the Iranians can be a force for good.  I passionately believe that the threat that Isis poses is not just a threat to Iraq and especially to northern Iraq but right across the region.  We need to encourage the Iranian position and use it as a way of a new <i>d&eacute;tente</i>, as I described it in Parliament so that the Americans and Europeans can resolve their difficulties with Iran.  This is something that I have worked towards as a member of the committee.<br/>I apologise that I have not answered all the questions but I think I have given a flavour of my work.</p></speech>

It also causes interference for the members of staff.  I thank everyone for being here this morning.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Catherine Byrne, Regina Doherty, Peter Fitzpatrick, Ciara Conway, Eamonn Moloney and Senator Colm Burke. Deputy Catherine Byrne and Senator Imelda Henry had to leave us this morning.  </p><p>  We are beginning our first in a series of meetings dealing with the issue of concussion in sport.  With sport increasingly becoming played at a faster speed and with greater physical intensity at both professional and amateur level, the number of concussions appears to have increased and the issue has become very prominent with many of the sporting and medical boards expressing concern.  For most of us, concussion is something to be associated with elite sports people and involves physical contact.  The reality is concussion can affect anyone who undertakes any type of physical activity.  It is an issue that is relevant to everyone from those in the school yard, to the recreational walker, to the person who plays five-a-side, to the club player and to the elite sports person. </p><p>  Unfortunately, head injury awareness is limited.  It is important to bring attention and focus to the issue, so that the focus is not just on high profile incidents but across the spectrum of society.  I welcome the committee's deliberations and wish to inform people that at the end of our hearings we will produce a report.  We will meet with a wide variety of medical professionals and a range of stakeholders, including athletes and sporting organisations, to explore the various issues around concussion.  At the end of the process, which I hope will be rewarding and in keeping with the tradition of this committee, we will hopefully have an increasing awareness of concussion.   </p><p>  I welcome Professor Michael Molloy who I have known for almost 30 years. I first met him as a student working as a porter in University College Cork hospital.  Professor Molloy is an eminent consultant rheumatologist and is chair of the concussion advisory group at the Faculty of Sports &amp;amp; Exercise Medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  He is a former chief medical officer to the Irish Rugby Board and a former Irish rugby international player.  Dr. Padraig Sheeran is dean of the Faculty of Sports &amp;amp; Exercise Medicine at the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland and the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland.  Professor John Ryan is the consultant in emergency medicine in St. Vincent's University Hospital and the team doctor with the Leinster rugby team.  Dr. Michael Farrell is the consultant neuropathologist from Beaumont Hospital.  Dr. &Eacute;anna Falvey is director of Sports and Exercise Medicine at the Sports Surgery Clinic and also works with the Irish rugby team.  You are all very welcome and I thank you for being here.  This is the first of two meetings this morning.  </p><p>  Before we begin, to remind people on privilege, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence you are to give to the committee.  However, if you are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and you are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that where possible you should not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make them identifiable and members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice or ruling of the Chair to the effect that members shall not comment on, criticise or make charges against any person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him identifiable.  </p><p>  This is the first of two meetings.  I am hoping with the co-operation of all that this meeting will conclude between 11.15 a.m. and 11.20 a.m. to allow people time to change the tapes for recording of the next session, which will begin at 11.30 a.m. and which must end at 2 p.m.</p><p>  I call on Professor Molloy to make his opening remarks. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.597" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Michael Molloy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014100200003#B00200"><p>Chairman, thank you for inviting me.  I am going to start with a definition of concussion and mild traumatic brain injury.  I think I share this view with many others that perhaps it would be more effective if this was called mild traumatic brain injury.  There is a strong view that it is mild traumatic brain injury regardless of whether there are long-term consequences.  This is something that has not been completely evaluated or accepted.</p><p>  I was going to list how one deals with the issue in practice.  The cause is trauma to the head, neck and body.  In the management of concussion, the Zurich consensus statement on concussion in sport is used.  It is an acceptable document and used worldwide.  Concussion is a brain injury and is defined as a complex patho-physiological process affecting the brain induced by mechanical forces.  It can be a trauma to the head, neck or body transmitted to the brain, in other words, shaking the brain.  </p><p>  The diagnosis - there are on either side of me people who have dealt with this on the sideline regularly and still do so and I have a lot of experience of it myself - needs to be immediate.  Other speakers will mention how they make sure they are aware of it and the significance of the impact or the contact.  That should result in the individual being removed from the field of play.  That the diagnosis is made urgently and the individual - I am talking about contact sports at all levels - is removed from the field of play is perhaps the most important part of the whole process.  </p><p>  The second most important part is that the individuals concerned are not allowed back to play the same day.  This is something that has come from the NFL in America where there was a concern about concussion and long-term consequences including traumatic encephalopathy.  The US Government introduced a regulation stating that if a person had a diagnosis of concussion he or she had to come off the field of play and could not go back to play or train again until passed fit by a different - independent - medical person.  The clinical decision here is the gold standard. Others have published an article on this some years ago. The concussion statement points out that it is a clinical concussion.</p> <p>There are many questionnaires available.  One can ask the individual questions to determine whether he or she has concussion.  It is a clinical diagnosis because it is a changing and evolving situation.  A person who is concussed may well sound reasonable and sensible initially but then a minute later he or she is confused.  </p><p> Next is the on-field or sideline assessment which is very important.  We have issued the relevant guidance documents to the committee, known as Sport Concussion Assessment Tool, SCAT 3 and Child SCAT.  There is also a pocket SCAT.  The SCAT 3 document is very good.  Members can imagine the fun involved in going through that list in the middle of a game.  A clinical decision must be made first and then on the sideline someone must do the evaluation which involves repeated neuro-psychological questions.  All of the questions have been validated.  Child SCAT is very important because children are very susceptible to head injury and are at higher risk.  In certain sports like horse riding and rugby, for example, one must exclude a neck injury.  When an individual is on the ground, one has an obligation to make sure that he or she does not have a significant neck injury.  Once a neck injury has been discounted or dealt with, if necessary, then one is dealing with an evolving injury, namely concussion.  The good news is that 80% to 90% of concussed people recover in seven to ten days although it can take longer for children and adolescents to fully recover.  It is important to remember that point because too often concussion is considered to be a trivial event.  </p><p> If an individual has been knocked unconscious or there has been a more serious event, he or she can be referred to hospital for an X-ray and-or scan.  Unless there is a fracture, CT scans and MRI scans will not pick up anything in pure concussion.  However, if there is a brain injury - a bleed for instance - a CT scan will pick that up.  The most accurate test of all is a functional MRI scan but there is only one such scanner in this country.  It can pick up changes in the brain immediately following the injury.  We must go down the road of providing more functional MRI scanners to evaluate the injuries properly and to enhance research in this area.  </p><p> The neuro-psychological assessment is a very important part of the evaluation process and particularly so with children.  Children also have to be treated differently.  They should be kept out of school, not allowed to play games on their telephones and allowed to rest.  This is taken very seriously in most countries, particularly in the US.  Children must be evaluated slowly and it must be remembered that they take longer to recover.  They are at a greater risk than adults because frequently they bleed from the injury.  In that way, they are a special group.  In the recovery phase they are also a special group and should be monitored very carefully.  It is generally accepted that neuro-psychologists are in short supply in this country but most of the larger hospitals have one attached to the psychiatric unit.</p><p> The return-to-play protocol is very clear.  Individuals are assessed daily over a six-day period.  They are assessed on the first day and if all is well, they are allowed to do some exercise the next day.  If they are fine the next day, following an evaluation by medical personnel, they are allowed to do more exercise and so forth.  It is possible, therefore, under the return to play protocol, for an individual to return to play within a week.  Players go through a very rigorous, careful evaluation before they are allowed back to play.  Before they go back, however, they must be given medical clearance.  This is quite easy to manage in professional sport but with amateur sport it is a major headache.  In previous times, when rugby was an amateur sport, for example, players took a three-week break.  In a sense, three weeks is a necessary safety net for amateur sports because the necessary medical expertise is not readily available.  </p><p> There have been many articles in respected journals detailing the possible long-term consequences of concussion.  It has been suggested that there is a higher risk of dementia from repetitive head injury.  It has also been suggested in numerous papers in the US that chronic traumatic encephalopathy can be a consequence of concussion.  Cases of repetitive head injury causing early onset dementia or chronic traumatic encephalopathy have been reported in the US among American football players.  One case has been reported here of chronic traumatic encephalopathy in a rugby player.  In America, most of the cases reported are among American football players, with no cases reported in other sports such as ice hockey or Australian rules football but that may simply be because information was not being collected.  </p><p> The most important issue in all of this is prevention.  It is essential to minimise the risk of head injury to make sport safer.  It is vital that players protect their heads and necks.  The aim should be to prevent head trauma in all sport and the sporting bodies need to do more work in this regard.  Education is also critical for all age groups and teachers, coaches and referees have an important role to play in this regard.  In New Zealand, for example, referees must have a first aid certificate before they can referee a game at any level and that certificate must be re-validated every two years.  In my opinion, coaches should also be required to have a first aid qualification.  This is particularly true at the lower levels of sport, where medical expertise is not on hand all of the time.  Coaches, referees and other officials at the touch-line should have first aid training, should be aware of concussion and know what action to take.  </p><p> In all sports, but particularly in rugby, if a player is concussed but refuses to come off the pitch, the referee should send him or her off.  Many times at international level, I have told a referee to send a player off.  Referees must look out for signs of concussion in players.  A number of years ago an Irish referee sent a player off during a match between Scotland and Wales.  The fact that the player had been injured was not spotted by anybody else but the referee saw the player vomiting and sent him off immediately.  At all levels of the sport, referees have a role to play, as do coaches.  The coaches also have a role to play in the context of prevention, particularly in sports where there is a possibility of a lot of head contact.  Coaches should aim to minimise if not avoid such contact.  </p><p> There are excellent education programmes in many countries.  In ice hockey in Canada and America, for example, there are specialised programmes for players as young as seven.  While seven might seem a little young to start playing, those of us who support hurling here will know that if children do not start playing at aged five or six, they will probably never be really good at the game.  </p><p> I have given the committee an overview of where the problems lie, as I see them.  It is an ongoing and evolving situation, with research being carried out continuously.  We intend to get involved in one or two studies here which will be very significant and which will involve the use of functional MRI scanners as well as neuro-psychological evaluation post-concussion.</p></speech>

He has set the scene regarding concussion very well.  I am sure many of the other speakers here will echo the points made by Professor Molloy.</p><p>  I wish to speak on this issue from the perspective of emergency medicine.  At a national level we have a poor amount of data on the volume of concussion here.  We know that concussions are occurring at club level which are not reported to general practitioners, primary care teams or accident and emergency departments.  This means it is very difficult to know what the true incidence of concussion is in Ireland.  This is an issue which must be addressed going forward and it underpins one of my key points, which is the need for research.</p> <p>We need some basic research on the incidence of concussion in Ireland.  The top sports involved are rugby, GAA, soccer, equestrian and, increasingly, cycling, which has taken off in the past few years.  People are presenting at emergency departments with head injuries and concussions, along with other injuries.  We need to improve our awareness of the incidence and try to get some statistical evaluation of increases and decreases in particular sports and an understanding of the mechanisms involved.</p><p> Professor Molloy has covered what concussion is very well, and I will not repeat that.  It does not have to incur loss of consciousness or amnesia or involve a blow to the head.  A transmitted force or whiplash type of injury can be enough to cause concussion.  Part of the educational process necessary for the public and the medical, nursing and other allied professions involved with injured athletes, is to get the message across of what concussion is, how to recognise it on the field of play and in emergency departments, and how to manage it.</p><p> The two main issues arising in emergency medicine are education and the need for us to get a better handle on it through research.  It is unfortunate that much of our time in undergraduate education is spent on the severity of injuries and illnesses.  I do not wish to denigrate that in any way.  The management of patients with multiple injuries and major head injuries is very important but there is no doubt that junior doctors mostly see people at the lower end of the spectrum, which Professor Molloy spoke about, the mild traumatic brain injury group.  We spend a lot of time teaching undergraduates about the severity of severe injuries and head injuries associated with major trauma.  We desperately need to focus on undergraduate education and the volume of injuries at the lower end of the spectrum.  At postgraduate level too our emphasis is on taking people through courses such as the advanced trauma life support course for managing patients with major injury and multiple injuries.  We are not so good at teaching our postgraduate doctors how to deal with the consequences of mild traumatic brain injuries which will constitute the largest volume of what they will treat in emergency departments.</p><p> The issue around chronic traumatic encephalopathy has been elucidated.  I am sure Dr. Farrell will speak about it too.  It has helped in some ways because it has led to greater public awareness of traumatic brain injuries and concussion.  Parents, players, coaches, managers and, increasingly, junior and emergency medicine doctors are becoming aware of concussion, of its significance and the need to deal with it.  While there is a desperate need to have longitudinal clinical pathological studies on, and evaluating, chronic traumatic encephalopathy that discussion is helping to drive greater awareness of concussion.  The Irish Rugby Football Union, IRFU, has done some great work in the past year or 18 months on developing safe rugby courses for coaches, medics and physiotherapists involved with players who sustain injuries on the pitch and their assessment and safe management.  That is very welcome.  The faculty has been seminal in leading courses on the management of concussion through its sports course as well as half day courses.</p><p> The International Rugby Board, IRB, is studying what was previously known as a pitch side concussion assessment trial, now a head injury assessment trial to try to gain some information on the outcome for players.  The non-governmental organisation, NGO, Acquired Brain Injury Ireland held a very successful meeting last year drawing attention to this.  We are starting to see that in emergency medicine.  We did a study in St. Vincent's Hospital of the number of head injuries in sport presenting in the 2012-13 season compared with the 2013-14 season.  There has been a significant increase in the number presenting.  I do not think that is because more people are playing but because there is a greater recognition of the need to seek help.  The greatest rise has been in the adolescent group.  There has been a 41% increase in adolescents presenting at the emergency department with concussion.  In response we have developed a process out of which we hope to develop research findings that could be reproduced in, and transferred to, other emergency departments around the country.</p><p> Our policy now is to admit our patients to a clinical decision unit for a period of observation and effectively education too, for the parents and the injured athlete, to reassess and re-evaluate during that period.  Concussion is a disorder of function rather than structure and CT scans and MRI scans are usually normal.  Given a period of rest in a quiet ward area in most cases that is not necessary.  What is necessary is the instruction to have a two-week period of complete rest followed by a graduated return to play.  Following discharge we give the patient an appointment to return to a dedicated concussion clinic for an evaluation and further instruction about returning to play.  That works now.  It is labour intensive and needs more research.  It would be great to see support and funding for that type of initiative to enable us to get some hard data.  If successful it could then be transferred to, and reproduced in, other emergency departments.  My main points in regard to emergency medicine are the need for more information through research, for support for the public awareness campaigns and undergraduate and postgraduate education, particularly within emergency medicine.</p></speech>

I have spent much of my life examining the consequences of head injury in patients who have been unfortunate enough to die.</p><p>  At the far end of the spectrum is chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  This condition has been around for over 100 years.  It was recognised in the 1920s in boxers when its pathology was described.  It has received enormous publicity recently because it has been recognised in a group of American professional football players.  There have been other individual cases described in a rugby player and individuals from other sports.  The pathology is one of progressive loss or death of nerve cells in the brain and the accumulation of a particular protein called tau.  The filaments in the nerve cells are like fingers of asparagus tied in a bunch with string.  They move down along the nerve cell over time.  The string is known as tau.  In patients with chronic traumatic encephalopathy the tau becomes abnormal.  It changes shape, accumulates phosphate molecules and the process of supplying the far end of the nerve cell fails.  The patient then develops a dementia which is progressive over time, characterised by behavioural changes, impulsivity, suicidality and so on.  The diagnosis can be confirmed only at autopsy.  The key question concerning all these sport-related concussions is whether repeated concussions over multiple periods of time result in chronic traumatic encephalopathy.</p> <p> The scientific evidence is entirely anecdotal.  There have been no prospective longitudinal studies conducted on players with established baselines before they become concussed and examined afterwards with a variety of different biomarkers and followed long enough to see whether they develop this condition.  That is where we are at.  Nobody has been able to come up with a study.  We tried to design one ourselves involving the rugby football unions from a number of countries.  The study would be enormously expensive but it is doable.  It is doable because of the willingness of the rugby football unions and other sporting bodies to support the study.  It requires new biomarkers of concussion to see how long an individual patient takes to return from concussion.  We have all the return to play guidelines but we do not have really good biomarkers either in the blood, radiological or otherwise that would allow us to say one's brain has completely returned to normal and one is free to return.</p><p> We know there are individuals who are genetically or otherwise prone to concussion and that there are individuals who never get concussed.  One hears people talk about boxers who have a glass chin, one blow and he is down.  There are all these individual variations from person to person in one's susceptibility or resistance to concussion and that may or may not have a bearing on whether, in the long term, one gets chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  From my point of view the condition exists, it is interesting, it is difficult to diagnose even pathologically with a brain in front of one, because one can never be sure that the patient did not have a gene that was disregulated, the code for tau, that perhaps this patient who got repeated blows was genetically predisposed to get a dementia related to tau, of which there are many.  The science is dirty, the data is dirty, there is no data, there is no scientific data, all we have is anecdote and, unfortunately, that is the way it will continue.  </p><p> The upside of all of this is that the publicity attended to chronic traumatic encephalopathy has resulted in all of the sporting bodies paying increased attention to concussion in its diagnosis and management.  That can only be a good thing for players who now realise it is not natural to go back on the pitch having had a concussion, or to hide one's concussion symptoms.  One is not doing one's team any favour, one must stay off the pitch and wait until one is better.  That is filtered down to all levels to schools and so on.  Yes, more can and will be done but in respect of the dramatic outcome in some footballers and some Rugby players there is no scientific evidence available and studies need to be done.</p></speech>

As I had some visuals for the committee that is the reason it would not transfer, so my apologies.</p><p>  I have been invited to appear before the committee as director of sports and exercise medicine at the Sports Surgery Clinic but I have my feet in a number of camps with regard to concussion.  I represented Ireland internationally in boxing and would have been one the people mentioned earlier with the glass chin.  From a professional perspective I look after the Irish senior rugby team and the Irish Amateur Boxing high performance unit, both sports have been linked and will continue to be linked to concussion.  In my day job at the Sports Surgery Clinic, we look after some of the jockeys for Dr. Adrian McGoldrick's excellent programme which manages concussion for the turf club.  We look after three groups and the general public on concussion.</p><p>  I wish to speak on concussion and echo my fellow speakers who have made excellent presentations, which are well thought out with moderated approaches which, unfortunately, in the debate around concussion is not always the case.  Any publicity on this topic is good.  We will take the good with the bad.  Raising public awareness and making parents, athletes and coaches more aware of issues around concussion is always positive.  We need to do our best to keep this topic in the limelight.  I commend the committee on having such an in-depth look at the process over the next couple of sessions.</p><p>  Concussion is a multi-sport global issue.  It is not an Irish problem, a rugby problem or a boxing problem, it is in many sports all over the world.  It is an emotive health concern and, as Dr. Michael Farrell said, the science is of a very poor quality.  We have serious causal difficulties in what we say in and around areas such as chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  I echo the point in respect of tau protein.  Tau protein as well as being present in CTE is a natural protein that is seen in aging.  Anybody who is over 50 years of age will probably have some tau protein in their brain on autopsy, thankfully I am not there just yet.</p><p>  We have to know where we can differentiate out between what is a natural process and what is a traumatic process.  The only way we can do that is to structure proper longitudinal studies.  To date we have not been able to do that and it is something we need to progress towards.  We have to ask ourselves a number of questions around concussion.  We do not know more than we know in and around concussion.  We do not even know the parts of the brain that are affected.  Professor Michael Molloy mentioned functional MRI.  Thankfully, things have moved on slightly more.  There is now diffusion weighted scanning and also connectivity scanning which shows the traps in the brain that are affected when there is a concussion and allows us to look at people in real time and, nowadays, tell some information in and around the concussion.  It remains a clinical diagnosis but we have some better imaging that we can look at nowadays that we did not have previously.  </p><p>  Similarly, it is vital to create a number of screening programmes where we take baselines in targeted populations in, say, the population of boxers, the population of Rugby players, the population of non-contact athletes, and follow this group longitudinally over a period, looking at their psychometric analysis and biomarkers.  Biomarkers are an interesting area in that their blood tests will potentially show injury to cells in the brain and something we can follow up.  The work in that area is evolving.  Therefore, the work here would be in and around longitudinally following a group but taking blood samples from that group on a yearly basis and storing those samples so that in five or six years' time if something shows up that is a biomarker that may be of use, we have the serology available to go back and revisit that to see if it is present.  If we have something that is gradually increasing over time, this may be a useful marker for us to use but we must have the samples to do that.</p><p>  Similarly, we need to look at biomechanics.  The biomechanics of how head injury occurs is still poorly understood.  We need to look at impact biomechanics, for example, the use of helmets, protective equipment and so on.  We also need to look at detection strategies such as genetics susceptibility, the APOE gene.  There is a group of people in society who will have a concussion with a much lower head contact than people without.  Screening for that at the moment is a slightly problematic area but I imagine it will be done in the future, where we can advise people on their risk of developing concussion.  There is a unique possibility here in regard to research as there is good data to show that university based research takes about 15 years to get from the university to the patient.  There is a big delay in how that happens.  There are a number of reasons for that but where there is expertise in terms of research one does not have patients.  Generally, where there are patients, as Professor John Ryan said they are very busy and, therefore, it is very difficult to conduct research, but busy clinicians are the people who can ask the hard questions in and around dealing with injuries and illnesses. </p><p>  I work at the Sports Surgery Clinic in Dublin, Ireland's largest private orthopaedic facility.  Since its inception in 2007, more than 150,000 patients have been through the premises.  We have a very large sports medicine department with five sports physicians working there.  It is the largest of its kind in the country.  We look after a number of groups who are prone to these problems.  Due to the throughput of patients and our interest in looking at this, we are launching a research foundation at the facility aimed at answering some of the hard clinical questions.  The reason it is important to look at this is that concussion is a global problem.</p> <p> With regard to research in the clinical issues around the world, it has been highlighted that many small groups are undertaking small projects.  Pulling it all together becomes quite difficult.  International collaboration is the way forward in terms of big problems like this where we need to gather proper longitudinal data.  It is difficult to gather this kind of data where a small group in a small population is involved.  It becomes very expensive and very difficult.  If you have groups from around the world working together, pooling their resources, pooling their information, big numbers would be quickly gathered.  Similarly, Dr. Farrell mentioned looking at all the rugby unions.  Spreading this beyond rugby -  if other countries and groups were also included - would be one of the ways forward.  The research foundation being set up will look at a group of areas, one of which is brain health.  The programme on brain health would gather a group of internationally recognised experts in the area.  We have invited a scientific board who will attend in November. Among those invited is Professor Paul McCrory who would have been involved in the publication of many of the papers circulated to the board today.  He has over 400 publications on concussion.  Steven Blair who works for the centre for disease control in the States will also attend.  He has over 600 publications on the epidemiology of injury.  Lars Engebretsen from the International Olympic Committee will also attend.  He has over 400 publications.  These are world leaders in cutting-edge concussion research who are working in large groups and pulling all the information together.  Rather than reinventing the wheel, we are hoping to plug into information already available and expand upon work already done.  </p><p> Further on from what was stated by Professor Ryan, we would like to look at developing proper concussion clinics where patients with concussion attend and are not only diagnosed but are rehabilitated.  One of the issues raised at the recent Faculty of Sports Medicine &amp;amp; Exercise meeting was that concussion is one of the only injuries where we tell patients simply to rest.  There are very few injuries where we tell the patients to rest and do not do anything else to help make them better.  At the moment, we have very few tools to help people get better.  In the US, dealing with concussion is a big industry . People are out of work and so forth because of this.  Methods to improve the situation - there are some methods - need to be researched and examined properly.  A centre which conducts high level research is a perfect tool to educate.  We need to educate clinicians. This can be seen on a regular basis.  We need to educate doctors, physiotherapists, team trainers, coaches and individuals on this issue.  </p><p> A centre of excellence gives a focus point for much of that.  It provides a focus point to develop a screening programme and proper neuro-imaging.  This would allow us to move on from functional MRI to fusion tensor imaging and mapping, or connectivity, where the tracks in the brain are viewed live and differences or changes in these can be seen.  This is prospective work which needs to be done in a healthy population and then in an unhealthy population.  One of the issues - which is difficult to separate from the research available - is headlines which state, for example, 20 American football players have developed CT.  We have no idea how much of the normal population has this problem.  If 2,000 people in the normal population were sampled, we do not know if some of them would have similar problems.  Until we get proper baseline data, we cannot make a comparison.  We run the risk of jumping to conclusions.  It is, as Dr. Farrell stated, poor science.  Anything that raises the profile of concussion is good but we need to do it in a scientific fashion.  We do not want to draw false conclusions.  Similarly, looking at impact, I have a video clip of the Honda laboratory in America which I had hoped to show. Honda are researching how to protect pedestrians when they are struck by cars.  They have crumple zones in the cars. If a person is struck by a car at less than 30 km/h, the person has a chance of surviving.  A crash test dummy is struck by the car and is thrown 10 m when hit by the car at 30 km/h.  </p><p> I would show a video alongside that of a collision in Australian rules football where one footballer runs into another at 54 km/h.  The player who is impacted is on the ground and is having a post-concussive seizure.  The other player gets up and runs off.  These are real problems.  These are major traumas.  We need to look at the impact of that.  Professor Andrew Macintosh in the University of New South Wales has experimented with crash test dummies.  He uses these to test, for example, helmets in boxing and American football.  It is a Hybrid III concussion bio-mechanics model.  This is very useful.  We are looking to engage with Professor Macintosh so that we can use this information rather than trying to recreate it.  We hope to tap into what the information he already has and to house some of his material and equipment and do some prospective work ourselves.  </p><p> To recap, our primary goal in terms of concussion has to be education.  We need to use any publicity available including opportunities like that available today -  it is good to see members of the press here today - to highlight the problem and make people more aware of it.  We need to set up an international centre of excellence and tap into people and a scientific advisory board with more than 2,500 PubMed citations and more than 1,500 publications on concussion alone. These are the types of people we need to engage to push this issue forward.  We need to examine longitudinal population studies and follow groups over a long period of time. This needs to be done in a fashion where we can gather as much information as possible so that, down the line, when we need to draw inferences we are drawing them safely.  It would be worthwhile looking into impact bio-mechanics and seeing if there is anything we can do to protect people who are getting these contacts.  Gene-type analysis is an area of serious growth.  So is the area of biomarkers.  These are blood tests which, in the future, may help us to track someone's recovery from an injury.  Advanced neuro-imaging, which we mentioned earlier, will be an area where we are going to see advances in the near future.  We are working with the Hotchkiss Brain Institute in Calgary, Canada and the Florida institute in Melbourne, two of the world-leading concussion research centres.</p></speech>

We now move to questions from members.  I call on Deputy Billy Kelleher.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.608" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014100200007#F00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  I welcome the witnesses and note that the session was very informative.  At the outset, there are two real issues.  One is what happens on a local pitch, basketball court, American football pitch or ice-hockey pitch. Then there is the broader issue of how we collate all our data and statistics to have a long-term strategy on this issue.  The biggest problem is to take action without having any detailed research.  It may lead to conclusions that may not be correct.  This could damage the sport itself.  People participating in sport and parents may be anxious about a potential threat to their families or children playing sports.  It is important to keep things in perspective and to act with the proper research and science.</p><p>  I have played a little hurling and football.  I never had a concussion.  I would try to stay away from the physical activity as much as I could and let the other players get involved in the messy side of it.  There is huge pressure on team doctors and the local coach. They are looking into the eyes of the best player and the player is a bit starry-eyed but he might run it off after five minutes.  There is huge pressure at local level.  At a professional level, it is obviously very different.  The local team doctor will have an emotional involvement in the issue as well.  He is probably the local everything.  That is a key issue.  A clinician makes a decision in the interest of the patient. However, he may also be taking into account the interests of the team.  I am wondering if that is an area where we might need a stronger focus in terms of giving people the confidence to say concussion is an issue that can have prolonged implications on a person's health. It is not just for five or ten minutes while the player is running around the pitch running off that particular concussion.  That is something that happens on a daily basis.</p><p>  The broader issue raised by the speakers concerns prevention.  Nowadays watching an All-Ireland hurling match, it is hard to believe that there was a time 30 people would take to the pitch without a helmet between them and it was permitted.  Is there detailed research - perhaps in American football which would be a very high impact contact sport - on helmets?  Where do we draw the line?  People will argue that impact collisions are equally as high for people wearing helmets.</p> <p>At what point do we have to drill down through the simplistic assessment that one can avoid concussion by wearing a helmet?</p><p> On the longitudinal studies, it is difficult for a small country like Ireland, with a population of just over 4 million, to gather data at the scale required for detailed analysis.  I realise there is a considerable throughput at Dr. Farrell's sports clinic but we also need to collaborate internationally.  The best way to do this is through medical organisations but it can also be done at governmental level.  It does not always work to get governments involved in matters but the populations of countries like Australia, the United States and New Zealand are strongly committed to sports, and could offer opportunities for collaborative approaches.  This could also be done at EU level.  I imagine that considerable co-operation would be required to complete longitudinal studies because they would be logistically difficult without a commitment at some other level to assist in the studies.</p><p> We should be careful to avoid discouraging people from taking up sports when we discuss these issues.  One often hears people say, for example, that they do not want their sons to play Rugby or to play in certain positions.  Clear training programmes should be developed for coaches and even clinicians at local level.  Every Saturday and Sunday in the parishes of this country, injured players are going back onto pitches pretending that they are not seeing stars and the local coach or GP might say they can run it off in three or four minutes.  Perhaps sporting organisations need to given the confidence to encourage coaches and GPs to tell players they cannot play when they are concussed.</p></speech>

We need continuous and ever increasing attention to the issues we are discussing, and I hope they will help us in that regard.  We are meeting the witnesses in our role as legislators.  Do they believe there is any legislation that we should consider or are there specific steps that the Houses of the Oireachtas could take to enhance standards, adherence and other matters?  I do not know if they have given consideration to that issue but it would be helpful if there were particular actions they asked us to consider.  In regard to safety improvements or measures, do they believe further improvements could be made in terms of the standards of safety equipment and other instructions that could be introduced to participants across a wide discipline of sporting activities?  A question that immediately comes to mind in is whether they believe satisfactory standards apply to headgear across the various sporting activities, such as hurling, cycling, football, boxing and horse racing.  What is the situation regarding compulsion in these sporting activities?  Is compulsion the order of the day for the sporting bodies overseeing these activities and is this something in which we might have a role to play as legislators?  Are there particular areas of resistance to the commonsense advice that the witnesses in their collective professional experience would give?  Is there resistance from the sporting bodies and, even, individual players?  One can understand why there may be resistance in the heat of a game or a contest.</p><p>  I beg the witnesses' pardon if I missed their comments on the issue of repeat concussion, the consequences of which can be serious.  Do we have statistics on the incidence of concussions across the various sporting disciplines?  It can and, all to sadly, does happen, with serious consequences.  In regard to special awareness and care for children and adolescents, Professor Molloy highlighted the benefits of rest for brain development and concentration.  If one is lying back on the couch, one may still be exercising one's brain with a video game or other technology.  This is a message that should go out.  Lying back does not mean one's brain functions are resting.  Dr. Ryan recommended a return to school first for children and adolescents, with sporting activity to follow later.  Are there rules of thumb in regard to the period of time that should govern the programmed return to full and normal activity?  Can we demonstrate that not only for the medical profession but also for parents who are keen to know more about how they can support their children?  I am not familiar with SCAT3 and welcome that Dr. Ryan referred to it.  Is this hospital based equipment and are comparable sideline tools available to confirm concussion while play continues?  Where are we in terms of technological advances across that area?  I thank the witnesses for their contributions and assure them this committee is anxious to play its part in imparting the critical information they have shared with us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1171" speakername="Jillian van Turnhout" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014100200008#G00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their interesting presentations on concussion in sport.  I had my own experience of concussion approximately ten years ago, although it happened through a simple slip on the bathroom floor rather than being connected to sports.  I went about my business for the day without realising what had happened but over the following ten days I became aware of the seriousness of concussion.  I was surprised at how much one could be thrown by it.  This was brought home to me again as I was reading documents in preparation for this meeting.</p><p>  Several speakers noted that we cannot draw conclusions which are not there and that we need to learn more about the issue.  I understand that but, in preparing for the meeting I read about the experience of the NFL in the United States, which appears to be ahead of us in this discussion, particularly when it comes to protocols.  In Ireland the team doctor seems to be responsible but in the US it is necessary to have somebody independent make the clinical decision.  Deputy Kelleher spoke about the emotional connection and the difference between a clinical decision and an emotional one.  I appreciate this is an evolving area in which we need to do further research.  </p> <p>However, I wonder whether things could be done to see how we could make changes.  This was brought home to me when I was researching for today's meeting and looking at experiences.  Brian O'Driscoll, who I am sure is a great hero to many of us, gave a quote last November when Dr. &Eacute;anna Falvey made the decision that he should come off.  He tweeted that he definitely would have tried to go back on but that was why the decision must be taken out of the players' hands.  I thought that tweet was highly honourable and it engenders a culture.  Several speakers have spoken of the importance of sport but for me, there is importance both in playing the sport and being honourable about making such a decision.  Moreover, there is nothing wrong with that decision to take off a player and perhaps more must be done to engender such a culture, whereby it is not a case of a player failing his or her team but is the reality of the situation in which he or she is and that the player's health must be put first.</p><p> In preparing for this meeting, I also encountered an issue that has not yet been mentioned.  I do not know whether there is a correlation or if it is a contributing factor but I am concerned about the bulking-up of players and of the greater use of the tactics of barging through.  This has been seen in rugby with professionalism but it also is evident in the GAA.  My colleague, Deputy McLellan, will undoubtedly raise several issues in that regard.  However, if one considers the increased reliance on putting on weight, I am concerned in particular about the promotion of protein products, such as creatine and so on, to those under 18 years of age in particular.  I must state I am both angry and annoyed that a province I support, namely, Leinster, is clearly associated with one such protein product in a leading sports shop.  This is telling children that it is good for sport and I have an issue with that because I wonder whether it is a contributing factor, through the type of play, which I have seen change.  I mentioned Brian O'Driscoll, who went on to state the current professional rugby players are guinea pigs for the current study and being those guinea pigs for that study is not a good place in which to be.  Is it necessary to talk sometimes about the nature of the change of play?  Is this a matter that should be discussed or perhaps it is completely unrelated?</p><p> However, having looked at sports and having spoken to many people in preparation for today's meeting, I believe there is a correlation that must be discussed.  I wish to hear a little more about this subject to ascertain whether members should be doing something about it or whether they should be raising awareness of it.  While it is necessary to have awareness at all levels, there is a particular role for the professional sports and the leading amateur sports to set the standards and best practice.  They should set out what is the ethos and culture when dealing with mild traumatic brain injuries and concussion.  They set the tone and the children pick it up from there.  I completely agree that education and training are needed but the children will look to what their role models will say.  In international rugby, for example, a culture almost has been promoted in which players are expected to shake it off after five minutes.  This should not be the case but I reiterate what Brian O'Driscoll and other rugby players have said, which is that this issue must be taken seriously and this is the way to do it.  More and more is being learned about concussion and I understand the need for longitudinal studies.  However, like my colleague, I ask whether there is a way which we can co-operate with other countries to ensure we have sufficient data to make it representative and that we are not using our players as guinea pigs for too long?  It is far too serious an issue.  Equally however, as Deputy Kelleher noted, we want young people to be playing sports.  Although we want them out there, I do not want them to have these protein products either.  I want them playing sports in the way it was intended.</p></speech>

What is the status in training or first-aid courses regarding awareness of identifying concussion and awareness of what to do when it is identified?  In many instances it will be the first-aid person, rather than a qualified medic, who will make many such decisions.  While there is a growing awareness of the whole subject of concussion, this is coming from a position in which there was not sufficient awareness of it.  How well has first-aid training moved in respect of having a level of skill in identifying concussion and knowing how to respond to it?</p></speech>

This was not something about which I had thought in depth but having spent several hours going over the presentations last night, they certainly provided food for thought.  They made me think about many issues pertaining to concussion about which I had never really thought previously.  The presentations make it obvious that clear protocols are needed to adhere to best practice.  I noted from the presentations issues such as the lack of neurosurgeons, the lack of science and funding, the need for further education and the science to recognise concussion, as well as how it should be treated.  In his presentation earlier, Dr. Falvey stated that proper concussion clinics were needed and that it would be necessary to set up an international centre of excellence.  This certainly is something towards which we must work.  America was mentioned quite a lot throughout the presentations.  Is it the model of best practice or should Ireland be looking towards another country?  It also struck me that although we have no national database of concussions in sport, I have to hand a table setting out Ireland's concussion rate per thousand playing hours, which goes from horse racing down to American football.  How are those data collated in the absence of such a national database?  Were such a database to be established, who would be in charge of it?  Who must ensure that these changes are made?  As for education, I note that Scotland has been to the fore by providing leaflets at school and club levels.  The leaflet advises coaches, teachers and parents on how to identify the signs of concussion and what actions to take.  It states, "If in doubt, sit them out".  Is this the type of education practice to which we should be adhering here in Ireland?</p><p>  I will turn to the recent all-Ireland football final at which, near the end of the match, there was a heavy collision with perhaps 20 minutes to go.  One player came off the pitch while the other remained on and played for approximately 20 minutes while concussed.  Reference was made to the sport concussion assessment tool, SCAT 3, and my question is, did anyone use it with this player?  Whose decision was it that he should remain on the pitch?  I ask this because from reading the presentations, I gather that somebody who is concussed is not the best person to make such a decision.  Should the referee have made that decision, should it have been the coaching staff or perhaps a qualified medic was available because it was an all-Ireland final?  However, if one then moves to football and hurling at a lower level or to weekday matches in which seven, eight, ten or 12-year-olds are playing, sometimes one might have a referee for the match but there will be no sideline officials.  It may merely be a parent who is taking charge and must such a parent have first-aid training?  Who should identify whether a child is hurt?  Whose responsibility is it if the child insists he or she is grand and wishes to play on?  Is it necessary to put into legislation the decision of whose responsibility it is?  I have one further point to make on rugby's five-minute concussion rule, which some people have stated is discredited.  Do the witnesses have an opinion in this regard and if so, perhaps they could expand on it?</p></speech>

One is the wearing of a helmet, which can be used as an offensive weapon.  In other words, one leads into a head to knock out or injure the other player.  Second, there are off-the-ball tackles in rugby which are not allowed in football.  An unsuspecting player can be gang-tackled by two or three people and one does not need to have one's head hit to be concussed; the mere rapid acceleration or deceleration associated with a tackle, for which one is not prepared, is what separates American football, in many ways, from rugby, football and other sports.  The first issue is that the helmet is used as an offensive weapon and the second issue is third-man-tackle or the off-the-ball tackle by one or two other players on an unsuspected player.</p></speech>

The evidence, particularly in the sport of rugby, around scrum caps shows that they will protect the scalp but not the brain.  There is anxiety in some circles that it may give younger children a false sense of security, allowing them to lead with the head and use it as a weapon because it is now protected.  The structure one wants to protect is the brain inside of it, but what one is protecting is the scalp.  In some sports the weight of a heavier helmet may put an abnormal torque on the neck and even put the neck at risk.  There are studies evaluating the true benefits of protective head gear in sport.</p></speech>

It is the scalp that is being protected, not the brain.  The need for improvement in this area and greater awareness at pitch side is necessary.  We must realise that the majority of people getting head injuries in sport occur among a group of weekend warriors and school children for which this country does not have the capacity to provide a medic or even a paramedic or an allied health carer.  We need to drill down that education to coach and parental levels.  That is certainly the case in the sport of rugby.</p><p>  A Deputy mentioned that Scotland has produced leaflets.  The work done under the SAFE Rugby programme by the IRFU is fantastic.  They have gone out to the clubs and schools.  I know that even this year one school had 45 members of its coaching and teaching staff attend a weekend course on the management of pitch side injuries, including concussion.  That has made a difference particularly during the past 18 months.  As a consequence of that we have seen in our emergency department a greater awareness by parents in terms of the people presenting with those injuries needing to be assessed.  We are seeing that but more needs to be done.  We are aware of the legislation around child abuse, the need for Garda clearance and so on, and rightly so, and perhaps the legislative route is a way to make sure that parents and those coaches who are involved are up to date with, as Deputy Neville said, the-----</p></speech>

I am a little nervous that a concern about the consequences of the introduction of legislation might result in the withdrawal of volunteerism upon which sport in this based.  We have seen a shrinking in the level of volunteerism in the past decade and we need to be careful we do not do further damage in that regard.  Legislation is certainly one option.</p></speech>

I am not referring only to the IRFU.  Professor Molloy touched on the point that the IRFU should be commended on the way in which this year in particular it has involved the referees in this respect.  I have met a few referees who have spoken about how they have been asked to become more aware of this.</p></speech>

There is the issue of how we can get the statistics for those with head injuries.  That data are collected by individual sporting bodies and they need to make the reporting of injuries sustained to players mandatory and collate the data that way.  Having a central database collection from all the sporting bodies would give us true national figures of where we are at with head injuries.</p></speech>

If there is a situation one can envisage that increases the risk of the injury, then one has to consider that.  First, there is the sporting bodies and if they do not take it on, then somebody else needs to, but the sporting bodies have a major role to play.  I was involved in the past with the International Rugby Board, IRB, and I was one of the signatories to the concussion statement issued in 2008.  The IRB then had a responsibility.  It took two years to draw up the documentation and it took ages to get consensus because there were many differing views on it, but eventually the IRB put together a package that all the other countries use and it was translated into seven languages at the time.  The biggest users of it were the Chinese and they do not play much rugby.</p><p>  There is a need for the sporting bodies, for example, in a sport like rugby where there is a good deal of head contact, to give this issue serious consideration.  Perhaps we should add to that the question on the bulking.  That is the problem.  The bigger the players are, the bigger the collision, and the wearing of helmets comes into that.  Helmets do not protect players from concussion, that is for sure.  Even in American football where they have specially adapted helmets, it does not work, but it does prevent, as Professor John Ryan said, injury to the face and fractures.  I think equipment in the helmet is now used to measure the contact force.  Dr. &Eacute;anna Falvey will mention this when he speaks shortly but the contact force on the head can be measured by using equipment in the helmet.  It does not protect one but gives a false sense of security and for children in particular, it should be outlawed.  In rugby it does protect the player's ears.  I know from my experience that if one did not wear it in the forward position one's ears would look like those of Dr. Spock.</p><p>  The other question raised was on who decides in this regard.  The medical person on the day has to make the decision.  I would go further, and my colleagues would agree with me, by saying that it has to be a decision that is made instantly, without dependence on the sports concussion assessment tool, SCAT.  We have copies of the SCAT if members want it.</p></speech>

I was part of the original group that set that up.  This is an updated version.  It is critical that the person makes the decision quickly and that the player comes off the pitch.  This is only for professional sport, and that is the majority.  There is a need to train people in first aid, and this is where we have a major responsibility.  First aid courses are available.  The faculty has a special emergency care programme for doctors, physiotherapists and others, which Dr. Padraig Sheeran will speak about shortly, where the participants go through a programme and are then certified.  There must be certification.  If we take New Zealand as an example, as others did, it has specific requirements.  The Government in New Zealand is the insurance company also.  Even when it hosted the Rugby World Cup it had to insure that event.  The coaches, the referees and the teachers have to be certified in first aid every few years.  That is necessary.  If any legislation or direction comes forward here, that is on what it should be focused.</p></speech>

Helmets work well in hurling because heads are protected from cuts and so on.  Dr. Falvey and I were involved in publishing a paper on this some years ago and he might speak to that.  They work but they do not protect people from concussion.</p><p>  When it comes to recreational sport, it is everybody's responsibility.  For example, we asked the people at the desk on the way in how often the defibrillator has been used because things get a bit hot in here sometimes.  It has never been used but it is important to have people trained in its use.  The Department of Education and Skills decided some years ago that everybody doing a gap year in secondary school should do first aid training.  I gather that is happening and the HSE has pushed that.  That is important in order that everybody has that skill.</p><p>  My experience of playing amateur rugby in the UK, which goes back too many  years to mention, was that the game could not start unless there was a first aider on the sideline.  My wife ended up doing it because she happened to be medically trained.  Somebody trained in this regard had to be present before the game started and we need to adopt that.</p><p>  The sideline concussion assessment tool, SCAT, works exactly the same way for recreational activities and it has been written specifically for lay people.  The child SCAT is for children because they are a particularly vulnerable group.</p><p>  The bulking problem is a worry.  We are conducting studies on protein, exercise and health in the general population and protein is an important part of that.  We are not talking about the people dosing themselves with large amounts but protein, exercise and well-being is a well established combination.  Dr. Falvey is involved with us in the study.  We have shown this combination both in professional and amateur sport but bulking is a worry.  Some years ago, patients got the Irish Sports Council to drug check some of the children because they were concerned about them.  That is happening and it is a protection.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout asked about compulsion but it is difficult to answer that.  All the sporting bodies should be specific about having trained personnel available.  The officials, in particular, should be trained because that covers a large number.</p><p>  Professor Ryan referred to volunteering and he is right that volunteers are needed but the well-being of the athletes surpasses anything else and most people approached to take on the responsibility are happy to learn first aid.  It is a good skill.</p></speech>

As a consultant in the children's hospital in Crumlin, my main area of concern is management of concussion or evolving brain injury and major injury in schools.  Every parent wants to know that his or her child is as safe as he or she can be and parents want to know that their child has the right to suitable advice, equipment and medical support if something goes wrong.  Currently, there are no national structures or guidelines in our schools.  Concussion is difficult to detect in adults and because of differences in anatomy and physiology, it is even harder to detect in children.  We have had initial meetings with Dr. Miriam Owens in the Department of Health and Mr. Seanie McGrath in the Department of Education and Skills to initiate protocols and guidelines which will have to be compulsorily placed in schools and if we can do this, we hope there will be a positive effect on children's GAA and mini-rugby on Saturdays and Sundays.  If we can have firm guidelines in schools, they will, hopefully, have a knock-on effect in clubs and that will involve the sporting bodies.</p><p>  We do not have to reinvent the wheel.  For example, South Africa's guidelines - BokSmart - involve two people being consistently present to address playing field injuries and they are referees and school teachers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.633" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. &Eacute;anna Falvey" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014100200011#K00400"><p>I thank everyone for their questions.  Deputy Kelleher asked about the longitudinal studies.  Even though it is a small country, Ireland has an ideal set up for performing this research.  We are a small country and our geography allows us to gather data on groups reasonably well.  We are well set up in that we do not have many centres spread out all over the country.  We have a number of centres to gather data.  I agree we need to collaborate with international groups and if possible it would be better again to do so at governmental level, if this was possible.  One wants to pool as much data as one can as early as one can to gather the information quickly and I echo that fully.</p><p>  With regard to helmets, the concept is risk compensation.  We all have an acceptable level of risk and if we do something that makes us feel less at risk, we will undertake more risky behaviour.  This is an established fact.  If one puts a helmet on a child, he or she will feel there is less risk involved and, therefore, they will go for a ball in hurling or into a tackle in rugby.  There is, therefore, a side effect.  We need to be extremely careful in legislating for safety equipment to ensure, first, it is doing its job and, second, it is not causing unexpected consequences.  We must be careful that the standards relating to the equipment are met.  There are stringent guidelines for that.  Dr. Paddy Crowley has done the research on the micro helmet and he has shown the evolution of head injuries in hurling as a result of helmet use.  However, strict guidelines have to be adhered to in the manufacture of helmets as a result.</p><p>  Good studies have been done on protective helmets.  In Australia, the use of bicycle helmets in cycling was analysed and over a ten-year period during which extensive money was spent on education and advising people on health risks, the use of helmets increased from 20% to 32%.  Legislation was introduced and helmets became mandatory.  Helmet use increased from 32% to 95% in one year.  There is, therefore, definitely a role for legislation; it just needs to be directed and informed.  We need to be careful of jumping in with legislation but doing the right stuff with the strength of legislation behind it could be powerful.</p><p>  I echo Professor Ryan's comments on compulsion.  Making it compulsory to do anything means we could potentially lose volunteers but there is a gap for a body such as the faculty of sports medicine to step in and help to provide a basic first aid set up that can be delivered.  This is usually done by sports and rugby is doing a good job at the moment.  Referees are all indoctrinated now in concussion management while all coaches involved in the AIL this year have to partake in the course before being allowed to be involved.  That is obviously at a higher level but significant education is not needed for this to filter down to the grassroots.  The SCAT tree can be used on the sideline.  If one not is medically trained, this tool will help one decide whether one should sit the person out.  If one is medically trained, one can make the call but if one is not, this tool can be used if one is worried about a player.  It is easy to use and we could educate people about it easily if there was an initiative and support.  Perhaps this could be legislated for.  If one is involved in a team, it is important that one, for example, takes an online module.  I urge members to go the IRB's website because it contains a good module on how to complete the SCAT tree for non-medical people.  One reads it and then one is asked a few questions to make sure one has read it.  That could easily be done.</p> <p>It is low cost and with some support it could be very effective.  We need to not just educate the players and the coaches, but, to echo Dr. Sheeran's point, if we start at the bottom in schools, the change will become a fact.  I was cycling recently with my daughter and she asked me why someone was not wearing a helmet.  I struggle to wear a bicycle helmet because I did not use one growing up.  She takes it for granted that one does not get on one's bike without using a bicycle helmet.  If we start at the bottom, we will see change.  The schools' initiative is a really big one.</p><p> With regard to protocols, the doctor must be independent.  One of the biggest struggles when one is involved in a team is not being a fan but one is a person as well.  It is hard not to be a fan but one must try to be as impersonal as one can.  The nice thing about protocols is that much of the time it takes the situation out of one's hands.  If one follows the protocol and one is honest about it, then the protocol will do the work.  If one is worried about someone and one asks the questions such as whether the person is oriented in time and place or if he or she steady on their feet, one will remove the person if the situation dictates.  If one follows the protocol, it helps one to be as professional as one can be.  We need to see a cultural change.</p><p> In response to Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s question about players feeling like guinea pigs, it is important that research takes place.  It must happen in a professional setting as the required group of people are available.  The current players are guinea pigs in the sense that they have seen a dramatic change in rugby in the course of their playing careers.  The average forward is 10 kg heavier and the average back is 8 kg heavier than when they started to play rugby.  That is why there is a big change.  The protein supplement companies would be delighted to hear Senator van Turnhout&rsquo;s comments.  If it were true that just taking a protein supplement made one bigger, they would be really happy.  What is happening is that athletes are training much harder now.  Taking supplements help the process but if one just took a protein supplement without putting in any effort, nothing would happen.</p></speech>

That is too simplistic a way of looking at the issue.  That is marketing.  The companies would love to hear that it is the protein that is causing the players to get bigger.  The reason children get bigger is that from the age of 15 on players are involved in structured weight programmes.  In fact, there is good evidence to show that if one has a well-balanced diet with proper protein intake, that is every bit as good for getting big as taking a protein supplement.</p></speech>

I am the chief executive and co-founder of Acquired Brain Injury Ireland.  We set up the organisation 14 years ago to fill the gap in the provision of neuro-rehabilitation for people with a brain injury and their families.  Ms. O'Boyle has been responsible for our education and awareness programmes on concussion and is here to answer any questions the committee might have.  Mr. Macauley is our all-star ambassador and role model for our concussion campaigns.</p><p>  We are pleased to be recognised as a significant player in the high-profile debate on concussion that is currently taking place.  As stated in our written submission, we have to date carried out a number of activities and collaborations to raise much-needed awareness on the issue of concussion.  Only 10% of people who experience a concussion are actually knocked out.  That leaves 90% of concussions to be reported by the player, observed by the coach or the team doctor.  How can people observe something that they do not understand or do not recognise?  If one asks a player whether they have ever been concussed, most will say that they have not.  If one asks players whether they have seen stars, most will say that this has happened many times.  Players will admit to having thrown up after a match or having felt dizzy, but do not always relate that to the fact that they may have had a concussion.  That is why we need education and to implement agreed protocols to ensure that concussion is managed correctly on every playing pitch across Ireland and at every level, from grass roots to elite.  </p><p>  Concussion campaigners call for change in concussion education and guidelines, along with increased awareness among young players, coaches and parents in order to protect the safety and well-being of our sportspeople.  Acquired Brain Injury Ireland's concussion awareness and education campaign was driven from a grass-roots level at a local sports club, where it became evident that nobody knew what to do when a bang to the head happened.  It is that basic.  Knowledge, education and awareness of how to respond when a concussion happens should be available to all parents, coaches, and players in any sport.  We argue that it should be mandatory but unfortunately that is not the case, so concussion continues to be mismanaged or not managed at all, which puts our children and families at risk.  It is a manageable injury, but when it is not dealt with correctly it can be fatal.  Think of Ben Robinson.  He had a repeat concussion before the first concussion had healed.  This is seriously dangerous and often fatal.  We call for players to be removed from play if a concussion is suspected to prevent the possibility of second impact syndrome.</p><p>  I want to say a few words on concussion care pathways.  The abnormality of concussion is the same as with any brain injury, so we must start linking concussion with mild brain injury, making the role of a healthcare professional essential in monitoring a player through the rehabilitation process.  Players are being concussed every weekend of the year throughout the country but there are no specialist services available.  Dr. Ryan stated earlier that they have some concussion clinics scattered around the country but these services are not readily available and GP awareness is not there.  Concussion care pathways services should be available nationally in the public health service to anyone in need of a mild brain injury rehab following a brain injury.  No concussion is the same, so each one should be treated individually and cared for specifically.  </p><p>  Children require a particular mention because they are not small versions of adults; they are physiologically different.  What we call "return to play" guidelines for adults we call "return to learn" guidelines for children.  These must be implemented in schools for parents and teachers.  Return to learn should be facilitated by inter-disciplinary teams, made up of the coach, the teacher, the family member and the clinician.  I recently came across a young boy who returned to school the day after a concussion and was dribbling in class, completely disorientated.  He became a spectacle for his peers, who were laughing and joking at him, when really this boy was clinically suffering from a concussion.  </p><p>  We carried out a research project that found that 42% of GAA players who sustained a concussion reported that they had played on and did not remember any of the rest of the game.  These players are putting themselves at risk and must be educated about the dangers.  As we have called for in our written submission, a sustained national collaborative concussion campaign is required to bring together all involved bodies to outline best practice, education, messaging and protocols.  The sporting bodies have the information, but it is not enough for this information to be on a website or in a booklet.  It must systematically be put into protocols so that people are trained.  The Acquired Brain Injury Ireland ambassador and role model, Mr. Macauley, knows only too well what it means to be concussed, so I will hand over to him.</p></speech>

As a Gaelic player at both club and county level, I have suffered my fair share of concussions.  I know first-hand what it feels like.  I have both been knocked out cold and suffered concussions that left me dizzy and off-balance.  The reality is that one is no good to anyone on the field in that condition, yet sometimes players feel they know differently.  Players are their own worst enemies when it comes to handling concussion.  I am no stranger to injuries, as demonstrated by the fact that my arm is in a cast, and I knew last Saturday that it was time to come off when I could see my thumb was broken.</p><p>  However, brain injury is different.  We think that because we cannot see it it will be grand and we will stay on the pitch, even though we know inside that something is not right.  This comes down to the wire ethos within many sports, including the GAA.  It should be more than acceptable, it should be admirable to sit out after receiving a concussion.  A concussed player has impaired decision-making capacities and is in no fit state to make a judgement call on whether or not to remain on the pitch.  The coach or the management team must make the decision for the player to sit out.  It cannot be left in the hands of the player because as well as being impaired cognitively we are emotionally involved.  All any player wants to do is to finish the game to the final whistle, preferably on the winning team.  Do not leave the decision up to us; take us out of the game.</p></speech>

Before I start, Deputy McLellan earlier asked what country could be seen as a role model and I would recommend South Africa.  Twenty years ago Sports Concussion South Africa was set up by Dr. Jon Patricios and Dr. Ryan Kohler, who have now renamed it BokSmart.  This is a Third World country, yet every child in South Africa playing rugby has baseline concussion assessment.  Their website would be an ideal model for this committee to look at in drawing up their recommendations.  Having watched what has happened in the US over many years, as I attend the American college on an annual basis, it is my belief that we in Europe are at least ten years behind.  However, Irish different sporting bodies are not very far, if at all, behind their European counterparts.  There is still much more to do and I will address this at the end of my presentation.</p><p>  Concussion in sport has been the hottest topic in sports medicine for the last ten years, with more peer-reviewed articles published on concussion than on all other topics in sports medicine.  Some 90% of concussions occur in young athletes and recreational sportspeople, rather than elite athletes, so it is very important that we not concentrate on elite athletes; we must look at young athletes in particular and recreational sportspeople.</p> <p>The Irish Turf Club and the Irish National Hunt Steeplechase Committee view concussion extremely seriously.  We follow the most current evidence based, internationally accepted, best practice standards of prevention, identification, treatment and management of riders suspected of, or having been diagnosed with, concussion.  The presentation we have submitted to the committee touches on second-impact syndrome and chronic traumatic encephalopathy.  I think those aspects of the matter were dealt with adequately at an earlier stage of this meeting.</p><p> I would like to comment briefly on the incidence of concussion in sport.  We know from American figures that as many as 3.8 million concussions occurred in the US in 2012 during competitive sport and recreation activities.  This is twice the number of concussions reported in that country in 2002.  It is reckoned that as many as 50% of concussions may go unreported.  Given that the US has a population of 317 million, it is probable that between 2% and 2.5% of Americans suffer concussion on an annual basis.  Currently, there are no statistics available for the rate of concussion in sports and recreational activities in Ireland.</p><p> With respect to racing, I must point out that I am possibly unique in this area in so far as I am dealing with a very defined cohort of athletes - approximately 170 professional flat and national hunt riders and approximately 450 amateur riders, all of whom must be licensed on an annual basis.  Additional criteria in respect of baseline concussion assessment have been in place since 2010.  On race days, races take place every 30 minutes, on average.  This means we have more time to assess concussions than those involved with rapidly moving sports like Gaelic games, soccer and rugby.  There is a 15% fall rate in point-to-point racing and a 5% fall rate in national hunt racing.  This means there can be multiple fallers - perhaps ten or 12 - during each race.  We have to assess these riders quickly.  One of the conditions written into our rule book is that riders can be stood down for as long as it takes to assess them for concussions.  As a result, our doctors have to assess riders for concussions on a daily basis.  This leads to improvements in their skills.</p><p> The number of participants in racing has fallen in line with the decline in the economy.  We currently have approximately 40,000 runners per annum, with approximately 2,200 fallers over approximately 450 meetings.  We have approximately 290 recorded injuries per annum, of which 10% are concussions.  Therefore, approximately 1% of falls result in concussions.  My predecessor, Dr. Walter Halley, introduced concussion guidelines in 1991 in conjunction with Professor Jack Phillips of the department of neurosurgery at Beaumont Hospital.  The 1991 guidelines, which were based on the current knowledge of that time, provided that a rider with a concussion of a minor nature was stood down for two days, a rider with a brief loss of consciousness was stood down for seven days and a rider with significant loss of consciousness and amnesia was referred to hospital and stood down for 21 days.</p></speech>

I reviewed the 1991 guidelines following my appointment as senior medical officer in 2008.  Over the following 18 months, I introduced a new protocol based on certain documents, from the 1997 guidelines of the American Academy of Neurology up to and including the most recent consensus statement issued following the fourth international consensus conference on concussion in sport, which took place in Zurich in 2012.</p><p>  Our current concussion protocol involves baseline neuropsychological testing being carried out on all riders.  This is evaluated by one of a team of neuropsychologists retained by the Irish Turf Club.  When a rider has a fall, he or she is assessed by one of the doctors in attendance at the race meeting.  This assessment takes place not less than ten minutes after the injury is sustained, assuming no other more serious injuries have been sustained.  This guideline has been provided for on the basis that concussion is an evolving injury and cannot be diagnosed immediately following the fall.  The assessment involves six screening questions - the modified Maddocks questions - which are scientifically accepted as providing good baseline guidance with respect to concussion.</p><p>  If a rider fails to answer one or more questions, he or she then undergoes a detailed assessment using the third sport concussion assessment tool and a full neurological examination.  The doctor is then required to make a definitive diagnosis of whether the rider has suffered a concussion.  If the answer is "Yes", he or she is stood down for a six-day period.  Following this period, he or she undergoes a repeat neuropsychological assessment and an examination by a sports physician.  The neuropsychological assessment is compared to his or her baseline by our neuropsychologist, who then advises me accordingly, as does the sports physician.  If the rider fails either of these assessments, he or she is stood down for a further 14 days, after which he or she undergoes the same procedure again.</p><p>  At any time, I may seek a neurosurgical, neurological or neuropsychological assessment to assist me in making a decision on the management of the rider.  Baseline testing is done on all professional riders every two years and on all amateur riders every five years.  This is based on recommendations from our panel of neuropsychologists.  In the UK racing industry, only professional riders have baseline assessment testing carried out at present.  Since we introduced our protocol four years ago, we have had riders sidelined with concussion for periods varying from six to 12 months.</p><p>  The researchers spoke earlier in the discussion about what needs to be done in their area.  Work has certainly been ongoing in this regard.  I would like to stress that Professor Michael Gilchrist of University College Dublin is one of the leading biomechanical engineers in this field.  Nine years ago, the Irish Turf Club gave him funding to carry out instrumented helmet research on our riders.  I was glad to hear recently that he has received EU funding to continue his research along with Dr. Peter Helding from Copenhagen.</p><p>  With regard to racing, the current European helmet standard &ndash; EN 1384 (2012) - is a 1996 standard with the date updated.  Nothing happened to it in the interim.  There may be anecdotal evidence that helmets reduce concussion, but there is no scientific basis to support this hypothesis.  A new higher standard for equestrian helmets &ndash; EN 14572 - was introduced in 2005.  No helmets to this standard were ever produced, most likely because manufacturers did not try to do so.  After the standard was withdrawn in 2010, at Ireland's request, the fifth CEN working group on helmets for horse riders was directed to rewrite EN 1384.  Ireland took over the secretariat of the working group at that stage.  I commend the work of Ms Elizabeth O'Ferrall of the National Standards Authority of Ireland, who was the secretary of the working group.  She has done outstanding work with me, in my capacity as convenor of the group, over the last three years.</p><p>  It was agreed that a two-stage rewrite of EN 1384 would take place.  The initial stage involved an increase in the current requirements.  This was followed by the drawing up of a test for tangential impact.  This test was devised by the eleventh of the 12 CEN working groups that worked in the area of equestrian helmets.  We focused on the tangential impact test because most concussions occur from such impacts, rather than from direct impacts.  It is hoped to have this test completed within the next two years so it can be incorporated into the new standard.  This will, for the first time, provide a helmet standard that will have the potential to reduce concussion.  In the interim, the Irish Turf Club increased the minimum helmet standard with effect from 1 January last.  As a result, all helmets now have to meet the joint standards of PAS015 (2011), which is a much higher standard produced by the British Standards Institution, and EN 1384.  The British Horseracing Authority has agreed to do likewise and this took effect yesterday.</p><p>  I would like the joint committee to recommend that the minimum equestrian helmet standard used by those involved in other equestrian sports and by recreational riders should be raised to the standard we now use in horse racing.  I am not sure whether that can be mandated, but I would certainly like to see it recommended.  In racing, riders participate in a controlled environment in the presence of a minimum of two doctors and two ambulances with paramedical personnel.  By contrast, the vast majority of people participating in equestrian sports do not have any back-up.</p><p>  Education is the cornerstone of the general approach we must take with regard to concussion.  It is essential that education is provided to undergraduates and, more importantly, to doctors who diagnose and treat concussion.  I refer particularly to GPs, sports physicians and emergency medicine physicians.  This is being done through the faculty of sports and exercise medicine and the Irish College of General Practitioners.  Education of the general public, particularly coaches, parents and those participating in sports, is also essential.  This is being provided by the Departments of Health and Education and Skills, with input from sports physicians and Acquired Brain Injury Ireland.</p><p>  Reference was made earlier to what is happening in England and Scotland.  My personal feeling is that there is no point in educating coaches, parents and teachers unless we educate the doctors who take care of concussions.  Currently, the vast majority of GPs cannot diagnose or treat concussions.  We do not have the educational skills.  We are in the very early stages of the learning process.  It is important for this committee to send a clear message to the training bodies for general practice, which are at the forefront of concussion treatment, that they have an important role in educating GPs in this area.  The faculty of sports and exercise medicine has been very proactive in this approach and has held many seminars on this topic.  As I have said, we are in the early stages and much more needs to be done.</p><p>  Legislation was mentioned earlier.  We are all aware of the Zackery Lystedt law, which was introduced in Washington State in 2008 with respect to concussion in youth athletes.  Since then, all 50 states in the US have introduced variations on this theme.</p> <p>It has three basic tenets: a mechanism to inform and educate youth athletes and their parents-guardians about concussion; provisions to remove a youth athlete who appears to have suffered a concussion; and a requirement that a youth athlete must be cleared by a licensed health care professional trained in the evaluation and management of concussions before returning to practice or play.  While we would like to see this done on a voluntary basis, we should not rule out the need for legislation in the future if all of us fail to get our message through.  I would like to see the committee actively review this aspect in one to two years.</p></speech>

I have been medical director at the FAI since 2006 and have been working in football medicine for over 20 years at all levels.  Mr. Ruud Dokter, who is accompanying me today, is the high performance director at the FAI.<br/>Concussion is a brain injury and in its simplest form can be described as a disturbance of brain function.  It may be caused by either a direct blow to the head, face, neck or elsewhere on the body with an impulsive force transmitted to the head.  Concussion typically results in the rapid onset of short-lived impairment of neurological function that resolves spontaneously.  However, in some cases, the clinical picture may evolve over several minutes to hours.  This is a very important factor in how we manage concussion pitch side.  Concussion results in a graded set of clinical symptoms that may or may not involve a loss of consciousness.<br/>The majority, 80% to 90%, of concussions resolve in a short time over seven to ten days, although the recovery time may be longer in children and adolescents.  All contact sports have some risk of concussion injury.  Sport offers so many benefits to society but we do have an obligation to participants.  The most important aspect of the medical management of concussion, once diagnosed, is the timing of the return to play decision.<br/>There have been four international concussion consensus conferences held since 2001.  FIFA, F&eacute;d&eacute;ration Internationale de Football Association, our world governing body, along with the International Ice Hockey Federation and the International Olympic Committee, were the initial signatories to the conferences and subsequent consensus statements.  The most recent conference in 2012 further developed several side-line tools for use by medical professionals such as SCAT 3, sport concussion assessment tool, child SCAT 3 for ages 5-12 years and the pocket concussion recognition tool for non-medical people.<br/>Concussion is a clinical diagnosis and presents with a collection of symptoms and signs such as headache, dizziness, loss of balance, disorientation, confusion and memory loss.  If an athlete sustains a concussion or is suspected of sustaining a concussion they should be removed safely from the field of play and not be allowed to return to play on the day of the injury.  That is a key point to all involved in this area.  The final decision regarding a definitive diagnosis of concussion and/or the timeframe for a return to training or playing is a medical decision based on clinical judgment.  Concussion is ultimately a clinical diagnosis.<br/>It is worth noting conventional neuro-imaging, CT, computed tomography, or MRI, magnetic resonance imaging, is typically normal in concussive injury.  The cornerstone of concussion management is physical and cognitive rest until the acute symptoms resolve and then a graded programme of exertion prior to medical clearance and return to play.  Progress through the graded return to play is contingent on the athlete being asymptomatic as they move along the stages.  It is worth restating that no return to play should be allowed on the day of a concussive injury.  In the child or adolescent, it is recommended that no return to sport or activity should occur before the child or adolescent has returned to school successfully.<br/>There are no figures for concussion, not just for football but for amateur sport in Ireland.  UEFA, the Union of European Football Associations, has been actively involved in the whole area of sports injury research since 2001 involving 1,400 players and 26 professional football clubs.  It published the data from this study in the <i>Clinical Journal of Sports Medicine</i>in 2013.  It found there were 0.06 concussions per 1000 hours and head and neck injuries accounted for 2.2% of all injuries.  In the study, a 25-player squad would suffer an average of 0.4 concussions per season.  Accordingly, one can say football is a safe game.<br/>However, there is an important obligation on the players to obey the rules of the game and for referees to enforce them.  For the FIFA World Cup in 2006, a deliberate elbow was sanctioned with a straight red card resulting in a three-match ban.  This had a significant impact on head and neck injuries when compared to the 2002 World Cup.  Adherence to the rules by players and strict enforcement of the rules by referees may be an important aspect in the prevention of head injuries and subsequent concussions.<br/>The FAI considers all aspects of player health and safety to be of the utmost importance.  It first published guidelines on concussion in January 2010.  The most recent copy of summary guidelines approved by the FAI medical committee is included at the end of the written submission.  Our international team doctors and chartered physiotherapists, at all levels from under-15 boys and under-16 girls through to the senior teams, attend an annual medical seminar which includes the management of on-field emergencies including spinal injuries and the management of concussion.  Our League of Ireland team doctors and physiotherapists are now required, under the club licensing agreement, to attend an annual medical seminar which includes the management of on-field emergencies including the assessment, diagnosis and management of concussion injury or suspected concussion injury.  Under League of Ireland club licensing regulations, team doctors and physiotherapists are required at all games, along with the presence of an ambulance and crew.<br/>The FAI has a detailed child welfare policy which specifies that the health, safety and welfare of children is of paramount importance with each club having a designated child welfare officer.  The policy recommends that first aid should be available for all training sessions and matches.  Referees at all levels abide by the FIFA laws of the game.  The referee is empowered to stop the match if, in his opinion, a player is seriously injured, such as with a head injury, concussion, and ensures the player is removed from the field of play.<br/>It is goes without question that prevention is better than cure.  Recognising or suspecting a player has concussion is of paramount importance.  This requires education of all the stakeholders involved in the game.  Players have a significant role in the prevention of concussion by adherence to the rules of the game.  Coaches, likewise, have a role in the prevention of concussion too, as the style of play they choose for their team may influence the likelihood of a player sustaining a concussive type injury.  That is more a footballing matter and maybe an area I should avoid.</p> <p>At the core of the prevention, recognition and management of concussion is education and awareness.  All the stakeholders - players, coaches, team medics, referees, parents and administrators - need to be reminded to think with their heads and not with their hearts when making decisions on the medical fitness of a player who is suspected of or has sustained a concussion injury.</p><p> Concussion is not a common injury in football.  It is a very important injury, however, and requires recognition and appropriate management.  A lot of work has been done by the FAI on player welfare over recent years.  This work is ongoing, and the cornerstone of any further work in this area should be an ongoing education programme.</p></speech>

What are the next steps for ABII on the educational awareness side?  Who funds the organisation?  How much of Ms O'Connell and Ms Boyle's time is dedicated to fund-raising?  This is not specifically related to the issue at hand but I am curious to know how much time is wasted, so to speak, keeping the lights on rather than doing the work?</p><p>  For the witnesses in the football and sports medicine side, I was at an under-10s training session for the GAA recently, watching parents scolding children for crying when injured.  I did not know if there was a doctor around, although there were perhaps 200 or 300 children there on that Saturday morning.  Is there any onus on the GAA or the FAI to have a doctor present when training is taking place or, for the younger age groups, when a blitz rather than a one-off match is taking place? Are there any existing regulations which insist on this, or ought there to be ones?  I do not think there are.  We seem to have defibrillators everywhere now, thankfully.  Do we need to have a physician present every time we are playing any kind of contact sport, whether it is children or adults?  As Dr. Byrne mentioned, the League of Ireland has to have Civil Defence or Order of Malta on hand with an ambulance and personnel.  Does that need to be done?  I apologise that I will have to excuse myself after those answers.</p></speech>

I was struck by the fact that we have no national database for concussion.  How would this information be collated and who would be in charge of it?  Most sporting activity in Ireland is not supported by medical or paramedic expertise.  How can we change this?  Education is key, but who should be responsible for rolling out the awareness and education campaigns?  Should it be external organisations, the sporting bodies, the Department of Health or the Department of Education and Skills?</p><p>  Did Mr. Macauley, who said he himself played while suffering from concussion, take the SCAT3 test when he had concussion?  I refer again to the all-Ireland football final, when there was a serious collision between Jonny Cooper and Rory O'Carroll 16 or 20 minutes before the end of the game.  Johnny Cooper came off but Rory O'Carroll played on for the 20 minutes.  There is no doubt that a concussed player's decision-making is impaired.  Should a player be forced to leave the pitch?  Who is responsible for making this happen? Should it be the referee, a medic or a coach?  Should all referees, coaches and volunteers have first aid training?  On most weeks throughout the country it is coaches and volunteers who are taking part in under-age matches.  There will not be any medics in sight.  When it comes to these matches, the decisions are left to the coaches and maybe the referee.  Do they all know about SCAT3 and should it be mandatory?</p></speech>

We have learned quite a lot about the child SCAT3 in this discussion.  Is this in use and is it applicable to all the sports and sporting bodies we are talking to?  We have heard about the need for greater pitchside and trackside awareness.  We need to have a training programme for this.  We heard some references to different sporting bodies having a training programme.  Under the Healthy Ireland initiative, ABII suggested one training programme for all sports, especially for schools and school-age players.  I would like to hear more about the witnesses' views on this.  We heard about an example from South Africa called Boksmart which offers good guidelines to schools.</p><p>  When we are drawing conclusions based on these hearings, one conclusion should be about raising awareness, but we should also make sure we are not sending conflicting or separate messages.  My background is in youth work and girl guides, and we do a standardised first aid course along with other youth workers, because we are doing activities with young people.  In New Zealand there is certification for these types of courses.  Is that something we should consider?  I am trying to put on my hat as a policy-maker, legislator and influencer to try to see what we can do.  We have a role as legislators but we do not want to produce any unintended consequences in what we do.  On the issue of helmets, we see that in certain sports, mandatory helmets can lead to risk compensation whereby young people think they are invincible because they have a helmet.  This can lead to more injuries because they have this weapon.</p><p>  Do the witnesses have any pointers for us?  Are there areas where legislation is needed?  What are their views on having a combined training programme or certification level that would be available to all schools, coaches, parents who are actively involved and other youth workers and organisations, such as has been suggested by ABII under the Healthy Ireland initiative?</p></speech>

Do the witnesses believe adequate training is being provided by the people who are coaching younger people, in particular in school?  Is enough done to prepare the people involved in sporting activities in schools?  Where do the witnesses see the more serious deficiencies?  Although we have raised great awareness of farm accidents, there have been far more tragedies and deaths in that area this year than in any other year.</p> <p>Are we doing enough on this with regard to sport and where are the greatest deficiencies?  Is training provided to coaches in schools and clubs?</p></speech>

Rehabilitation after concussion is relatively easily dealt with in racing because those involved form a contained group of professionals and amateurs who all come under the auspices of the Turf Club.  A designated medical professional like me oversees them, but problems arise with those involved at a recreational level.  There is a massive deficiency in Ireland when it comes to neurologists, especially neuropsychologists, and if this committee could make representations to the Department of Health on this, it could be a major step forward.  One of the great problems facing people is access to a neurologist or, in particular, a neuropsychologist.  Assessment is almost impossible.</p></speech>

Concussions can be dealt with by people like me but in complicated cases, the Turf Club pays for riders to be assessed privately by a neuropsychologist, and not everyone can afford this.  The vast majority of concussions, some 99%, occur at the amateur level, and this is the area that needs to be addressed.</p></speech>

The vast majority of concussions in equestrian sports occur in the recreational area, and this is of major concern.  Regarding the presence of doctors, I cannot simply turn up to oversee a race meeting or GAA match.  I must inform my medical indemnifier that I am doing so.  This is mandatory or I will not be insured.  A doctor in such circumstances also must be trained to a level sufficient to cover the risks he or she is undertaking.  For example, in horse racing, doctors must undertake a one-day course every three years.  I was concerned when I heard recently that the Medical Council is considering mandating a three-day course for all doctors participating in sports activities.  If this goes ahead, there will be a risk that many sports will not be able to get general practitioners to oversee them.  Perhaps this committee could suggest to the Medical Council that a one-day course is more than adequate.  Most GPs cannot afford to take three days off in order that they can cover one or two point-to-point race meetings or GAA matches.  There must be a balance between what is appropriate and what is feasible.</p><p>  Doctors must be trained and must inform their indemnifiers, which is not as easy as one might think.  In terms of education, one small body cannot do everything.  The Departments of Health and Education and Skills and the sporting bodies have roles to play, and all are working together on education.  It is important to inform the public on concussion issues, but it is as important or more important that we educate the medical personnel who must diagnose and treat these injuries.  Educating the public and professionals must be done hand in hand.  There is no point in taking a child to a GP with concussion if he or she does not know how to diagnose and treat it.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy McLellan on the need for a database and that we require a survey that examines schools.  A model can be drawn up on what should be done using accident and emergency departments.  The suggestion relating to first aid training would be impossible for one body.  The Order of Malta, St. John Ambulance and other bodies do great work and I suggest we allow them to continue doing so.</p><p>  Senator van Turnhout mentioned legislation, and I have referred to this.  In the current climate we should not take this route first because we are a long way behind.  We must roll out an education programme on a voluntary basis and, if it is felt in two or three years that we did not succeed in this, legislation could be considered.  The laws introduced in the United States vary greatly and are not all adhered to, so I do not think legislation is the way to go.</p><p>  Senator Burke mentioned young players and education is the key to this as there is a massive information deficit on concussion and its management.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.681" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Alan Byrne" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014100200017#R00700"><p>I echo much of what Dr. McGoldrick said and, regarding rehabilitation at professional and semi-professional levels in football, doctors and physiotherapists play a very important role.  I agree with Dr. McGoldrick, as will anyone working in professional or amateur sport, that the difficulty is concussion symptoms in adolescents and young adults can go on for months and it is very difficult to access a neurologist or a neuropsychologist.  If a family does not have the necessary financial resources, it may not get such access for some time, and this is an important issue.</p><p>  There has been much talk of education, but coaches, players, referees and parents attend all matches.  I agree with Dr. McGoldrick that doctors must be educated in the management of concussion, and in an ideal world there would be a medical professional at all training sessions and matches, but I do not think this is practical, nor am I sure it is essential.  Coaches, players, referees and parents should become more aware of concussion.  It is very difficult for doctors to diagnose concussion, and this arose in the World Cup final, although I do not wish to highlight the highly experienced doctor involved, whom I know well.  Concussion is a difficult clinical diagnosis that evolves, so we should try to focus on people at grassroots level who may be in a position to take an affected child to a GP.  The GP will usually know such a child and can make a judgment.  If a referral is required, it can be done, although difficulty of access to a neurologist has been mentioned.  We can work towards educating GPs through the Irish College of General Practitioners and the faculty of sports and exercise medicine, but I feel this matter applies most to those who attend matches.  There is a significant voluntary element to sport at this level in Ireland and we must not discourage people from taking part.  The benefits we accrue as a society from sport are great.  I believe in the people who put up nets and wash the gear.  We can only raise awareness of concussion.  If people suspect concussion, they must seek appropriate medical attention.</p><p>  Schools are an area on which attention should be focused.  Many teachers are also coaches and all children must attend school, so this presents a great opportunity for it to be used as a forum where players can learn about concussion and teachers can be trained.  The SCAT3, the ChildSCAT3 and the pocket recognition tool were referred to.  The SCAT3 and the ChildSCAT3 are for use by medical professionals, and this is an important point.  They are good tools but they are quite complex and could put pressure on coaches.  The pocket recognition tool for concussion has the Maddocks questions to which Dr. McGoldrick referred.  The Maddocks questions form a series of questions to which everyone should know the answer such as, "Where are we playing today?  What is the score?  What was the score last week?" and so on.  These questions may raise the suspicion of concussion and the next step is to remove the player from the field of play and not allow him or her back on.  The player is handed over to a parent, guardian or responsible adult to seek medical advice.  The Maddocks questions form a simple tool.  I took a player off the pitch in the 1996 FAI cup final after 22 minutes and it was a straightforward case of concussion, but on other occasions one may not be sure.  A player may have received a kick in the head and may be bleeding.  One might ask him whether he wants to go back on the pitch.</p> <p>I have not met a player yet who does not want to play.  One is fighting against that, and Mr. MacAuley mentioned that.</p><p> It is a difficult diagnosis.  We cannot diagnose 100% of concussions.  Education starts at grassroots level, by disseminating information.  We recently sent our revised concussion guidelines to all our clubs and coaches, along with a short video.  That is the way to keep that message out there.  It is very difficult for one body to do that.  We work closely with our colleagues in rugby and in the GAA and outside of the medical profession also.  The focus should be on grassroots level.</p><p> Like Dr. McGoldrick, I do not think legislation is a good idea at the moment.  We have a lot of work to do before we get to that.  FIFA governs and makes the rules for football.  I am not saying legislation would not be a good idea down the road but it might be a difficult marriage at the moment.  To be fair, FIFA is reviewing what happened at the World Cup and has issued some comments.  It has empowered referees to empower doctors in a more significant way from now on in regard to professional sport, of course.  Initially, a referee would seek the advice of the doctor as to whether the player is concussed and needs to be removed from the pitch.  However, we should really focus our attention on grassroots level.</p></speech>

I work in general practice as well as in sports medicine.  Unfortunately, one needs to experience a few concussions to manage it.  Someone has to visit a doctor with a medical problem in order for the doctor to learn how to manage it.  One has to experience concussion.  There is a necessity to work in the area also but I think the Irish College of General Practitioners can play a huge role from the medical end of things.</p><p>  A lot of people put the pocket concussion recognition tool together.  I would not say there is one thing we should do differently.  We have plenty to do at the moment with what we have.  We could increase the resources we have as doctors, where we can send on our difficult cases of concussion.  A child or an adolescent may not be able to sit his or her junior certificate because he or she has been concussed, has had symptoms for the past six months and has been unable to go to school.  If we could get those difficult cases to the appropriate professionals, while at the same time educate those people who are at the coalface to raise the suspicion of concussion, we can then look to the next step.  However, we have plenty of work ahead of us.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.689" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Barbara O'Connell" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014100200018#S00800"><p>We took a very pragmatic and practical approach.  I was asked what rehabilitation services actually entail but I would like to bring members back to what a concussion is.  One can experience headaches and dizziness and people can get very depressed.  We are coming across many players who have sustained a number of concussions over time.  The rehabilitation services are for people who say they are forgetting things, they are disorganised and they are really moody.  We have heard players say they are sitting in dark rooms, due to light sensitivity.  Relationships are breaking down at home.  We need a multidisciplinary team to deal with that.</p><p>  Dr. Byrne mentioned the child who cannot go to school.  Acquired Brain Injury Ireland has the ability and knowledge to deal with those cases but not the resources to roll them out.  That is what is needed so that when people are experiencing those things, they have someone to help them.  A player who recently retired, and then spoke about his concussions, had difficulty going back to college because he could not organise his college notes and could not turn up to appointments on time.  A very practical and pragmatic approach is required which does not always require a neurologist or a neuropsychologist but which needs clinical input around counselling and occupational therapy.  It is not always about the physios or the medics; it is about the allied health professionals who are very pragmatic, the activities of daily living which people can no longer do as a result of repeat concussions, and social withdrawal and how that affects people's lives.  To answer the question on what we see as rehabilitation, it must go the whole way down the track.</p><p>  A member mentioned they fell and knocked their head.  If they suddenly thought they were not themselves and asked who would they go to, I would advise that they go to Acquired Brian Injury Ireland.  We do not have the resources but we have the knowledge.  I was asked what we can do.  There is a role for an organisation like ours to add on to the care pathway, following the clinical diagnosis and when it becomes a non-medical issue.  That is what a person who has experienced a concussion is looking for.  Specialist services, including psychology, behavioural therapy and family support, are needed.  If an elite player is not himself anymore and has become depressed, it affects the whole family, including the kids, so that help is needed for everybody.</p><p>  On the question about how Acquired Brain Injury Ireland could play a part, one area of our expertise is that we provide neuro-rehabilitation.  We are prepared to take a leadership role in assisting the Department of Health.  Our experience has been tremendous.  We deal with all of the sporting bodies.  We have been very successful in bringing everybody together and in pulling together the expertise.  I heard somebody ask at what country should we look.  I got really annoyed about that because we have the expertise here.  We know what to do.  That is why we have identified the Department of Health and the Department of Education and Skills to say we are going to pull everybody together.  It is not a one-size-fits-all but a series of agreed protocols and policies which would be rolled out and which people would know.</p><p>  We need to take in the added value of educating our children that trips and falls also cause concussion.  There is an added value there in training kids to recognise what a concussion is at a very young age, namely, that they are dizzy because they just fell.   </p><p>  We are producing very simple cards because people do not like carrying around little booklets and they are never there when they need them.  Basically, something very small which fits into one's wallet is required and which has some of the questions mentioned to hand if one is at the side of a pitch.  We have produced a number of easy things and we will launch an app next month, which will be accessible to parents and coaches.  It will have clinical guidelines, questions and answers for clinicians.  We have an expert group, of which Dr. McGoldrick is part.  An international expert group has helped us also.  Acquired Brain Injury Ireland can play a leadership role in assisting the roll out of that education and awareness.</p><p>  On a very practical level, a member spoke about the girl guides and the Order of Malta.  They all have really good training programmes.  Let us use what people have and just add on to it.  People will say they have another class to go to but information should be readily available and practical.  We are really teaching people to signpost.  One may be taking one's son home in the car and notice he is not really himself and he will say he does not feel well.  It is usually mums and dads who will identify something is not right and will ask what they should do.  It follows on that general practitioners need to be educated.  The care pathway needs to be in place.   We should start at grassroots level and make this something people know.</p><p>  As I said, we asked players who said they got sick after the match, if they knew it was a concussion.  They said "No" but that they did not feel right for a couple of days.  We are starting at that very basic level.  </p></speech>

Coca Cola sponsored a video, of which Mr. MacAuley was a part, that we made in conjunction with the GAA.  Covidien has sponsored our app.  We are at that level, so we need to be resourced properly.  It is ridiculous that we must ask outside companies for &euro;10,000 to do something.  We do not even have the necessary resources to send the approved material to people.</p></speech>

It is a cross-departmental issue.  As Dr. Byrne stated, it must start in schools, so it is an issue for the Department of Education and Skills, but it is also an issue for the Departments of Health, and Children and Youth Affairs.  I have been working on this campaign for four years, so we have a great deal of material and do not need to reinvent the wheel.  With combined expertise, supporting bodies and Departments, we can be successful.</p></speech>

I did not when I got concussed with three minutes to go while playing in a county final with my club.  The celebrations started, but I did not know where I was.  The problem is that the situation at club level is not the same as at county level.  Lads on our team who have been concussed this year underwent the SCAT3 test and were taken out of games.  It is a question of rolling the tests out from club to younger levels and ensuring that everyone can access the same facilities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-10-02a.698" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Darragh MacAuley" time="12:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2014100200019#T00800"><p>Yes.  Acquired Brain Injury Ireland has been working with the GPA on this matter.  In terms of the GAA, we saw the Rory O'Carroll incident in the All-Ireland final.  Obviously, he was in no state to play.  He could have been on a beach in Spain and he would not have known the difference.  There were no substitutes left, though, so he could not leave the pitch.  He was left to wander around it and was of no use to anyone.  Like blood substitutes, perhaps there should be something like a brain injury substitute.  It is not a matter for this committee, but perhaps the GAA should consider it.</p></speech>

With that, I thank all of our witnesses for their participation and attendance.  I also thank Mr. MacAuley for being the ambassador.  It is good that we have a high-profile sports person to be that voice and face.</p><p>  We will adjourn.
