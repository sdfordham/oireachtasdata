    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-17a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sean Coughlan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111700002#M00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before them again.  I welcome the opportunity to provide them with an update on progress and some technical aspects of the scheme from a breeding perspective.  Given that we were here just a few months ago, I will try not to cover the same ground again.  However, it might be useful to recap a little.  By way of background, the ICBF is an independent, industry-owned agency responsible for the generation of genetic evaluations for cattle in Ireland, and it is licensed by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We have attended the various farmer meetings around the country over the past couple of months and have fielded many queries and concerns on the technical breeding and genomics-related aspects of the scheme.  In that context and the context of the invitation to attend again today, I propose to cover some of the key issues from a breeding perspective, and my colleague, Dr. Andrew Cromie, and I will be more than happy to attempt to answer any questions asked.</p> <p>    The first question concerns the nature of the core issue in terms of genetic gain in the national suckler herd.  The reality in terms of the genetic gain in the national suckler herd is that farmers have done a very good job in increasing the genetic merit in the terminal, or meat, traits of their animals.  Unfortunately, these gains have been offset by continued decline in the maternal traits, concerning milk and fertility.  The current make-up of the replacement index is contained in figure 1 of my submission.  Members will see that the five key aspects are calving, feed intake, carcase weight, maternal milk, female fertility and, carrying some weighting, docility.  The key point is that genomics can bring to bear the ability to predict how animals will perform in the more difficult to measure and see traits of milk, fertility and docility.  When one looks at an animal, one cannot necessarily tell how well it will calve, its feed intake, the amount of milk it will produce or its fertility or docility levels.  One could have a good stab at guessing its carcase weight or other traits.  Unfortunately, the terminal, or meat, traits that the industry has been chasing are negatively correlated to the maternal traits, which are key for the profitability of our cows.  That means that as we breed for more muscle, a higher growth rate and other traits in our animals, the calving, milk, and fertility traits go in the opposite direction.</p> <p>  Why is fertility in our cows important?  Members should consider figure 2 in my submission, which refers to two herds, the first of which is a high-fertility herd of 20 cows producing 19 calves.  Therefore, there are 0.95 calves per cow per year, with an average weaning weight of 350 kg.  The total weaning weight produced in that herd would be 6,650 kg.  The second example is a low-fertility herd, again with 20 cows but producing only 14 calves.  Those calves are heavier than in the first herd, averaging at 400 kg and with a total weaning weight of 5,600 kg.  However, although the weanlings in the second herd are heavier, because there are more in the high-fertility herd the latter produces 1,050 kg more.  At a weanling price of &euro;2.20 per kilogramme, there is a difference of &euro;2,310 between the prices achieved from both herds.</p> <p>  With regard to how farmers have come to know the Euro-star evaluations of their cows, in September beef data and genomics programme Euro-star reports were sent to participants in the scheme.</p><p>An example page is contained in figure 3.  It contains details on the animal, namely, the jumbo, the tag, the date of birth, the sex and the star rating of the animal.  Most farmers were pleasantly surprised regarding the status of their herds, and the reports have significantly eased the concerns of many of the scheme participants.  However, one of the key messages coming from the reports is that the majority of four and five-star cows are the older cows, as the terminal breeding continues to flush the maternal genes out of our cows.  Thus we need to pay much more attention to the bulls and cows we are using to breed the next generation of replacement females.  That is a key focus of the scheme.</p><p> To recap on how Euro-stars are calculated and what the Euro-star rating means, there are two parts to it.  One is the Euro part, which represents the additional profit an animal, male or female, will deliver compared with another animal.  If one animal is rated at &euro;50 in that respect and another animal is rated at &euro;100, the latter animal is predicted to provide &euro;50 more profit per progeny than the animal rated at &euro;50.  In terms of the stars, the animals are ranked into quintiles, in different 20 percentiles.  For example, the five-star animals are the top 20%, the three-star animals are the average, and the one-star animals are the bottom 20%.</p><p> The majority of the data used in genetic evaluations come from the individual farms. The 2008 suckler scheme changed the landscape in terms of data for suckler cattle in Ireland.  The culture of data recording on suckler farms that this scheme brought about has had a dramatic impact on the quantity and quality of data that are available for use in genetic evaluations.  The participation of on-farm recording has also facilitated the linking of mart and factory data, which are very powerful data for genetic evaluations.  That is why the evaluation system available to Irish farmers is as powerful as it is, because of the high levels of integration in the various industry data capture systems.</p><p> A key question is whether the adoption of Euro-stars take the industry in the right direction?  Figures 5 and 6 show the results of some analysis we have done of around 100,000 replacement females that were born in 2008, the first year of the suckler scheme, and that subsequently came into current beef data and genomics programme participant herds as female replacements.  We then analysed the data we had on the offspring of these females to see how we performed.</p><p> Figure 5 contains the weanling performance.  I would point out a few key points.  In terms of the percentage of animals that are still alive, 79% of the five-star females are still alive versus 63% of the one-star females, so there is a difference of 16%.  The five-star females have had 4.57 progeny, on average, versus 3.94 for the one-star animals, which is  0.63 of a calf more for the five-star versus the one-star animals.  The five-star animals are 27 kilos ahead of the one-star animals in terms of the weanling weight, and the value achieved at the marts is &euro;786 versus &euro;757, a difference of &euro;28.  When we add up all those figures, the offspring of five-star animals has averaged &euro;3,587 versus &euro;2,980 for one-star animals.  Five-star cows have had more progeny, are lasting longer, have had heavier weanlings, albeit at a slightly low price per kilo and have generated &euro;28 more per weanling and a total of &euro;600 profit more per date over the one-star animals.</p><p> If we note the carcass performance in terms of the factory output, we see a similar profile.  The five-star animals have had more progeny go through the factory.  The animals are being slaughtered significantly younger, almost 39 days younger.  They are slightly heavier in terms of carcass weight.  There is no difference on average in terms of the confirmation, and with respect to the price achieved at the factory, they are ahead by &euro;17.  When we add more progeny and a higher carcass weight, there is a &euro;600 difference between the offspring of five-star animals and that of one-star animals followed through to slaughter.</p><p> Figure 7 is a graph that was presented at the Teagasc national beef conference by N&oacute;ir&iacute;n McHugh from Teagasc in which 1,200 cows and calves across 40 herds were weighed.  The results showed that, on average, five-star cows were 26 kg lighter than the one-star cows, thus costing less to maintain, but that the offspring of five-star cows were 30 kg heavier at weanling.  Five-star cows are producing more from less, the essence of the scheme in terms of increased profitability at farm level, and more environmentally sustainable in terms of more outputs from fewer inputs.</p><p> Will the four and five-star cows move us away from the breeds we have been using?  The graph illustrates that there are four and five-star cows across all breeds and although some breeds will have more of a challenge, there is no need for herds to change breed in order to meet the four and five-star requirements of the scheme.  What happens when the Euro-star indexes move?  It should be noted that the indexes will move over time as we get more data into the system.  Some will move more than others but there will be movement in all species, including dairy animals, sheep, pigs and chickens.  Beef will be no different.  The key from a scheme perspective is that once an animal has a four and five-star index at the required time, when it is genotyped, it will be eligible from a scheme perspective, even if its rating subsequently drops to three stars or below.</p><p> In terms of the current status of engagement with the scheme by farmers for the 2015 requirements, over 19,000 herds have returned samples for genotyping.  In terms of animal survey requirements, over 20,000 herds have returned some data on the survey forms for their animals.  We are currently following up with farmers to ensure maximum levels of completion ahead of the December payment runs by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.</p><p> We are very confident in the ability of genetics to deliver improved profitability for Irish suckler farmers.  Five-star cows have the potential to deliver an extra &euro;100 profit per year to farmers and, as a result, we strongly believe the scheme has the capacity to deliver long-term benefits to the Irish suckler industry well beyond the six year timelines of the scheme.  The most recent engagement with thousands of farmers across the country has served to reinforce our view.</p></speech>

Am I correct that with people producing for the Italian trade - for example, the weanlings - generally the cows are rated with one or two stars?  That is generally what I have seen through the years.  If we move the way described by the witnesses, will we produce a replacement animal closer to the milk or dairy sector with a smaller carcase?  Would it be a smaller-framed animal, to put it simply?  It would not be as attractive for the likes of the Italian trade as a live export.  With regard to replacement of cattle, we have seen a problem detailed at meetings where an animal had twins and one had a different rating, despite being from the same cow.  I do not know if that has been sorted out and perhaps the witnesses could further inform me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-17a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1041" speakername="Paul Connaughton" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111700002#O00800"><p>I welcome the delegation.  I hope to be just as brief with my questions, which arise as a follow-up as I know the witnesses tried to address many of the issues.  With regard to the purchasing of a bull with a rating of four or five stars, the witnesses stated that indexes will move.  Has that always been stated publicly at meetings as some farmers are confused because departmental officials and officials from the Irish Cattle Breeding Federation have given conflicting views?  Will the witnesses confirm today that this is the case and there is no change?</p> <p>  With the calculation of different percentages, how is docility only given 4%?  A number of farmers might say a quieter animal would thrive much more.  Why is such a small percentage given in the importance of the overall scheme?  The last question follows on and relates to Deputy Fitzmaurice's comment.  One farmer has given an example of six animals with the same bull and dam which seem to have different ratings.  Four were born in 2008 and two in 2009.  Why have the indexes moved quite widely although they come from the same gene pool?</p><p>Perhaps the witnesses will be able to explain it in a way that puts people's minds at ease because the goalposts seem to be moving, which is causing confusion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-17a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1125" speakername="Pat O'Neill" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111700002#P00200"><p>I thank Mr. Cromie and Mr. Coughlan for coming before the committee.  I found our previous meeting with them very informative.  I will go over some of the issues raised by Deputy Fitzmaurice.  I am participating in the scheme, and last year I bought 16 heifers as replacements before the scheme was introduced.  They happened to be Black Angus, which is an Angus and Hereford cross, and when I received the ratings, 14 of them were five-star heifers and two were four-star heifers.  This was because they are from a dairy herd.  The witnesses can produce figures to state animals are more profitable if they come from dairy herds, given the milk rates, but I am concerned we will lose the Italian and Spanish trade because these animals will not breed E and U grade animals, which are required for the Italian market in particular.  We may lose this trade because we will not have enough of them.</p> <p>  The Irish Cattle Breeding Federation's website states 17 traits are taken into account.  We have a list of six here, which means there are 11 more traits.  According to the list we have, weanling weight is the first trait, which can be established through the mart.  Will people such as me, who do not sell weanlings but continue to slaughter, be asked to weigh animals?  With regard to calving intervals, we all want a calf within 12 months because this is the ideal situation, but if farmers change the calving date from September to the following January for a cow which was a four-star or five-star animal, it may be downrated.  Calving difficulties are very hard to rate.  I still have to fill out my form about calving difficulties.  We want everything right, but will somebody state he or she had to jack 10, 11 or 12 calves and one was harder than the other?  This will be very difficult to establish.  Establishing progeny carcass weight is fine for someone slaughtering animals in this country, but when animals are exported, is there a follow-up process when they go to feedlots in Italy or Spain?  Do we have any way to establish an animal was slaughtered in Italy at 350 kg or 360 kg?</p> <p>  I am concerned about the dairy element.  I have a number of five-star cows which are either Angus or Hereford crosses.  My own cows, which are very good breeders, calve within 12 months, and produce a lot of milk and good calves, are only rated as one-star cows or two-star cows.  I am concerned we will go too much towards a dairy element.  I have a five-star bull, which I bought this year.  If I cross him with the five-star heifer, the next breed will be half-Limousin.  Will this animal have a five-star rating or will it go down to a four-star rating because the milk rate will drop because of not coming from a dairy herd?  How many generations of breeding does it take to drop the rating of an animal?</p> <p>  We cannot establish docility.  Nobody wants a wicked animal on the farm, whether a bull or a cow.  This is about honesty.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  The more information we convey to farmers, the better.  There was a lot of fear when farmers joined the scheme, but as information became available it became more acceptable to them.  I know one farmer who was very concerned and was going to withdraw from the scheme.  He brought his data to me one Sunday evening and we went through it, and he found he was at 68%.  All he had to do was continue. </p> <p>  Senator O'Neill referred to dairy herds which are of concern.  My part of the country along the Border and the west produce a lot of good quality weanlings that would be exported.  We do not want to lose that important market.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses find that milk and fertility are linked in herds?  Many still hope the system will be reduced to three stars, particularly in the initial stages.  A review was promised and perhaps that is being considered at the moment.  The scheme could be reduced to three stars and then perhaps increased in a year or two as people become more used to it.  As people were breeding bulls, in particular, it may be a bit of a problem for them to achieve five stars on the bulls they are producing.</p></speech>

This is one of the days where the gift of bi-location would be quite handy.</p> <p>  The witnesses said survey forms, in one form or another, for 20,000 herds have been sent in and samples have been returned for 19,000 herds.  I understand that initially about 27,000 filled out the form.  What is the latest date this year for sending in data in order that farmers can get paid before Christmas?  If farmers do not submit data for this year, does this mean they are out of the scheme or not?  Can they join at any stage for the five years of the scheme and can the scheme run for five years from that date?  Of the 7,000 who have not yet submitted data, do the witnesses know whether there is any correlation between them and herd size?  Does the figure involve predominantly large, small or medium-sized herds?</p> <p>  I tabled two parliamentary questions to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine and to say that I did not get very clear answers is putting it mildly.  I asked him if a person who buys a five-star bull could find that in subsequent years the star rating of the same animal was reduced and if he would make a statement on the matter.  He told me that it could reduce, but if a bull was in a five-star category it would remain so.  My second question asked him if there was any guarantee that bulls currently rated star five on AI catalogues would retain their star rating in the future, the effect it could have on farmers if it was subsequently found that AI bulls had been overrated and if he would make a statement on the matter.</p><p>The Minister did not really address the issue at all.  I will try to clarify for the officials the point I was trying to make.  I listened to an expert on the subject recently in a southern county.  I went all the way down to listen to him.  He said that the reliability of many of the AI bulls in terms of the star rating was actually rather low.  For example, I could go to the catalogue and decide on a five-star bull.  Then my 50 cows could produce 50 calves.  The same would apply if it were 20 cows or ten or whatever.  However, I could easily find out two or three years later that I had actually mated the cows to a one-star or two-star bull.  It does not matter, except that the progeny, accordingly, would not be what I had thought they would be.  It would have been as if I had got a one-star or two-star rated bull.  In fact, the speaker was recommending that farmers should not use only one AI bull and that they should reduce their risk.  For example, if a farmer had ten cows he could use five bulls and mate two cows per bull to insure against one or more of them proving to be a gliogar.  I am not sure whether the witnesses know what a gliogar is - it is a term for a rotten egg in the Irish language.  Anyway, if a bull proved to be something other than what it was meant to be, then I would not have bought into it.</p><p> The Department seems to be concerned about the AI bull, but that would not be on my register as a farmer.  The progeny of the AI bull would be my problem.  Four or five years later I could find myself with a major pain in my head, having thought I had done everything correctly.  In fact, I could be left with progeny that do not match the specification of what I bought.  In that case I would face a severe penalty, if I understand the system correctly.  If a farmer was not knowledgeable beyond my understanding of genomics, he might not pay much heed to it.</p><p> I am actually in favour of genomics.  I like the concept and I believe in science.  I believe that over time, once we have enough data collected to start rating things on past performance and so on, we will have a useful tool.  However, I think we are rushing our fences in demanding that farmers have X or Y number of four-star or five-star animals in the coming years.  To my mind, that is how everything works according to the plan of the Department.  I accept the basic science, but I think there are many variables in it.  If I accept what Department officials are saying in terms of output, then obviously farmers are going to move toward the four-star or five-star bulls over time for good reason, since the economic return on the market is going to entice them, just as the economic return from the factories moved farmers towards the confirmation of the animal in the factory or whatever the factories wanted.  When this data becomes available, it will move people.  However, the problem is not that people will not want to move.  The problem is the unintended consequences, since the data they are being given at the moment may be unreliable.  This particularly relates to people who use AI bulls or people using what are now rated as five-star stock bulls but which may subsequently turn out to be one-star bulls.  The original bull is only one animal, but the fact that his progeny might not have the traits he was meant to deliver as a five-star bull could have major consequences for the herd.</p><p>Does the system include some type of in-built guarantee for farmers who act in good faith, based on the information given to them, and subsequently find that this information was less than optimum and a reclassification was required, specifically in respect of the bull - the paternal side is likely to produce a large number of progeny - where it fails to live up to its record and produces a large number of sub-optimal cattle?</p></speech>

I presume <i>force majeure</i>would apply in cases where depopulation is caused by disease or similar factors.  In the event that the number of animals increases by more than 20%, is provision made to readjust the entitlement?

In terms of the weanlings produced for the Italian trade, it is not true to suggest that four-star and five-star cows will not produce animals that are fit for the weanling trade.  The key is the bull that is used on the four or five-star cow.  If one uses the bull on the right cow, the cow will have enough milk to feed the calf, drive it on and ensure it grows and is ready to go-----</p></speech>

We included six competing areas within the index.  Some animals will be better on the carcass, some will be better on milk and others will be better on fertility.  Obviously, one wants an animal that is good on the carcass and milk if one wants to mother a weanling for export.  There is no reason that cannot be the case for four-star and five-star animals.  The final graph shows the breeds of four-star and five-star cows.  There are plenty of four-star and five-star cows in the west in the Charolais and Limousin breeds.</p></speech>

Is feedback provided?  That is the nub of the issue.  This information could be fed into the data system for assessing the mother's traits.</p></speech>

However, we have the mart data and the price per kilogramme data which are very good indicators of the confirmation.  We also have the farmer scoring the calf quality of the animals.  Those data are all feeding into the prediction of carcass information and they are very good predictors.  While it would be optimal to receive information from the Italian factories, it is not necessary to make a good prediction.</p> <p>  Deputy Fitzmaurice asked the reason twins could have different Euro-star ratings given that they have the same father and mother.  This issue arose at a few of the meetings we held.  To take one example, there should be no difference between young twin calves.</p><p>In one example I looked at, the sire had been recorded on one of the calves but not on the other.  Immediately there was a clear reason they would be different.  I was asked about animals with the same sire and dam and why their Euro-Star ratings would vary.  As we get data on the animals themselves, it is only natural that they start to separate.  Full brothers or sisters will perform differently depending on the data that are recorded.  That includes the weights of the calves they are weaning, calving intervals and how long they stay in herds.  Those will have different influences on the star ratings.  Just because they are from the same sire and dam, as they gather more data of their own, they will start to differ in terms of their star ratings.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-17a.37" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Andrew Cromie" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111700002#V00200"><p>I will pick up on the 40% accuracy question and genotyping and genomics.  I note to Deputy Fitzmaurice that the accuracy of genotyping is 100%.  That is the first point.  When we think about accuracy, how accurate is the process of taking the DNA and establishing a genotype?  That is 100% accurate.  The next question, which is in essence the one Deputy FItzmaurice is asking, is how confident we are in converting that genotype data into a star evaluation.  This is where one has that figure of 40%.  In effect, that is the reliability, which is what Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v also adverted to, of the Euro-Star evaluation.  In many ways, these questions are at the nub of one of the issues.  We are dealing here with Euro-Star evaluations which by their nature are based on data and more data.  As a consequence, the evaluations will change over time.  As my colleague, Mr. Coughlan, has indicated, we are absolutely confident at a high level when one looks at it based on lots of data that these four and five-star animals will lead to more profitability for farmers.  People are generally acknowledging that right across the board, but that does not get away from the issue that at the individual animal level, some will go up and some will go down.  In the case of an AI bull or a stock bull, that can, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v indicated, have a profound impact, particularly when it relates to potential progeny.  That is why education and training is such a core part of the beef data and genomics programme.  It is covered as a cost associated with the scheme and is going to start in February.</p> <p>  There are approximately 27,500 herds in the scheme.  We have done the initial analysis of how many four and five-star cows there are and farmers have received the reports.  While they are generally happy, there are some herd owners who are in a more challenging place.  This is where we need to have a discussion with them regarding their replacement strategy to ensure they meet the 2018 and 2020 requirements.  In those circumstances, their options will include the use of artificial insemination.  At the information meetings, we saw that while 20% of the progeny from the suckler herd or the cows in the scheme were from AI, almost 60% of herd owners in the scheme were using some level of AI.  That is a very interesting and relevant statistic.  It tells us that guys are engaged with using AI but we need to get them to use it more.</p> <p>  The next advice we must give those individuals who are going to use AI is that it is not one AI bull.  I take Deputy Fitzmaurice's point about what would happen where a bull dropped.  If they use a very reliable AI bull, the likelihood of that bull dropping is very small.</p><p>The accuracy figure alluded to by Deputy Fitzmaurice is like a confidence interval.  How confident are we that this index is going to change?  Certainly for an AI bull with 90% reliability, we would be very confident that the index will not change.  However, for a young AI bull who is down at 40% or 45% reliability, the same as a stock bull, the index could change.  The advice to herd owners in that regard is they need to use a team of AI bulls.  They will need three or four AI bulls.  Generally if one looks at the herds that are involved, in Gene Ireland or the various AI-based initiatives, they would use three or four different beef bulls across different breeds.  Using a team of bulls has worked very effectively in the context of the dairy herd.  The benefit is that one mitigates against the risk of any one individual falling.  One could go up, one could go down but the average of the group stays the same.  Using four young AI bulls is the equivalent of using a very well-proven stock bull.  That is work that Teagasc would have done in the context of strategies that herd owners can use to try to offset the risk around reliability or the potential fall in reliability.  We are always talking about the bull that goes down, but for every bull that goes down, there is another bull that goes up.</p><p> The issue of drops in proof will only affect a proportion of herd owners.  The advice is that if they are using AI bulls, they should use a team.  The other piece of advice from Teagasc and the AI companies and which is a core part of the education and replacement exercise is that if they want to guard against this issue and if the cut-off is &euro;74 - the four and five-star cut-off on the replacement index is &euro;74 - then, on average, the progeny on a &euro;74 cow will be &euro;74 and they will be fine.  However, that is not good advice if they want to cover off some risk.  In that case, they should go higher than that because the bull could potentially fall.  The advice is that if herd owners are going to buy a stock bull, they should look at one at &euro;120 to &euro;150 in terms of the replacement index to give them some ability to offset this potential risk.</p><p> We have spoken about the information meetings and Pearse Kelly and Aidan Murray from Teagasc would have presented much of this material at those meetings.  More than 5,000 farmers attended 12 information meetings and they understand this.  They understand that this issue is a part of the Euro-Star indexes.  At an individual level, this is how one guards against a problem with an individual animal.  The key point is that it applies across many animals, whether they are buying in heifers, breeding on their cows or using AI.  Over the course of the six years of the scheme, these issues dissipate.  They also dissipate across the 27,500 herds in the scheme.  That is why, at the high level, from the point of view of the ICBF, Teagasc and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, we are confident that the genomic base and the science behind it will take us to where we need to be at the end of this scheme, which is delivering &euro;150 per cow in terms of additional profitability.</p></speech>

Once the animal is genotype four and five-star for the purposes of the scheme, it is eligible until the end of the scheme.  In the intervening period, that index may move but that animal remains eligible.</p><p>The Deputy asked another question which was similar to that Deputy Fitzmaurice asked about different embryos.  As those animals get their own performance, they will establish different values.  They will perform differently because they will have received different sets of genes from their mothers and their fathers.</p><p> The docility question has come up quite strongly at many of the meetings we have held throughout the country.  The current weighting for docility is based on the economic model done by Dr. Paul Crossan at Grange.  On the basis of the meetings, the index is under ongoing review.  We will be looking at the relative importance of docility from a farm safety point of view and from an on-farm labour point of view.</p><p> I would like to respond to Senator O'Neill's query about dairy herds getting four or five stars.  It would not be correct to assume that the first cross animals from the dairy herd heifers will be four-star and five-star animals.

He was absolutely right to make the point that even though our material refers to six traits, there are actually 17 traits.  When we are evaluating female fertility, for example, we evaluate age at first calving, calving intervals and cow survival rates.  We present that data as an overall group of traits called female fertility.  Similarly, we evaluate carcass weight, carcass fat, carcass confirmation and age at slaughter.  Six traits have been listed for ease of presentation, but in effect there are 17 traits in the actual index.  We group the traits in that way purely from an ease of presentation perspective when we are talking to a farmer audience.</p></speech>

A relative weighting of 21% is attached to carcass weight for age.</p> <p>  The Senator asked a question about the collection of data and expressed some concern about missing data.  He asked whether a farmer would be required to weigh his own calves if we did not have weight data on his animals.  He is right to suggest that our goal is always to try to pick up the data wherever we can.  For example, we get the data on weights and prices per kilo through marts.  An increasing number of farmers are starting to weigh their calves themselves, which is a positive development even if it is not a requirement of the scheme.  As farmers see the value in that data, we expect that an increasing number of them will look to weigh their own animals in appreciation of the use of this valuable data in getting more accurate milk evaluations - maternal evaluations - for their cows.  At the moment, we use the cow milk score as a proxy or a predictor of weaning weight in the calf at 200 days.  I hope that answers the Senator's question on missing data, about which he expressed some concern.</p></speech>

All the animals are coming in and are easy to tag.</p> <p>  The cut-off dates are the realm of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  My understanding is that there is no cut-off date for payment.

That is the point that was being made.</p> <p>  On another point raised by Deputy Fitzmaurice, if a four-star or five-star animal is sold in a mart and subsequently genotyped at below the original designation, will the animal qualify because it was designated four or five-star when it was purchased and introduced to the herd?</p></speech>

This is the first year of the scheme.  The animals will be genotyped at a much younger age in the second and third years of the scheme.  The animals that are in the scheme herds that are going through the marts will be genotyped prior to being traded in the marts.  In addition, farmers with herds that are not in the scheme who wish to trade animals will be able to avail of the genotyping service, which will allow them to have their animals genotyped prior to sale at marts.</p></speech>

They will receive training some time in future.</p> <p>  I once asked a number of Deputies how many of them had read the Oireachtas safety statement which new Members receive when they enter the House.  I hope Deputy Fitzmaurice, who is relatively new to the House, received a copy.  We are all responsible legislators and the Oireachtas produced the legislation providing for mandatory safety statements in the workplace.  If the Deputies to whom I spoke were in any way a representative sample, the number of colleagues who have read the safety statement is incredibly small, particularly when one takes into account the highly responsible job we have and the fact that we introduced legislation providing for safety statements in the belief that they are a great idea.  I make this point because Departments and official bodies present farmers with 50-page printed documents setting out terms and conditions and so forth.  When a farmer does not follow the conditions, as laid down, the officials will say "Tough luck" and the farmer will lose X amount of money for not reading the document.  It is a case of good luck, goodbye and goodnight.  If we applied the same approach to Oireachtas Members with regard to safety statements, none of us would get paid.</p><p>For this reason, we must accept that if we are relying on the fine print that is conveyed in written documents, we can forget it.  Even if information is being conveyed at meetings that farmers are obliged to attend as a condition of the scheme, those present may not fully concentrate on the proceedings.  I do not know how many times Deputies have made a public statement on radio and people have come back to us having got the message arseways.  That is a common phenomenon, which is the reason I do not like the penalty regime. <br/><br/>It has been correctly pointed out that if one uses artificial insemination multiple times, the law of averages dictates that the farmer should pass the test within five or six years.  If one calculated, on an actuarial basis, the chances of the <i>Titanic </i>sinking in the middle of the Atlantic killing such a large number of people, the large number of things that would have to go wrong would indicate that the chances of the vessel sinking would be minuscule.  One hears the various statistical scenarios about the <i>Titanic</i>having to turn left or right or having to be five minutes early or late.  Nonetheless, the <i>Titanic </i>sank, which demonstrates that the most unlikely events occur, even though statistically they are very unlikely.  <br/><br/>To return to the artificial insemination bull, will it be mandatory on AI providers to set out in large red or black print the reliability of the data on which the rating of their bull is based at that point in time?  I understand there will be bulls in the catalogues which may have a reliability rating of less than 40%.  One would be careful about putting &euro;1,000 on a bet in Paddy Power with those odds, not to speak of &euro;10,000.  This process involves considerable sums of money, both in terms of the value of the progeny on the market and the lost grants.  <br/><br/>If I understand the position correctly, the ICMF's problem is that the scheme is new in that genotyping and data collection are new and the longer and more consistently the ICMF receives the data, the more the actuarial level will increase.  After five or six years, it will plateau at a high level of accuracy but at the beginning, the reliability of the bulls is lower because the ICMF does not have much data on them or their progeny.  In that case, would it not have been better to have removed the penalties from the game on the basis that the market will look after people doing the right thing?  Would it not be preferable not to introduce penalties until the scheme has been operating for a long period, farmers have acclimatised to it and much more reliable data are available?  Once the data are available, the penalties could be introduced over time, perhaps in the next round of the scheme.  At that stage, I assume penalties would not be necessary because most farmers would be doing the right thing as the market will determine that it would be sensible to do so.  <br/><br/>It is a statistical fact that 48% of herds have fewer than ten cows.  I was surprised to learn from the data supplied by the Department that approximately 45% of herds in counties Carlow and Kilkenny have fewer than ten suckler cows.  It is not the case, therefore, that the smaller herds are all located on the west coast as there are many smaller herds on the east coast.  While there are fewer herds in the east than in the west, the variation in herd size is not dramatically different between the regions.  In other words, a high proportion of herds in the east are small in number, notwithstanding what many east coast farmers may believe.</p><p>There are some very large herds in the west.  If a suckler farmer is using artificial insemination, how many bulls, or AI bulls, are recommended if he has eight cows?  If he gets it wrong, he is in trouble five years down the road.</p></speech>

With regard to penalties, we are all obliged to register a calf within 27 days.  If a farmer encounters a problem or there is another problem, such as forgetting to register, such that a calf is not registered within 27 days, will the farmer be penalised?

The federation is trying to move on the genetics of the herd quite quickly.  This is taking away farmers' old-style belief in being able to tell by eye how good an animal is.  Moving from this approach to science results in some distrust.  Is there any independent body over the federation that can verify its approach is correct?  An independent body could stand over the approach and say all is good with it.</p> <p>  Can a five-star or four-star crossbred animal born into the herd be used as a sire and not be purebred at all?  If so, is the farmer not taking a huge risk with the next progeny?  I refer to circumstances where the bull is crossbred even before starting.</p></speech>

The key point to remember, which is one of the key points we were making at the meetings, is that when we look at farmers' Euro-star ratings, we see a significant weighting among four and five-star animals towards the older cows.  As we have bred further generations, we have been breeding the maternal traits out of them.  That is the picture today but one must ask how many of those older cows will actually be in the herds in 2017, 2018 and later.  While the figures look good right now, it is critical that we do not take our eye off the ball and that we start a breeding strategy right away to ensure we are regenerating more and more four and five-star animals.<br/><br/>Registration within 27 days is a requirement of the scheme.  I have no doubt that if there are extenuating circumstances affecting why a calf is not registered, <i>force majeure</i>arrangements will apply.  The same applies to the Chairman's questions on land and TB-related depopulation.</p><p>On Deputy Connaughton's point, we work very closely with Teagasc.  It is an independent entity that is examining how we put together the evaluations.  Much of the work we do and the economic models we use to put together the evaluations are based on work done by Mr. Paul Crosson in Teagasc, Grange.  Therefore, there is independence.</p><p> The Deputy is correct that there is some resistance and unease over the combining of science with what people consider to be the traditional art of cattle breeding.  It is not a case of either&ndash;or; one combines the best of both but genomic data and genetic evaluations can indicate to a farmer certain characteristics he cannot see just by looking at an animal.</p></speech>

The reality is that not all calves will be born of purebred bulls all the time.  We have to allow for those eventualities, and the Department has been reasonable in allowing for them.</p></speech>

Many of them hinged on the replacement strategy and artificial insemination.  I mentioned education and training.  The Deputy was concerned about how many people will read the terms and conditions or seek to attend the education and training courses.  As I indicated, our plan is to start the education and training in February.  It is expected that the courses will be completed in 2016 for the 27,500 herds.  Our plan is to do the training in groups of approximately 25 farmers, each doing a four-hour training session.  Approximately two and a half hours of that will be devoted to the Euro-stars and replacement strategy in particular.  We are very anxious to adopt an approach such that the herd owners who find the scheme somewhat more challenging owing to their not having as many four- and five-star females initially will be targeted for education and training early.  There will be constant communication with the farmers on the status of their herds.</p> <p>  The first beef data and genomics programme reports indicated the status of herds with regard to the 2018 requirement.  We have to have a very accurate and up-to-date picture as more data, including genotype data, become available.  We anticipate communicating very regularly, at least twice per year, and giving farmers the latest indication as to where we anticipate their herds to be in 2018 and 2020, particularly in regard to the replacement strategy requirements.  Deputy O'Cu&iacute;v's concern about a bull that has been purchased and whose evaluation may be starting to slip down, thus affecting his progeny, is that the farmer will know about this for the first time only in 2018.</p></speech>

What does the farmer do?  Does he sell them off?  It could delay the farmer by a year or two.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-17a.98" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Andrew Cromie" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2015111700002#CC00800"><p>That is a concern and it is very justified.  The view we are taking is that we will communicate constantly with farmers on their standing under the scheme.  It may require some interaction with Teagasc or advisers so additional advice for the farmer may be provided.  Our goal is not only to ensure every farmer reaches the targets of 20% and 50% but also to ensure farmers have as many four-star and five-star animals as possible as they work their way through the scheme.</p><p>Ultimately, this is what will drive profitability and sustainability on farms.  It is certainly a process of constant communication throughout the scheme and our goal is that farmers will meet and exceed the requirements.  The specific point on artificial insemination is very relevant.  Can we indicate that a bull is proven?  We publish an active beef bull list which indicates only proven maternal artificial insemination bulls, those which have daughters with milk and fertility evaluations.  The suggestion that it be clearly stamped or indicated on an artificial insemination catalogue has been considered and discussed, and it has much merit.</p></speech>

The Deputy is concerned that the programme is only starting now.  We must think back.  The underlying data that supports the programme began to be compiled in 2008 with the suckler cow welfare scheme.  Since then, farmers have been collecting the data that underpins the scheme.  This includes the sire date of calves and all the relevant data recorded on calf quality and docility.  Last year's scheme gave us the genotype data.  We are in a very strong position regarding launching the scheme with a level of confidence that with genomic evaluations, or using the genotype data in the Euro-Star evaluations, we can confidently give an indication to farmers regarding the four-star and five-star status of animals.</p> <p>  Although there is an expectation that at some stage, with genotype and other data, it will be 100% accurate, it is not the case.  There is a natural plateau effect.  Although with genomic evaluations, one can add so much genotype data, there will always be a level of uncertainty associated with genetic or genomic evaluations, until we reach 99% reliability, although that would be an artificial insemination sire with 10,000 progeny.  Genotyping will not be able to deliver this.  While it may be able to deliver a reliability in the order of 60% to 70%, it is nothing like 95% or 99%.</p></speech>

I note in particular the issues raised at a recent session of this committee, on 8 October, which heard from members of the Organic Farmers Representative Body, and I hope that in the course of our discussion here today we can clarify many of these issues for the committee members.  At the outset, it should probably be said that the Organic Farmers Representative Body is not an umbrella organisation representing all or even most organic farmers.  It represents a number of small livestock farmers and does so most effectively and efficiently.  The usual forum for discussion between the Department and the organic farming sector is the Organic Focus Group, which meets quarterly under an independent chair and which is representative of the entire sector.  The Organic Farmers Representative Body attends these meetings and the Department has also met independently with the body on several occasions to hear its views and to respond to its various proposals.</p> <p>  Having studied the transcripts of the discussion at this committee on 8 October, I found that four main issues were raised: the framework of support established under the new organic farming scheme which was introduced as part of the RDP; the question of double-funding under GLAS and the new organic scheme; the problem of delays in making payments to organic farmers; and the cost of membership and inspections applied by the organic control bodies.</p> <p>  The new organic farming scheme was introduced following a wide round of consultation which extended over almost two years as part of the process of drafting the new rural development programme.  It also takes account of a detailed value-for-money review which was completed last year and which quite deliberately  links across to both GLAS and to the targeted agricultural modernisation scheme, TAMS, in creating a comprehensive framework of supports for the sector.</p> <p>  The new organic farming scheme was launched in April 2015 with a budget of &euro;56 million over the lifetime of the RDP.   It provides for significantly increased rates of payment to all organic farmers, irrespective of sector.  For example, the standard rate payment, which applies to most farmers including livestock farmers, was &euro;106 per hectare under the old scheme, but under the new scheme this has been increased to &euro;170 per hectare, which is a 60% increase.  In addition, the area on which full payment can be made has been increased from 55 hectares to 60 hectares.  The new scheme also specifically targets tillage farmers for the first time, as this is an area that was identified as being in deficit and is of key importance both in its own right and as a source of home-grown organic feed for the livestock sector.  For the same reason, the new scheme also encourages the cultivation of red clover as a high-protein dry-matter fodder crop for the purpose of building supplies of organic feedstuffs.</p> <p>  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is very pleased that the new scheme has been hugely successful since its launch, attracting 870 applications in its first tranche.  To put this in context, the highest number of applications ever received previously was 380 applications in 2010.  In addition, over 500 of the 870 applicants are new entrants to organic farming.  The highest number of new entrants to organic farming heretofore was 158, in 2009.  By any standards the new scheme is a major success, and we have already met most if not all of our targets for the entire RDP period in this first intake of applications.</p> <p>  There are also 720 existing participants from the previous organic farming scheme, which means that when all applications into the new scheme have been processed and approved, we should have some 1,600 organic farmers in the system.  This is a major step forward.  Together, these farmers manage about 60,000 hectares of land, and because of the structures we are putting in place, we hope to secure this land under organic contract for at least the next five years.  For the first time, this allows us to plan ahead with confidence in terms of an organic food market.</p> <p>  Participants under the new organic farming scheme receive significantly higher payment rates than under the previous scheme.  Following extensive negotiations with the European Commission, it has been agreed that the benefit of these higher payment rates can be extended to current scheme participants who are under the previous organic farming scheme.  This ensures that all organic farmers in the country are now operating off the same footing.  Furthermore, the Commission has very recently agreed that we can extend the contracts of people operating under the old scheme so that all participants can now be confident of a secure system of supports right up to the end of the RDP period.</p><p> Part of the success of the new scheme is due to the synergies we have put in place with both GLAS and TAMS.  Under GLAS, an organic farmer receives guaranteed priority access to the scheme under tier 1.   Under TAMS II, a dedicated capital investment scheme has been put in place specifically for the benefit of organic farmers, providing support for the widest range of equipment and structures of any TAMS scheme.  The TAMS organic capital development scheme has a budget of  &euro;8 million over the lifetime of the RDP.  In addition, the Department has put in place a wholly Exchequer-funded scheme of financial assistance directed towards processors to facilitate the development of the organic sector, with a budget of &euro;1.2 million in 2015 and similar for succeeding years.  The package of measures available now for the organic sector exceeds anything which was in place previously.  More important, however, it demonstrates clear, joined-up thinking between the different strands of support that could be utilised.</p><p> I will now turn to the question of double funding between GLAS and the organic farming scheme.  I wish to clarify that all organic farmers can access the full range of GLAS measures and in many cases this presents a unique opportunity to top up their organic farming payment with up to &euro;5,000 or more a year under GLAS.  The only proviso is when similar actions are in place under both schemes - in such cases it is a clear stipulation of the European legislation that a risk of double-funding exists - that this must be explicitly addressed.  It is not possible to be paid twice for the same action, particularly when in most cases the basis will be compensation for income foregone which is already being paid under one or other action.  We are happy to discuss this with members and we will do our best to explain the issue as clearly as possible.</p><p> With regard to delays in making payments to organic farmers, this was indeed an issue last year due to an industrial dispute at local office level.  The impact on organic farmers is deeply regretted and we are doing everything to ensure that the first instalment of this year&rsquo;s payments will go out to all eligible farmers before Christmas.   Reference was made to charges levied by the various organic control bodies.  These are independent bodies which operate on the basis of commercial contracts with their farmer clients.  There are five separate organic control bodies operating in Ireland and it is open to any farmer to choose to which one he or she wants to sign up.  Members will appreciate that it is difficult to comment on the rates being charged in such circumstances.  Each of these bodies is approved by the Department to carry out the necessary controls and checks to ensure that Irish organic farmers are operating to at least the standards laid down across the EU.  In accordance with the governing EU regulations, specifically Article  27 of Council Regulation (EC) 834 of 2007, this certification process can be delegated to approved control bodies.  This is the approach we have taken in Ireland and which is common across many member states of the European Union.  The flexibility to delegate this work to anybody other than an approved control body is not provided for within the governing legislation.</p><p> The Department contributes directly towards the cost of inspections by these bodies to the tune of &euro;150 a visit, a contribution which we increased recently from a previous rate of &euro;121.  The organic control bodies play a critical role in ensuring that the standard of Irish organic farming and produce is respected and relied upon worldwide, which, in turn, is key to unlocking the extensive framework of supports we have put in place through the EU regulations.  It is also key to the development of a vibrant and growing organic market.  That is all I have to say at present but my colleagues and I are available to take whatever questions which members may wish to pose.  I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

He said there are 870 new applicants and that 500 of those are brand new.  Can it be presumed that the other 370 are people who were in the scheme but went out of it and came back in again at some point?  The Department is looking at 1,600 altogether so that means there are 720 existing participants.  Can Mr. Dillon clarify how long it will be before the existing farmers who will enter the scheme this year are fully converted to organic production?  From what they are saying, I understand that many of the smaller farmers are not comfortable remaining in the scheme.  I have discussed the issue with Mr. Dillon and with Ms Furlong previously.</p><p>If many of them are lost to the scheme, is there a risk of a trough over the two-year period starting now until it goes fully organic in two years?  While the scheme has higher rates per hectare, double funding was possible under REPS at one time, something Mr. Dillon will address.  Under new EU rules that is not allowed at the moment.  Smaller farmers who farmed ten, 15 or 18 ha had problems.</p><p> As well as farmers, does the Department fund the independent groups on which the witnesses said they would not comment?  They are Department-approved, but there seem to be problems in terms of what they are charging.  Does the Department contribute towards them and, if so, how much does it give?</p><p> We know there are 760 farmers under the old scheme, with a manual payment system.  I understand the 870 new farmers coming into the scheme will be on a database or a new modified system whereby a button can be pressed and payments sent to them.  Will those on the manual system remain there?  As the witnesses alluded to, there were major problems last year.  Can anyone guarantee that the farmers concerned will be paid by Christmas?  There is a lot of fear about the scheme. </p><p> The organic groups to which I have spoken raised issues with me.  This may not be the place to discuss them, but Senator O'Brien also spoke about the issue.  We discussed areas such as Connemara, the hills in Mayo, Wicklow, places where there are mountain lamb and areas which would not be fertilised.  Can we get clearance from the EU to classify such areas as organic?  One would not spread fertiliser on the top of a mountain.  Such a scheme would probably involve sheep rather than cattle.  Areas such as Donegal and Kerry could be included.  Many areas in Ireland are left to themselves, fertilisers are not being pumped into them and they are not being tampered with.  The issue arose during a previous meeting and it is worth discussing.</p></speech>

I note in the submission it was stated that an industrial dispute in the office last year held up payments.  I hope that has now been settled and that people are paid before Christmas to this year.  Bodies that rate organic farmers are independent and the Department cannot interfere with them.</p> <p>  Could I have a breakdown on the 1,600 farmers the officials have said will be in organic schemes within the next year?  What is the breakdown between livestock - including sheep, beef and dairy - poultry, tillage and vegetable production, in terms of the farms that will participate?  Are many farms mixed or specialised?</p></speech>

I agree with Deputy Fitzmaurice that in the west of Ireland, particularly along the western coast, a lot of mountain and hill land is not fertilised.  I have always said that a lot of lamb and other produce coming from such areas would be organic.  Some farmers may give one or two doses to a lamb and would feed and fatten them up.</p> <p>  I welcome the move regarding the tillage sector, because getting organically grown grain was a problem.  The news is very welcome for organic farmers.</p><p>A number of members have referred to delays in payments, which was a major problem.  We received representations from farmers in the organic sector whose payments were delayed, something which annoyed them greatly.  It is good to see that the problem has been sorted out. </p><p> I missed the discussion on whether farmers can still join the scheme.  It is important that we get the numbers up.  Things look very positive for those people.  The combination of GLAS and the organic payment will be attractive for farmers.</p></speech>

I listened carefully to what they said and understand that under EU law the Government is allowed to tender for certain things, but I fail to see why five bodies certify the organic sector. </p> <p>  I examined what Austria is doing.  Let us remember it is 2015 and we talk about climate change every day.  Agriculture is the one area that adds to the problems of climate change.  Organic farming saves 60% of the CO2 that is produced by conventional farming.  I want to open a conversation in this country about what Austria is doing that we are not.  Some 14% to 16% of Austria's farmers are organic and it has become a centre for all things organic, even tourism.</p> <p>  I listened to the Minister, Deputy Coveney, who is so articulate.  We are the green island and there are bodies such as Origin Green and Bord Bia, but a very small minority of farms are organic.  The group which came before us at a previous meeting is not powerful.  I am not coming up with any light bulb ideas.  The officials have given us great answers, but I still feel rather lost in terms of the organic movement and I do not feel we will sit here in ten years' time and say we have passed out Austria.  It would be good if we could do so.</p> <p>  Small-scale farmers are important.  We do not ever want to become a country of giant farms.  A satellite view of Ireland shows that we are suited to small farmers, and this is exactly what suits small-scale farmers.</p> <p>  I again thank the officials for the very relevant answers they gave us today, but I am still anxious and slightly concerned for the future.  I hope they will join me in thinking that we must brainstorm on how we can assist farmers.  I heard what they said about payments and all of that, but we are not the same as all other EU countries.  How can we assist farmers and the thinking and vision of our young people in planning to go into the sector in the future?</p></speech>

On the double payment, I recall the organic representative body identifying that the way the different measures are grouped seemed to restrict farmers who were unable to do something else in a group where there was overlap.  I cannot recall the individual measures but the group said farmers might have been able to do things that were complementary.  I would like clarification on whether such a rule amounted to double payment.  I understand fencing and hedging was one such category.</p></speech>

We have an open mind when it comes to what can be done, in terms of what we need to be doing that we are not doing.  We always have an open mind because we identified this as an area which needs attention.  We are putting extra resources into innovative schemes.</p><p>If that does not work, we will have to look again to see what needs to be done.  We have an open mind in that respect.</p><p> To turn to Deputy Fitzmaurice's queries, the idea with the existing scheme participants and the new scheme participants is that they will all start now from a new five-year contract.  We will lock them all in for five years from now.  We thought we could get approval from the European Commission to transform existing old organic scheme participants into new ones, but it said it had a difficulty with that because of the regulations.  In fact, that is what we were going to do.  We are allowed to leave current scheme participants where they are but we must pay them the higher rate.  They are going to get new contracts starting from now which will mean that we will have all of them locked in for five years from now.</p></speech>

However, we do not expect that there will be that much churning, for want of a better word, or that there will be that many people walking away from the scheme.  We have put in place a measure which allows people who are in the existing scheme to get the higher rate of payment and to get contracts.</p></speech>

I agree with Mr. Dillon that a measure has been put in place.  The only thing is that if one is a smaller farmer, one is walking away from it because if one goes into GLAS, one can get &euro;5,000.  I know Mr. Dillon spoke about the measures and I understand the point, but if one gets the &euro;180 per hectare on a 15 hectare farm, one will not get to &euro;5,000.  We have done the figures and Mr. Dillon is probably aware of that.  One is better off to go into GLAS and not have the hassle of organic, going by the system.  For the smaller fellow under 20 hectares, is that a fair point?</p></speech>

There are a number of small ones who are coming in and a number of large ones.  We do not anticipate that there will be a large fall-off in production.</p> <p>  I might ask some of my colleagues to answer some of the questions as we go through them.  On the issue of double funding with REPS, the big change was that under the new CAP when it was negotiated, the direct payments regulation and the rural development regulation were changed to state explicitly that one is not allowed to be funded twice for the same action.  This was previously identified by the European Commission as a risk to funds.  What one must look at is what income is being forgone by the farmer for a particular scheme and then ask if the same action is involved for two different schemes.  If that is deemed to be so, one cannot be paid under both schemes.  That was identified as a serious risk to funds and it was explicitly stated that double funding had to be avoided.  That is why payments in the organic scheme are made on the basis of income forgone and costs incurred.  For GLAS, payments are made on the basis of income forgone and costs incurred.  Low-input permanent pasture is an example that is often quoted.  The action involved - the income forgone by the farmer in GLAS - is almost identical to the income forgone by the organic farmer.  Therefore, one cannot pay organic payment and low-input permanent pasture payment on the same land.  That is the logic and one can understand it.  It was not an issue in REPS because the regulation was changed since REPS.  That is the point there.</p> <p>  I was asked whether the Department funds the organic control bodies.  We make a payment of &euro;150 per visit per annum.  For each member that is attributed to the particular control body, there is an entitlement to a refund from us of &euro;150 per annual visit.  That is the way we fund them and that sum was increased.</p> <p>  I was asked about a manual versus automated system.  Our original plan was that we would be able to transfer all of the existing scheme participants into the new scheme and that would all be automated via an online system.  However, the Commission told us clearly that it would not allow us to do that.  As such, we had to come up with a hybrid system.  That is why we are stuck with some of the manual payments.</p></speech>

As far as the farmer is concerned, if we are able to make the payments on time, it will make no difference.  Some of it is being done manually and some of it is being automated.  It is kind of a hybrid system.  We were forced to do that but they will all be brought in.  In due course, they will all come in.  It was forced upon us because the Commission would not allow us to transfer the existing guys into the new scheme.</p> <p>  On the delay in payment, we admit fully that we were late with payments last year.  We have given a commitment that it will not happen again this year.  That is what we are working on now.  We have given that commitment and will stand by it.</p> <p>  On marginal mountain land, I was asked if it can be identified as an organic area.  There is provision on that and my colleague, Mr. Frank Macken, will probably enlighten the committee in that regard.</p></speech>

There is a provision within the regulation which speaks about the grazing of common land by organic animals alongside non-organic animals.  There are very specific conditions to do that.  In short, the answer is yes, there is provision to do this.  However the implied question is whether there is a generic approach to all the mountains and hill lands of Ireland.  It does not work like that.  The rules are specific and confined within the organic regulations so that one cannot break out of that.  To avail of this, one must be an organic farmer.  The answer is yes, there is provision to graze animals on commonage, but one must be an organic farmer to avail of that opportunity.  While the simple answer is yes, in terms of seeking a relaxation from the Commission as a general overall rule for Ireland, that will not happen.  Organics is a specific form of food production and within that there are measures and opportunities for farmers.  That includes one of them.  If the Chairman wishes me to go into the detail, I will, but that is the principle involved.</p></speech>

That is why we have gone through it in some detail to see if we are addressing those properly.  We have met them quite regularly.  They are also members of the organic focus group.  As such, we have a good bit of contact with them.  The biggest issue they expressed was the delay in payments and we have dealt with that.</p> <p>  I was asked about the cost of membership of the organic control bodies.  We have looked across a number of other member states of the EU to see how they operate and there is a mix.  Some countries operate the same system as we do and some operate it from the agencies themselves.  Somebody mentioned Austria, which has eight private sector organic control bodies.  That is not dissimilar to how we operate it ourselves.  There is competition between the control bodies.  That is the way they operate.</p> <p>  I was asked about the breakdown between the different sectors.  Ms Joan Furlong will give the committee some of the breakdown.</p></speech>

Under the new scheme, 500 new people are converting to organics for the first time and that accounts for 100 new cereal producers with an area in excess of 730 ha.  From a horticultural perspective, we have 202 producers under the existing scheme covering an area of 301 ha.  Under the new scheme - and I am speaking in relation to the 500 people who are converting to organic for the first time - we have 97 new horticultural producers covering an area of 78 ha.</p><p>With regard to beef, there were 294 herds at the end of 2014.  The new entrants to the scheme will bring in a further 145 herds.  To put that in context, at the end of 2014, the 294 organic-registered herds accounted for 4,425 cattle.  The 145 herds that are currently being converted to organic herds for the first time will account for 3,040 cattle.</p></speech>

We regard it as one of the big growth areas given the amount of marginal land available and the low intensity at which lamb is reared in many of these areas.</p> <p>  We have spoken about delays in payment already.</p> <p>  On the question as to whether the door is still open to people who want to join, we are examining that at present and will be making a decision on it shortly.</p> <p>  With regard to the combination involving GLAS and the organics scheme, there was a deliberate move on our part to regard organic farmers as having priority access under the GLAS because we recognised organic farming as a practice to be encouraged.  Bearing in mind the demand for access to the GLAS, it is an advantage to be organic or in the process of converting to organic farming.  We are well aware of that.</p> <p>  On Senator O'Brien's points, should we examine further the Austrian model?  Is there something the Austrians are doing that we do not do?  A larger proportion of Austrian farmers are organic.  They have a smaller farm size and a small enough herd size.  They operate on the basis of eight certifying bodies, which are private sector controlled.  We have five and they have eight so there is a lot of competition there.  The Austrians have one representative group, which comprises almost two thirds of all their organic farmers.  That seems to be a difference; there seems to be strong representation.  Perhaps that is a factor.  Perhaps it is just the type of farming they do on the type of land they have, or the fact that they have alpine pastures that are covered in snow for much of the year.  Perhaps it is all those factors together.  However, we have examined and will continue to examine the Austrian model.</p> <p>  We are open to constructive suggestions.  If there are arrangements we need to change, we will consider them.  We believe the combination of GLAS, TAMS and the organic farming scheme, particularly considering the capital investment opportunities for organic farmers that are not available for other farmers and the ring-fenced processing money that is not available for other areas, should in itself stimulate interest.  If after the mid-term review of the rural development programme we find an insufficient uptake, we will need to determine what we need to change.  However, we have an open mind.</p></speech>

The comment on grazing in the mountains and hills was fascinating.  I wonder whether Senators, Deputies and the farming community as a whole are aware that organic animals can graze alongside non-organic animals up on the hills.  I was not aware of it.  There is a hell of a difference between the price of organic lamb and non-organic or regular lamb.</p></speech>

I realise that when one gets 75% of one's payments, one has to send in the form.  What is the reason for it?  Does the Department subsidise the organic bodies?  I asked that earlier but the delegates may have omitted to answer.</p><p>As with a farmer who draws down the single farm payment, for example, why can this not be looked after by the Department?  Is it true that if one is coming to the end of one&rsquo;s organic farming arrangement, one gets priority in applying for GLAS?  If organic farmers get into GLAS now, will they be kicked out of it if they decide to get out of organic farming when their schemes end in January or February, for example?</p></speech>

As with every other priority or environmental asset one might have, such as a bird action or a Natura action, if that action gets one in ahead of anybody else there is a requirement to keep it for the duration of the contract.  Similarly, if one has used organics to get into tier 1 of the system, one is expected to honour that over the period, to be fair to the farmers who were not allowed in.</p></speech>

The presentation outlined what had happened, and it reflected on and dealt with every issue raised by the Irish Organic Farmers &amp;amp; Growers Organisation.

Our meeting has been convened today to discuss the policy issues arising from the Cemetery Management Bill 2013 and related matters.  At 3.15 p.m. there will be a minute's silence in the Chamber as an expression of sympathy for the victims of the Paris atrocities.  I put members on notice that this committee will join in with that.  It is proposed that, if not previously concluded, this session will be brought to a conclusion at 3.30 p.m., as the Select Sub-Committee on Finance will be meeting here to discuss the Finance Bill 2015.  As a result of the late start, we are under a particular time restriction.</p><p>I welcome the following witnesses to the meeting: from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, Ms Mary Hurley, assistant secretary, community division and Ms David Dalton, principal officer, community division; from the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority, Ms Isolde Goggin, the chairperson, Mr. John Shine, director of advocacy and market intelligence, and Ms Haiyan Wang, head of unit, consumer enforcement division; from the Irish Monumental Firms Association, Mr. David Pierce of Pierce Monuments, Mr. John Sweeney of Craft Monuments and Mr. Gerry Brennan of Headstones Ireland; and from the Dublin Cemeteries Committee, Mr. John Green, chairman, and Mr. George McCullough, chief executive.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has supplied a written submission.</p><p>I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  It is proposed that the opening statements and any other documents that may be provided by witnesses be published on the committee website after the meeting.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>I now call Ms Mary Hurley from the Department to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

I am accompanied today by Mr. David Dalton, principal officer in the Department&rsquo;s community division, with specific responsibility for, <i>inter alia</i>, local government community services and the regulation of local authority burial grounds.<br/><br/>The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has policy and legislative responsibility for the regulation of local authority burial grounds.  This responsibility covers a range of technical aspects related to the operation of burial grounds but does not extend to matters related to the funeral industry generally.  The main legislative provisions in respect of burial grounds are contained in the Public Health (Ireland) Act 1878, as amended by Part 6 of the Local Government (Sanitary Services) Act 1948, the Local Government Act 1994 and in the rules and regulations for the Regulation of Burial Grounds 1888 and the relevant amending regulations.</p><p>The legislation provides that local authorities are burial boards for their respective functional areas.  They have sole responsibility for providing, managing, regulating and controlling burial grounds in their areas.  In this respect, there has been gradual devolution of functions from central to local government over time, with almost all functions relating to burial grounds exercised locally by local authorities at this stage.<br/><br/>The underpinning legislation has been in place for some time, but it has served us well and continues to do so.  While there have been calls to review the legislation in recent times, it has remained unchanged as the changes proposed were outside the Department&rsquo;s policy and legislative remit.  I believe that this is also the case with the matter before the committee.<br/><br/>The Dublin Cemeteries Committee was established as a body corporate by the The Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act 1970 and is a registered charity for tax purposes.  It currently owns and operates a number of cemeteries in Dublin city and county and has incorporated a number of limited liability companies for the purposes of carrying on certain ancillary funeral related businesses.  A Supreme Court decision in 2009 reaffirmed the capacity of the committee in this regard.  Neither the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government nor Dublin City Council have any function in relation to, or any direct control over, the operation, management, regulation or otherwise of the Dublin cemetery committee or, for that matter, the business of any other private cemetery operator.<br/><br/>As outlined in the explanatory memorandum, the Bill has been introduced primarily for the purposes of regulating competition.  At its heart, therefore, the Bill seeks to address a market regulation and competition matter in the funeral industry and to level the playing field between private businesses.  The Department has no policy responsibility in this regard and the proposal to vest responsibility for such a regulator in the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government, therefore, is not consistent, in our view, with the scope of the Minister&rsquo;s responsibility <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the operation and management of burial grounds.<br/><br/>As stated, the primary purpose of the Bill is to provide for the establishment of a cemeteries regulator.  First, there is no policy or other need for a cemeteries regulator in respect of local authority or ecclesiastical authority burial grounds which constitute the majority of burial grounds in the State.  Second, the introduction of a regulator for such a limited number of operators and at a time when Government is actively pursuing measures to reduce the number of State agencies and control the number of State employees would appear to run counter to Government policy to reduce the number of such authorities.  Third, a regulator would require a staffing structure and other necessary administrative supports, all giving rise to a potentially significant cost to the Exchequer.  Given the clear purpose of the proposed regulator to regulate competition between private businesses, it appears to duplicate the statutory remit of the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  Indeed, the commission has responded to a complaint of anti-competitive practices by Dublin Cemeteries Committee and made recommendations in this regard.<br/><br/>I do not believe that the competition matters the Bill seeks to address come within the policy or legislative responsibility of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  For this reason, I have not dealt with the technical or legal issues and other matters of concern arising from the Bill.  However, I am happy to detail these briefly if it would be of assistance to the committee as part of the broader discussion on the Bill today.  Given the breadth of policy and technical issues arising from the matter we are here to discuss, I believe a wider consideration by other Departments of the proposals reflected in the Bill is also imperative.<br/><br/>I thank the committee once again for its invitation to participate in this discussions.  I hope the foregoing will assist the committee in its deliberations and both my colleague, David Dalton, and I will be happy to deal with any queries that might arise in the course of subsequent discussions and which come within the remit of the Department.</p></speech>

We are very pleased to be here on the occasion of the Cemetery Management Bill 2013.  I am accompanied by my colleague, Mr. John Shine, who is the director of our advocacy and market intelligence division, and Ms Haiyan Wang, who is the head of investigation in our competition enforcement division.</p> <p>  We are a relatively new organisation having been formed at the end of October 2014 from the amalgamation of what was then the Competition Authority and the National Consumer Agency.</p><p>The mission of the commission is to make markets work better for consumers and businesses, and our vision is for open and competitive markets where consumers are protected and empowered and businesses actively compete.  We have brought together the competition and consumer protection roles of the two legacy organisations.<br/><br/>I will outline our past involvement in the sector and will move on to our view on the question of regulation.  Funeral-related services are a bit different from run-of-the-mill services that people buy.  A lot of the advice to consumers on our website, <i>www.ccpc.ie</i>, is to shop around, but one cannot say that to somebody in a situation of bereavement, as they are very sensitive purchases that consumers have to make in very difficult and stressful circumstances.  They may be particularly vulnerable and be unsure of what they need to do.  They may be very dependent on the service provider, which is normally a funeral director or a provider of cemetery services, to guide them through the process.  As such, it is very important to have transparency and compliance with competition and consumer law in the sector.<br/><br/>From an enforcement point of view, the commission conducted a detailed investigation, over a number of years, into alleged anti-competitive practices by Glasnevin Trust.  This was concluded to our satisfaction in March 2015 with the agreement of Glasnevin Trust to a number of remedial measures.  Details of the case are available on the website, but I will summarise the main aspects.  The case arose from a complaint received in November 2011 in which it was alleged that Glasnevin Trust and its subsidiary, Glasnevin Cemetery Monument Works Limited, GCMW, were engaged in anti-competitive practices which were designed to put competing headstone providers, in particular, at a competitive disadvantage.  It was alleged that this amounted to an abuse of dominance by the trust, contrary to the Competition Act.  We carried out a detailed preliminary assessment and, subsequently, a formal investigation.  We engaged with Glasnevin Trust and sought and secured a number of remedial measures from them.  The measures related to the provision of burial plots, headstones and headstone foundations and were designed to mitigate the alleged anti-competitive practices, ensure the protection of consumers and increase transparency.<br/><br/>The measures included the requirement that Glasnevin Trust make its prices more transparent to consumers, making it easier for consumers to find a price list for burial plots and foundation fees on its website and in its offices.  In addition, given that many funeral directors were acting on behalf of the bereaved families, Glasnevin Trust was required to take measures to ensure that funeral directors informed consumers of the separate cost of the foundation fee, because the degree of transparency around the foundation fee had been an issue.  Before applying for burial services in Dublin City Council cemeteries, funeral directors were required to confirm to the council that they had informed consumers of the foundation cost.  Third, Glasnevin Trust was to treat competing headstone providers in an equal and non-discriminatory manner in terms of waiting times for permits and foundations and access to the cemetery.  Finally, the trust was to allow competing headstone providers to advertise in their promotional brochures subject to payment of the same fees as would be paid by GCMW, its own subsidiary, for the same advertising.  Based on these measures, we were satisfied to conclude the investigation in early 2015 without any further action being required.  The commission also corresponded with the Irish Monumental Firms Association, setting out our position on the issues that had been raised.  <br/><br/>Mindful of the potential vulnerability of consumers at a particularly stressful time, we also provide information to consumers in a dedicated area of our website called &quot;Planning a Funeral&quot; and we have recently added material relating to succession planning.  We operate a helpline for consumers which deals with over 50,000 contacts per annum, from very general inquiries to specific complaints alleging breaches of consumer law.  On average we get some ten contacts per annum on funeral-related issues.  There is no pattern in this respect and the issues raised seem to be one-off issues.  We have not received anything to suggest there are substantive issues relating to breaches of consumer law.<br/><br/>That is the history of our involvement in the sector from the point of view of competition and the consumer.  Our remit covers the entire economy, so if there are competition or consumer issues we are already there to deal with them.  On the necessity for regulation, the purpose of the Bill is to establish a cemeteries regulator to provide for the licensing of cemetery authorities and to specify management stipulations for such authorities, to promote competition and to provide for related matters.  Competition law and consumer welfare are already within our remit.</p><p>We have no information that would indicate there are substantive issues that merit the creation of a new regulatory authority.  That is not to say that issues causing detriment to consumers might not exist.  Rather, that we do not believe a sufficiently strong case has been made to justify the proposal for a specific regulator.  As a general principle, we believe regulation should be adopted only as a last resort where there are very serious shortcomings in the sector and in circumstances where existing measures have proven incapable of addressing such issues.  Regulation can go too far.  It can impose restrictions on entry to a market that can actually damage competition, leading to cost increases, inefficiencies, lower service quality and general detriment to consumers.  Regulation must be paid for.  My colleague from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government mentioned that it might cost the Exchequer.  In my experience, however, a regulator for a very specific sector is usually paid for by a levy on industry or on businesses in the sector.  That leads to increased costs and these may outweigh the benefits.  We recommend that any proposal to introduce new regulatory structures should be progressed only after very careful consideration of the necessity for and implications of such an initiative.</p><p> I will now turn to a couple of specific concerns that strike us in regard to the current proposals.  We understand the key concerns informing the Bill relate to alleged anti-competitive practices in the cemetery industry and, in particular, Glasnevin Trust's engagement in ancillary commercial activities, namely, commercial activities in which there are also other firms engaged.  There is a danger of duplication of existing statutory functions.  We are the statutory authority with responsibility for enforcing competition law and consumer law in the State.  We very much urge anybody who has any concerns about potential breaches of either competition or consumer law to bring them to our attention.  We have the power to investigate and we have done so in the past.  The Bill envisages a role for the proposed regulator that would duplicate some of the statutory functions.</p><p> Parties have a right of private action before the courts.  As a result, it is not always necessary for a regulator to act on behalf of aggrieved parties.  Parties can take action themselves, certainly in regard to competition law and some aspects of consumer law.</p><p> On effectiveness and proportionality, an issue arises regarding the coverage of the proposed Bill.  It defines a cemetery authority as being any company, committee or body - other than a local authority, a town or borough council or an ecclesiastical authority - that is engaged, pursuant to statute or otherwise, in the management, operation or occupation of a cemetery.  Our understanding is that Dublin is a specific case.  Many of the cemeteries outside the Dublin area are either local authority owned or ecclesiastically owned and consequently would not be covered by the Bill.  Within the Dublin area, it seems the impact would mainly be on Glasnevin Trust.</p><p> The Bill proposes to restrict the regulated entities with charitable status from engaging in ancillary commercial services at cemeteries.  Again, Glasnevin Trust appears to be the only cemetery operation with charitable status in the Dublin area.  Engagement by charitable organisations in commercial activities is not, in itself, anti-competitive.  We must bear in mind that operating a cemetery is, by its nature, a very long-term business.  In some cases, the trusts or organisations involved are required to maintain the cemetery in perpetuity.  Therefore, it does not seem unreasonable for the operator to try to find some kind of ancillary commercial activities to fund the maintenance of cemetery grounds that perhaps no longer generate sufficient income from burial plots, particularly the older ones.  The funding requirement is likely to be higher for cemeteries of an historic nature and they generally require more maintenance.  They are not so easily maintained as the modern ones.</p><p> As I mentioned when talking about the four measures that had been agreed with Glasnevin Trust in order to promote competition and protect consumers, those concerned have undertaken to treat competing headstone providers in an equal and non-discriminatory fashion.  We would be very happy to engage with any of the other cemetery operators if similar issues arise elsewhere and explain to them how they can meet similar requirements.</p><p> Regulation should not be an end in itself.  In considering any proposals for additional regulation, any perceived failings in the sector should be clearly identified.  It should be clearly demonstrated that such issues cannot be adequately addressed within the existing legislative environment before we contemplate additional regulation.  Any such regulation will come at a cost.  No matter how it is constructed, it is likely in the end to be borne by the consumer.</p><p>We think that any proposal for further regulation would merit careful consideration and the conduct of a regulatory impact assessment.</p><p> In regard to the cemetery sector, we are of the view that the case for further regulation has not been sufficiently articulated and that further examination would be required before proceeding any further.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-17a.187" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David Pierce" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015111700002#H00300"><p>Chairman, Members of the Oireachtas and invited guests, we, the Irish Monumental Firms Association, are here to seek help in achieving a level playing field, fair competition, fair procedures and an end to a charity dominating the headstone trade.  Cemeteries, by their nature, are anti-competitive.  Everybody goes to his or her local cemetery.  If it becomes ridiculously expensive, the market does not correct itself.  That is why we need a regulator.  Planners will not give permission to open a new cemetery in a locality where an existing one is still viable.  Therefore, the business of operating a cemetery is outside the normal checks and balances of a competitive environment.<br/><br/>We are a group of ten headstone businesses based all over Dublin.  We are struggling to survive in business, most of us having had our turnovers decimated.  The Dublin Cemeteries Committee, DCC, trading as Glasnevin Trust, is the main reason we are on the verge of collapse.  The DCC is a private statutory body and a charity controlling four of the largest cemeteries in Dublin, namely, Glasnevin, Palmerstown, Newlands Cross and Dardistown at Dublin Airport.  It does not pay corporation tax; we do.  It does not pay rates on its showrooms and factories; we do.  The DCC uses burial data to send brochures to relatives of the deceased.  We do not have access to that information.  It has huge displays inside its cemeteries and its registrars double up as salespeople, pitting them against us on a daily basis.  Until recently, it received 12.5% commission when selling a grave or a headstone.  Some of the staff can have wages of &euro;2,000 a week.  It insists on doing foundations for our headstones, charging us &euro;1,000 in Glasnevin.  We have offered to pour these foundations for &euro;80.  It charges us &euro;500 to spend a day working in its cemeteries.  We have to pass these outrageous fees on to the bereaved of Dublin.  It insists on doing all work on stone cremation walls.  We are not allowed work on any cremation plots, even though this is the only growing part of our business.  It has begun to sell pre-erected blank headstones on graves.  This totally excludes us from the market.  No other cemetery operator anywhere allows this.  So far seven monumental firms within close proximity to Glasnevin have closed.  Just last year, Farrell's of Glasnevin, which had been in business for 126 years, had to shut down.<br/><br/>We are not allowed meet potential customers in the DCC's cemeteries.  We are not allowed take photographs of our completed work.  The DCC has, over the years and for spurious reasons, barred seven Dublin monumental firms for operating in its cemeteries.  These firms have never been in any dispute nor ever even queried by any other cemetery owners.  Kerry County Council operates more than 130 cemeteries and Fingal County Council operates more than 30 and none of them has ever had any reason to ban firms or men from going about their business.  The evidence strongly suggests that when a body is both regulator and competitor, it cannot be trusted to be fair and impartial.<br/><br/>There are many more examples of abuse of Dublin sculptors, far too many to mention.  The firm I represent has seen its turnover drop from &euro;1.3 million to &euro;350,000.  It could be said that, through loss of earnings, Dublin sculptors have contributed more to Glasnevin than anybody else.  Glasnevin Trust has taken our trade, aided and abetted by the State.  The Oireachtas has given the DCC a far better deal than Apple or Google has received.<br/><br/>Some 115 years ago, Theodore Roosevelt, the 26th US President, said:</p><blockquote>Artificial bodies ... depending upon any statutory law for their existence or privileges, should be subject to proper governmental supervision ... in the interests of the whole people, the Nation should ... assume power of supervision and regulation over ... [such bodies].  This is especially true where the corporation derives a portion of its wealth from the existence of some monopolistic element or tendency in its business.</blockquote> <p>Over the years we have written to the DCC.  We have suggested arbitration and we even suggested a yearly voluntary contribution by us if it were to stop selling monuments.  The last correspondence we sent to it was nearly two years ago.  It answered us with a solicitor's letter, sent to our individual homes and business addresses, not our association's office, threatening to sue us personally if we continue to protest about it.</p><p>As we said in our opening statement, the Dublin Cemeteries Committee now owns and controls five cemeteries and when it doubles in size again, we will no longer exist.  It is now by far the largest provider of burials and cremations in Ireland and its monumental firm is also the largest in Ireland.  It now sells headstones tax and rates-free all over Dublin and beyond, not just in its own cemeteries but in cemeteries from Balbriggan to Bray.  It has now branched into boulders for housing estates and nameplates for houses, all tax-free.</p><p> We ask the Oireachtas to pass the Cemetery Management Bill as it is the correct action to take.  New South Wales in Australia and New Zealand have recently introduced new cemetery regulators.  In the D&aacute;il debate, some Deputies hoped this would not be another quango, but the DCC is the oldest quango in Ireland.  It is a body of perpetual succession, with no role for a Minister.  Is it a case of swapping an unaccountable quango for an accountable one?  In The Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act 1970, the Oireachtas entered into a bargain with the owners of Glasnevin Cemetery, conferring powers on it but with no safeguards for anybody whose private interests could be destroyed by it.  To compound the problem, the Oireachtas allowed it to become our competitor with a tax exemption and regulator not answerable to any power in the land.</p><p> Heretofore, when the State interfered in a trade or business, the affected parties received some sort of compensation.  For example, those involved with farming, fishing and turf-cutting and even taxi drivers received tax concessions after deregulation.  Make no mistake, Members of the Oireachtas have interfered in our trade and they must make it right.  We are not looking for compensation and we just want fair play and the opportunity for firms to survive.  We sculptors are not out of step but the Oireachtas is, as no other country in the world allows a charity to sell headstones.  An expert on competition and consumer affairs stated that charities must raise money.  Glasnevin Cemetery is a member of what are called the historical cemeteries of Europe, and that group comprises 150 cemeteries.  The other 149 cemeteries do not sell headstones as their staff see it is unethical and immoral.  They do not interfere in the trade.</p><p> I had much more to say but I will change my plan.  In August 1988, at the age of 24, I set up a headstone business in Swords, County Dublin.  Business went very well and over time my turnover reached &euro;1.3 million, with ten employees.  I erected headstones in cemeteries in north County Dublin and north Dublin city.  The Dublin Cemeteries Committee opened a large cemetery in Dardistown, just beside Swords.  At the time, I considered this to be a good opportunity but two years after opening the cemetery, the DCC erected just inside the main entrance a large display of new monuments for sale to the bereaved.  It erected signs suggesting that when the monuments are purchased from it, the graveyard would be better maintained than if they were purchased from me or my colleagues.  My first exposure to the power of the DCC was when I met a family in the cemetery who wanted to see some of my recently erected monuments.  I received a phone call the next day to say that if I ever met a family in the cemetery again, I would be barred from all the DCC cemeteries.</p><p> Most of the members of this Oireachtas committee would be familiar with their local sculptors and cemetery.  Imagine if the sculptor were not allowed to discuss a headstone with a client or family in a local cemetery.  That would not happen anywhere else in Ireland and it is why Glasnevin Trust, as it now calls itself, cannot be both regulator and competitor.  A few weeks later I was taking some photographs of my recently erected monuments and the following day I received a phone call indicating that no photography was allowed in the cemetery.  This was all the more galling as Glasnevin Trust has pictures of my work all over its offices.  Sculptors all over Ireland inscribe trade names and phone numbers in small letters on the side or base of newly erected work, as this is historically the best way of selling monuments.  I was told not to put my phone number on monuments or I would be barred.  Again, this does not happen anywhere else and it is why Glasnevin Trust cannot be both regulator and competitor.</p><p> It has been suggested that we have room to go to the courts.  Glasnevin had a so-called Irish stone rule and although I will not bore members with the details, it dropped the rule when I took the matter to court.  I was left paying &euro;16,000 as a new business.  The legislation is the 1970 Act and there are no internal or external safeguards for us.  The Competition Authority has told us it cannot help us and the issue is one of state aid rather than competition.  The Revenue Commissioners will not talk to us about this because of client confidentiality.</p><p>We do not want to know anything about the tax affairs of Glasnevin; we are just saying a charity should not sell monuments.  With regard to charities trading, Glasnevin does not have to sell headstones.  There are many other monumental sculptors.  It can raise money other ways.  How come 149 other members of the historical cemeteries of Europe think it is unethical to sell monuments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-17a.190" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Green" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015111700002#K00200"><p>I express my condolences to the Chairman on his recent loss.</p> <p>  I am chairman of Glasnevin Trust.  Glasnevin Trust is the business name of the Dublin Cemeteries Committee, established under the Dublin Cemeteries Committee Act 1970, which followed on from the earlier 1846 Act.  Glasnevin Trust manages the operations of the cemeteries in Goldenbridge, Glasnevin, Palmerstown, Dardistown and Newlands Cross.  It operates solely by reference to the public interest in the provision of burial grounds and cremation facilities, as well as the maintenance of Ireland&rsquo;s historic national cemeteries at Glasnevin and Goldenbridge.  Glasnevin Trust is run by an executive management team and the Dublin Cemeteries Committee.  I am joined today by Mr. George McCullough, the CEO of the trust.</p> <p>  Glasnevin Trust manages the burial and cremation, now running at a 50:50 ratio, of approximately 4,000 people annually.  This accounts for less than 30% of the burials in Dublin and the immediate surrounding counties.  The remainder of burials in the Dublin area are carried out in cemeteries owned, operated and subvented by local authorities or in a few privately run cemeteries.</p> <p>  Glasnevin Trust also maintains and preserves the considerable heritage assets in Glasnevin Cemetery, which has become the focal point for many of the commemorative events for the decade of centenaries.  More recently, Glasnevin Trust opened the multi-award-winning Glasnevin Cemetery Museum as a major educational and tourism centre.  The museum attracts more than 100,000 visitors annually and is a significant boost to tourism and the economy on the north side of Dublin.  At our initiative, DNA Dublin's Northside Attractions has been developed and was launched at the world travel market two weeks ago by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Paschal Donohoe.</p> <p>  Glasnevin Trust employs more than 100 people in Dublin.  Companies owned by the trust also offer florist and monument works services to the bereaved, competing in a market where more than 50 registered monumental sculptor companies and hundreds of flower sellers operate.  Glasnevin Trust, in the absence of any other significant development of local authority cemeteries in the Dublin region over the past 30 years, has developed three cemeteries.  These are Palmerstown Cemetery in 1978, Dardistown Cemetery in 1990 and Newlands Cross Cemetery in 2000.  Simultaneously, it introduced and developed cremation in the Dublin area, establishing the first crematorium, Glasnevin Crematorium Limited, in 1982 and Newlands Cross Crematorium Limited in 2001.  Dardistown crematorium is scheduled to open in 2016.</p> <p>  Glasnevin Trust is a statutory and voluntary not-for-profit body, originally established by Daniel O&rsquo;Connell in 1828.  In recent times, Glasnevin Trust, with the invaluable assistance of the Government and the OPW, has overseen the restoration of Glasnevin Cemetery from a dilapidated state to the sanctuary of peace, dignity and reconciliation it is today  The trust&rsquo;s role remains as it was handed down from Daniel O&rsquo;Connell, to bury people of all religions and none, and to ensure that we bury and cremate the dead with dignity and respect.  We believe the ultimate dignity for the deceased is paramount and burial grounds need to be maintained and funded on a sustainable basis.  Many burial grounds operated by local authorities can only survive with significant direct financial subvention from the local authority budgets, which in the past year in Dublin and its hinterland amounted to approximately &euro;2.5 million, and throughout the country amounted to some &euro;10.8 million.  I have with me the breakdown of these figures.</p> <p>  In addition to providing burial services, Glasnevin Trust has been working closely with the State in playing its part in the decade of remembrance.  Glasnevin Trust, true to its mission of serving people from all creeds, beliefs and walks of life, has been central to a number of State commemorative ceremonies.  These have ranged from the commemoration of Irish men and women who lost their lives in the First World War, to Collins and Griffith and, just this summer, the State remembrance of the centenary of the burial of Jeremiah O&rsquo;Donovan Rossa as the opening centrepiece for the 1916 commemorations.  In addition to this is the 100th anniversary of Cumann Na mBan, and a multiplicity of commemorations of national importance are held, on a regular basis, at Glasnevin Cemetery.</p> <p>  This work will continue right through the 1916 centenary commemorations, with a number of major projects scheduled, among them being the necrology wall for 1916-1923.</p><p>This will remember, in a totally non-judgmental manner, all who lost their lives during the struggle for independence in the period 1916-1923.  In addition, Glasnevin Cemetery will be the site for the opening of the governmental commemorations on Easter Sunday morning 2016.  I give this by way of background and explanation as to the role of Glasnevin Trust in the life and history of Dublin and its people since its foundation in 1828.  </p><p> I will turn specifically to the purpose of this meeting, that is, to elicit views on the policy issues arising from the Cemeteries Management Bill 2013 and related matters.  I understand that this is a Private Members' Bill advanced by Deputy Maloney.  There are a number of important regulatory issues concerning burials and cremations which have not been addressed in this Bill.  For example, Glasnevin Trust has identified the need for a new regulatory structure for cremations in Ireland.  At the current time, this area is totally unregulated despite its increasing demand.  In Dublin last year, 50% of deceased people were cremated.  We have previously engaged with the Government, from Deputy to ministerial level, for cemetery regulation and proper cremation regulation, and we believe this is an area being progressed by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.</p><p> This Bill, as set out, has a very narrow focus and does not address the broad issue impacting on burial grounds and cremation services.  It concentrates solely on a small number of burial grounds, including private burial grounds, private family burial grounds, burial grounds run by a charitable trust, Glasnevin Trust and Jewish burial grounds.  Glasnevin Trust, together with Mount Jerome, Mount Venus, Kilmashogue, Dolphin&rsquo;s Barn, Ballybough and Woodtown, would be covered by the Bill, but all others would be expressly excluded.  The Bill proposes to exclude from regulation local authority, ecclesiastical and religious orders&rsquo; cemeteries.   Thus the Bill, as a matter of fact, proposes to regulate fewer than 10% of the burials in the State and a tiny percentage of all burial grounds. </p><p> The policy basis for such a narrow focus has not been made clear.  During the D&aacute;il debate on the Bill, certain comments were made about Glasnevin Trust.  It it is important that I address them as many are based on a very distorted and selective view of our operations.  At the heart of these complaints is a protracted challenge that the trust has faced from an individual monumental sculptor, supported by a minority of those in the monumental industry, who contends that the manner in which Glasnevin Trust regulates the cemeteries we operate is illegal.  It has variously claimed that Glasnevin Trust has breached Irish and EU competition law and that the trust was generally operating outside the law.  It has brought its case to the European Commission, the Irish Competition Authority, the High Court and the Supreme Court, which have all ruled in our favour.  Laterally, following a further complaint to the Competition Authority in 2011, now the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the commission stated that it had a number of concerns and made four recommendations to Glasnevin Trust, all of which have been fully complied with.  </p><p> In conclusion, I reiterate the absolute commitment of Glasnevin Trust to continue to bury and cremate people, of all denominations and none, with dignity.  We will ensure that all of the burial grounds in our care are maintained to the highest standards, so that the families of the bereaved will continue to have a peaceful and  compassionate environment in which to mourn and remember their loved ones for generations to come, or as our mission statement says "[T]o preserve the past for future generations".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-11-17a.192" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1038" speakername="Eamonn Maloney" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2015111700002#L00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their contributions.  We would not be discussing this issue if there was not a problem within the headstone industry.  Ms Hurley stated quite rightly in her contribution that the responsibility for graves, etc., in Ireland is the direct responsibility of local government.  I am not blaming anyone here for the sins of Queen Victoria, Daniel O'Connell, or anyone else, but we would not be having this discussion if historically the Department had dealt with this, especially in 1970 when a Private Members' Bill came before the House.</p><p>I dare say to the people to my right and left, as legislators, that if anyone was to try to introduce a private Bill in the House in this day and age, that person would not get as far as the stairs leading up to the D&aacute;il Chamber.  Anyway, this was the sort of thing that happened in the 1970s.  In this case the private Bill served to extend the protection of Glasnevin Trust and its influence and activity.  It afforded protection to the trust that was not available to any other body.  It is extraordinary.  Despite all the good work that Glasnevin Trust has been undertaken historically, it moved into a certain position.  This followed the 1970 private Act, which was passed unanimously in the House.  It was not drafted by any legislator but was drafted outside the House, something that speaks for itself.</p><p> I will condense the argument.  The 1970 Act bestowed on Glasnevin Trust a collection of new activities.  The trust could borrow money, buy property, etc.  These were functions it did not have up to that point.  The Act allowed the trust to engage in commercial activity.  The people on my left who have made submissions know the story of all their colleagues who had companies that have gone out of business since the 1970s.  The Act bestowed a privilege on one body that was not conferred on other bodies.  This has already been alluded to by one or two people.  What has happened since the early 1980s is that in the greater Dublin area almost 20 companies have gone out of business.  These companies employed people, paid taxes and so on.  They did not have charitable status, and they no longer exist.  Without being too humorous about it, they did not go out of business because people stopped dying.  They went out of business because they could not compete.  I cited as an example Mr. Pierce's letter in respect of the case in Swords.  It showed the inequality of this situation.  That is why we are before the committee today debating the matter.</p><p> The Department has failed to regulate unequal competition in the sector.  A registered charity has a special tax status, something the firms represented today do not.  It was a trust.  Other than one or two names, I do not know who is a member of the trust.  I know it is established in perpetuity as well.</p><p> We cannot compare like with like.  What happened in 1970 is something that we, as legislators, have to change in the interests of fairness.  It is not a simple matter for the Department or a question of blaming local authorities, although I believe it should have been rectified historically, because of what has happened since 1970.  Anyway, it is up to us now to rectify the matter.</p><p> This country has gone through great change and turmoil.  The word "quango" has been mentioned once or twice.  My difficulty with quangos is that we have not got rid of enough of them, but that is for another day.  Anyway, we have to rectify this on the basis of justice and fairness.  In no sector of Irish society should bestowing special private Acts on one body be permissible.  It is unfair.  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

I have some questions before I make my comments.  The basis of Ms Hurley's statement is that there is no issue anywhere outside Dublin and therefore the legislation is misplaced.  In other words, it is not suitable for a regulatory body to be established as a national body when the difficulty only appears to be an issue in Dublin.  I concur fully.  The purpose of the legislation was an attempt by the gentlemen to my left who have made witness statements today to try to address the matter, having tried every other angle within their means to address the inequality in the Dublin market.</p><p>In that context, I ask the witnesses to go back and have a look.  It may be that we need to repeal the 1970 Act to rectify matters.  I ask the witnesses to come back to us with further advice as to what should be done to address the anomalies that have been raised today.</p><p> Ms Goggin had a formal complaint made to her and an investigation was pursued.  Her final statement referred to the four things Glasnevin Trust is going to do arising from the investigation.  The trust has undertaken to treat competing headstone providers in an equal and non-discriminatory manner.  Does that mean the trust acknowledges that prior to the investigation it was not treating headstone manufacturers in the Dublin region equally and in a fair manner?  Ms Goggin's comments on the investigation would be very useful to the committee and allow us to ascertain whether the legislation needs to go forward from Second Stage.</p><p> I thank Mr. Gerry Brennan and Mr. David Pierce.  This is not our first meeting.  We have been meeting over the last number of years.  To say that they have pursued most graciously simply to be treated at least fairly would be an understatement.  I wish them very well in their endeavours.</p><p> Nearly everything Mr. Green said is true.  Glasnevin Cemetery is a credit to the organisation running it.  However, there is a definite inequality in the way it operates by comparison to some of the competitors in the same business.  Fundamentally, why is Glasnevin Cemetery in the business of selling monuments and flowers?  The Act that bestowed on the organisation all of the gratuities it did in the 1970s does not necessitate the cemetery being in a competitive business with regard to manufacturing and installing monuments and selling flowers inside the premises for no other reason than to make a profit in something.  It is a commercial activity in which the trust is competing on an uneven playing field with people who are trying to make their livelihoods and have been in the same market in Dublin for generations.</p><p> How much is Glasnevin's salary bill on an annual basis in comparison to the overall running costs?  Why does Glasnevin not publish in a transparent and open way the actual running costs and profits from the businesses that are part of the overall trust?  What is actually done with those profits?  How are they reinvested and what are they reinvested in?  Why are salaries and operating costs not published?  Why is there an element of secrecy around the trust and who are the body of people on it?  I do not understand what the purpose of the secrecy is.  Mr. Green might explain that to the committee.</p><p> Arising from the letter he wrote, I ask Mr. Pierce about the following.  The trust has claimed that it has never treated Pierce Monuments unfairly.  The day after Mr. Pierce was there meeting a potential client, he received the letter warning him not to do so again.  What happened thereafter?  What happened after he received the e-mail telling him not to dare to take photographs in the trust's cemeteries again?  What happened after he received the communication telling him that he was not allowed to place a plaque on his monuments?  What communications and clarifications were given to him by the trust arising from that?  What were the reasons for it and how did it affect his business?</p></speech>

That has the potential to increase costs for people.  At the moment, if I hear complaints about anything, they are about the cost of funerals rather than that of erecting headstones.  Funerals take place at a time when people cannot shop around, which is the point that was made by Ms Goggin.  We must be very careful not to do something that will achieve the reverse of what is intended.</p><p>I expect that issues would arise in this regard, for example, with regard to extending oversight by such a regulatory authority to church-owned property, which I do not believe would be possible.  </p><p> On Glasnevin Cemetery, I echo some of the points made regarding the maintenance of the cemetery.  The original concept behind Glasnevin Cemetery was very enlightened because at that time people feared being buried owing to the burial practices common at the time.  Glasnevin Cemetery makes an important historical contribution, not only for the more celebrated people who are buried there but also for ordinary people.  I should declare an interest in that some of the bones of my ancestors reside in Palmerstown and Glasnevin cemeteries.  I expect a few other people in the room are in a similar position.  </p><p> Clearly, research has been done on comparable historical cemeteries.  Is public funding provided for the maintenance of similar cemeteries?  In Ireland, we tend to do things in a way that avoids the use of public funding.  Do the business operations at Glasnevin Cemetery contribute to the maintenance and upkeep of the cemetery in lieu of public funding for maintenance?  All of us will agree that the cemetery is maintained to a high standard.  I echo the view that its new buildings have been a great addition.  What contribution does the business make to the expenditure required to maintain the cemetery?  Are other income streams available for expenditure on maintenance?  If the Glasnevin Trust is a charitable trust, it is not for individual shareholders to make a profit.  There is, however, a question mark hanging over this issue.</p><p> The last thing we want to do is add to the cost faced by individuals.  If, however, the cost is to be borne by taxpayers, we need to know what dynamic is at play.  I expect competition would be the more fruitful option.  Serious concerns have been raised by previous speakers.  The introduction of competition appears to be a more viable option than the introduction of a regulatory authority as the latter could increase costs and the shortfall would have to be made up from public funds.  Given that some of the national cultural institutions, which are to play a role in the decade of centenary celebrations, are struggling financially, it is difficult to see from where such public funding would come.  Those are my observations.</p></speech>

As the only person from Glasnevin in the room, I acknowledge the great job the Glasnevin Trust has done in the cemetery, which stands out in all kinds of ways.  I have a number of questions, the first of which is directed at Ms Goggin and the Competition and Consumer Protection Authority.  The authority's four requests to the Glasnevin Trust included that it make its prices clear and inform undertakers of real costs.</p><p>I first became interested in this when I met a very distressed woman who had thought it was going to cost &euro;3,000 to bury her husband but found out that it would cost over &euro;9,000.  This was sprung on her after her husband died suddenly.  </p><p> Are the witnesses satisfied that the headstone providers are being treated equally?  Are they satisfied that the alternative headstone providers are allowed to advertise in trust publications and so forth?</p><p> I understand that we will be suspending shortly to observe a minute's silence-----</p></speech>

May I also ask for a response from Glasnevin Trust to the points raised by Mr. Pierce?  He made some very serious allegations and I am not satisfied that Mr. Green has answered them.  I would ask that we be given answers to those questions.</p> <p>  Does the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government see an issue that needs to be addressed here?  I agree with Deputy Doherty that the fact that it is only a Dublin issue is not an argument for not addressing it, especially given that the cost of funerals is greater in this city than anywhere else in the State by a country mile.  Is the Department happy with the operation of the Glasnevin Trust or is there a need for it to be more open in terms of publishing its finances and so forth?  Is there an inequality in operation in terms of the trust not having to pay taxes and rates?</p></speech>

Deputy Doherty asked whether our investigation meant that there was an acknowledgement from Glasnevin Trust that it had not been doing these things previously.  The short answer is "No."  The slightly longer answer, in terms of law, is that we do not make any findings of a breach of the law.  Our responsibility is to take issues to court.  What was being alleged here was an abuse of dominance.  We would investigate that and if we felt that it was worthwhile bringing a case to court, we would have to go to the High Court and get it to make a finding of dominance in the first place, a finding of an abuse of dominance and then a direction on remedies - that is, what should be done to fix the situation.  Given the costs and the amount of time involved in that process, often what we do is to engage with the parties and try to get them to agree to change the course of action.  That is what we often do, and we publicise it.  We do not go to court just for the sake of it, because often there is no gain for anybody in that.  Sometimes things can be sorted out more quickly with the engagement approach and that is the approach we took in this case.</p> <p>  I am not sure if Deputy Catherine Murphy asked a specific question of our organisation-----</p></speech>

I received a phone call from the registrar to say I had been seen by the chief executive and I was not to be there anymore.  I asked him to put that in writing but he refused to do so.  When I was told about the photography a few weeks later, I asked them to put that in writing also but they refused to do so.  Any time they do something to us, they refuse to put it in writing.  Since that day, myself and other sculptors - I spoke to representatives of Farrell's of Glasnevin last week - have not been allowed to meet potential clients in our local cemeteries.

The Competition Authority said it would get Glasnevin to tell customers that the cemetery fee - say, of &euro;1,000 in Glasnevin - was not included in the price of the grave.  Unless it includes the price of the foundation in the grave, it is no use to us, given that we still have to tell people it costs &euro;1,000.  I see people thinking they will go to Glasnevin to see what deal it can do for them.  It is another useless measure by the Competition Authority.  Glasnevin Trust Monument Works in all the Dublin City Council cemeteries have 40 to 50 monuments inside the gates of the cemetery.  The only thing the Competition Authority can do for us is to insist that either nobody has a display or we all have a display.  Otherwise, it is wasting time and taxpayers' money.</p></speech>

Deputy Regina Doherty asked why we are in the business and I want to join it with a comment Deputy Catherine Murphy made abut the enlightened attitude of Daniel O'Connell.  Daniel O'Connell's view was the same as that of all the cemetery people at the time.  In London, the magnificent seven Victorian cemeteries were opened, and all have failed as joint stock companies.  We decided to be a charity at that time, but we did not take a very prudent decision.  Cemeteries sell graves, and when they run out of space, the shareholders disappear.  Glasnevin Trust, under the Dublin Cemeteries Committee, has been in existence for 180 years, and we intend for it to exist for the next 180 years.  We went into the ancillary business.</p> <p>  The 1970 Act was to ensure the sustainability of Dublin cemeteries.  Since the Act, Shanganagh is the only public authority cemetery to be opened in Dublin.  We went into the business unashamed.  Selling graves is a commercial business.  Many of the thousands of charities listed on the Revenue Commissioners' website are limited companies and hundreds of them are involved in commercial activities.  There is no secrecy about the members of Glasnevin Trust; they are on our website.  If Deputy Maloney wants to engage with us, as Deputy Dowds has done, we can provide all the names and addresses.  I could give them now, although I do not think we have time.</p> <p>  We publish our accounts annually in a format prescribed by the Act and the Charities Regulatory Authority comes in.  After our AGM in 2016, we will publish our accounts in the appropriate form and furnish them to the committee with the 2014 comparators.</p></speech>

We had become aware of all sorts of nefarious practices in the monumental sculpturing business, mostly due to health and safety issues.  In one case, an individual came in with a flat-bed truck and a JCB actor as a crane, which was tipping over as it was lifting stones.  We had to examine what we were doing.  We have a code of practice and monumental by-laws.  Every cemetery has a set of monumental by-laws which dictate who can erect a monument, on which grave it can be erected and what can be said in the inscription, for the orderly management of the cemetery.</p><p>In other words, is one entitled to put a headstone up on a grave?  That has to be checked.  It has to go through the records and all the systems of control, such as safety statements, vehicle registration, Safe Pass, health and safety, and, most importantly, insurance to us and to members of the public.  We introduced a registration process in which any monumental sculptor could register with us under health and safety and a code of practice to abide by our by-laws and insurance.  We introduced that on 13 June 2006.  There were 16 sculptors registered, including Glasnevin Cemetery monument works.  We now have 22 or 23 sculptors registered.  They are registered sculptors that are on our books at Glasnevin, Palmerstown, Newlands Cross and Dardistown.  There are another 30 <i>ad hoc</i>sculptors - not only monumental sculptors but sculptors who carry out work occasionally in our cemeteries, which is usually of a very high quality - who comply with the exact same conditions.  To say that Glasnevin Trust, Glasnevin Cemetery or Dublin Cemeteries Committee have put monumental sculptors out of business is not correct.  Added to that, many of the funeral directors who operate in Dublin city now sell monuments.  Fanagan's, Kirwan's, Nichol's and all of the funeral directors in the greater Dublin area sell monuments, generally for members of the monumental stonemasons' alliance.  Added to that, cremation has increased by 50% so up to 50% fewer people are buying monuments.  The monument business is contracting.  <br/><br/>Mr. Pierce alluded to the by-laws of Dardistown Cemetery in his statement.  When we opened Dardistown Cemetery in 1990 we introduced a by-law that only indigenous stone could be used.  Mr. Pierce and his colleagues rigorously objected to that.  We had no axe to grind and had nothing to make on it.We do not run quarries or supply stone to the stone industry.  Its purpose was to encourage more art and more use of indigenous stone because we foresaw that Indian and Chinese mass-produced stone, which some people would call blood stone or slavery stone, would come into this country and replace the native stone from Kerry, Cork, Galway, Limerick, or Donegal, and all the small, usually farmer-run quarries around the country.  We were quite right.  It has disappeared.  We stepped back from that by-law because of the furore that resulted from sectoral interests in the stone business.  That resulted in Mr. Pierce talking direct action again the Dublin Cemeteries Committee through the Competition Authority in 1991, through the European competition authority in 1991 and 1992, more recently through the Competition Authority in 2011 and 2013, and through the High Court and the Supreme Court, all of which found in favour of Glasnevin Trust.  This Bill is pointed directly at Glasnevin Trust and at no one else, apart from a few of the others from other cemeteries around the country.  Mr. Pierce took an action against Dublin Cemeteries Committee in the Supreme Court, which ruled in our favour.  This Bill is designed to overturn the decision of the Supreme Court.  It is as simple as that.</p></speech>

I am talking about the dual funding issue when a body has some funding from commercial activities and some from the State or from another area.  It is outside our remit.  We investigate its behaviour on the market and whether it has the object or effect of preventing, restricting or distorting competition.  On the point about the brochures, the agreements that we reached were aimed at levelling the playing field.  We were not trying to set the price for advertising, because that would not be our remit, but to level the playing field between that company and others.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned issues around transparency and paying the foundation fee upfront.</p><p>I may not have understood the Chairman correctly but I do not think we would have the power to instruct that a certain fee be paid up front.  In any case, I am not sure it would be to the benefit of consumers because it might bring forward the fees they have to pay.</p><p> I wish to make a couple of comments in respect of the last exchange.  We do not act on behalf of somebody; we implement the law.  We are an independent agency to protect consumers and promote competition.  If somebody comes to us with an allegation it has to be substantiated or we will not take any further action.  We do not just take sides.  I would not like to give the impression that we are acting on behalf of somebody or against somebody or whatever.  There was a comment to the effect that we had acted on behalf of somebody.  That is not what we do.  We investigate the evidence and where we believe there is a case to be taken, we take action either through the courts or by engaging directly with the parties.</p></speech>

As I pointed out earlier, with regard to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and local authorities, the responsibility is for the technical regulation of burial grounds.  In respect of competition matters, that is not a matter for the Department.  In response to the question from Deputy Dowds about whether something should be done, I think there is further work to be done on this Bill.  There are a wide range of issues that come under the remit of various Departments, from funeral costs to property rights to national monuments and headstone sales.  It is impossible at this stage to say whether something should be done.  There are a breadth of issues from the Department's perspective.  Our focus is around the management and operation of local authority burial grounds and that is where our responsibility sits.</p></speech>

In reply to Deputy Dowds and Ms Goggin, we did offer advertising but we have listed every single monumental sculptor who is registered, giving their names, addresses and telephone numbers on our brochure.  That is free, <i>gratis</i>and for nothing.  I could answer many other questions but I know there is not enough time.</p></speech>

The Bill conflates many different issues.  The regulator of cemeteries should be the local authority and the licensing body in the area.  It is a statutory body and probably the most important tier of government, or should be the most important tier of government, as in most other countries.  The Bill provides for the establishment of boards of not more than ten members.  That is not practical given that cemeteries are provided by a range of bodies.  While the Bill appears to deal largely with the situation in Glasnevin, we have to deal with all the other cemeteries around the country.  If implemented, there would be huge implications for Church bodies, local authorities and joint burial boards throughout the State.  I can foresee many problems with it.  In regard to head 2(3)(e), which deals specifically with the issue of competition, there may be some merit in trying to separate the role of cemetery provider from the commercial activities that take place in cemeteries.  There should not be monopolies in this area.  I have heard the debate as to whether monopolies are operating in the case of Glasnevin Cemetery.  The solution is for the local authority to be the regulator and, in many cases, the provider, which is the practice in most counties throughout the State.  I have been a member of joint burial boards.  That system seems to work reasonably well, though there is room for improvement.  There are Church bodies and other bodies that own cemeteries, and commercial interests are also buying and operating cemeteries.</p><p>They could be licensed by local authorities.</p><p> The work of sculptors, monumental firms, etc., must be opened up to the same laws on commercial activity as everything else and it must be handled very carefully, given the situations that have arisen in different parts of the country.  To some extent, that is a separate issue.  However, it is the responsibility of the local authority, as regulator, to ensure that everything operates in a fair, proper and professional manner.  The Government is supposed to be getting rid of quangos.  Establishing another office or quango to manage this would be ludicrous.  The local authorities are already in existence and their members are elected by the communities and families that use the services.  Responsibility in this regard needs to be vested in the local authorities.</p></speech>

I have never seen my parish priest or local authority workers cut stone.  That is why they are excluded.  I am more convinced now of the damage the 1970 private Act did and of the need to repeal it so the problem outlined today will not continue to obtain.  I will communicate further with the Minister on this matter.</p></speech>
