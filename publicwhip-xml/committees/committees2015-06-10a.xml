We begin today with session 1 public hearing and discussion with Mary O'Dea, Central Bank-Financial Regulator.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 31st public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with senior officials from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator, who had key roles in the crisis period.</p><p>At this morning's session, we will hear from Ms Mary O'Dea.  Mary O'Dea joined the Central Bank in 1987.  She was the Financial Regulator's consumer director from 2003 through to July 2011 and sat on the board during this period.  In February 2009 to January 2010, she was acting chief executive of the Financial Regulator, having stepped in when Patrick Neary retired.  She is currently senior adviser to the executive director of Ireland at the World Bank.  Ms O'Dea, you are very welcome before the inquiry this morning.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The bank inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers that can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identified.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are now before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence to the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath.</p></speech>

Thank you, members of the committee.  The committee has asked me attend today to give evidence covering the period when I was acting chief executive of the Financial Regulator.  I was appointed acting chief executive in January of 2009 for a period of about three months initially.  This appointment was extended a number of times until the newly-appointed chief executive took up his position in January 2010.  At the time of my appointment, I held a statutory office of consumer director, a role I continued to hold throughout my year as acting CEO.  </p>  <p>         As consumer director, I was responsible in law for consumer information and consumer protection codes.</p> <p> My period as acting chief executive of the Financial Regulator started on 12 January 2009 and ended on 4 January 2010.  It was a crisis period on a number of fronts, including bank funding and liquidity, bank governance, investigation of legacy issues and putting a system in place to manage the bank guarantee scheme.  At the time, the organisation itself was also in crisis with uncertainty around the restructuring of the Central Bank and the regulator and its governance.  The financial crisis continued throughout 2009, internationally as well as domestically.  Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised in January and the Government announced capital injections for AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In April, the Government decided to set up the asset management company, NAMA, which would take larger non-performing loans from the balance sheets of the banks.  Confidence in the regulatory system was at an all-time low.  The system of supervision and regulation that had been in place internationally and in Ireland had proved to be inadequate.  At the same time, significant new responsibilities had been assigned to the regulator associated with the bank guarantee.  In addition, our investigations were producing new information on serious governance matters at certain banks.  As acting chief executive, I, along with my supervisory team, took the following actions with the full support of my board.  From the end of January, we significantly increased the volume and frequency of periodic reporting by each bank in the areas of profitability, impairment provisioning, regulatory capital, liquidity, lending and governance.  This information formed the basis of a comprehensive quarterly report to the Minister.  We introduced a more intrusive level of supervision requiring active and frequent engagement with domestic banks.  Officers of the regulator attended meetings of the boards and relevant committees, such as the credit committee, of these banks to assess at first hand if governance practices were working and to send a strong signal to the banks that the regulatory regime was different and that our expectations were different.  We monitored the strength and weaknesses of banks' governance systems and challenged banks where we felt that their processes were weak.  A report on governance issues was also included in the quarterly report to the Minister.</p> <p> I set up an interim management structure to help address the fundamental issues we faced in banking supervision.  In January '09, I also advised the board that these arrangements were appropriate on an interim basis but that they were not a lasting solution.  A more permanent organisation structure, of course, could only be adopted when there was certainty as to the new regulatory structure, including its governance.  It was clear that the level of intensification required for banking supervision could only be achieved with the addition of significant extra resources.  We increased resources in the interim to manage the crisis more effectively, recruiting an additional 20 staff, including specialist staff where there was a deficiency, such as credit and liquidity analysts.  By the end of 2009 there was over 75 staff in banking supervision, 35 of whom were dealing with domestic banks.  We also set up a special investigations unit with around 25 to 30 seconded staff at various times and initiated a number of investigations into some specific events which had unfolded in 2008.  Part of these investigations were reported to the Garda at an early stage, while others continued throughout 2009 with a view to exercising the regulator's own administrative sanctions powers in respect of any regulatory breaches involved.  We took care to ensure that the use of the regulator's enforcement powers did not jeopardise any action on the part of the garda&iacute;.  As some of these matters are now subject to legal proceedings, I cannot, therefore, comment further.</p> <p> To summarise for the committee, during my period as acting chief executive the new approach to regulating the guaranteed banks included a significant increase in information reporting requirements, more regular on-site presence at each bank, periodic attendance at board and committee meetings, greater review and scrutiny of management information, more frequent meetings with key officers, requirements for and reviews of business plans and challenging and monitoring of key variables affecting these plans, heightened focus on governance structures and processes and the introduction of a code of conduct on mortgage arrears and a statutory code of conduct for business lending.  We engaged with and challenged the banks regarding various revisions of their business models throughout 2009, as we considered how best to maintain a viable banking system.  In addition, the sensitivities of their profits, capital and funding to various assumptions were challenged to ensure that the plan was robust.  In meetings with senior credit executives, we consistently challenged the banks to make more realistic assumptions of the position of their loan portfolios.</p> <p> During 2009, our focus was on crisis management, as we assessed the scale of potential problems.  Early in the year, our governance concerns were directed at the institutions in most difficulty.  </p>  <p>         We set out these concerns in our quarterly reports to the Minister.  For example, in June 2009 there were three banks who were seeking a new CEO, two who were seeking new chair, two seeking heads of finance and two without risk officers.   For new appointments we applied a fit and proper test.  This involved gathering information about a proposed person's qualifications, experience and personal history.  Aside from the boards of the banks, in 2009 it was clear that the expertise of staff in the lending areas was focused on sales and not on arrears management where there was a pressing need for expertise.  Furthermore, preparations for the transfer of loans to NAMA tied up the credit resources as this process was lengthy and complex.  During 2009 we used our supervisory powers extensively.  Seconded inspectors were appointed to carry out special investigations into possible breaches of law or regulatory provisions.  Over 70 separate engagements were held with banks at the level of acting CEO, ten administrative sanctions enforcement actions were concluded in that year, and fines which were ... ranged from &euro;7,500 to &euro;2.7 million were imposed with one disqualification direction.</p> <p>  During 2009 the integrity of financial reporting gained heightened significance and in that year we fined one bank &euro;600,000 for breaches of regulatory reporting.  I believe it's fair to say that the supervisory teams were in constant dialogue with the banks during this time, probing the extent of their liquidity and solvency problems and addressing the emerging issues appropriately.   In March of '09 to ensure that our staff would feel comfortable heightening their concerns where there might be areas of disagreement, I circulated a written procedure to staff relating to the escalation of significant issues.  In June of that year, the Government announced the new regulatory structure and asked the chairman of the regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank to work together as much as possible in advance of implementing this new legislation.  In any event, this was necessary since almost all issues relating to banking at this stage had some sort of financial stability angle.  During 2009 there was one IMF Article IV mission to Dublin, which reported in June, and referred briefly to regulatory and supervisory initiatives that were already in train.  The main focus of the report was of managing the fiscal situation and the establishment of NAMA and a special resolution mechanism.  It also noted that Ireland needed to be guided by evolving European Union guidelines.   </p> <p>  During my year as acting CEO in '09, the quality and effectiveness of policies and regulations both from a European and an international perspective had already been declared insufficient and reforms were well under way.  For example, in February of that year, the de Laroisi&eacute;re Group published its report.  The EU Commission had sought the report in '08 to advise on the future of European regulation and banking.  It formed the basis for many of the subsequent changes to European regulation and supervision.  Certain specific findings of the report are worth recalling, and I'll mention two quotes from the report, the first of which I misquoted slightly in my written statement.  It says that both by banks and supervisors there was "a misunderstanding of the interaction between credit and liquidity", and this led to "an overestimation of the ability of financial firms as a whole to manage their risks and a corresponding underestimation of the capital they should hold".  Having learned from the international crisis, the regulatory model in Europe is now much more intrusive and challenging with the associated significant additional staffing in place.  The Single Supervisory Mechanism has now changed the nature of banking regulation much more fundamentally in Ireland and elsewhere.  Ireland, as part of Europe, will benefit from the changes in the European structure such as the single resolution mechanism, which allows for banks participating in the banking union to be resolved appropriately if the needs arises in an efficient and centralised way.  And, most importantly, there is now a clearly defined mechanism for dealing with these issues, which will be very much recognised by the financial markets.</p> <p>  The banking crisis resulted in an enormous cost for Ireland and for Irish people.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank did not take sufficiently strong action at an early stage in the build-up of the property bubble, which might have mitigated the worst effects.  In the environment of the time, I have no doubt that had the regulator taken stronger action to restrict lending, this would likely have been unpopular, could have been questioned and criticised, and pressure could have been brought to bear to reverse such action.  So, one lesson from the crisis is that the regulator, now the Central Bank, needs to be supported in making difficult decisions because for a regulatory system to be effective it will include taking preventative action at a time when this action is likely to be unpopular.  </p> <p>  Ireland has now moved from a principles-based approach to an intrusive and challenging approach to regulation, and this is appropriate given the lessons we've learned from the crisis.  </p>  <p>         But we must be realistic in our assessment of what changes the regulatory and supervisory system can achieve.  For example, in the US, which has a much more rules based approach, there was also spectacular failures of banks and insurance companies.  There, many changes have now been adopted through new legislation and the conversation is not so much about more intrusive regulation but about stronger enforcement action, stronger consumer protection and changes to the culture of banks.  There is no perfect formula for a regulatory system that would prevent financial crises and, indeed, no regulator can operate a zero failure regime.  However, in working towards a better system, transparency and recognition of risk is, in my view, one of the most fundamental pillars of appropriate supervision.  The relationship between risk and return rarely changes, so that a careful examination of the relevant profit centres of any financial institution is a key part of identifying where the risk is.  It could be derivatives trading, commercial lending, credit card insurance but if the relative profit seems high, the likelihood is that there's an unknown or unrecognised risk for which the bank is being rewarded.  The bank's board, first and foremost, and then the regulator should follow the money, especially seemingly easy money, to probe these risks, both at an individual bank level and at a system level, paying particular attention to the most extreme scenarios.  Today, we are unlikely to know the genesis of the next crisis, so we need to have a system which can react quickly to changing circumstances, including domestic, European and international circumstances.  And finally, we also need to be confident to bring issues to the international arena where we see fractures in the system that are best addressed by regulators collectively.</p> <p> Thank you, Chairman and committee.  I'm happy to answer any questions now.</p></speech>

I suppose it was the system that was in place at the time, admittedly, but did you ever express any reservation as somebody who was a part of that system?</p></speech>

It was the internationally ... seen as the best model at the time.  At the time, when that system was in place, I had the role ... the statutory role of consumer director and actually I think principles-based regulation worked very well in relation to consumer issues because we were in a very new regime.  We'd had no best practice to follow in relation to the super ... the supervision of the consumer issues.  If you recall, it was issues of consumer failing around National Irish Bank and around DIRT issues that led to the set up of the consumer area.  And if I may tell you how I think it worked better on the consumer area, we were able to build into the consumer protection code specific principles, such as you must act in the best interest of your consumer and we were able to codify that.  So when we wanted to take an enforcement action in relation to a consumer protection issue, we could look at not just the particular rule that may have been breached but also the principle, for example, acting in the best interest of the consumer - that was also breached.  So I think codifying those principles on a principles-based regulation on the consumer side actually worked extremely well.  On the prudential side, of course, much more depended on very complex supervisory models and it was a completely different system.</p></speech>

When did you come to that position in light of the fact that large profits existed in financial institutions, particularly in some forms of the financial institutions, in the period in which you were working in the regulator?  Did you change your view to that being a new position for you or is that ... was that always a position that you held?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.23" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Dea" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#F00100"><p>Well, let me say in relation to my period in the ... of the regulator from 2003 right up to 2008 before I took on the position of acting chief executive, my role in law was as consumer director and that was my statutory function.  And at that stage, precisely what we did do was look very closely at credit risk.  So we looked at areas where we thought that there was problems; the build-up of credit was one.  And seeing that, we built into our consumer protection code the concept of suitability in lending which didn't exist anywhere at the time.  And that included affordability, so we introduced the concept of affordability.  We also banned pre-approved credit cards.  Prior to that, 42,000 customers a month were getting some ... a letter in their door saying you have been pre-approved for extra credit.  We banned those completely.  We also introduced requirements in respect of consumer protection loans so that if you consolidated, you know, your car loan and holiday loan and all of that into one, the provider was then obliged to tell you precisely how much extra this cost.  So we introduced that requirement and we issued a number of warnings in relation to credit.  You recall in 2006 when the SSIAs matured, a lot of people were getting large sums of money then.  We were the only people who said, "Please use your money to pay down debt", and pointed out to consumers that this might be a good idea rather than use it for a different type of investment product.</p>  <p>  So in my role as consumer director, I believe that's a principle that I followed a lot.  Having said that, I would also say that reflecting back now and listening to all of the various groups internationally saying what went wrong in the crisis, I do think that sometimes we make matters much more complex than they need to be.  And that's why I was thinking to myself that we can boil it down to be a lot more simple.  And I think that a lot of what we were doing on the ... in the prudential area was looking at extremely complex models rather than focusing on these more simple issues.</p></speech>

I asked him a question about it when he was a witness before the inquiry.  I want to reference him correctly.  He stated, ''An issue in relation to a corporate governance matter in a particular bank which I think reflected poorly on the authority'', was the reason for his departure.  Do you have anything to ... anything more to add to that or anything maybe with regard to wider corporate governance issues in relation to the Financial Regulator and their role with banks at the time?</p></speech>

I remember moving from the consumer building was separate.  I remember physically going into the 7th floor building in the Central Bank and reflecting on all of the issues that needed to be addressed.  Obviously, the key thing was the banks' liquidity and the capital position of the banks.  That was the key issue that we were focused on.  But as well as that, the organisation itself was in extreme crisis and the people that I was then asked to lead as the chief executive were in an extremely difficult situation.  Many of them had worked in the regulator, which was a great of ... great sense of pride and public interest working there and now they were filled with doubt and questioning so ... and at the same time working all of the hours day and night to make sure that they stabilised the situation.  So actually I think giving leadership to the organisation to carry out its extremely important role during the crisis period was a key priority of mine.  Also, bearing in mind that at that stage I thought I would be in the seat for three months so I was trying to look at it from that point of view ... what could we best do at that stage?  And then most particularly there were a number of very specific investigations, the details of which I won't go into for legal reasons, that had to be started and that we had to make sure that we did appropriately and very thoroughly.  So there were a number of issues and that's really focusing on the banking side.  Remember the organisation is vast and I was also holding the position of consumer director and mortgage arrears were a serious issue for people at that time.</p></speech>

There was a major turnover going on in relation to governance, which meant that institutions were left with not an appropriate governance.  They were missing a CEO, they were missing a chair, they were missing a chief risk officer for quite a period of time at precisely the time where you needed these institutions to be operating at their most effective in order to be able to bottom out the position of loan arrears and deal with liquidity issues and sell off assets and take serious decisions there so-----</p></speech>

As I said to you, I think the organisation itself was in crisis.  There was certainly a feeling of blame and there was definitely a feeling within the regulator that the Central Bank should have seen the broader systemic issue, and I'm sure a feeling within the Central Bank that the regulator should have seen the more micro-prudential-type issues.  So yes, there was that feeling.</p></speech>

The nation's finances were in peril but Ireland's banking elite were celebrating in a private room in a discreet hostelry near Dublin's Stephen's Green.</blockquote>  <p>You were reported as being one of those who was in attendance at that particular event.

Ms O'Dea, can I ask you, when you were consumer director, and in the period of the development of the bubble, do you think there was a shortage of people and skills in the banking supervision department at that time and, then as you went on to chief executive in February 2009, what was the situation then?  We had in evidence from Mary Burke, for example, that three staff were supervising AIB and IL and P together, and a further three, Bank of Ireland and Anglo.  What was your view of that situation?</p></speech>

The way the process worked was that I consulted with my team in the consumer area and we figured out what was the appropriate resources that we needed, pay and non-pay, to do the job.  There was a similar exercise done in the prudential area.  And then we proposed those resources to the budget committee at the time.  Now, my interactions, if you like, with the budget committee in terms of resources, I do recall that the prudential area were looking for more staff.  I do recall that, at some stage, it could have been around 2007-2008, it was a significant amount of staff, and I remember when we went to the budget committee to discuss that large increase in staff.  And I think there was a couple of issues, as I recall it, going on with the budget committee.  That, while they had no objection <i>per se</i>to additional staff in the supervision area, that they wanted to be convinced that there couldn't be efficiencies gained from the organisations.  For example, in relation to IT or shared services-----</p></speech>

This would have been, certainly in the later years ... but I think there would have been a bit of a theme maybe for the last four or five years where the committee would ... wanted to be assured that we were taking all efficiencies in terms of IT and shared services.  We shared some services with the Central Bank and the committee wanted to make sure that there wasn't any duplication.  That was one issue.  And, in fact, I think the reason that the committee thought it was a good idea to commission Mazars was precisely to get to the bottom of that and see were there efficiencies that could be gained.</p></speech>

That was really the discussion that took place at the board but also it is important to recall, I think, that if this was a model of principles-based regulation ... this was not a model of intrusive regulation and I think you'll see that later the Mazars report had said that resources were just about right in terms of that particular model which, of course, by the time Mazars came along, we were not implementing any more.  So it was in a completely different context, I believe.  If I may just though say that the second thing, I think ... affected the thinking within the budget committee was the inability to actually fill the vacancies that was there, so that there was really no point in approving additional vacancies when the ones that were there weren't actually filled.  So I think that was the second part of the issue.  And that's why ultimately, I think, they commissioned the Mazars report and they asked the deputy director general of the Central Bank, who was responsible for filling the various positions within his line of reporting, to attend the board meetings.</p></speech>

The bottom half of that page ... this relates to discussions on various committees about staffing and it is 2008 when alarm bells were going off in relation ... and yet there seemed to be a discussion here on staff saving, cutbacks.  Can you tell us what's that about?</p></speech>

Now the Central Bank and the regulator are independent of Government but nevertheless, the tradition has always been if there was a public sector change in pay that the regulator and Central Bank would follow that change in pay and they had committed to delivering the savings of ... I can't remember, was it 10% or something like that of the pay bill ... I can't remember what the specific amount was.  But they had committed to delivering the same savings that the Government Departments were being asked to deliver within their own budgets.  So that was, if you like, in the context of the various austerity measures being introduced in 2008.</p></speech>

So that was a time of great uncertainty.  You'll see on the next document just across the page, when I was appointed in 2009, I did bring it to the attention of the audit committee that this was a significant operational risk operating with such stretched resources and actually it wasn't until 2010 that those resources, in fact, were approved and came in.</p></speech>

Quite a significant increase.  Did you have any feeling at that time of, you know, the horses were away over the horizon, that it was a pity that these extra staff weren't put in during the bubble, for example?</p></speech>

It was quite clear - though, as you say, although it was too late to prevent what had happened already in Ireland - it was still absolutely necessary and is absolutely necessary that we have this more intrusive model for the future.  I think we've learned that.</p></speech>

At that stage, I would have been the consumer director and my role around the guarantee was very specifically in relation to consumer information.  A lot of people were very worried about their savings and we would get phone calls at about five times our normal phone calls of 100 calls a day, so it was up to about 500, people worried about their savings, and so myself and my team were trying to provide appropriate and correct information because the situation was constantly moving and also preparing contingency plans with the retail banks at line level to make sure that there wouldn't be a large retail run on a bank.  So, my role was very much around the consumer issues at that time.</p></speech>

What was the attitude of the banks to this new approach?</p></speech>

The more we drilled into the loan books, the more we could see difficulties in terms of provisions.</p></speech>

So, I sent a team into Anglo to do that.  We seconded officers because we needed people with special forensic skills and we seconded them in and sent them in immediately.  I was surprised at the attitude that Anglo took in relation to those inspections.  For example, at all of the inspectors' meetings, initially, there were stenographers and I'd been a long time around supervision and I'd never come across somebody having a stenographer at an inspection meeting and it slowed the process quite a bit for us.  </p>  <p>         There was also a lot of claims of legal privilege, which of course people are entitled to do, over documents.  But it seemed to us that they were, they were very frequent and they were very much slowing the process.  And we believed that it was in the best interests of the country to have these issues investigated thoroughly in a speedy fashion.  And-----</p></speech>

Ms O'Dea, on page 7 of your opening statement, second paragraph ... last few sentences, you said: "In the [United States], many changes have been adopted through new legislation and the conversation there is not so much about more intrusive regulation but stronger enforcement action, stronger consumer protection and changes [in] the culture of [the] banks."  In relation to all that has happened here and by common consent, the disastrous consequences of reckless lending that has been alleged, do you believe that legislation should be changed in this country to provide for jail sentences, for example, for serious breaches of financial rules and regulations that should be upheld?</p></speech>

Yes.</p></speech>

I think that has to be very carefully set out and I think, as you said yourself, the consequences are so significant that there should be a greater consequence for doing it incorrectly.</p></speech>

Now looking back on it, whose interest do you think was served mainly by the financial institutions over that period of time?  Was it the interest of profit-seeking private institutions?  Did that predominate over the interests of ordinary people?  That's question one.  And question two is-----</p></speech>

I believe I acted as a strong advocate for consumers during that time and provided appropriate information to them, specifically in relation to credit issues as well, and also to set out codes and enforce those codes and again, I believe that I did that.  I think you'll see in the Mazars report it suggested that the consumer information could be seen as best in class.  However, I do believe that the actions of the regulator and Central Bank were not adequate to prevent what ultimately happened and I regret that.</p></speech>

When 100% mortgages were introduced, we issued new information in relation to that.  We warned consumers about negative equity and how you could build up negative equity in relation to that, and we talked about affordability.  But I will also say, Chair, that at the time of the 100% mortgages, when they were introduced and the discussion, I actually felt it was the wrong discussion, because there were 80% mortgages that people couldn't afford, and that the issue was really about affordability.  And there may be some people who had, you know, many means that could afford 100% but the issue to me, from a consumer perspective, was much more about affordability.</p></speech>

It wasn't a case that they had a mortgage and a holiday home, and a car, and maybe a credit union loan, and it was all being bundled into one.  New home owners coming into the market were buying homes at eight and nine times their average incomes, which was an increase.  They were moving ... buying mortgages that were moved from 20 years out to 35 years.  They were being presented with 100% mortgage products and there were a whole host of other measures.  I'm trying to get a clear picture from you.  Did you direct banks or did you advise them, or did you say: "We're going to bring in a law to stop you from doing this"?</p></speech>

A law is something that is enshrined in statute and is a criminal act if it's violated.  A guideline is something that, we, we would like you to do this and we'll talk to you more about it if you don't.</p></speech>

Under the law as set out, we were allowed to set out what was called a code, but actually it was enforceable by a fine up to &euro;5 million.  So, it was an enforceable code.  And that enforceable code was in relation to suitable lending.  So, if somebody was getting a mortgage for example, of 35 years that they clearly couldn't afford, then the institution would be in breach of the suitable lending requirement.</p></speech>

Did it work? And then I'll bring in Deputy McGrath.  Did those measures actually work?  Did it stop mortgages going up to 35 years?  Did it stop income ratios increasing where people buying a home for the first time would have been traditionally buying a home in three to four times their household income were now buying it on ten times plus?  Did your intervention into the banks in that regard work?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it was too late.  I believe it should have been brought in earlier.  We had to carry out regulatory impact analysis in relation to those rules and that delayed it.

You're very welcome, Ms O'Dea.  Can I start by asking, prior to 2008 the regulator had proposed a number of initiatives to impose more explicit requirements on banks such as directors' compliance statements, corporate governance guidelines and fit and proper requirements.  What was your view of these initiatives, and can you describe the circumstances in which the board chose not to implement the original proposals for these initiatives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Dea" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#N01000"><p>Yes, thank you.  I have looked back over those - the various initiatives that came in.  To be honest, most of the issues that came to the board ... as I said, I was there at my statutory capacity as consumer director and I would have looked at them from ... through that lens.  With the benefit of hindsight, they should have been brought in earlier.  I think probably in a couple of cases the issue was over-complicated, so for example if I take the case of directors compliance statement, there was a similar provision being brought in in company law, and there was a lot of toing and froing as to whether or not the provision that the regulator was bringing in was cutting across that, or was not in line with that.  And I think the issue was actually, now that I look back at it, made much more complicated than it needed to be.  I think it was also impacted by the, the statutory role ... that had been built in in relation to the growth of financial services where the regulator didn't want to introduce something that was uncompetitive.  So I think that also affected things, but as I look back at those, they should have been brought in earlier.  And actually, I contrasted with later in 2009, when we took a different approach in relation to directors' loans and related party loans, were we knew their was a provision coming in under company law and, nevertheless, we moved ahead quickly and brought in the provision as the regulator.  And that was more onerous than the one in company law, but we still felt that was appropriate.</p></speech>

In fact, in 2009, and it's very hard to recreate this, it was extremely ... crisis management and trying to stabilise the situation so there wasn't a pause to set out a strategy and ... the practice changed.

So, I don't recall a specific decision being made, but there would have been no question of operating any other way than in a very intrusive way.  And if you recall, what we were doing at the time in relation to the banks required daily and frequent contact ... contact at that stage, it was extremely intrusive.</p></speech>

Now I should add, though, that it was very difficult to do the more intrusive regulation without having the resources at that stage, and there was a sequence there in terms of, first of all, getting the governance of the regulator correct ... we didn't know whether there was going to be one board, two boards, how that was going to be set up.  Then we got a new Governor.  Patrick Honohan came in, then the chief executive was appointed, and then the strategy and resources flowed.  So there was a natural sequence there.</p></speech>

And I think the situation in relation to Anglo had been complicated by all the other issues that were going on at the time.  But I think it was the size and scale of the loss escalated over the period of time.  It was necessary, of course, to have ... because despite the fact that Anglo was nationalised, our regulatory relationship with Anglo didn't change in any way.  So we still had regulator-to-regulated relationship and the solvency of Anglo was extremely important in terms of providing liquidity because we couldn't allow it to trade or provide services at all unless it was actually solvent.</p></speech>

We brought in two types of specialists.  We brought in auditing specialists and we also brought in valuation specialists.  And I think it was really with the two of those working together, particularly the valuation specialists, that allowed us to get a much, much better understanding.  And actually, one of the things that I noticed clearly in 2009, when we did actually bring in particular types of very specialist staff into the regulator, the value of those staff in terms of being able to even have that conversation with the banks of the type of land, the value of land, what type ... of whether it was land bank or whether it was close to development or anything like that ... those conversations, to me, became much richer and much more meaningful when we had our own specialist staff in those areas.</p></speech>

My particular role was in relation to the consumer area and we were on the phone constantly to each other updating the information, because we had to very careful that the information we gave to consumers was exactly right.  We couldn't simply say, in a trivial way, "Your money is safe".  We had to actually say precisely what that means, precisely what was guaranteed.  You'll recall the deposit protection scheme increased over that period of time, so we had to make sure we gave them that information very, very quickly.</p>  <p>  And the other issue was, having seen Northern Rock, our focus on the consumer side was not on the wholesale run that others might've been looking at but very much on the possibility of a retail run, queues forming outside of a bank and what that might do in terms of a visual.  So we were extremely worried about it and we were constantly ... we ... you know, we got a phone call to say, there was a photograph of a bank, you know, with two people standing outside, we'd immediately be on to say, "Please rectify the situation".  And then, on the consumer information line, we had to pull staff to make sure that we could answer ... because a phone ringing out would send a really signal.  So we had outsourced that service but we had to make sure we increased our capacity in relation to doing that.</p>  <p>  And then, the other issue I remember is, on the day after the guarantee, we had about 15,000 visits to the website.  So nowadays, of course, a lot of people get their information from the website ... 15,000 people ... we'd 1,000 calls ... and again, we were ourselves trying to understand precisely what the guarantee meant for consumers and we had to portray that information in an accurate way.  So it was continuous, really, all through 2008 and into 2009.</p></speech>

Okay.  So the ..., I think the legislation was very good.  I think bringing everything back within one organisation had to be done because something had to be shown to revive confidence in the system.  Something different had to happen.  But I would also say that I don't think the structure, of itself, was actually a major causal issue because, I think, even in a new organisation, in a single organisation, you're still going to have two specialist areas - one looking at financial stability issues, one looking at micro-prudential issues.  And if those two areas don't have absolute clarity of role and don't work together very well, then, I think, you can the same problem.  So while I think changing the structure is a good idea, I think that that wasn't, of itself, the same problem.  And if I may add one thing, because I wouldn't be true to my previous role as consumer director, if I didn't say that I thought it was also very important that the new structure retained the two pillars: one of setting out the enforceable codes, which I've talked about for consumers; and the other one of providing consumer information.  And while consumer information has moved out of the Central Bank, that pillar stayed within the new consumer agency.</p></speech>

I actually think it was both.  I think the model itself was clearly inadequate.  I think we've seen that.

I certainly couldn't do it in that forensic level of detail, but I think one issue that you haven't mentioned that's also extremely important, possibly the most important thing, was the failure to identify the credit bubble as it emerged, and the failure to spot that it wasn't a soft landing.  And there I think you have the IMF, the OECD, the ECB, many others in that particular category.  And I would add that as something that was extremely important in what happened in Ireland.</p></speech>

We were ... carried out the much more intrusive level of supervision, we challenged every day, and I think probably the biggest issue in terms of the question that you've put to me was around the banks' business plans, so at that stage the banks were providing their business plans for what the future of their business would be.  And we saw a lot of ... because we could see all the business plans we saw a lot of overlap around what they were doing and therefore questioned the profitability that would be there.  We also then sought to identify, well, what were the major issues that would lead to that profitability and really challenge those in a much more robust way.  So that was probably most of 2009.</p></speech>

Because there's an area of confusion around this.  So can you just, on the record, what administrative sanctions were available to the regulator?</p></speech>

I know it was in time to introduce the consumer protection code and enforce it, and we had actually been very vocal with Government to say that we wanted the fine increased to a level of &euro;5 million at that time.</p></speech>

What about, we'll say, prudential lending?  About, we'll say, breach of guidelines, where effectively that they could only, we'll say, up to 200%, 250% in terms of ... within any category of loans?</p></speech>

And that's what we did with the consumer protection code.  The model in relation to prudential regulation is that they were not codified, that they were set out as guidelines, but they could have been codified, if that's the question you're asking me?</p></speech>

You made reference in one of your earlier contributions where you spoke about that you ... the 100% mortgage and how we react to the 100% mortgage, and you said that ... it was about the capacity to repay.  So the question I suppose I'd ask is: would you not take into your thinking that, with 100% mortgage, that you were leaving the borrower far more exposed in terms of negative equity in the fall in the value of their property, and that there was a certain, we'll say, element of enormous amount of risk in allowing the 100% mortgages to continue?</p></speech>

It was in our consumer information that we put on the website to warn consumers that if you took out 100% mortgages this is what could happen.  But I don't have the figures on this, but I do suspect that the majority of people who are in terrible situations with their mortgages now are not actually the 100% mortgages, that actually it was even lower levels of that that were the issue in terms of affordability.</p></speech>

I just want to get your position on this 100% mortgage.  </p>  <p>               To use an analogy, it's like the Road Safety Authority telling people to put on their seat belts and people should be listening to them and putting on their seat belts.  But if a car manufacturer's making cars without seat belts, then somebody else has to do something with the car manufacturer.  It's one thing to tell people to be mindful of availing of 100% mortgages, it's another thing to say, "Stop providing them".  Do you have a view as to whether 100% mortgages were a suitable product and that they should be been taken off the market?</p></speech>

And I fully support the actions now taken by Governor Honohan in relation to this.  At the time, 100% mortgages were introduced, what we did at that stage was say, "You can only sell them to customers where they can afford them and where they are suitable", and that warnings had to be given in relation to negative equity.  So that's what we did, if I can distinguish, at the time, for hindsight.</p></speech>

I just want to ask a question on that, if I may.  In paragraph 20 of their report, they say:</p><blockquote>The authorities did not formally produce any estimate for aggregate bank losses.  They have focused on the needed restructuring of property-development loans, which they rightly view as at the heart of stress faced by banks.</blockquote>  <p>Why didn't you have any estimates for aggregate bank losses at the time?</p></speech>

And, in fact, even after that, even after NAMA was set up - and NAMA had specialist valuers - it still took a significant length of time after that because, basically, land banks had to be looked at, individual loans had to be looked at, connections had to be looked at, what collateral was there.  So it took a longer time to do it than you might have expected.</p></speech>

I think at that stage they were looking at what might have been done in other countries and in other countries it wasn't just the larger loans but it was also some smaller loans.  I think here the Department were of the view that it would be the larger loans.  And again, there was a sequence in there.</p></speech>

And, again, I think at that stage NAMA took the approach - and NAMA will explain to you how this worked much better than I - that they would take all the connected loans.  And, in fact, that actually sped up what you rightly said was a very long process.  That actually sped it up by taking all the connected loans and, again, some countries had done this differently.  So the IMF would be looking at what other countries had done and in some other countries they had done it differently.</p></speech>

In paragraph 25 of that same report it states that, "Staff noted that nationalization could become necessary, which would be seen as complementary to NAMA."  So, at that point, when this was published in June 2009, were your offices preparing for the nationalisation of any further banks in the Irish banking system?</p></speech>

But what I'm wondering is, given that the IMF took time to note this in their country report, did you in your office then say, "Well, look, we need to look at the banks very carefully and we have to see about which ones have to be nationalised", and then, given what happened in 2010 at the end with AIB, I mean, did that not set in train, you know, work in your office to prepare for that eventuality?</p></speech>

So once we knew what the level of the loan losses were going to be, those type of decisions would then be much easier, of course.</p></speech>

So it didn't surprise me that there wasn't any enforcement action.  And I think in the case of one particular issue that came to the board, as I recall it, rather than dealing with it as an enforcement action with the fining type powers, it was dealt with by way of an additional capital requirement for a particular firm.  So that would have been dealt with in that way but the model that was adopted was that the enforcement actions would be predominantly on the consumer area.</p></speech>

So that was a separate issue but the predominant issue was in relation to the model.</p></speech>

Can I ask you, Ms O'Dea, the IMF mission in 2009 referred to the lack of a resolution regime.  Can you explain the Financial Regulator's views on the need for a resolution regime in 2009?</p></speech>

At the time and actually, to me, it's a clear sign that nobody envisaged what was going to happen across Europe because there was no special resolution regime for banks.  Banks have to be treated differently, as we now know, in terms of how they're resolved.  It has to be done in a particular way and the IMF were simply pointing out that this should be a standard part of the toolkit for any regulatory crisis.</p></speech>

In some cases, this will involve dual representation in certain fora.  In cases where only one party is represented, the other undertakes to contribute information and advice in advance of any meeting.

The issue of credit growth was discussed several times.

F&aacute;ilte romhat, Ms O'Dea.  Can I first ask you during your period as acting CEO of the Financial Regulator you'd initiated a number of changes to increase the intensity of banking supervision.  Can you describe to the committee some of the key changes you made during that period?</p></speech>

So one of the things we did was we increased the reporting.  We had reports on things but they were, unfortunately, not frequent enough for us, so we increased the periodic reporting in profitability, impairment provisioning, regulatory capital liquidity, lending and governance, and then we had a monthly report where we could analyse these.  We also sat on ... some of the inspectors would sit in at board meetings or credit committee meetings so that we could see them operating in practice.  One of the things, I think, that we had learned at that stage was that we had been overly focused on the process and not so much on the outcome.  And that by actually sitting in at the board meetings you could see the outcome and we were very, very focused on credit and credit decisions at that particular time.</p></speech>

More challenging regulation is what I would call it.  And again, rather than check the model, we were checking the outcome.  We were engaging with the banks, we were much more challenging with the banks.</p></speech>

I didn't know that there was a middle one called intrusive regulation.  Is that an international standard-type of regulation?</p></speech>

But, actually, principles-based regulation has a lot of rules.  There was an awful lot of rules that were set out.  And this is a really important point actually, because when we came to do some of our investigations, some of our particular investigations, one of the things that we looked at were what rules were there that could have been breached whether or not they were set out by Europe or whether or not they were in law.  And we were then able to either report those if they were into the legal territory or liaise with the guards and this was something I did in my time to say, ''Can we go ahead and pursue some of these breaches of the requirements without infecting any process that you have?''  So we liaised with the guards in relation to that.</p></speech>

There was ... you didn't ... you didn't have to change any rules, you didn't have to have a change of documents, you just actually decided to send investigators into the banks, which were always the power within principles-based regulation and asked for more reports and asked for more documents.

But you are right to say that the law elsewhere hadn't changed.  The practice of doing regulation had changed not just in Ireland, actually, but it had changed everywhere.</p></speech>

There was discussion about the press release, I think, from the Government sent out on June 18 2009 and I'll quote from the document.

So the question I am asking you is: what were the concerns of the ... at the time in relation to this idea of light-touch regulation for IFSC?  And during your period of acting regulator of ... of the Financial Regulator ... did you have to deal with legacy issues of IFSC banks, for example, like Depfa Bank-----</p></speech>

And we thought that this would be very negative both as a matter of substance and also as a matter of reputation.  So we did actually say that we don't want any perceptions whatsoever and drew the attention of the parties, the Government parties to that to say that they should be very careful how this was phrased because we didn't want to have that differentiation.  And then in terms of the day-to-day dealings, the main focus of 2009 was very much on the domestic banks.  The main focus was on the domestic banks.  There were also discussions with other international regulators about banks who had a presence here.  So there were discussions around that but the principal focus was on the domestic banks.</p></speech>

Again, it depended on the issue.  One of the things at the time that we were very intolerant of was regulatory reporting issues.

Briefly, Ms O'Dea, I just want to ask was the excessive credit growth that took place in the economy a matter that should have been covered or looked into or examined by the regulator or the Central Bank in the period which we are discussing?</p></speech>

I think both organisations, and I answered another question in relation to the structure, about having a clear level of role and responsibilities.  My understanding all through that time was that the Central Bank clearly had the role for systemic financial stability and I think the build-up of a credit bubble within the economy falls within that jurisdiction.  Also my understanding was that the regulator had responsibility for looking at the micro-prudential areas, so I think the build-up of credit within particular institutions would fall within that.</p></speech>

Between 1996 and 2006, the price of a home for an ordinary person increased by the equivalent of the average industrial wage each year for ten years.  Now, the profiteering and the speculation that was responsible for that situation was driven by massive lending by the banks, including the banks taking wholesale funds from international institutions and laying them out, and then changing rules like mortgages increased from their parents 20 years to 35 or 40 years, etc., etc., so that young people who were desperate to start a home, you know, were forced to go under this system.  Did your office and the Financial Regulator board fail miserably to protect young people caught in this bind or not?</p></speech>

And I think that is absolutely true and as consumer director, as somebody who held the position of consumer director, I think it absolutely true to say that consumers are in a very difficult position and I regret that the regulator was unable to prevent that situation.</p></speech>

And the fact that the regulatory system didn't go into a mode of alarm and opposition to this and try and stop it, why did that happen when it was so obvious how the ... this generation was just being screwed to the wall by what was going on by banks and developers?</p></speech>

What we did do, and I think it's important to say what we did do in relation to the consumer protection area was, we did many, many information campaigns warning consumers about the size of their mortgage, what their mortgage cost, and in fact one of the things that sticks-----</p></speech>

And we tried to point this out to people at the time.  We had no control over the price of the actual house at the time.</p></speech>

At the end of this process, Ms O'Dea, this committee is going to make findings, findings with statements of fact and recommendations and this will be one of the areas that we will be specifically referring to in our report.  You spoke all morning about the advice that you were giving customers outside there and potential customers.  I want to get down to the detail of what you were doing with the banks during that time.  So can I ask you, you mentioned that the banks have to do affordability checks on high loan-to-value mortgages.  When you continued to see that the high-value mortgages were being handed out by banks, despite your guidelines, which you just spoke about the moment, were any investigations ever done into the affordability checks that were done by the banks?</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  And the Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis now resuming in public session, I can remind members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  Today we are now continuing our hearings with senior officials in the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Regulator and, our next session, we will now hear from Mr. Cyril Roux, deputy governor of the financial regulation, Central Bank.</p><p>Mr. Cyril Roux was appointed to the position of deputy governor of the Central Bank on 1 October 2013 with responsibility for financial regulation.  Prior to taking up the role, he served as first deputy secretary general at the French insurance supervisory authority.  He also served as a board member of the ANC, the French accounting standard-setting authority.  Mr. Roux, you're very welcome to the committee today.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You're directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information that they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In addition, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.

As regards the first theme of inquiry, I'm not close enough to the Irish experience of the previous decade to provide this knowledgeable committee with special insight.  That said, I'm well aware of the severe economic hardship brought about by the crisis.  Many Irish households and Irish firms still suffer from it today.  Hence all parties, including the Central Bank, must continue to do their utmost to prevent a replay of the banking crisis and to protect the financial stability of the country.  I'll share with you what I know of the reforms put in place here after the crisis and before I joined and I'll present the further European reforms that I have replaced them with in the past year and a half.</p>  <p>  In October 2013, as I came into office, two independent, large-scale exercises were in train to assess the effectiveness of the domestic framework that had been designed and put in place by my predecessor, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, between 2010 and 2013.  The first exercise was a balance sheet assessment of the three remaining covered banks, conducted as part of the 2013 financial measures programme.  It concluded with a view that the covered banks were mostly in financial working order and required only moderate strengthening of their provisions, which they did bring into their year-end accounts, in the main.</p>  <p>  The second large-scale exercise was the IMF review of Ireland's observance of the Basel core principles for effective banking supervision.  </p>  <p>         The IMF found that since the crisis has begun the Central Bank had taken substantive steps to rebuild its functions in financial regulation and supervision, including changes in the institutional setting, changes of senior staff, and increases in the quantity, albeit from a very low base, and the calibre of supervisory staff.  The IMF acknowledged the design and implementation of a proactive and intensive approach to banking supervision, the expansion of prudential requirements and improvement in enforcement powers.  Overall, the IMF ascribed to the Central Bank as of 2013 a satisfactory level of compliance with the aforementioned Basel core principles for effective banking supervision.<br/><br/>Taken together, these two reviews gave me sufficient assurance that Irish banks, and Irish banking supervision, albeit not without further progress, had been put on a more solid footing and that I could direct our 2014 efforts to moving towards the entry into force of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  This entailed two major lines of work.  The first line of work was internal and organisational - I will describe its outcome later.  The second line of work was a comprehensive assessment.  Under the leadership of the ECB, we conducted, like all the other national supervisory authorities of the eurozone, an asset quality review and a stress test of the top 120 eurozone banking groups.  The results were published in the comprehensive assessment report of the ECB in October 2014.  The ECB found that around one out of five eurozone banking groups was in need of recapitalisation.  Out of the top four Irish banks, only Permanent TSB was found to need supplementary capital to fully withstand an adverse stress test.  PTSB subsequently raised the required capital in May of this year.<br/><br/>Let me now change tack and describe the overhaul of the banking regulatory framework.  Domestically, between 2010 and 2013, the Oireachtas and the Central Bank introduced several pieces of legislation, codes and regulations which much strengthened the requirements weighing on commercial banks and the hand of the Central Bank in supervising them and enforcing against their breaches.  These new requirements were additional to the prevailing European capital requirement directive.  Internationally, between 2010 and 2013, three large initiatives unfolded that are directly relevant to matters of the inquiry.<br/><br/>First, in 2010, the EU adopted the European system of financial supervision, comprising the European Systemic Risk Board and the three European supervisory authorities, including the European Banking Authority.  The ESRB is tasked with micro-prudential oversight in Europe, while the European Banking Authority is in charge of banking supervisory convergence and drafting secondary legislation.  Also in 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision addressed the inadequacies of its second agreement and replaced it by the third agreement of Basel III.  The third agreement formed a basis of the new prudential banking regulatory framework in Europe, adapted under the Irish Presidency of the EU and enshrined in the fourth capital requirement directive, CRD IV, and the capital requirement regulation, CRR.  They have been in force from 1 January 2014.<br/><br/>Finally in 2012, the EU Heads of State and Government decided on the banking union, which also started to come into force in 2014 as far as the Single Supervisory Mechanism is concerned.  The changes have been profound.  I will try to give you a flavour of the depth and breadth of this new, multifaceted regime starting with CRD IV and CRR.  Both the quantity and quality of capital that banks are required to hold are now much increased, whereas up to the end of 2013 banks could operate with as little as 2% of capital.  They need now at least 4.5% of a more tightly defined equity.  Furthermore, the new regulatory framework introduces the possibility for macro-prudential authorities to impose several additional capital requirements, known as buffers, to all banks in their jurisdiction.  The Central Bank has been designated as the macro-prudential authority for this purpose in March 2014.<br/><br/>From 1 January 2016, as agreed throughout Europe, all banks will also have to begin building one of these buffers, the capital conservation buffer, for an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.  Liquidity requirements were domestic until then.  They are now harmonised at a much tighter level under the liquidity coverage ratio of the CRR.  The existing Central Bank liquidity requirements, which were introduced in January 2007, are being replaced by this LCR, which will be fully binding in 2018.  The CRR also introduced a net stabled funding obligation, and a leverage ratio requirement which caps banks assets to no more than 33 times Tier 1 capital.<br/><br/>Finally, the quality and granularity of banks&rsquo; regulatory reporting have also been significantly enhanced from January 2014 by the CRR, and subsequent guidelines and standards of the European Banking Authority covering financial reporting, credit risk, operational risk, own funds and capital adequacy ratios.  The transformation of the regulatory framework for banks, from what it was up to the end of 2013 to what it is becoming, does not stop at prudential supervisory requirements.  Lessons were also learned about the way to resolve the difficulties of banks that are failing or likely to fail.  This has entailed another change in regulatory framework through the adaption of the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, and enactment of the Single Resolution Mechanism.  The BRRD and the Single Resolution Mechanism aim to create a predictable framework for resolving banks that fail in the future.  BRRD provides a toolkit for resolving banks, such as a bailing-in of unsecured liabilities in lieu of the bailing out of the banks by taxpayers.  The Central Bank has been designated as a national resolution authority, and is already working with the banks to double up resolution plans in line with BRRD requirements.  For larger eurozone banks, including our own, resolution decisions will be made from January of next year, by the single resolution board in Brussels<b>.  </b>It will avail of the new propounded resolution funds in the eurozone, which are to be gradually mutualised.<br/><br/>Let me now turn to the transformation of the supervision of eurozone banks from 2014.  As I mentioned earlier, in 2012, EU Heads of State and Government agreed to transfer the responsibility for supervising banks to the European level, with the establishment of the SSM.  Eurozone banks have come under the supervision of the ECB since 4 November 2014.  The ECB directly supervises the largest European banks, including Bank of Ireland, AIB, Permanent TSB, and Ulster Bank, with our assistance and that of other national supervisors.  We supervise the smaller banks, under the oversight of the ECB.<br/><br/>The revamped banking supervisory framework that was put in place at the Central Bank by Matthew Elderfield has mostly been superseded by the SSM.  Our domestic supervisory engagement cycle, our approval procedures, our internal supervisory guidance, enshrined in PRISM, were effective from 2011 to October 2014.  They have now been replaced by the prescriptions of the SSM supervisory manual, which are guided by a similar, if not more tough, intrusive and sceptical ethos.<br/><br/>Daily supervision of the larger banks is conducted by joint supervisory teams, mostly made of central bank staff, but always headed by an ECB co-ordinator based in Frankfurt.  These co-ordinators propose draft decisions, during consultation with us, to the supervisory board of the ECB where I sit.  When approved, these draft decisions are submitted to the governing council and finally signed by the President of the ECB.<br/><br/>In the Central Bank, banking supervision was re-organised and further strengthened in the course of 2014.  Approved headcount in banking supervision was brought up to 140, and the actual headcount has increased to 124.  We have thus reduced, albeit partially, the numerical gap with eurozone standards.  Instead of two generalist divisions, we now have three: one is dedicated to ongoing supervision; one to specialist expertise; and a wholly new third division carries out on-site inspections year-round.  This structure aligns the Central Bank with the organisational requirements of the SSM and further enhances our supervision.  </p>  <p>           Let me conclude by restating a few key messages.  In our country, the institutional arrangement of financial regulation, the engagement framework and practice of prudential banking supervision were overhauled during the tenure of Matthew Elderfield in the wake of our domestic banking crisis.  As of 2013, much repair had been achieved.  On the European stage, the lessons of the global banking crisis resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution that has started unfolding at the end of 2013.  While the EFSF was put in place in 2011, CRD IV, CRR and BRRD come gradually into force from 2014 up to the end of the decade.  The SSM is operational since November 2014 and the SRB will assume its functions in January 2016.  These new European regulations and institutional arrangements have, in the main, superseded the domestic response of 2010-2013 to our national banking crisis and they are designed to address the challenges of public banking oversight and resolution at a European level, in the area of national decision making that prevailed until 2013.  Thank you.</p></speech>

So, with that said, to get matters under way, if I can invite Deputy McGrath to lead off the questions.  Deputy, you have 15 minutes.</p></speech>

Mr. Roux, you're very welcome.  And can I start by asking you do you believe that you now have sufficient powers to take direct action against banks, if that were necessary, to avoid another financial stability crisis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.472" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cyril Roux" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#Y00400"><p>I think we do have sufficient powers but I would rephrase your question.  It's not that I have sufficient powers - I am part of a system which decides.  So I do believe that the ECB has sufficient powers, but they are the decision-maker now.</p></speech>

And you might just explain how the regulation is working in practice now, the division of responsibilities between the Central Bank in Ireland and the ECB.  You have gone into it in an element of detail in your testimony which you provided but can you just advise the committee how that works in practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cyril Roux" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#Y00600"><p>Yes.  It's fairly ... it's fairly long but anything that is prudential supervision, prudential powers, that are listed in CRD IV, CRR, there's a single decision-maker and that's the governing council of the ECB, for the largest banks - so, in our country, for the four that I've listed plus the subsidiaries of eurozone group.  For instance, KBC is ... is also ... decisions on KBC are taken by the ECB because KBC is one of a top 120 groups.  I've only listed the four Irish ... either Irish headed or when the head is outside of the eurozone, but ... so for these ... for these banks, the decision ... the decisions on prudential matters are for the ECB to take.  The decisions for the smaller banks are for us to take, but under the oversight and the rule book of the ECB.  So we have to replace our procedures by the ECB-mandated procedures.  So that's for prudential supervision.  But we do more than prudential supervision, of course.  We do also the supervision of ... conduct supervision - that's outside of the ECB - and we do anti-money laundering - that's outside of the ECB as well.  So we remain fully responsible for these parts.</p></speech>

And I do so in the context of <i>The Irish Times</i>article this morning detailing some correspondence you had with the Department of Finance, albeit in relation to the insurance sector, but you raised some important issues in your letter to the Secretary General of the Department of Finance where you refer to a staff vacancy rate in the enforcement division was close to 40% due to Government pay restrictions.  Would you like to comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cyril Roux" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#Y00800"><p>Certainly.  So I think the staff working on banking ... well, you have the staff in banking supervision that I alluded to in my opening remarks, so with the three divisions that we have there ... so I think we've calculated the number of people we need.  There's a benchmarking exercise done at the ECB.  So we are towards the lower end in terms of number of people but ... so that will be revisited by the ECB benchmarking all national supervisory authorities.  Then you have the staff in enforcement and the staff in policy - banking policy - and developing the regulations.  So ... the issues are not exactly the same for the three blocks.  So I would say for prudential supervision, we have some vacancies.  We have 124 people when we have our approved complement ... or we have estimated we need 140.  But I think, here, where we are an outlier is mostly in terms of supervisory experience.  There's a lot of people coming and going and this is very different, for instance, from what I've experienced in France where you have on-site inspectors that stay for 15, 20, 25 years.  So when you compare the lengths of experience of our staff ... although they're remarkable staff, but they're gaining experience ... they just have fewer years of experience than their counterparts.</p></speech>

So the only possibility for staff to be paid more is to change jobs and they change jobs, so we have a lot of churn.  Because there are vacancies and there's a lot of opportunities within the Central Bank to apply to new jobs, so you see people changing jobs to get paid more, which is, of course, the ... the thing ... the thing-----</p></speech>

So it's ... it's not as if, you know, there's only an inflow - there's inflow and outflow.

Just to put it in context, can you give us a direct comparison, because we had evidence from Mary Burke who was the head of banking supervision, that back in 2006, for example, there was a three-person team responsible for Bank of Ireland and Anglo Irish Bank-----</p></speech>

Yes, but now ... what didn't exist at the time and exists now is that we have also an on-site division of 40 people and these ... sorry, and these 40 people will go on site in these banks and other banks, so, the on-site work is now, has to be added to these teams.  And then we have a third division, the analytics divisions were we have specialist expertise.  So if you want a special focus on, say, commercial real estate risk, credit risk in commercial real estate in this bank or that bank, you go to that third division.  So, in fact, you know you have to add up these teams, of four to six people, plus a co-ordinator in Frankfurt, because they have a line through Frankfurt.  Then you have the on-site inspectors, and then you have the specialist expertise on credit, risk liquidity risk, operational risk, etc.</p></speech>

I mentioned that in my statement.  But maybe to give more flavour, for instance, the FINREP reporting.  We moved from eight templates to 46 templates, so that's CRR and the allotment of CRR,  so the amount of reporting is, is much increased.  So we have a lot more granular data and we are ... the supervision done now through the SSM is heavy on data and reporting and, and quantitatively-based, so we have a lot of information on ... on what is building up in, in the banks ... so, yes.</p></speech>

Can I ask you Mr. Roux to clear up one thing ... this issue of principles-led regulation, which was used in Ireland and is being cited as the method of regulation in the developed world.  Where did it come from?  What's the provenance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.504" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cyril Roux" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#Z00900"><p>I listened to a few of the ... the other witnesses, and I'm struck by the fact that on ... there is this wording: "principles-based" versus "rules-based".  And when people describe it, they don't describe principle-based versus rule-based, what they describe is putting the onus on the banks themselves to solve their problems, or not taking ... being sceptical and challenging the banks.  And, to me, this is nothing to do with being rule-based or principle-based; it's, it's an ethos.</p>  <p>  So, I think you can build a very challenging principle-based supervision, if you are, you know ... or you can be a book checking rule-based supervisor.  The question is whether you have the skills to challenge.  You, you go into ... into the meat, into the substance, so you go into the collateral evaluations and you go into the impairments and you go into the accounts and you're challenging.  It's not really ... I think the moniker of principle-based or rule-based do not really describe the change in regime.  And the other reason why I think it doesn't really describe this is, okay, we have CRD IV now ... and it's more detailed, but we had CRD III and CRD II before and they were quite detailed.  So there are rules; there were rules as well before.</p></speech>

Is that what you're saying?  You can put it in your own words, but-----</p></speech>

What I would say that, Europe has chosen a very detailed rule book approach.  So if you compare the Basel III accord and the CRD IV,  CRD IV is supposed to be the transcription of the Basel III accord, but it's way bigger, way more detailed.  So that's the European approach, we want tonnes of rules.  Now, you know, the more you write rules, the more you write loopholes into rules, so, you know you could very well ... you can very well have thousands of pages of rules, which we have, and still miss ... you know, miss the ... miss the trick.  So what you need is the mindset not to check the boxes but to challenge, to be sufficiently skilled to have the right, the right people.  And these right people they have to be, you know, accountants, and experienced supervisors and, and lawyers and ... quants and credit risk analysts, etc, people that know their stuff, and be able to challenge the banks.</p></speech>

But can I ask you, Mr. Roux, to give us your view on the responsibility for the regulation of the banks in Ireland in the years leading up to the crisis?  To what extent can it be attributed to weak rules at a European level, or to what extent do you believe it is related to the system of regulation in Ireland and the manner in which that regulation was actually carried out?  Where do you apportion a weighting on both of those?</p></speech>

And a recognition of that is that when, in 2014, through the comprehensive assessment that I referred to in my speech ... there was the asset quality review of the comprehensive assessment and we were able to convince the ECB that we could reuse the balance sheet assessment of 2013 because it was so comprehensive, it was so challenging and there was a lot of quality assurance built in ... we have a very detailed work, that we convinced them that we could reuse this.  So I think, when I arrived, we knew very well the Irish banks.  And I think, it's a credit to the team, it's a credit to financial regulation but also to Governor Honohan and the rest of the bank, because the quality assurance was given on this by the financial stability division in the central banking part of the bank.  You know, loan loss forecast ... I think there was a lot of work done on the banks since the beginning of the decade and our knowledge of the banks are ... is really very good.</p></speech>

They have to ... a role in the economy and we enforce our regulations and requirements and so they come to us asking for, you know, approvals, approvals for board members, approval for using internal models, approval for issuing securities, approval for capital plans and, you know, we play it by the book, you know.</p></speech>

And we became quite familiar with the notion of the seventh floor and the meetings that took place there ... informal meetings which were not brought to the attention of banking supervision and at which no minutes were taken.  How has that situation changed?</p></speech>

Well, I think the people best placed to judge are people that are professional supervisors and know what good supervision look like and bad supervision look like.  And who are they?  Peers?  So ... or the IMF?  And we go through constant IMF and peer reviews.  So, for instance, fitness and probity standards, okay, this is less harmonised than capital requirements.  So we have guidelines and ... from the EBA.  The EBA conducted a review of our fitness and probity performance in 2014 and out of all the countries in the EU, only eight were fully compliant and were at the highest standard of fitness and probity surveillance, and Ireland was part of that.  Now, I think we can get some comfort on this bit.  And then you have how we monitor large exposures.  There's another review there by the EBA.  Then you have the IMF reviews.  The IMF teams ... they go throughout the world looking at the way, you know, national supervisory authorities operate.  So I think we can take their reviews, you know, seriously.  So we had the 2013 review, which was published in spring of 2014 ... they're coming back, and in the spring of 2016, they will be back here and they will do a financial service programme review, an FSAP review.  And so we'll be doing another round of, you know, assessment of our effectiveness.</p></speech>

I'm wondering, in your time ... in your tenure, have there been any administrative sanction enforcement actions?  Have any fines been levied on institutions and, if so, have they been paid?</p></speech>

Okay, so I will answer, you know, exactly, on enforcement ... on credit institutions ... so, since I arrived ... okay, I'll look at 2013 and 2014 ... 2013, Allied Irish Banks entered into a settlement with us for failing to ensure the accuracy of its liquidity reporting and to have internal controls in place and there are ... Allied Irish Banks admitted to the contraventions, they accepted a reprimand and penalty of &euro;490,000.  Citibank Europe entered into a settlement with us on contraventions of liquidity requirements and also paid a monetary penalty of half a million.  In 2014, Ulster Bank had, as we know, IT governance failures as, you know, 600,000 customers were affected ... deprived of banking for close to a month and they accepted a reprimand and they got a maximum penalty we could inflict on them, which was &euro;3.5 million.  The maximum ... maximum is &euro;5 million but when you come forward and you accept to enter into a settlement, you have a 30% discount, so &euro;3.5 million was the maximum amount that we could settle with.  </p>  <p>         In 2014 we entered into two other settlements, UniCredit Bank for &euro;300,000, and Bank of Montreal for &euro;650,000.  Now, there are other cases that are ongoing, and these are settlements, but there are other cases that are ongoing, and they ... the bigger the case, the longer it takes.  And we have also cases where the party is not willing to settle, and so that has to be referred to inquiry.  So it goes to the legal department and then it goes to inquiry and it's a very lengthy process of, you know, of enforcing penalties on these banks.</p></speech>

We supervise 10,000 financial service providers, 10,000, and out of which we have 200 banks.  So there's not only the, you know, the four banks that we talk about all the time but we have a number of wholesale banks, and branches and subsidiaries of wholesale banks.  As you know, we supervise the credit institution ... the credit union sector.  We have a number of ... hundreds of insurance companies and re-insurance companies.  We have thousands of retail intermediaries and ... all told, so that's 10,000 people ... 10,000, sorry, 10,000 firms that we supervise.  So that's why, although we are very concerned about the four main banks or the banking ... there's four ... the four retail banks, I have 15 divisions doing financial regulation, not three.</p></speech>

Well, up until the Central Bank supervisory and enforcement Act of August 2013, as I said, the maximum fine was &euro;5 million.  Only breaches that have happened since August 2013 can be punished by a bigger penalty, which goes up to 10% of turnover.  But, as you mentioned, elsewhere there are much, much bigger penalties and it is baffling to me, although you could extract billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions, you know, there is still wrongdoing committed.  So that's really incredible that you have ... take the biggest French bank being fined or entering its settlement with the US authorities for I think something like $9 billion and then saying subsequently that it won't affect their dividend.  So how much money do you need to extract?  It's just ... it seems ... it seems almost ... it's never enough to deter, it seems.  It's just amazing.  So I think your question is well posed in saying, well, then you have to go into individual responsibility and white-collar crime.  But the white-collar crime, I think that's an issue that, you know, I would ... certainly the Governor spoke about that not long ago.  But it's something that is, you know, partially beyond me.

And Professor Lane's testimony as well where he raised this sum initially.  And the proposition, I think, that was put forward by Professor Lane at that time is, we need to consider to move the fines onto the bankers and away from the banks.  As long as the bank is actually absorbing the fine it's just put in as part of the profit and loss margin, but the actual ... the people who are making the decisions are not affected by it.  Would you have any consideration with regard to that proposition?</p></speech>

But I think maybe, you know, it's what deters is criminal proceedings and jail terms.  Now, the level of evidence to put people in jail is very high.  It's, you know, the kind of requirements that we're looking at are requirements on firms, you know, they have to have sufficient liquidity and solvency and reporting rules.  But to attach a failure to any single individual is a very high bar in this jurisdiction, so, you know, it's something that's to be considered in the round.</p></speech>

So it's not that it was not a good domestic framework and a good response.  I think it was a, you know, a much-needed response and a much-needed improvement in the specialisation, in the organisation, in, you know, in framing banking supervision.  So I think that it's ... it's fair to say that when I arrived, I had a much, much better banking supervision than when he arrived.  But then I had to replace that by something else.</p></speech>

But the system, the PRISM system, no longer applies to Irish banks because now it applies through the ECB system, IMAS.  Now, where is IMAS coming from?  Well the ECB looked at the various systems across the eurozone and ... to decide not to build something from scratch but take one and build from it.  Which one did they choose?  They chose PRISM.  So they took the Irish system and built on it.</p></speech>

Some people might find that astonishing after all we've been through.  So could I ask you if the Central Bank anticipated non-compliance, had it been aware of this and, if so, why did it not address these issues in advance, or ... and what has been done since to rectify the situation?  Are all those compliance issues now resolved?</p></speech>

So I'll take them one by one.  The first is independence accountability, that's Basel principle 2.  So the independence of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator has been found to be compromised in Ireland by the fact that the Secretary General of the Department of Finance  is a member of the CBI commission.  And the other independence issue that has been raised by the IMF is the fact that members of the commission, including myself, can be removed without explanations being given.  So, I see that, for instance, in other countries, such as France, if the French deputy governor cannot be removed, cannot just ... cannot be removed unless for, you know, just egregious behaviour, but he cannot be removed.  I can be removed today, and with no explanation given, and other members of the Central Bank Commission.</p></speech>

So I think here we've made some progress as we've increased staffing in banking supervision by moving the approved resources from 110 to 140, and when the Central ... when the IMF came, the number of people in banking supervision was just a little under 100, and now as I said, we're 124.  That's a 25% increase.  So I think we've, you know, we've closed much of that gap.</p>  <p>  The second is supervisory techniques and tools.  So here I think the Central ... the IMF, as I mentioned, recognised that we have made a lot of progress.  I've mentioned ... I quoted other parts of their internal review that we've made substantive steps, but there were things in that were not ... we're not up to the standards.  What are the things that we're not up to the standards?  But we're not looking at the returns in the way as thoroughly as the IMF wanted, so we get a lot of returns, but they felt that other supervisors would spend more time in looking at them and challenging them, and I think that's quite different now in the SSM.  So I think that's very clear, and we'll see next year it's different.  The other thing is they felt is we didn't have enough on-site supervision, so that's closed as well because we ... and third, we didn't spend as much time as we needed on the low impact supervision.  Again, I said with 10,000 regulated entities, 9,500 as low impact as PRISM said that we should have only low ... reactive supervision.  That's not acceptable for the IMF.</p></speech>

The IMF felt that section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act of 110 asked for statutory guidelines to be issued and we looked at that and the Department of Justice said "Well, we can't issue these guidelines because that would be inconsistent with the primary legislation".  So, in fact, I think here we have the right legislation, it's just that there was a power under the Act that was not being used by Department ... by Minister for Justice.  It's really not a question for us to enter technically but I do think that on substance, it's addressed and the reason why I'm saying that I believe that on substance it's addressed, it's because of FATF, the Financial Action Task Force in 2013, concluded that we were technically compliant with its standards, so I think they know better.</p></speech>

Have ... has the bank learned considerably from the disaster that happened, the crash, the bubble etc.?</p></speech>

We have more specialist expertise.  It's better staffed ... what is lacking is just lengths of experience.  So, you know, just the distribution of experience is such that our staff are mostly junior staff and we can't keep them.  So, when you compare our staff to the staff that is available in other, in other supervisory authorities, they are younger, they have less experience.  We don't have as many people with five to ten years' experience but to have these people, you need to pay them.  You need to able to have a career progression and a pay progression and at present, we can't do that.</p></speech>

It is a bit ambiguous because a number of banks are under public ownership.  There are special ... there is the emergency liability scheme covering them.  So there's ... the State is also the shareholder of the banks.  So, it acts as, you know, in several capacities, so I think it's a bit ambiguous in that but there's no avoiding it.  Now, I think the bank ... the Central Bank should be fully independent as, you know, the IMF said and I do think that also to foster that independence, the regulation should be fully paid by the industry and not half paid by the taxpayer.</p></speech>

And that's something that Governor Honohan has raised before, before Oireachtas committees here in this House.  Mr. Roux, can I refer to the core booklet, Vol. 1, page 26.  I'll read out the section and it's very short.  It's headed "Examples of Interactive Engagement".  It says "Based on a review of [the] sample of board papers during 1992, 1995 and 2000, we have not identified matters escalated to the Board where it was decided that it was necessary to pursue prudential breaches by credit institutions on a more formal basis other than through interactive engagement based on moral suasion."  The policy of approach in prudential breaches through interactive engagement based on moral suasion, based on your experience, would this be normal or not approach for a central bank to take?</p></speech>

Some breaches are inadvertent and some breaches are willful.  Some breaches are ... come as a result of insufficient or defective processes and procedures, some not.  Some firms will self-disclose and they will come to us and say "We have had this breach and we are corrected them".  Some will actually try to hide, so you know, suppose you have a firm which has normally good controls and has an inadvertent breach and they come straight to us, it will treat them differently than a bank that is actually, you know, willingly breaching things and not telling us and I think we need to always move on two fronts.  So, we have to decide whether we go to ... we refer this to enforcement but that's ... referring to enforcement doesn't solve the issue in itself.  So, you have to solve it on a supervisory front as well.</p></speech>

One of the companies that you regulate, on their website promoted that they were basing a facility which provided light-touch regulation without the costs of an offshore entity, without the ... or a tax haven without the costs of a tax haven.  This was their promotional strap on their website.  Can I ask you, how could a company that you regulate promote itself in that way?

It's very important that people speak up and say what they think and have, you know ... have the different opinions.  So I think in the present system we have put in place risk governance panels for institutions are medium, high or both.  We have risk governance panels and it's not just the team supervising them that is present and discuss, but you have people coming from other part of the ... of the house ... of the bank and they can read independently and they say, "Well, this is not what I think you know, I have read the evidence, I know the bank less than you do but it seems that you are missing this or that", and so these are a very good place to have frank exchange of views and it's valued to be contrarian.  So that's for the banks themselves.  And then we have other, you know, we have other committee meetings and we foster this ... this exchange, we do.</p></speech>

I mean reading the Honohan report I can't tell how things were.  What I can say ... I will, sorry to ... to take this opportunity, but I must say that since a month ago, the Freedom of Information Act has been ... is now applicable to the Central Bank.  So it's very good so, you know, people can look at every single of my credit card receipts and I have no objection to that.  But we do have requests to see all the e-mails that are exchanged internally and I find this really problematic.  Okay, so there are exemptions in the Act, you know, so we have to go though every single e-mail to see whether that falls under the exemption or whether it's commercially sensitive or, you know, which reveal ... but the fact that any time I write an e-mail or someone writes an e-mail to me they have to think whether it will ... it has the potential of being published.  And I'm not talking about e-mails that I wrote long ago; we have requests for e-mails that I wrote last ... you know, yesterday or up to the date of the submission and it's very detrimental to the way we function.  So we are writing less and it is very problematic.  We are also in meetings all the time.  I am away in Frankfurt, in ... in London, the Governor is away.  My staff are all over the place and it's problematic now, really.</p></speech>

That's part of the 2013 Act.  There is a section ... a part of that Act on whistleblower disclosures and protections.  We have a whistleblower bureau.  So if anyone in the public has, you know, something to say , which is evidenced of course, it's not just, you know ... yes ... it has to be evidenced or you have something to say and you can show that, you know, you have a basis for saying it but then their identity will be protected.</p></speech>

You know, so one of the first things that were done at the beginning of the decade was to impose fitness and probity standards.  So there was no fitness and probity standards when Matthew Elderfield arrived and they were imposed at the end of 2011.  There was a general review of boards.  I think 26 members of boards of the main retail institutions resigned.  So there was a lot of scrutiny and challenge and I think the boards now have been very different from what they were a few years ago.</p></speech>

So, what do I think about the commission in which I am in and the members and ... you know, I have no issue.  I think that they are all dedicated to the public interest and, you know, it's just the arrangement is a bit unusual.  I think the arrangement is a bit unusual because the way the legislation is made is that the  ... lot of powers are vested into the commission and not to the Governor or deputy governor.  And then they have to delegate most of their powers to the Governor and deputy governor.  It's an unusual arrangement.  It would be better to ascribe powers directly to the Governor and to the deputy governor and give to the commission the powers that they can actually exercise, you know, meeting every month as an oversight board, really.  They can't manage a bank, you know.</p></speech>

In percentage of GDP, I would not know the answer.  In, I think, for ... I think for Dexia, which is a main ... the main problematic bank there was ... it is a bank that is ... strides across three countries - Belgium first, then France and Luxembourg.  </p>  <p>         And for Dexia ... Dexia is being run off with a guarantee of &euro;90 billion shared between the three states.</p></speech>

I think banking systems are very different from one country to the next.

I think we are all discussing here credit risk linked to mortgages and real estate, but there are lots of other risks that could hit us.  The biggest one is interest rate risks.  If interest rates go up by 3% or 4%, what is going to happen to households, to mortgage holders, to the firms?  This is a very serious issue?  It is a very different issue than the one we are talking about.  This is maybe the main risk, because experience is that when interest rates rise they rise very quickly and very much.  That's one risk.  Another risk is cyber risk.  We are quite concerned.  All banks experience, every day, attacks on their system.  One day they will ... they will go through and they are determined attempts to take down the European payment system or settlement system or banking system.  So these are very different risks and they're very alive and they're quite different from those of the past and the way to address them are quite different as well.</p></speech>

It's a valiant effort.  Basel II was mostly capital requirement, not very much capital.  Now we have much higher capital requirements that can be increased, we have liquidity requirements, we have a leverage ratio requirement, we have disclosure requirement, we have requirements on the compensation of risk-takers.  So instead of looking on one dimension, which I think was wrong and doomed from the start, we are now asking a number of requirements and a number of dimensions.  But you are right, it isn't tested and, you know, there might be some flaw.  It is just the best we can do.</p></speech>

Are there risks from these sources of financing that, Basel III or that, are unregulated by sectors within finance?</p></speech>

The European economy is mostly financed through bank lending, and that's different from, as we know, the US economy which is mostly financed through market funding.  So the capital markets union, that is one of the primary objectives of the current EU Commission is to grow market funding and you grow market funding by using non-banks - it is exactly the definition of that, it means through the issuance of securities, including equity.  I think it's a good thing that there is more finance through equity finance rather than debt finance.  And we have too much debt finance in the economy and that exposes more risk.  You can always decide not to pay a dividend, but you have to pay your coupon.  If you don't pay it you are defaulting.</p></speech>

I have to impact with these ... we have the fund industry, say money market funds for instance, they are regulated and we are a big place here in Ireland of money markets, and they are really regulated.  I strongly object to something you haven't said but I hear sometimes that anything that is not a bank is a shadow bank, so not regulated.  This is not true at all.

I am a board member of the European Securities and Markets Authority and I can tell you that we are looking at incredibly detailed rules.  That's the European way, it's very, very prescriptive and very detailed and very granular.  It's just very different, we don't go through capital requirements, we go through rules about client assets and custodians and settlement systems and it's a different environment.  But you're right, I think it's very good that you give me this opportunity to say well finance is not just banking and actually banking relies on this surrounding of markets and funds and other sorts of funding.</p></speech>

These are ... list the powers of the supervisory authority, and the supervisory authority is the ECB.  So, we have lots of instruments, and, if I can just take a minute, it's not as if, you know, you have supervision - and supervision is just about, you know, moral suasion and meetings with people - and then you have enforcement.  A very ... the biggest power we ... we have, I think, is that we decide the capital requirement.  So, it's not just a calculation.  We do calculations but then it's judgment based.  And when you decide, as we did here in Ireland, that the banks need 10.5% of ... of core tier 1, you force them ... or you force the State to recapitalise them.  When you ask PTSB, through the comprehensive assessment, to reach 5.5% in a stress test and they're below that, you force them to raise hundreds of millions.  So, that's not enforcement, that's supervisory powers.  You put the bar where you think it should be and then that's, you know, that costs hundreds of millions or billions.  It's a very important power.</p></speech>

Up to 4 November 2014, you know, the ECB and us were working on the comprehensive assessment but decisions were made by ... by me, you know, in a sense.  So, for instance, when Bank of Ireland issued equity at the end of 2013, you know, they wanted to make a number of ... of operations on the capital structure and that needed a supervisory approval.  So, you know, I decided, you know, what I would agree on and what I would not agree on with the bank.  And now that would go through the governing council of the ECB.</p></speech>

You cannot be capricious.  You know, I can't just say "I don't like this so you're not going to ... you're not going to get it".  You know, there, so ... these are commercial firms, they have rights, so any decision that we take has to withstand scrutiny and withstand appeal.  So, you know, we ... we have to have a good case.

So I'll just say two things.  First, France is one of several countries in Europe where on-site supervision is very ... very developed.  Right, there are 200 people there doing only on-site supervision and they've done on-site supervision for ... for decades.  So we have very experienced on-site supervisors and they ... they're quite robust, quite sceptical.  So, that's a signal strength of French supervision in banking and that has been brought to ... to the SSM and brought to Ireland.  The other thing is that it's very ... you know this principle based, I don't understand it, you know, you had the CRD and that was detailed enough, and then you had a further detail in secondary legislation in France, so the code that you had to apply is, you know, hundreds of pages long.  So, people would ... would apply the <i>code mon&eacute;taire et financier</i>, and that's a very detailed code.  So, that's the way, you know, that's the way we worked, you know, we'd say &quot;Well this ... this prescription here or that prescription there is infringed&quot;  and ... and you ... you ... but-----</p></speech>

So, enforcement ... and while saying it takes years, you know, and it ... it doesn't solve anything.  You just say "Well we've noticed that in the past or recently you didn't do this", so you take years to develop, and you do the enforcement case, but you need to do the supervisory power.  So, we ... you instruct or direct this to be solved by such and such a date.  So, we say we'll give you three months to solve this, you know?  For instance, you have a large exposure.  You have too ... too much exposure to one counter-party, okay, so you've reached that.  Okay, you do the enforcement case, that will take you several years.  But you want this to be solved and ... and, so you ... you have to get into a robust conversation ... how long will it take the bank to reduce that exposure?  And you can't ... sometimes if it's not just a securities that you're holding but a property or something, you know, to unwind you have to discuss it with the bank how much time you give them to unwind it.  So, that's a ... that's a supervisory dialogue.</p></speech>

In comparison to the level of financial reports you've seen in your regulatory career previously, which I ...

So, these are standards that are actually developed at the European Banking Authority and they are used throughout.  The ... there were some elements that were-----</p></speech>

There are some parts that were not under COREP and FINREP, that's the liquidity reporting, because liquidity rules were domestic ... so, were national.  So the liquidity ratio ... the French liquidity ratio is different from the Irish liquidity ratio when the reporting is ... is, you know, is ... according to domestic legislation.

So the own funds, the description of the own funds, the breakdown, the calculation of the requirement, all of that is in COREP and FINREP.  For liquidity, it is not the same requirement so it is difficult to say.  Everything that appears in the requirement is then detailed in the template, it is quite different.  Anyway, now that is of the past really.  Now we're working on a harmonised template.  We are developing the liquidity templates.</p></speech>

And then I would say it is not all about the supervisor.  It is also about the business model of banks.  So the French banks in the main are universal banks, so they do not do only property-related lending; they do a lot of customer finance.  We don't have ... there is no credit unions so the small loans are also part of the business model of the banks.  Then, I guess, the structure of the economy is such that there is more industry to finance, so there is more industry financing.  Aircraft leasing, aircraft financing and shipping is also done within the banks and not outside of the banks.  It is different as well in the way that mortgages are protected through mortgage insurance and they are re-financed through securitisation and covered instruments are quite different from covered banks and the covered instruments, they are very different animals.  Also they are a lot more internationally diversified than----</p></speech>

So on the same vein Mr. Roux, in your opinion is the current supervisory regime robust enough to prevent another crisis?</p></speech>

Whether we are well equipped against cyber risk or, you know,  a very different crisis, I cannot give you full assurance.  I do not know, we do our best.  We challenge ourselves, we try and recruit IT specialists and to take that one example, so we are very alive to the fact that there are a number of risks weighing on the banking system and the financial system, not just credit risk.</p></speech>

In an earlier exchange with Mrs. O'Dea this morning on the genesis of crises and how they arise, one of the things that came under discussion was the belief system that because the previous crisis has now seen measures implemented that it is different now to what it was in the past, which is a belief system saying that it most likely won't happen again.  So in that regard, could I ask you what changes and recommendations, if any, are still outstanding from the previous reports and are there plans to introduce these changes into the future?</p></speech>

For instance the CRD IV and the BRRD and the single resolution mechanism, all of that will take the better part of a decade to unfold.  We are not finished.  There are wider risks in the financial system and they are being addressed through a great many regulations, such as securities financing, CSDR, SFDR and all of these regulations that will unfold.  There is something quite important I think that is outside of my remit but it is very important, is the accounting part.  We are still working with accounts that are based on incurred losses, not expected losses.  For an insurance supervisor this is astonishing and they will have to wait until the end of the decade to move to expected losses in the accounts of banks.  This is really bad.  Another thing which I think is really problematic is the tax advantage which is given to debt financing, so we are just encouraging a debt finance economy instead of an equity finance economy.  It is not good.  So there are things that are very important.</p></speech>

Mr. Roux, I would like to ask, you mentioned that the decision to take actions against large Irish banks rests with the ECB.  Can I ask who recommends that action?  Is it the supervisory teams of the Central Bank of Ireland or the supervisory teams from the ECB?</p></speech>

The joint supervisory team is made of people in Frankfurt and people here for banks which are smaller than or which are, you know, not the very biggest bank in Europe.  There is one person in Frankfurt for our banks, for each of our banks, so that person is called a JST co-ordinator and it is that person who decides with, you know, working through their hierarchy what to do.  But they are working daily.  They are exchanging throughout the day, every day of the year on these banks.</p></speech>

So, I think the ... look, this is what the Governor told me, I haven't looked in the case.  I understand that a case can, you know, that the basis of his exchange with the Department of Finance, that a case can still be made based on the published intention of the Government at the time the contract was written.  So, this is contract law, this is exactly, I think, I would say, this is exactly the kind of discussions we no longer want to have under BRRD and that's why we're working on resolution plans and we are working so that the securities issued, the bonds that are issued by banks or by their parent, by their holding companies, are very clearly "bail-inable" and we don't have this-----</p></speech>

Can I ask if risks which you identified yourself, such as interest rate risks, the risks of IT systems in banks, for example, are they now greater risks for the banking system than concentration risks, such as lending too much to any one sector of the economy and, if so, what is the Central Bank doing to reduce those risks?</p></speech>

So this is ... so when we do our planning at the ECB - on "What are we going to spend time on?  Where are we going to do our on-site supervision?  Where do we concentrate our work?" - we have decided in 2015, and it will probably, you know, continue next year, that we spend more time ... we devote more time on this.  So, it's just allocation of resources and expertise.  Now, on the regulation front, there's more as well.  The Basel committee, for instance, has published a consultation the day before yesterday on management and monitoring of interest rate risks.</p></speech>

And we deal with session 3 this evening ... or this afternoon's public hearing is with Mr. Tom O'Connell, former assistant director general and chief economist, Central Bank. The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.</p><p>Today we continue our hearings with senior officials from the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Regulator and at our session this afternoon we will hear from Mr. Tom O'Connell, former assistant director general, chief economist at the Central Bank.  Tom O'Connell joined the Central Bank of Ireland in 1970 as an economist, he was appointed assistant director general of the economics division in April 200.  As chief economist, his responsibilities were economic analysis, research and publications, monetary policy and financial stability statistics.  He retired in 2010.  Mr. O'Connell, you are very welcome before the inquiry this afternoon.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should then be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they've come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and answered which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  And members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are to be confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence to the inquiry.  So, if I can now ask the clerk, in commencing proceedings, to administer the oath to Mr. O'Connell.  Thank you.</p></speech>

If I may take it ... the committee through my opening statement.  Thank you.  Ireland&rsquo;s banking and economic crash should never have happened, should never have been allowed to happen, with all the consequences of huge increases in unemployment, rising emigration, enormous debt, suicides, etc., that we have seen. As well as addressing the aspects that I have been asked to deal with by the joint committee, I would like to talk about our experiences from my perspective as the head of the economics function in the Central Bank from 2005 until 2009.</p>  <p>   In his report on the crisis, Professor Honohan described what happened here as a world-beating property bubble.  As early as around the turn of the millennium, the head of the IMF Article IV mission to Ireland, James Morsink ... I remember him saying to us that a country could not prosper on the basis of selling property to one another at increasingly elevated prices - an obvious truism.  The huge excesses here are well known, but I think that it is worth recalling some examples.  As Donal Donovan and Antoin Murphy have noted in their book on the crash, the size of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet in 2007 was six times what it was in 2001.  The former chief executive of Bank of Ireland himself has stated that it took Bank of Ireland 200 years to grow its balance sheet to &euro;100 billion; it took only four further years for the second &euro;100 billion to be added on to reach &euro;200 billion.  And, of course, Bank of Ireland was the most conservative of all the Irish banks.  A further example of the absurd mania at its height was the fact that a small site in Ballsbridge was acquired for &euro;174 million at the height of the crisis - at the height of the boom, I should say - and purchased not so long ago for &euro;22 million, that&rsquo;s a fall of 87% ... you know, an indication of the huge excesses that we experienced.</p>  <p>  If I can turn to the independence of the Central Bank, as you know, the Central Bank&rsquo;s independence is established in law, essentially as a result of the EU treaties and the ECB statute.  There's a reason why central banks are legally independent - so that they can take tough, unpopular decisions when required, without regard to populist government priorities.  This applies, in particular, to monetary policy issues.  However, it has to be asked how independent the Central Bank was on other matters.  Patrick Honohan, in his report, stated that the authorities displayed undue deference to the banks.  In my view, this applied equally to the authorities&rsquo; relationship with Government.  Was the Central Bank going to act independently, and to possibly take unpopular decisions, if the Governor was always appointed by the Minister, with whom he had worked intimately for many years prior to his appointment, and with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance always serving on the board of the bank?  Further, the boards of the Central Bank and regulator were also heavily weighted with political supporters of Government.  In practice, it was my experience that any concerns or issues raised by staff for airing in the public arena were invariably watered down so as not to reflect adversely on matters of concern to Government.  That was an undesirable state of affairs.  While vested interests can be cheerleaders for asset prices, the authorities have a duty to be unflinching, straight and upfront on these matters.</p>  <p>  I think it would be useful for me to reflect on the governance arrangements in the Central Bank.  The decision-making entities in the bank in my time were the board and the Governor.  The staff provided reports and advice to the board and Governor through the director general and deputy director general - what we economists would call the "kitchen cabinet", if you like.  Now, some time ago, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, perhaps Ireland&rsquo;s most eminent public servant, regretted the passing of the stage where public servants gave their advice and opinions objectively without reference to political or populist issues, or to anticipate what might be welcomed by the Minister.  In the Central Bank, it was difficult to get views through that might impinge on vested interests.  For example, as land and property prices escalated to bizarre and absurd levels, I had written, in a low key way for the bank&rsquo;s bulletin ... comment in its quarterly bulletin, that there was a need to consider the issue of rezoning more land for building in order to increase housing supply.  That&rsquo;s also an issue of course of continuing relevance at present.  I saw Colm McCarthy writing in the newspaper last Sunday about that.  But that was blocked from reaching a higher level in the bank in the light, in my view, of political and property interests on the bank&rsquo;s board.  Of course, as the demand mania for property took off against the background of restrictive zoning which limited the supply of housing, the inevitable result was huge property price inflation.</p>  <p>  I think I should also say a few words about the relationship between the Central Bank and IFSRA &ndash; the financial regulatory authority - at least from the perspective of the economics function in the bank.  While, at the operational level, the bank interacted with the banks through market operations - in the wholesale payment system target, for example - there was little or no contact after 2003, when the new regulator was set up, on major policy matters.  As far as I could see, contact with banks was primarily effected through IFSRA.  This was such that at a certain point, I think towards the mid-noughties, the Governor began to arrange high-level meetings with the main banks at occasional intervals to discuss ... discuss the big issues.  I would have attended quite a lot of these.  Further, in the bank, we had no knowledge of the large exposures of the banks to individual developers.  Such data were rigorously concealed from my level in the bank.  Of course, we were aware that banks&rsquo; aggregate lending was increasing enormously and was concentrated in the property sector.  I had a discussion with one of the consultants that was brought into IFSRA after the crash.  I mentioned to him the name of one large developer, he, in turn, asked me how much I thought that ... that developer might have outstanding in borrowings.  I suggested &euro;1 billion; he said I could triple it.  That, and newspaper reports that 15 borrowers from Anglo Irish Bank had borrowings in excess of &euro;750 million each, together with the disclosure at your inquiry here that 20 developers had total borrowings of between &euro;21 billion and &euro;22 billion, were news to me.</p>  <p>  It's sometimes said that nobody seemed to know that a property boom or bubble was developing.  That's ... that is completely incorrect in my view.  You will recall, for example, that, in his evidence to your committee here, Peter Nyberg - himself the author of a report on the collapse - asserted that it was obvious that a property-lending mania was afoot.  At the decision-making levels in the bank, either people were unaware of what was happening, despite the clear evidence, or they were aware and chose to do nothing.  Either way, it all seems quite incomprehensible to me.  </p>  <p>           While the bank in its public utterances presented a low-key assessment of what was happening, that is not to say it was not fully aware of the major excesses.  The annual financial stability reports reviewed comprehensively what was happening and Patrick Honohan&rsquo;s report acknowledged that the three major excesses were well recognised in the FSRs, the Financial Stability Reports: there was the huge increase in bank lending, the concentration of this lending in the property sector, and the very large reliance on the ... by the banks on potentially volatile wholesale funding.  The main body of the stability reports set out extensively how almost all indicators were pointing massively in the wrong direction.  By contrast, the overall assessment and tone which reflected the views of the two boards tended to be reassuring &ndash; talking of a soft landing, and so on.  In fact, I should say that one member of the board did have grave doubts, to the effect that I can recollect his words still ringing in my ear, "It was all a house of cards and would all end in tears".  However, his views appear not to have had any impact on policy-making in the bank.  Notwithstanding that director&rsquo;s views, it was probably necessary, in any event, to present such a rather hopeful overall assessment in public since the Central Bank could hardly conclude that the banks were about to collapse.  However, whatever the published assessment, the authorities should have been working assiduously behind the scenes to curb the huge excesses and reckless lending of the banks &ndash; egregious risk-taking, as Patrick Honohan has termed it recently in his speech.</p> <p> I don't want to go right through the whole thing, but I point out on page six of my opening statement there that, as another confirmation of us being aware of the problems emerging, the Governor and his letters to this Minister pre-budget frequently flagged the very high increase in the bank lending and the property prices and by implication, the natures of something above that.  So it wasn't as if we were unaware of these things.  In fact, you may recollect, the Government itself, through the Department of the Environment had around ... I think it was 1999 ... requested three reports from the economist, Peter Bacon, to assess what could be done to alleviate rising property prices.</p> <p> Around that time, a memo was sent from the economics function of the bank to the then Governor, recommending that bank lending to the property sector needed to be reined in.  For many years in the past, some of you may recollect the Central Bank had actually imposed credit ceilings on banks in the interest of prudence.  The response to the note, which was sent up to the Governor, was that he would have to consider bringing this proposal to the board, which is fair enough.  However, at the top of the note were the words, evidently added subsequent to the first comment, "That is out of the question".  I have a copy of that memo as well.</p> <p> Other specific responses given to me in reply to my pleas to rein in the banks were, verbatim: "The Central Bank is not going to disadvantage the Irish banking sector", and "The Central Bank is not going to collapse the construction sector", when, you know, construction sector really took off and we were completing 90,000 houses, or close to that, in 2006.  On another occasion, when bank lending to the property sector was increasing at the astronomical rate of 65% year on year, I urged a very senior member of the Financial Regulator staff, that bank lending to the property sector needed to be curtailed.  The response that I was given was that the lending was secured on property &ndash; that's true in almost all other property-related banking crashes that proved to be worthless when property prices crashed from unsustainable levels.  I, personally, was also specifically prevented from bringing forward to the bank&rsquo;s financial stability committee, data on house price levels across Europe that showed the extraordinary heights prices had reached here relative to elsewhere.  In fact, prices here were higher than anywhere else in Europe, any capital city, Amsterdam, Brussels, etc, except for central London.  And of course, central London is a special case where you've got Arab sheikhs and Russian oligarchs and so on, buying properties.  So, the net result was that the powers-that-be preferred to adopt an ostrich-like approach to the massive problem.  I offer a few more examples there of the extent to which people were not willing to recognise the problem that was emerging at the top of page 8.</p> <p> If I may go on ... in fact, in addition to the red flags in the stability reports, which Patrick Honohan recognised in his report, a financial expert has also reviewed the annual reports of the Central Bank over the years in the journal studies of spring 2009 and he has come to the same conclusion that the authorities were well aware of the dangerous situation that was developing, but decided to do nothing.  In fact, what Peter Nyberg, who interviewed me ... the author of the banking report ... he kept asking me "Why did nobody do anything?" ... several times "Why did nobody do anything?"  And I am afraid that the answer has to be that the authorities simply did not wish to do anything.  And actually, Peter Nyberg also asked me why I did not publish a newspaper article on the bubble.  I said to him that that would have been highly unorthodox - it would be like a civil servant, you know, writing an article in the newspaper, criticising the Minister of financial policy ... it just wouldn't be on ... in any event, I don't think it would've had an effect at a time when the Taoiseach was saying that anyone who was questioning the sustainability of what was happening should go and commit suicide.  And in fact, you should recollect in the event when Morgan Kelly ... Professor Morgan Kelly wrote about the probability of a crash, he was derided - he was literally shouted down at an economics conference where he was presenting his paper on the property market.  So, you know, people didn't want to know.</p> <p> In fact, one also has to ask whether there was any appreciation in the commercial banks that things were getting out of hand.  On the face of it, it would seem that certain divisions of the banks &ndash; maybe the capital markets divisions - were in fact well aware that we were experiencing a property bubble.  You have to ask, "Why else would the two main banks have decided to sell off their headquarters buildings and major landmark branches at colossal prices at the height of the bubble?"  Was it the case that their lending colleagues in the banks were, at the same time, even financing, in whole or in part, the acquisition of these premises?  And from the Central Bank side, you know, one has to ask, "How did the Central Bank see the erosion of the banks&rsquo; deposit base being halted as the Central Bank pumped increasingly vast amounts of liquidity into the banks to prop them up?"  In fact, you may be aware of the fact that the total ... the maximum amount ... or at its peak rather, the amount of liquidity pumped out into the banks was &euro;140 billion, you know, with the ... both from the Central Bank and the ECB.  I mean, once you spell that out, that's &euro;140,000 million - there are 12 digits in that.  So, you can well understand why the ECB was jumping up and down when the accommodation provided to Irish banks was at ... was at that massive level.</p> <p> Now, if may I turn to a few words about the role of economists in the Central Bank.  During the critical period 2000 to 2007 when the property mania was at its height, none amongst the top three executives in the bank was an economist &ndash; not that economists are the fount of all wisdom, I would have to admit.  This would have been less of an issue if there was a willingness to listen to the views of economists, I would admit.  You may recollect the Canadian expert, Rob Wright, saying to you here that he noted the relatively small number of economists employed in the Department of Finance, having 7% of staff being economists compared with 60% in Canada&rsquo;s Department of Finance.  This aversion to economists really carried over to the Central Bank, I would admit, and was part of the problem.</p> <p> In addition, the Financial Regulator employed very few economists.  A member of top management in the bank put it to me on one occasion, that the bank wants economists and other specialists to be "on tap but not on top".  So, economists were in a sort of cul-de-sac.  And this rather recalls the episode in the early 1920s when the Governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, said to the chief economist, "You are not here to tell us what to do, but to explain to us why we have done it".</p> <p> However, it is the norm now in almost all central banks for economists to occupy the great majority of the top decision-making positions for the obvious reason that central banks are primarily concerned with issues in the area of macroeconomics, monetary policy and financial economics.  On the other hand, in Ireland, the top positions in both the bank and Financial Regulator were filled traditionally by administrators and accountants.  Accountants by their work and training are concerned with detail, but do they always see the bigger picture?  The clean bill of health given by external auditors to all the banks right up to and even beyond the crash would suggest otherwise.  In fact, you may recollect, I checked it out there on the website, the Anglo-Irish bank profits in November 2008 were declared to be &euro;784 million and that was post the Lehman's problem in September 2008.  It would seem to me that accountants tend take a more backward-looking perspective on a balance sheet ... I mean, that's maybe what they're expected to do ... whereas examining a balance sheet from an economics perspective would entail a more forward-looking consideration.  Perhaps, in the wake of the crash, now, it could be argued that the type of appointments within the Central Bank structure, has lurched too far in the other direction, with economists predominating at the top of the bank and regulatory function.  In my view, there should be a diversity of skills and backgrounds at the highest level of the bank and Financial Regulator.</p> <p> Having said that, it is quite extraordinary that, at the highest level, there seemed to be a blindness to the fact that there had been a whole series of recent property-related banking crashes - we had them in Japan, Finland, Sweden, the savings and loan sector in the US, Norway, the Lawson mini-boom in the UK 1989, 1990.  Of course, the sub-prime crisis in the US itself and the related securitisation of mortgage assets that led to massive losses for many international banks was also a property-related phenomenon.  And one shouldn't forget that in the years leading up to the crash, the Bank for International Settlements, the BIS, of which Ireland, through the Central Bank, is a shareholder, had also been warning consistently for some time about the runaway evolution of asset prices with wholly inadequate attention being paid to risk.  </p>  <p>         Despite all of that, there seemed to be little interest in such experiences elsewhere, with the implicit belief that they had little relevance for Ireland.  In my view, this was a manifestation of a closed mind and an unwillingness to learn.  While economists were well aware of these banking debacles, their relevance to Ireland did not seem to register at a level where it should have done.  The view seemed to be, as the clich&eacute; has it, that the time ... this time is different, or we are experiencing a new paradigm.  <br/><br/>Now, some people suggest that it was the collapse of Lehman's that brought down the Irish banks.  Now that event didn't help clearly, as Lehman's failure did greatly affect liquidity flows, interbank lending, etc.  However, as the UCC economist, Seamus Coffey, noted in a radio interview some time ago:</p><blockquote>Ireland's crash derived from developments between 2002 and 2007.  Our problem was a pre-existing property bubble, before Lehman's hit.</blockquote> <p>And related to the fact of the enormous increase in bank lending, Irish banks of course were significantly dependent on borrowing from the wholesale markets, which were greatly affected by the Lehman's event.  Countries that had no such bubble, small countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, and Finland, they experienced some problems associated with the failure of Lehman's, but nothing on the scale of Ireland's banking crash and collapse.  Our problem was a banking insolvency one.  As Professor Honohan's report put it, the source of our problems was homegrown.  Those who suggest that Lehman's brought us down are almost wholly wrong, and are merely seeking an external scapegoat, not the first time this would have happened in Ireland, in my view.  <br/><br/>It was also suggested that, being in the eurozone, we were the victims of huge capital inflows to Ireland.  This again is a fairly thin argument.  Ireland participated in a quasi-monetary union with the UK from 1825 to 1979, when we joined the EMS.  We have plenty of experience of living in a monetary union.  We also joined the euro with our eyes open.  If monetary conditions were not particularly optimal from Ireland's point of view, the corollary was that other policies should be used to deliver the appropriate economic conditions.  This would have meant,<i>inter alia</i>, restrictive fiscal policy as well as a tightening of bank regulation.  However, this would have run counter to the naive populist policies of the then Government.  <br/><br/>In summary, it was crystal clear from about the turn of the millennium, and even before, Ireland was experiencing a major property bubble; &quot;a world beating one&quot;, in Professor Honohan's words.  It is not credible that those who ought to have been aware of what was happening were in the dark.  One can only surmise that, as Professor Alan Ahearne has said here to your committee, too many people were benefitting from the boom time for prudence avoidance ... prudent avoidance measures to have been taken.  Such necessary measures would not have been popular, but that should not weigh with those whose duty it was to ensure the country did not experience the catastrophe that we so painfully and unnecessarily suffered.  <br/><br/>Now I know, Chairman, that you want to derive some lessons from the crisis too, so I've jotted down a couple of points there, but I will leave it to yourselves, you know, to take those on board as you see fit.  Thank you very much.</p></speech>

I wouldn't disagree too much with that, you know?  But, as I said, even though a lot of the ... nearly all the indicators were pointing in a very bad direction in the body of the report.  The financial stability reports normally had to conclude, and in fact when I was interviewed by Donal Donovan and Paul Gorecki  from the ESRI for the Honohan report, I'd no sooner taken a seat for the interview when they say ... they took out the 2007 financial stability report and they read the third paragraph, I can recollect, and they put it to me: "Wasn't that very complacent?"  And my recollection of that paragraph was that it starts ... it said "The risks in the financial stability ... in the financial system have increased and our" ... it's all worrying but it'll be all right on the night.  Now a central bank probably couldn't say anything else, you know, other than that, so ... in fact, as you probably know, the financial stability reports have ceased since then, and ... because they could never conclude other than that "things are manageable."  If they said, "The banks are going to fall over", you'd have a run on the banks massively.</p></speech>

I think it was the ... Michael McDowell, sometime in or around early September 2006, made a comment about it, the housing market was slowing down anyway but the speculation over stamp duty certainly had an immediate impact upon it, and the ... there was a slowdown in purchase as well.  There was an assessment that the housing ... that the housing sector and construction sector was 24% of the Irish economy, twice of what it should have actually been, there was a whole load of information there with regard to loan-to-values, 100% mortgages, and, as was borne out later, that there was a structural deficit as well that was going to be faced because a lot of taxes were based upon consumption, and if consumption dropped, as we saw with the entry to the bailout programme, there was a shortfall of &euro;30 billion.  So when I put that proposition to Mr. Neary, Mr. Neary's response was, "Well, in the background that you have just presented there, Chairman, I think it does call the assessment into question."  This is the 2000 financial ... or the 2007 report.  "And you know I think reading that now and looking back on it, I think the message coming out from that statement to me is 'don't spook the horses.'  That's clearly the message there."  Was the report ... would you agree with Professor Neary's, or care to comment upon Mr. Neary's statement there that it was an exercise in not spooking the horses?</p></speech>

No matter how ... I mean, if the analysis of the indicators proved to be positive, you could certainly say things were fine.  If the analysis proved to be negative, a central bank had to sort of put a positive gloss on things rather than frightening the horses.  I think you're right.  So it's a sort of a predicament, you know.  You may recollect when the Northern Rock run happened, it happened because somebody, and I'm not sure whether it was the Bank of England or some commentator, they mentioned that emergency liquidity was being supplied to Northern Rock.  So the use of the word "emergency" caused that run.  So, you know, that would confirm to you that you had to be very careful, and maybe be elliptical about one's assessment of the overall picture, but it was pretty clear to me that, you know, we had a major property bubble and it had to burst at some time.  One could never say when, but that was underlying the ... what was happening in the Irish economy.</p></speech>

I'll give you two examples there.  It'll come up on the screen at the moment, you say, "when around 2005, ... Alan Barrett had expressed a view in an ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary that the banks were in a rather fragile state, I was instructed to request the Director of the ESRI to ensure that such comments were not published in future".  You then go on say, "In the 2007 Financial Stability Report [that we just discussed], a deliberate decision was taken to delete the conclusions of a research study updating the extent of the overvaluation of Irish property services".

Well, in relation to the Alan Barrett comment, which was at ... I think it happened at the launch of the ESRI quarterly commentary, and I think the reference to the fragility of the banks was actually in the quarterly commentary, I was, I was asked by somebody senior to me in the bank to ring Frances Ruane in the ESRI, which I duly did, and asked that, you know, those references should not arise in the future.  Now to some degree that's understandable, you know.  If the leading research institute is commenting on the possibility of the banks collapsing, I mean, it's one thing to try to sort of cool down those comments but I would argue that behind the scenes, something should be done to prevent that happening and that really wasn't happening at that time.</p></speech>

When I used to go to Paris to ... with people to look at the reports, almost every line was parsed, and any, anything of a negative nature needed to be taken out.  So, for example, if ... let's say if the OECD was saying that the house price increases are "very significant", they would be asked to maybe alter that to "quite significant", you know.  I felt it was quite embarrassing.  My attitude to these things was the IMF came here for the Article IV missions; we spoke to them, we gave them our views.  My attitude was, let them go off and make up their own minds and come back and if their view is different from ours, having considered what we had said to them, so be it.  And if they have different views from those prevailing in the country as a whole, I think that would help domestic economic debate.</p></speech>

In that regard, but if we were to take the context of the contrarian, if you take the Nyberg report or the Honohan report, that they talk about the herd instincts, so somebody who was operating outside the herd would have been a contrarian even though they might have been talking the world of sense.

I mean, for example, I used to say to my colleagues, almost every day, we had to have more land zoned.  In fact, I used to joke with them and sort of say ... I mean, because the restrictive ... the restriction on housing supply ensured by the restrictive zoning meant that when the demand for housing went up you'd have vertical supply curve, land went up, house, property prices went through the roof.  I used to say to the people that you could, you know, zoning should be freed up everywhere bar Stephen's Green, Howth Head and Killiney Head - jokingly, because, you may recollect, I mean ... and, in fact, Jerome Casey, who was a construction sector analyst who wrote about this extensively and he said, he noted that in north County Dublin, the zoned land was owned by eight developers.

The Central Bank is not going to disadvantage the Irish banks and by that they mean ... that was happening at a time when the, the ... some of the foreign owned banks, like Ulster Bank and Bank of Scotland Ireland were going mad with 100% mortgages and they were throwing confetti around the ... loans around like confetti.  So, it was said to me that yes, we're not going to, to inhibit the Irish banks.  In other words, we're going to let them compete with these mad guys, you know.</p></speech>

Governor Hurley, when he was before this committee, stated:</p><blockquote>I was not aware of contrarian views within the Central Bank, which differed in substance from the Bank's overall assessment[s].

I would have often ... I would have often said informally, I won't say daily, but I would say weekly - and I'm under oath - I would have said to my senior people that things were going crazy; the banks have to be reined in.  I said this many a time.  In fact, when the ... they mentioned there that one of the leading people in the regulatory staff, I said to him that property and construction lending at that particular point was growing at 65% year on year.  Now, you have to recollect, this was in the euro area.  The ECB indicated that the appropriate growth in the money stock in the euro area was 4% to 4.5%, credit and money 4% to 4.5%.  We were at 65%.  You know, I mean that was 16 times-----</p></speech>

Subsequently, the financial stability department would be liaising with the regulator about information or data, that sort of thing, but they weren't really actively involved beyond that point, you know.</p></speech>

In actual fact, the head of the financial stability department, although he had the title senior adviser, he was on the same salary as me, so in fact, he often, in practice, dealt with the director general who was the chair of the financial stability committee ... so ... but I would have had a lot of sort of lateral contact with the head of the financial stability department and, you know, we worked in the bank and we had written papers for a long time together and so on.</p></speech>

In fact, it's pretty common for asset price adjustments, particularly in stock markets, as you know ... whatever ... a currency thing ... for commodity markets to get abrupt drops.  In fact, quite often you'll get an overshooting downwards.  Now, housing market will be ... sort of ... you ... maybe you'll get a slower adjustment, if you like, but you probably can't ... you can never say <i>ab initio</i>... as I think it's more in hope than in confidence you'd talk about soft landings.  But, if sentiment, sort of, decreases monotonically or gradually, you might get a ... a ... a gradual fall but you certainly couldn't rule out ... I mean, for example, the instances in Sweden, Finland, Japan, the savings and loans in the States, they were pretty precipitous falls, you know.  So, I suppose the Central Bank had to come down on one side or the other ... was there going to be a ...  could we say there was going to be a hard landing?Well, for starters you wouldn't know <i>ex ante</i>if it's going to be soft or hard but, in general, I suppose, all central banks would tend to, more in hope than in confidence, say &quot;We'd hope for a soft landing rather than a hard landing&quot;.</p></speech>

And, you know, we were seeing a gradual fall, I guess.  The stability report came out probably in November 2007, so you were seeing a sort of a gradual fall ... a fall away and it was probably an extrapolation of that but there would have been, to my knowledge, no analytical or no high-powered analysis to prove that, you know ... of the binomial possibilities, that it was going to be a soft rather than a hard landing.  You could possibly extrapolate from the peak property price period in February 2007, given that up through autumn there'd been gradual falls but, you know, if something was going to hit the system, people like the buy-to-let investors and so on might've had to get out quickly, you know.</p></speech>

You say in your opening statement, talking about the financial stability reports, that the overall assessment in tone which reflected the views of the two boards tended to be reassuring and you imply that this was in contrast to the main body of the financial stability reports, which would you have drafted.   So what are you saying there?  Did that language come from the board?</p></speech>

I mean, they would have had a day-long consideration of the body of the report - all the details, data and so on - and they would form their views and that would be embodied in the editorial, sort of.  So, I always felt there was a potential disconnect, if you like, between the body of the report, the technical analysis and the overview.</p></speech>

In particular, there was no update of the McQuinn-O'Reilly (2006) model.  However, an internal staff updating of this model undertaken in April 2008 (after publication of the 2007 [report]) indicated that house price overvaluation was estimated to have reached almost 35 per cent by mid-2007.</blockquote>  <p>In your opening statement you say that &quot;a deliberate decision was taken [in preparing the 2007 financial stability report] to delete the conclusions of a research study updating the extent of the overvaluation of Irish property prices&quot;.  So, first of all, was the 2006 Quinn-O'Reilly model updated in advance of the 2007 financial stability report?</p></speech>

I'm sure ... I would stand to be corrected on this but I would imagine the draft financial stability report probably had that update in it but it was taken out.</p></speech>

You'll probably note from, you know, both Nyberg and Honohan and so on that you won't get anything terribly definitive.  In fact, you may recollect going back to Greenspan ... Greenspan famously or infamously said "I can never know whether there's a bubble there or not but what I'll do is, I'll pick up the pieces after the bubble", you know, so that's not a very wise thing to do.  But, not, the 35% estimate would have been an underestimate in my view.  </p>  <p>         And in the event it was, of course, it was very much an underestimate.</p></speech>

But again it's more ... you could say it is a bit of wishful thinking, you know.  Nobody can ... can say <i>ex ante</i>whether it is going to be a soft or a hard landing.  I mean, when the stability report came out in November 2007 that was eight or nine months since the peak of the property market so there had been, sort of, a gradual decline and maybe the ... extrapolating that the hope was that that would continue and they wouldn't have a complete collapse, you know.</p></speech>

I mean, I think in that third paragraph of the financial stability report which both Donal Donovan and Professor Gorecki put to me ... I think it was sort of said that the risks are increasing but they are manageable, you know.  It means the same thing,.  If they're manageable, we're looking ... we're looking at a soft landing.  But I wouldn't attach too much significance to the particular words that were used and in a way, I mean, any Central Bank probably had to sort of say, ''Well, it will be all right on the night'', or words to that effect, you know.</p></speech>

So I mean, what sort of a ... if you look at ... go back to the stability report in 2007 you had the body of the report all indicators pointing in the wrong direction.  And then you have an overall assessment of what's happening.  I mean, the ... could ... if I mean I was asked to do an objective assessment, an objective overview on the basis of the indicators, I would be inclined to say, ''Yes, we are headed for big trouble''.  But, a central bank being a central bank can't really say that, you know; it has to, sort of, pull its punches really.</p></speech>

I said, ''No.  That's Central Bank speak and it's negative in fact".  In fact, you probably know loads of people have made a good living out of parsing the words of Greenspan or Bernanke or Mervyn King or whatever, you know, if they altered their statement from one month to the next.  So in Central Bank speak, in my view, the overall assessment was possibly ... probably quite negative, even if it had used the words ''soft landing'' and ''things are manageable'' and so on.  But if you read between the lines, as people who were familiar with Central Bank speak would do or would want to do, you could see that was pretty negative, you know?</p></speech>

And I remember there was a huge ... I think it was the second largest pension fund in the world from Holland came over.  We wouldn't normally meet them but I think I was told since they're so important you have to go and meet them.  Now these guys in 2005 were utterly and totally sceptical of Irish bank shares.  But I mean I had to sit there in front of them and sort of say "Well, yes, they are problems over there all right".  In the event they didn't invest but, I mean, people in the know were clear that things were problematic.  And, you know, they'd be the people who were reading Central Bank speak and they would have seen that third paragraph in the FSR in 2007 as being a negative message, rather than a positive one, in my view.</p></speech>

You mentioned in your opening statement political and property interests on the bank's board making it difficult to get certain views through, but earlier you also said that contrarian views didn't drift up to the board.  So, which is it?</p></speech>

I wouldn't call them contrarian views.  But I ... they were sort of realistic views.  Yes, I mentioned that example of the need for more zoning of land, which was a crying need at the time.  I mean, as I said, these guys had cornered the market in zoned land in north Dublin.  In fact. there's another case ... it arose in Waterford ... in Dungarvan I think.  I mean, it mattered greatly where on a map the line for rezoning was.  So when I put that up ... because you had to increase housing supply, particularly in the greater Dublin area and you weren't going to do that unless you had more land zoned.  So when I put a very tentative point in the comment which was the editorial for the bulletin, to push it up the line to say we need to consider, you know, more zoning or whatever or, you know, some very milk and watery language, that was deleted.  It didn't go beyond ... it didn't get to the board.</p></speech>

And the county manager, in the course of the trial, said that if you zoned a particular piece of agricultural land, that would have increased in value tenfold.  So, the zoning of land, as you blokes probably know very well, more than I do and county council and so on, is a very contentious issue.  But the point ... the economic point is that one needed to increase housing supply and, therefore, zoned land ... more zoned land had to be brought on stream.  And I was trying to hint at that in my draft comment, which never went beyond that.</p></speech>

You didn't leave that lying around the place.  I was shown it the odd time but it was never actually physically given to me.  I might have perused it over somebody's shoulder or been asked to look at something like that.  But so, being ... being ... not seeing the large exposures, it was, sort of, par of the course.

Some of them were in the property sector themselves ... there were businesspeople and others.  Had they got the full information?  I'm not sure, but, I mean, the drafts, or papers if you like, were filtered through to the board and it was up to the top people in the Central Bank to decide what went or what didn't go, you know.</p></speech>

I mean, that point about the zoning was an important point, I mean, it's not a ... it's not an issue where there's any impropriety involved or anything like that, in my view, but it's just a common sense economic point that housing supply had to increase and in order to do that you needed more zoned land.</p></speech>

And the memo came back with the words, "That is out of the question", added to the memo.  Why did that happen do you think, and was that information brought to the board?</p></speech>

They wouldn't have been aware of that?</p></speech>

For example, if he didn't like the tone of the draft that was sent to him, he would alter it.  He'd come back to us and, yes, he had the final say.  Yes.</p></speech>

You know, most things would have been on the table.  Now, I can recollect in the past though, having said that, that, you know, from the economics department we might have suggested maybe some tax change or whatever, but that would typically have been not ... that wouldn't run because the view in the bank was that taxation was a matter for Government and we don't sort of suggest that they tax X and subsidise Y, you know.  So they would be, sort of, general economic issues, talking about the stance of upcoming fiscal policy in the budget recommendation, maybe bank lending property prices would have figured quite strongly, I think, too, yes.</p></speech>

So that's an example of information not going to the board, but not because of a conflict of interest or a potential one or an intermediary stepping in the way but because it wasn't what the Central Bank did.  Is that correct? You didn't give advice on taxation issues.  Is that what you said?</p></speech>

Yes ... I think ... I can recollect way out back in the past we probably did, you know.  We put something in about maybe something should be taxed, let's say for environmental reasons or something like that.  But the view was that it's not for us to say what taxes should go up or taxes down, it's really for Government, you know.</p></speech>

I think I would have been in general agreement with those, you know, because we would have drafted the approach and the approach generally wouldn't have been massively altered by the Governor or the board for the most part.</p></speech>

In that scenario, what does the Central Bank do?  Does it write a post-budget letter?  Does it note this in its financial stability report?</p></speech>

They can decide to ... not to accept that advice.  I mean, it would be fairly common, you know.  The Bank of England might be recommending to the British Government the same thing or the Fed in the States, you know, it would be fairly common.</p></speech>

Just to get through a few ... the mandatory pieces first.

In fact ... yes, maybe you're, sort of, asking about, you know, the interaction with the regulator, or between the bank and the regulator, and there would have been quite a lot of fora there.  You had the memorandum of understanding between the bank and regulator for starters.  Then you had the ... the Governor used to have a Monday morning meeting, you know, dealing with current issues and so on, and we'd all be there together.  You had the financial stability committee itself, of course, which dealt with things.  The regulator and the bank would have been on that.  And, of course, we were on the same floor, so we'd bump into one another quite a few times a day.  But having said that, I mean, to take one example I remember when the Se&aacute;n Quinn thing burst, you know, I wouldn't have had any-----</p></speech>

By my recollection that's 40 years.  Now you probably have a better understanding than any of us inside in this room as to what the obligations of section 33AK actually are.  If you want to waive them, inform us that you want to do so and I'll try and guide you but I would be advising you in that regard, okay?</p></speech>

When the problem thing arose ... I wouldn't have interacted with my financial regulatory colleagues on the same floor about that but I think I mentioned maybe to one of the guys at the water fountain on one occasion "This is an issue for you", and they'd say "Yes, it is an issue", so you know we wouldn't be going into detail on it, no.</p></speech>

On page 40 of the Regling and Watson report it is mentioned that by far the most serious macro-financial flaw was the over-exposure of institutions to commercial property.  From the documentation seen by the inquiry this, particular theme of commercial property financing appears not to have been regularly discussed at the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland board meetings before 2006 and was still playing a smaller role in residential property in 2007.  In your opinion, why was there so little attention to this theme until, kind of, late/post-2007?</p></speech>

I was sent actually 400 pages, you know, the two volumes to look at there.  When I went over it, commercial property lending and the area was covered in the stability report.  In fact, I can recollect the material that was sent to me.  Lending to the commercial property sector was, back in 2002-3-4, rising at 40% to 45%, you know, which is very, very high.  But I would agree with you that it didn't receive maybe the degree of prominence that it should have got because if you look at the banking crashes in most countries - Japan, Sweden, Finland and so on - it's commercial property that brings people down.  Now to some extent, my view also is that the residential mortgage area was politically more important and, therefore, it should be looked at more carefully.  </p>  <p>         I mean, politicians, like you folks, were very concerned about that, and that was also reflected in the great emphasis on the consumer function in the regulator.</p></speech>

Vacancy rates would have been flagged, for example, rents and commercial property would have been flagged quite a lot, but I ... as far as I can recollect, there was probably only one special article on commercial property, maybe in the 2007 financial stability report.  You could argue that it should have been treated more extensively at an earlier stage, I think, on reflection.  That's probably right, yes.</p></speech>

The fact that they went ahead and engaged in all this lending.  For some naive reason they probably assumed that things would be all right on the night.  But, I mean, when you look at it with property prices increasing at 20%, 25% a year, their own lending increasing at 30%, 35% a year, year in, year out, I mean, you had to ask where was it all going to end.</p></speech>

I mean, what ... do we need to know ... although, it may have been relevant alright that it was concentrated on half a dozen property developers, but we were probably sort of roughly aware of that anyway.

Now, naturally, this is of huge concern to ourselves here, in the public interest, in trying to get to a report at the end of this process.  If you are saying on one hand, albeit a slip of the tongue, and a Freudian slip, to use the word "concealment", you're also saying here, specifically due to, what is your view of political and property interests on the bank's board, that notwithstanding the fact that at the water fountain, when you meet people, and the three other more only positions that are senior to you, that you have difficulty getting important vital information to the board.

Okay, we'll take a break.  Okay, while we take the break can we just ... and can I remind the witness ... and we'll stop the clock there for Senator MacSharry.  Can I remind the witness that once he begins giving evidence he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to his evidence on matters that are being discussed before the committee.  With that in mind, I now suspend the meeting until ... well, we'll ... we'll give it just a few ... five minutes for a suspension, and we might then resume, but depending how long the discussion will take I'll let you know, Mr. O'Connell, when to return to the room.  Okay?  And may I remind the witness that he is still under oath until we do resume at that stage, and I now request that the public Gallery would be cleared.  Yes, sorry, I now propose we go into private session.</p></speech>

There were three different occasions where you intimated that there were political and property interests across the boards of both the regulator and the ... and the Central Bank in one part.  You later talked about concealment and, granted, you wanted to correct that word.  And the third issue then, where you mentioned the property and political interests at the board which, in your view, had prevented your views getting across.  And I was simply putting forward to you, was it reasonable in your view to say that it was impossible to get your views to board level given your proximity to it, your seniority in the organisation?</p></speech>

I ... in relation to the OECD chap, for example, you know, one of my subordinates, I asked him to ring the OECD ... to ring the newspapers, because I can recollect distinctly the OECD view about over-valuation of property was on, it was either page 3 or page 5 of <i>The Irish Times</i>, top of the page.  And I mean, to expect the OECD to ring up the newspapers and say &quot;Well they were misquoted&quot;, you know, that was sort of off the wall.

Looking through the CBFSAI reports between 2004-2009, could it be said that the emphasis was on economic development, retail sales, industrial output, the live register, productivity, inflation, house prices and so on, and not sufficiently to the financial aspects of the banking industry, which, I think, we're agreed is what brought us down in the end?</p></speech>

Well, they would have been indirectly in the sense that there would be commentary on what was happening to credit, bank lending, the concentration of that lending in property and so on but I can't recollect ... it would have been left probably to the financial stability reports to comment on the balance sheet of the banks, you know, their funding structure and the extent to which they were dependent on wholesale funding, that sort of thing.  So there wouldn't have been an overt commentary on the, certainly the entire structure of commercial banks' balance sheets in the regular quarterly bulletins.  </p>  <p>         It would be on evolution of the money supply, which would include bank deposits, of course, and bank credit.  As you probably know, regularly there would be ... there's a statistical survey or analysis of the sectoral distribution of credit.  So, you would see ... and there would be a short commentary issued by the bank press office, I think, about how credit was going to the different sectors, property, construction, etc., etc., but I, I think you're ... you're, broadly speaking, right though, if you're talking about, technically, the quarterly bulletins, they probably didn't focus especially on the overall picture of ... for ... for the commercial banks.</p></speech>

There is a ... on page 64, "the Bank was not aware of ... action ... taken by [any] other national central banks in the Eurosystem, which the bank", i.e., here, "was not already taking".</p></speech>

I mean, as you know, at the time the European Central Bank had no function in supervising national banks in different countries.  So, it probably wasn't on their horizon to any great degree, I would have thought.  The EU Commission, of course, you know, would ... would be doing their surveys of Ireland, like the OECD and the IMF and they ... they would be alert to that, certainly, yes.</p></speech>

I mean, you'd often have, say, things like a demand for money function and so on but the interactions between banks, I mean, interbank borrowing, interbank lending ... of course they're chopping and changing every day of the week, so, it is very difficult to capture that.  So, usually in, in economic modelling, financial sectors are, are very ... they're stripped bare, largely.  So, the ... you'd have ... you'd have a credit functioning ... figuring all right, and the money supply on the liability side but not an awful lot of interaction, you know, within the, the financial sector.</p></speech>

Soon afterwards, as you know, all the independent articles were dropped from the quarterly economic commentary, it just became an in-house ESRI thing.  Were those events connected?  Was the ESRI worried that it was annoying the Central Bank?</p></speech>

I don't know whether it was a coincidence or not but, I mean, as far as my recollection goes, I think the ... the comment by Alan Barrett was probably ... was in the commentary itself.  You know, it wasn't a special article on the banking sector.  And Morgan Kelly had an article subsequent ... well, was it subsequent?  Yes, I think it was subsequent, actually, to it.  So, I ... I wasn't fully aware that the independent articles had been taken out.  I mean, it might depend on people who were offering articles to the ESRI to put in ... in their quarterly commentary.</p></speech>

After the separation of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, the economists were deployed with the Central Bank and they ... the Financial Regulator had access for their purpose.  Were there many tasks carried out by the economics section of the Central Bank for the ... for the Financial Regulator and how frequently was this interaction?</p></speech>

I'm trying to recollect.  </p>  <p>         For example, yes, there was a question of whether ... there was a view around the place, if you like, that the Irish banks had got massively into property, as you're probably aware, in Britain, Ireland and the US, and there was a view that maybe these property ... or prices in ... property prices in those areas wouldn't be correlated, so it would be helpful if they weren't correlated because the diversification benefits for the banks would be there.  So, there was a study done on that, for example, which actually indicated that the property prices tended to be correlated, you know, so that wasn't a very positive result.  So, that was an example.  There were also a few articles written on stress tests, that sort of thing, you know, the methodologies to be used, etc.  So-----</p></speech>

You know, it tended to be on the optimistic side but, having said that, it probably had to be that way, you know, on the somewhat optimistic side.

I mean, that's the nature of things.  I have no doubt in the Department of Finance people would have been saying the same thing.  I think you're getting some witnesses coming forward with that and if their views are not accepted, that is the nature of the organisation.  People at the top decide as to how they play things.</p></speech>

You weren't, effectively, someone who was ... a person who was a junior that had just joined the Central Bank.  You were in the Central Bank at that stage nearly 40 years.  You were probably one of the most longest -serving officials in the Central Bank.  So, therefore, I'll ask it one last time.  Do you feel you should have considered your position on an integrity basis?  Could you have done more?</p></speech>

The only other option, I think ... well, I could have resigned.  Would that have any effect?  We don't know.  I could have written an article in the press, say, around 2003 or 2004.  Would it have had an effect?  I doubt it, when people were, you know, enjoying the boom and the fruits of the boom.  I doubt it.  People would dismiss you, you know, as a crank as it were.</p></speech>

Well actually the ... you've the Governor, you've the director general - who is effectively the CEO - and below that you have the deputy director general.  Now, the deputy director general was really focused on markets, you know, providing liquidity to the banks, the payment system.  His reasonability was the markets, liquidity provision, and the target payment system.  So he ... while he would get sight of the economics article and so on, but he wouldn't really ... well he wasn't an economist, but he wouldn't really have had that much input into the economic side of it.  So the Governor and director general were the key people as far as we were concerned, you know.</p></speech>

It was a matter for the regulatory side.  The regulatory people were dealing with the individual banks who were ... whose lending was increasing, I think, as you said at various sessions, 30%, 35%, 40% per year, and ... and ... I mean, to give you an example of what I did when ... when I saw the quarterly data on sectoral credit and I saw the sectoral credit, the property-construction sector going ... increasing at 65%, I went to a leading person in the regulator and said "Something has to be done."  They said "No, it's okay.  It's secured on property."</p></speech>

You refer to the ... the ... the crises and the crashes in a number of ... many countries, even in the Nordic countries in Finland and Sweden and that.  Did ... did you ... and then what happened in Ireland in some senses was quite repetitive of what happened there.  Did you ever try ... or your group of 60 economists try, in any really structured way, to learn the lessons of that and put it in front of the board or the Governor, the regulator?</p></speech>

But, no, actually one of our ... two of our team went to Sweden to actually review their case at the time and I think there were some even simulation exercises which might have been done in conjunction with the Swedes.  So, we tried to learn something from them.  But, you know, my view, as I said in the opening statement, was that the ... the view ... or the implicit view amongst the senior people was that crashes elsewhere weren't relevant to Ireland.  In fact, I know for a fact, if I may add, there was an IMF study done of one particular crisis which was handed to a senior person in the Central Bank and it was declined on the grounds that it wasn't relevant to Ireland.</p></speech>

And, in fact, I wouldn't have been the only one because the Government had requested the three papers from Peter Bacon to look into what could be done about the ... the property price boom.  Yes, so, anybody in a senior position in ... in the regulator or the Central Bank has to take responsibility.  So, I mean, the whole thing was wholly avoidable in my view.  It was unnecessary.</p></speech>

I'll come back to that.  Specifically, the Financial Regulator was in the habit of holding round-table meetings with banks.  Did you ever take part in those meetings and, if so, could you tell us a little bit about it?</p></speech>

In fact, the ... the people who chaired it really were the director general and, yes, I think the Financial Regulator was there too.  So, up to a certain point ... to a certain year, we used to have the round table with the banks prior to doing the stability report to see what issues were there, you know.  And the ... that would feed in then to the stability report in a broad sense.  Beyond a certain year ... I can't remember the year, but the round tables were held after the stability reports were produced.  I think the main point really was to get over the message that these risks were out there and the banks should be aware of them, you know.</p></speech>

So, the ... the bank side ... my colleague Frank Browne would make the presentation about the issues and so on, based on the stability report, and, you know, we tried to have a conversation then amongst on the banks.  </p>  <p>         Now, maybe the banks were a little reticent because there were maybe seven or eight or nine of them there and they weren't going to be that forthcoming themselves.  So the interaction was probably a bit inhibited, I think, really, you know.  But it was ... the main objective, I suppose, was to get over the message to them of the risks that ... as we saw them.</p></speech>

It was quite clear.  But actually, at that time, in fact, I think the banks themselves, when they were pressed, maybe at an AGM to explain it, they said "Oh, it's to generate more capital for ourselves."  But when you think of it, in that itself, is bizarre, because they wanted more capital to engage in more lending ... to make the bubble worse, you know.  So the thing was ... that's an issue, I think, that should be looked into.</p></speech>

So at a particular point I can recollect he evidently felt that he would need to get to know the chief executives and the chairmen and so on.  And that might have been probably around ... it would have been obviously after 2003 when the structures were set up.  Maybe around 2005.  So he would have had regular meetings then, maybe six-monthly, say, with the chief executives and the chairmen and maybe some credit officers of the banks.  So I would have met a lot of those with him and the director general as well, you know, so that was the forum where the big issues, if you like, were discussed, including, of course, the first thing put to the banks would be, "Your lending is increasing massively, property lending too"; and they sort of invariably said things were okay, you know.</p></speech>

Well, with a ... yes, we would probably have ... the Governor would have been putting it to them, I think, that we're sceptical about things, you know. "Are you getting out of hand, are you going over the top?"  So we wouldn't have sort of said, "You're absolutely going bananas."  But they would invariably tend, to my recollection, would, at the time, would ... their point would have been, "Yes, we have everything under control", you know.</p></speech>

Can you tell us why, in your opinion, the Central Bank's recommendations to the Minister did not more forcibly alert the Minister to this issue?</p></speech>

I was sent some of the letters from the Governor to the Minister.  I think he tended to be ... the letters tended to be, sort of, conservative for the most part, you know.  It may not have gone so far as to build ... recommend building up a cushion, but you must remember the pension reserve fund was there at the time, you know, and certain amounts were being set aside.  But it probably wasn't appreciated at the time that the extent to which property-related taxes, in the round, were contributing to the overall tax revenue.</p></speech>

I wouldn't have ... I wouldn't have assumed at the time that they were that high, no, I wouldn't.</p></speech>

Can you ... can you clarify maybe your role.  As chief economist of the Central Bank of Ireland, would it be a case where they, you know ... these types of statistics are available to the public, they're published by the Revenue.  I'm not sure if they were at that time but I know at this stage they're published by the Revenue quarterly.  Anybody with a calculator can figure out what type of proportion of taxes make up such and such.  How would the chief economist of the Central Bank of Ireland have to assume these matters back at that time in 2004-2005?</p></speech>

But, no, well, I think at the time things like VAT, you know, VAT on construction ... that wouldn't have been separated out, so people wouldn't have known that.  Now, we did a few studies late in the day, I think, admittedly, maybe around 2006-2007, trying to focus in on the ... the property-related taxes.  The main one, I think, was the stamp duty, you know.  But you'd have to go behind the whole picture to get the VAT thing and that certainly wasn't upfront at the time.  But, yes, we were informally well aware, of course, that ... I mean, the construction sector - I think as maybe the Chairman was saying earlier on - directly employed one in seven in the economy.  If you take a broader view, you-----</p></speech>

And when you were chief economist ... obviously, under your position of chief economist, you had the number of divisions, one of them would have been statistics - wouldn't that be ... that'd be correct - economic analysis and monetary policy and fiscal stability.  When ... when these agencies, external agencies, were talking about a cushion to build up for the time when property transactions would fall, did you commission ... or ask any of the divisions below to actually ... "Let's actually look at what proportion of the State's revenue is made up of property transaction", or can you recall when, if any, that you actually asked for that type of research to be done?</p></speech>

So, I have to admit it wasn't done early in the day, you know, maybe about 2002-2003.  It was done later, I think, yes.</p></speech>

But we were obviously aware of the fact that, yes, I mean, construction activity in the round was generating was a lot of tax revenue, which could fall away in due course.  So, we may not have quantified it, you know, at that early stage, but it was done later, yes.</p></speech>

I wouldn't regard it as a financial stability issue.  I mean, if consumption falls away, you know, VAT and excise duty will fall away, as they do from time to time, so, I mean, it might have had a effect.  Unless you got a massive collapse in the construction sector, as we had ... that did have a big effect.  But if construction were to fall back from say, one in seven in the economy being employed to one in eight, it wasn't going to be a big issue, you know.  You may as well, sort of, look at other tax headings and ask "If something were to happen there [you know] should we look into that carefully?"</p></speech>

I'm not sure if the IMF, the OECD and ECOFIN were all warning about property-related transactions or, for example, VAT-related transactions.  I think the question really is ... is what did you do after being prompted by external agencies in relation to this matter?  But you're confirming that you didn't carry out any research, or you didn't ask for any research to be carried out, until a later stage, until about 2007.</p></speech>

Not many people, if I recall, wrote anything about commercial property, and that was what caused the damage for Irish banks' profitability and caused them to require significant capital inflow.  </blockquote>  <p>I'd ask you two things.  Do you concur with that statement?  The second thing is, as chief economist, who had the ability to commission papers on commercial property, what did you do, when did you do it and what did you do with those papers if they were commissioned? </p></speech>

We didn't specifically commission research on commercial property for a separate paper but, I think, if you look back at the stability reports, they would have dealt with commercial property, you know.  For example ... I'm reminded the material sent to me pointed out that, say around 2003-'04, lending to the commercial property sector was rising at 40% to 45%, so there would have been commentary on that including vacancy rates, rental incomes and so on, embedded in the stability reports.  Now, I think, later on then, there were special articles, if you like, in the stability report but that came late, I think.  </p>  <p>         Now, I think, later on then, there were special articles, if you like, in the stability reports but that came ... came late, I think.</p></speech>

You've been informing the committee - and we thank you for that - about the difficulties you had in trying to get your message out.  You now inform us that you had the ability to commission papers on behalf of the Central Bank and you did not commission any paper in relation to commercial property, which, you agree, was the reason that caused the banks to collapse eventually.</p></speech>

But I mean, if you're talking about a paper with separate covers, if you like, as research papers that I've done and issued from time to time, was there one on commercial property?  That didn't happen, I think, until about 2006 but we did have certainly commentary on commercial property developments - vacancy rates, rental, capital values of commercial property so they were all there and we knew that, you know.  So the commentary was there.  Maybe they weren't as highlighted as they might have been in special research papers until late, yes.</p></speech>

Back in the day, you'd wake up in the morning property would be on the radio, it would be on the television.  You'd go for a pint that night and it would be the conversation at the table that you'd be drinking at and it would be at the table that I was having a pint at.  So talking to your colleagues about property you didn't have to be in the Central Bank.  You could have been working in a slaughterhouse or down making yo-yos or whatever.  Everybody was talking about property.  So I'm not ... I'm trying to get a quantification in my head from you as to as to how much general chit-chat you had on property in the Central Bank and on the seventh floor and how many documents you actually put your name to the end of that expressed concerns.</p></speech>

That's ... what I want to get at is a quantity of documents and research materials like Deputy Doherty indicated.

I would have thought so because Ireland's collapse has not been a complicated one.  It is not like ... the Irish banks did not get involved in the sub-prime mortgage assets in the States, some of which were divided up and they got credit ratings on.  People have called it a common-or-garden, plain vanilla property crash.  So it did not require any sophistication to figure out what was happening, if you saw the data in front of you relating to property prices and bank lending.  I think I said in the opening statement you had about ten other banking crashes similar to that in the previous 20 years.

You were expected to.  In fact I remember famously a chap made a presentation at a conference.  It was about the money markets, money market interest rates, there was sort of a sophisticated econometrics.  He was told by the then Governor at the time "When you go to that conference I don't want to see anything in the paper and I don't believe in econometrics."  They were the two points made to him.</p></speech>

I will change briefly then to the OECD reviews from 2006 and 2008, noting that house prices had overshot their fundamentals.  In 2006 they did not rule out a hard landing but predicted that a soft landing was more likely.  In both 2006 and 2008 it concluded that the banks were sufficiently well capitalised to be able to absorb any likely shocks.  In your opinion, was the OECD's conclusions the result of data that they had obtained from the Central Bank or financial services regulator, or was it as a result of any independent analysis that they conducted themselves?</p></speech>

In fact my reading of the OECD, people have been saying that the IMF and OECD got it wrong totally, they missed it.  But actually if you look at the technical stuff in the IMF papers, I think there was annex 1 in maybe IMF 1999.  It was pretty clear that they were looking at overvaluations.  I think the OECD, this chap van den Noord and somebody else did a special article.  They made the point that if ... people were talking about fundamentals in relation to the property market here.  But when you think of it, the fundamentals would have been things like peoples' incomes and population and so on.  That is fair enough.  That drives the demand for housing, but that should not drive the price of housing.  If the demand for televisions goes up, for example, you don't expect the price of televisions to go through the roof.  In the case of housing, a house can't be produced as quickly as a television set.  That is where the zoning issue comes in, because housing has to be somewhat elastic in supply.  If it is not, you have got a big price increase when demand increases.</p>  <p>  The OECD analysis, I think it was van den Noord and somebody else who wrote the article, I will glance at it again, they pointed out that if you look at the demand for housing and the fundamentals, if in the estimation period for your demand function, if the determining factors are actually themselves influenced by the boom, you are explaining boom prices in terms of boom explanatory factors, but that is not correct.  So they went back, because you are explaining boom in terms of booms which is circular.  </p>  <p>         They went back and said if you abstract from the boom period and you look at the econometric analysis up to, whatever it was, 1998, and you extrapolate further on from that, then, they said, the overvaluation is 50% and I wouldn't disagree with that.</p></speech>

I mean, the overall assessment, maybe in both the OECD and the IMF, tended to differ from what the technical analysis projected and in fact you could ... that can only be explained, I suppose, in terms of the people who are doing the overall assessment reckoned that "Oh, this is a special, technical exercise, you know, it's a little bit ... okay, we can't be sure about it.  It's interesting, but it doesn't carry over to the main message."</p></speech>

One final area that I want to cover ... in your opening statement - and again without naming any names - but you stated that in the Central Bank, this is a direct quote: "In the Central Bank it was difficult to get views through that might impinge on vested interests."  I just want you to maybe briefly outline for the inquiry what those vested interests were and how they manifested themselves, really, in the operations of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

You try to put a gloss on things and that carried over, as I said earlier, to IMF and OECD assessments too.  If they were coming up with a negative message, you tried to twist their arms or at least various people tried to twist their arms, to put a gloss on things and not to put a negative picture forward.</p></speech>

I would have thought probably around the time when the Bacon reports were called for, that was around 1999.

I can recollect actually Shane Ross, in the <i>Sunday Independent,</i>talking about the Cassandras in the Central Bank, you know, which sort of means that they're whinging about ... they're crying wolf, if you like.

It's commercial property that brings down banks.  So the focus ... I mean, what the origins of the focus on the residential mortgage market was I can't quite recollect but, I mean, it would be pretty obvious the indicators for house prices are out there, you know, or were out there.  Commercial property prices there's ... I don't think there's an official CSO statistic or series for that.  And if you look back at the stability reports you'll see, for example, CBRE indicators or Lisney's or whatever were used. So they were private ones, you couldn't ... I'm sure they were well complied but, there weren't official data there which by ... so there was the political importance of the housing sector and the fact that the official statistics related more to the private housing sector than commercial ... that probably explained why the focus tended to be on the housing sector, even though, I mean, history is replete with cases where-----</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connell, you're very welcome.  Can I start by asking you about the crisis simulation exercise conducted by the Central Bank?  You're familiar with that.  Feedback from staff involved in the crisis simulation exercise cited suggests, for example, too much information, too many voices.  Concerns were expressed by the Department of Finance regarding confusion over the roles of the Central Bank and the regulator and other comments.  </p>  <p>               Based on these comments, in your opinion can the simulation exercise have been deemed to meet the expectations?</p></speech>

So ... I think that maybe the material you sent to me there points out, you know, what the three different parties, how they, how they viewed this simulation exercise and what deficiencies they saw in it.  So ... did it serve its purpose?  That one did, I suppose, in the sense that it did uncover problem areas.  I can remember I think at the time the Department of Finance, for example, they were in a room on the seventh floor and they were there for a long time and nobody came near them for about 20 minutes or half an hour and they wondering what it's all about.  So there was sort of lack of communication, things like prioritisation of data was necessary.  There was just too much data flying around, it wasn't clear which was important or whatever.</p></speech>

Given the parties comprising the domestic standing group, can you outline the possibility that there was a deficiency in the DSG operating model which may have resulted in the group's failure to identify early signs of the crisis?  I know that's in light of the comment you said there that by 2007 the goose was cooked, as such.</p></speech>

I think the first meeting was probably middle 2007 and at that point the liquidity problem had arisen straightaway.  I think it was 9 August.  BNP, I think, had a problem, a liquidity problem.  In fact the governors across the eurosystem had to come back from their holidays to look at things.  So, they were straight in ... the DSG was straight in to monitoring liquidity and, in fact, if you look I think at the material, the minutes and so on and the reports on the DSG for quite a while beyond that, it was very much focused on liquidity and the fact that the Irish banks were finding it more difficult to get access to funds and ... particularly to short-term funds, sorry to longer-term funds.  They couldn't roll over longer-term funds, so the Department needed to be kept apprised of that ... on a continuing basis, just to see, you know, how things were developing.</p></speech>

Things were going bananas you said, that was obvious from the data, that you told your superiors things were going crazy, the banks had to be reigned in, that a crash was inevitable, since 2004 there was mad lending, overvalued assets.  So, can I interpret from that, that you saw the crash coming?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1533" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tom O'Connell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#ZZZ00600"><p>It was unavoidable in my view from around that point.  And if I can go back to ... house prices were 12 times average incomes.  In fact, I remember at that time, I said that to a D&aacute;il committee, an Oireachtas committee.  At that time <i>The Financial Times</i>, funnily enough, had a report by the Bank of England that house prices were seven times incomes in the UK, and the Bank of England said it was extremely worried about that.  So, Irish house prices had to fall by about half, clearly.  Or if you look at the ratio between house prices to incomes ... the dominator incomes, I mean if we had good times, per capita incomes in real times might increase by 3% and 4% a year.  So there was no way you were going to get that ratio down to four, five, six without a massive crash in property prices, so it was inevitable.  And in fact the Government itself, by its action in calling for the Bacon reports, as early as 1999, was clearly concerned about what happened.  But, subsequently, post I think the budget in 2002, tweaked things a little bit, after that house prices really took off.</p></speech>

But when the, when the Lehman's thing hit, and the shock to the credit markets really hit in September 2008, the whole thing was escalated to a higher level.  You know, the Governor, the Financial Regulator and the secretary of the Department of Finance came into the picture then, because you know, taxpayers money was at stake.  But ... I certainly wasn't in the loop on the guarantee at all, you know.</p></speech>

I mean, that sequence of events was certainly going to happen, but, I mean, I've been saying for years to people in the bank, that we had to rein in the banks.  You saw the answer I got ... I think I said it there ... even when the property lending was increasing at 65% year on year, that's 16 times what the ECB said the appropriate growth in money and credit should be.  Yet, there was no response.</p></speech>

So can you just square for us what you had been saying all day today, and what you have said to me just now, with an extract for example, from the quarter 4 2007 economic bulletin, where you talk about property and prices, you said &quot;Developments in residential output and property prices this year indicate a move towards a more sustainable position.&quot;  There's no hint there of an imminent collapse.  You said &quot;Prices have eased somewhat and the supply of new houses is also adjusting to meet new market conditions.&quot;  You refer to:</p><blockquote>... the underlying demand for housing in the economy [remaining] strong reflecting continuing income and employment growth.  In addition, the performance of the rest of the construction sector should help to ease the impact of the adjustment in the housing sector [etc, etc].</blockquote>  <p>And there is a lot more like that.

In fact, I remember my predecessor used to say, he has his own personal views, but, I mean, at these fora, meeting the press and so on, you're given the bank view.  Now, quarter 4, 2007 ... I would think that, as I said earlier, property prices peaked in February 2007, and you are, sort of, getting a gradual decrease at that point.  So, it was probably a hope or expectation that that sort of gradual decline, if you like, would continue.</p></speech>

I've forgotten what I've said myself.  But I probably ... the gist of what is there was probably originally written down by me, but ... no, I can only see ... well ... I mean, a central bank can't in any case, as I've said earlier, they can't ... you can't talk about a crash happening, because you'll have it in the morning.  So, it was that comment I would suggest, as I say, probably reflected an extrapolation of what was happening since the previous February and the hope that that would continue.  I mean, it was clear that with one in seven in the workforce working in the construction sector, that had to fall to one in 14, which was the average in Europe.  </p>  <p>         So there had to be some adjustment, and I can recollect some outside commentators, the OECD and so on, saying that, you know, you'd have to move a large part of the construction workforce into the other sectors of the economy or else you'd have big difficulties.  So it was ... yes, that was probably an optimistic assessment of what the fallout would be, and, I mean, I wouldn't deny it that the timing of the Lehman's thing precipitated a big adjustment, but that is just what was going to come anyway.</p></speech>

One is this inference that you make on page 2 of your witness statement that the need to consider the issues of rezoning more land to increase housing supply was blocked from reaching a higher level in the bank in light, in your view, of political and property interests of the bank's board.  The political side I think we can understand to mean that people were directly appointed by politicians.  But can you clarify, the property interests of the bank board; are you referring to the ownership of property by individuals on the board, just in general terms, if you can clarify that, what you mean by that?</p></speech>

But, I mean, I think the aversion to mentioning zoning, even though it was a terribly low-key reference which I had in the draft, you know, I think the aversion to carrying it through into the final document was because zoning was a controversial area.  I mean, we had ... didn't we have the tribunal going on down below, you know, about the planning and so on?  Was it the-----</p></speech>

And very finally, Chair, you refer, Mr. O'Connell, on page 4 of your witness statement that around 2002, 2003, a memo from the economics function in the bank sent to the then Governor essentially recommending that lending to the property sector needed to be reined in, and you refer to a memo coming back, and you said you have a copy of that memo where there's a note added that it's out of the question, it would have to go to the board, but that is out of the question.

I'm just going to wrap up on just a number of items so.  One was an issue touched on Deputy McGrath there, and it's the housing report that you published in 2003.  There's a footnote, I think, where ... that specifically relates to yourself in terms of further information, if it's required.  It would indicate at that time that there was still time to take action to cool down house prices.  You referred earlier to the Bacon report, okay, the measures were in place, they were then removed, but the graph hadn't, and evidence earlier to this committee would show that the graph increased significantly 2003 onwards.  But in 2003, there was still time.  So can I ask you what action did you take, if any, regarding to the findings of this report, and if no actions were actually taken, and what I mean by specific actions is that you go in and you put a tight position on something, what actions, if any, were taken?  And if they weren't, why not?</p></speech>

And, I mean, I felt it wasn't really for me to sort of suggest actions, you know, because the ... I put the issues forward to the board and the Governor and in fact, actions could or would be taken only by the regulator and the actions taken would be as highlighted by Patrick Honohan's report.  You know, credit ceilings, or sectoral limits, moral suasion.  I mean, some of these things may have been tried with ... by the regulator.  But, in fact, I remember Con Horan saying to you folks here that in 2005 he suggested moving to take some actions, and he said to you that the CEO of the Financial Regulator took it up with the director general of the Central Bank, and to Con Horan's disquiet, that was put off until 2006.</p></speech>

I'd like to return to what action you may have taken, Mr. O'Connell?  </p>  <p>         Yes.  Well I ... I was on the bank side.  I couldn't take any actions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the banks.  It was up to the Governor.</p></speech>

I think it might be of interest, Chairman, too, because one of my former colleagues who has a legal background said to me that - I think the question of the Governor's guidelines arose at some point and he ... my colleague, my former colleague, informed me that in actual fact the financial stability report constituted the Governor's guidelines because if the Governor had issued guidelines he was required, in accordance with section 33(d) of the 2003 Act, to put the guidelines in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  So for example, in the crisis situation he would have had to say &quot;We're raising the capital ratios for all the banks, or putting sectoral limits on them.&quot;  And of course, in a crisis situation that would cause panic.</p></speech>

In ... as a senior economist and in your opinion and given that the role of the Central Bank is to maintain financial stability and that is what your No. 1 duty of care as a member of the Central Bank would have actually been, at what point did a micro-prudential issues with banks become macro-prudential in terms of financial stability?</p></speech>

At the point where, I suppose, their ... the loan deposit ratio began to get out of hand, and I mean, that was ... if the ... when the loan deposit ratio began to exceed 1, or go beyond that, that effectively meant the banks were overtrading and they were relying on wholesale funding at that point.  So that should have been a warning indicator.  But even more simple-----</p></speech>

And just to finalise, you can add whatever you wish then by means of conclusion as well, Mr. O'Connell.  You began your statement to the inquiry today with the remark that Ireland's banking and economic crash should never have been allowed to happen.  So, without getting into specific personalities - we're maybe dealing now in an institutional level - do you think that it shouldn't have been allowed to happen at an institutional level, and can you maybe identify which institutions were predominantly to take responsibility for this?  Is it the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the Government, the Department of Finance?  Who is it?</p></speech>

I mean Greenspan famously said he believed, with the light regulation, he believed that bank executives wouldn't run their banks into the ground.  So the banks' boards and senior management were in the first line.  The second line, which not many people have focused on, is the institutional shareholders who had their funds at stake, investment management funds and so on - life companies.  They had large shareholdings in the banks.  I mean, why did they not rein in the banks?  And then behind that, you had the authorities - the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  So, they all had their part to play.  Now, unfortunately, with the principles-based regulation the authorities were sort of behind the curve on that, but the primary responsibility was clearly with the banks' boards and their senior management.</p></speech>

I wish to draw Ms Mangan's attention to the fact that, by virtue of 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if Ms Mangan is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and she continues to do so, she is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of her evidence.  Ms Mangan is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, she should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1613" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ita Mangan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#D00300"><p>I thank the committee for asking me to appear before it today regarding my proposed appointment as chair of the CIB.  As the committee already has my statement in full, I will probably not read all of it, as I assume that members can read.  However, I will refer to its more important aspects.<br/><br/>I am honoured to be asked to chair the board.  It is an organisation with which I have had a long association.  I will tell members a little bit about my background before discussing the issues that I believe are upcoming for the board.  I was born and reared in a farming family in County Sligo, where I went through primary and secondary education.  I have a degree in economics and history from UCD and I qualified as a barrister in the King's Inns.  I have been fortunate to have had a varied career, which has included working for a wide range of organisations like the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the European Commission office in Ireland, the Law Reform Commission, the National Council on Ageing and Older People, NCAOP, the Human Rights Commission and a number of referendum commissions.  I have had a long association with the CIB and its predecessors in title.  I have written its monthly information magazine, <i>Relate</i>, for many years and have also written a number of its other publications and numerous items on its information databases.  In recent years, I have been a member of two commissions of investigation and have heard appeals in the residential institutions redress scheme.  I have also been involved in various public policy issues and was recently the chair of the advisory committee on tax and social welfare, in which capacity I appeared before this committee, as some members may recall.<br/><br/>However, I am not the important aspect.  The CIB is, and members know what it does.  It is the statutory body that supports the provision of information, advice, including money and budgeting advice, and advocacy services.  It provides some of its services directly through information websites, etc., but it also provides money to a number of organisations, which is one of the issues I wish to address briefly.<br/><br/>A significant element of the board's services are delivered by a large number of small organisations, for example, citizens information services and the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  The citizens information services are staffed by more than 1,100 volunteers in addition to paid staff.  As members are aware, the relationship between State bodies and the voluntary organisations that they fund has come under scrutiny in recent years.  We all recognise the significant contribution that the voluntary sector can make, as it is particularly knowledgeable on the needs of local communities and is frequently more flexible in its responses than State organisations.  At the same time, though, everyone wants to see good value for money.  This puts pressure on small voluntary organisations.  Some of them believe that the pressure on them is unduly burdensome, but it is important that all recipients of public funds be able to show that they are using them effectively.<br/><br/>It is also important that services delivered through the voluntary sector are of the highest quality.  The voluntary organisations funded by the CIB recognise the need to ensure high-quality services, but they are operating in an increasingly complex environment and sometimes the size of the organisation does not allow it to deliver the quality of service that is required.  The CIB has been involved in trying to get more effective governance arrangements in place to facilitate better service delivery.  This work will continue, as ensuring the happy continuance of the voluntary sector while providing high-quality services and good value for money will pose one of the major issues for the organisation in the coming years.<br/><br/>Since I have set out the functions of the CIB in my submission, I will not go through them all, but I will discuss the issues arising from them.  The CIB was first established in the 1970s under a different name, the National Social Service Council, to set up community information centres.  Information remains a core activity for the board.  Accurate, independent, integrated and clearly written information is important for everyone.  The means of transmitting information has changed dramatically in recent times and the rules governing entitlements to various schemes and services have become more complex.  As members will be aware, there has been a significant increase in the quantity of legislation in the past 30 years, certainly since the 1960s and 1970s, and distilling all of that and making it meaningful for people so that they can properly exercise their rights and entitlements is a major operation that is becoming more complex.  However, it is an essential one and not just so that citizens can make best use of the available services, but so that they can be fully active participants in society.  </p>  <p>         As the economy improves, it is important that they have the right information to make the best choices for them in any given set of circumstances.<br/><br/>In the presentation, I give the statistics on those dealing with our services.  There were 16 million hits on the <i>citizensinformation.ie</i>website in 2014.  It is important that the website be kept up-to-date and remain user-friendly.<br/><br/>The second issue I want to address is the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS, with which the committee will be familiar.  MABS is in 53 locations throughout the country and it provides a service on both secured and unsecured debts.  The MABS service tries to address the entirety of clients' financial circumstances and deal with all the issues, including the social ones, that arise in order that they are in a position to return to financial health and be active participants in society.  In recent times, this has proved to be a major challenge.<br/><br/>As the committee will no doubt be aware, the Government has recently agreed a number of new measures to support mortgage holders who are in arrears, including a greater role for MABS.  Additional services to provide assistance in identifying the best options, completing financial statements and considering proposed solutions are to be introduced by MABS offices on a phased basis.  This will ensure that borrowers have access to information on the range of supports and options available, advice on the ones most suited to their needs, and assistance, where necessary, in pursuing such options.  In my presentation, I state that the development of this new service will require extra funding.  I am pleased to report that the extra funding was allocated yesterday.  The roll-out of that service will start immediately.  A project manager will be appointed shortly.  It is hoped that by the end of July the service will be running in a number of parts of the country.<br/><br/>We also must bear in mind that many users of MABS services need the service, not because they have mortgage payment problems but because of other indebtedness.  MABS was originally established to address the problems caused by moneylenders charging excessive rates of interest.  It is rather surprising to discover that there are still 360,000 customers of moneylenders in Ireland.  This points to the absence of a more appropriate source of credit, such as micro-loans, for those who need small borrowings.  Recent changes in credit union regulation and amalgamation aimed at curbing reckless lending of high-value loans mean that credit unions are not providing the sort of small loans service they were originally set up to provide and that are needed by those we are talking about.  The Citizens Information Board supports the micro-loan concept and is in discussions with the Departments of Social Protection and Finance on the establishment of a micro-loan scheme for citizens who have difficulty accessing credit.  Such people need credit, for example, when a domestic appliance, such as a cooker or washing machine, breaks down.  They can afford to repay.  They may not be able to afford to repay the moneylender because of the excessive rates of interests.  There is no way they have the sum required, perhaps &euro;300 or &euro;400, to buy the appliance in the first place, but if they can get a micro-loan at a reasonable rate of interest, they will be able to repay it.  It is important to recognise they can repay it.  We are not suggesting making loans to those who not able to repay.<br/><br/>Another area in which the Citizens Information Board is involved is advocacy services.  The board provides advocacy services to a small number of those with disabilities.  As I said, the service is small at present and clearly does not reach the number who need such a service.  The Citizens Information Act 2007 provides for the establishment of a statutory personal advocacy service, the relevant provisions of which have not been implemented.  There is a need for statutory arrangements, but the statutory arrangements contained in that Act probably are not the most appropriate for the current environment because advocacy services are needed in the context of the new assisted decision-making legislation and also to a significant degree in the context of patients' rights in the health services.  There is a need for a co-ordinated approach to advocacy services that would cover those with disabilities, those with assisted decision-making problems and patients within the health services who need help in establishing their rights.  Such a co-ordinated approach would require new legislation.  That is one of the areas that the Citizens Information Board, together with relevant Departments, will examine in the near future.<br/><br/>The final area I want mention is the social policy remit of the Citizens Information Board.  Through its information services, the CIB becomes aware of problems, issues and anomalies in the delivery of services.  It is in a position to document and analyse these and, in some cases, make recommendations for improvements.  This is an important conduit for citizens&rsquo; problems to be brought to the attention of Government with a view to influencing policy decisions.  Over the years, many of the issues raised in social policy reports have been addressed.  Of course, not all have been, but this is nevertheless a valuable public policy vehicle.  The timing of such submissions, for instance, at the budget preparation stage, is also important.  The CIB also provides responses to Government consultations on various policy issues.  These are all based on the board's experience in dealing with those who have problems with a particular issue that is being addressed.<br/><br/>I hope I have shown the committee that I have the necessary experience and qualifications to lead the Citizens Information Board over the next five years.  I look forward to the challenges ahead.  I am happy to take any questions the committee may have.</p></speech>

Her qualifications seem appropriate for the job and I hope she does a good one.</p>  <p>  There is one question I want to ask Ms Mangan.  My local Citizens Information Board, which is at Ring Terrace in Inchicore and which is linked with the one in Dublin 8, is now on a two-day week.  Because of the cuts, the service is unable to provide the five-day service it provided previously.</p>  <p>  I am aware of changes in how the CIBs will provide services to citizens who need help.  Can Ms Mangan provide information on what the reconfiguration entails and what is coming down the line?  I believe they will try to close down many of the offices and reconfigure the remaining ones into three main areas.  How will that impact on the services they provide?  The Citizens Information Board offices are important points of contact for citizens to get independent advice.  We have constituency offices but they are not the Citizens Information Board.  The board gives independent information to citizens.  The role the volunteers and workers in the Citizens Information Board offices play is helping people go through complex applications or forms.  Will this new configuration be more service-driven or driven for the service needs of citizens?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1621" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1170" speakername="Marie Louise O'Donnell" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#E00800"><p>I welcome Ms Mangan to the committee.  The T&aacute;naiste has made an outstanding appointment.  Ms Mangan comes with a seriously qualitative background, including the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the European Commission office, the Law Reform Commission, the National Council of Ageing and Older People, the human rights commission and the Referendum Commission.  We are lucky that she happens to be available to bring all this energy and these qualifications to the job.  I wish her the very best of luck.  It is a wonderful appointment.</p>  <p>  I also compliment the Citizens Information Board.  Recently I had reason to look up the fair deal for a person and it was to the Citizens Information Board that I went for the accuracy, clear, informed and explanatory nature of its service.  The information was also on the fair deal website, but the Citizens Information Board did such good work on the matter that it was able to answer all the questions in the back of my head that were not so obvious on that website.  I have one question.  Can Ms Mangan tell us why the credit unions are not supplying small loans and how that can be reversed?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1622" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1079" speakername="Ray Butler" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#E00900"><p>I thank Ms Mangan for coming in.  She spoke of micro-loans.  The problem in credit unions is that there are credit rating bureaus now coming in from the Central Bank and there are new rules and regulations.  Those who got behind through no fault of their own with the Celtic tiger crash have renegotiated their loans but staff in a building society, credit union or bank can press a button and see that this person has renegotiated the loan, which remains a blip on their credit rating for a couple of years.  </p>  <p>               People are borrowing from moneylenders so we need to put in place a microfinance loan scheme in credit unions or post offices to allow them get small loans because they are paying their way.  Ms Mangan is correct.  When the washing machine or the television breaks down, these people do not have the money to replace them so they get a small loan, which they will pay back.  They are paying back their loans as we speak, but in some cases they cannot get them.</p> <p> It was sad to see the rules and regulations put on credit unions.  I know serious mistakes were made.  Credit unions were established by the people and provide people with smaller loans but, unfortunately, in certain areas they got too big for their boots and gave loans to people who should never have got them.  That is very sad.</p> <p> We need to begin to examine the credit rating bureau, which I believe is no longer fit for purpose.  It was fine during the Celtic tiger period when we were awash with so-called money.  That money has dried up and local economies are suffering because there is no cashflow.  If these people get their small loan out of the credit union for back-to-school expenses or Christmas, they will spend that money in the local community.  I am hearing every day of the week in retail that small shops are starved of cashflow.  All retail runs on credit and when credit dries up the way it has happened here, it is very difficult for small, independent retail businesses to move on.</p> <p> I am delighted Ms Mangan has brought up the issue but we have to examine microfinance loans and get the economy running with small loans.  We must also examine the credit rating bureau to see how we can move forward on providing small loans.  We must remember these people have renegotiated all their loans.  They are paying them back but if the television, the fridge or whatever breaks down and they go to look for another small loan, it comes up that they have renegotiated their loans and they are listed for four or five years.  That has to be changed, and the credit rating bureau has to be changed as well.</p></speech>

We look forward to that.</p>  <p>  The point she raised upfront, and which was made by Deputy Collins as well, was the value for money element in terms of what the future holds for the small local offices which, in my experience, provide a great service to the people I represent in Balbriggan, Skerries and such small towns.  I would appreciate it if Ms Mangan would expand on that aspect.</p></speech>

It may be a clich&eacute; but this is sometimes called the information age, and Ms Mangan is the master of information-giving.  I refer to the very early stages in her career in the information services in Leeson Street where she established very high standards.  She worked there for a good while with a friend of mine, Martin McGarry.  It was very difficult to establish and give credibility to a service that was free of charge because people love going to solicitors where they pay a fortune to get advice.  However, the advice Ms Mangan was giving free of charge was accurate and worthwhile, and people could make decisions based on the information and advice she provided.  In a way she is the author of this entire edifice we see around us now on which so many of us rely.  People who do not have a lot of money to get accurate information can, for a minimum charge, be reassured that the information they get will be a very good guide to their actions.  I pay tribute to Ms Mangan personally, knowing her work and the credibility she has brought to it.</p>  <p>  On information-giving, the courtesy with which it is done and its reliability are very important aspects of information because if people act on it, they want to know they are acting on a firm foundation.  It has brought an important resource to civil society which perhaps is not appreciated widely enough.  If Ms Mangan were in England, she would be getting an MBE or something similar at this stage because she has built something from the ground up that is very important.</p></speech>

There are many bells ringing in my head but I will try to dwindle them down to one.  I have had a bee in my bonnet for a long time about moneylenders, particularly in the constituency I represent where many people depend on small loans.  A report was done on that previously which indicated that the south-west inner city area had the highest number of people with loans from both established and criminal moneylenders.  The report was shocking at the time.</p>  <p>  I wish Ms Mangan well in her job.  I have to be honest and say that if someone as qualified as her is given a job like this, there is hope for us all.</p>  <p>  When I got married at first we did not have a house.</p></speech>

It was a shame that the ESB abandoned those little shops because they were a lifeline for people wanting to buy a cooker, washing machine or whatever.  I am not that old but we did not have many fridges at that time.  People could buy a washing machine or cooker from that little shop and when it closed, it was a tough time for many who did not have the cash in hand.  Mr. Bolger in Inchicore, whom Deputy Conaghan will know, supplied everyone who moved into St. Michael's estate with their fridges and cookers, all of which were second hand but they got us over the hump in the road.  I always believed it was a bad decision by the ESB to close those shops and leave people stranded because that is when moneylenders came on the scene and devoured those people, so to speak, who would normally go to the ESB shop and pay a rate for the product they could afford.</p>  <p>  I compliment the people who run the citizens advice bureaus.  They are very dedicated.  Many of them are volunteers and are not paid, yet the information they have not only in their head but to hand is amazing.  I turn to them myself on occasions when I am bothered about something.</p>  <p>  Thousands of people do not have a loan with a credit union but there must be some channel through which such people can deal with a problem that might arise.  I refer to the awful event of someone passing away and people not having enough money to deal with that.  That can be very traumatic for people.</p>  <p>  I congratulate Ms Mangan on her proposed appointment as chairperson.  As the Minister said, we have done something right.  In her capacity as the new chairperson of the Citizens Information Board, is there any way that information on moneylending could be highlighted for people who come into her office?  I have sent many people who come to see me in my constituency office to the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, whose staff are brilliant, but we should talk to those people about the process of borrowing money from moneylenders, some of whom are criminalised.  </p>  <p>               A long time ago when I was on the council, I dealt with a girl who had given over her children's allowance book.  The moneylenders used to escort her to the post office, stand outside as she collected her money and then take it from her.  It was a horrific time for that family.  Perhaps Ms Mangan can comment on that.</p></speech>

What are her views on the overall restructuring of the agency, regionalisation and so on?  Does she intend to work with small rural post offices, which are under threat at the moment, and encourage people to use their post office, etc.?   That would be important because they are important in rural communities and many of them are under threat  Every organisation should work to support them and ensure they remain in existence.  Posts offices not only service the community but they have been part of the social fabric of society for a long time and the number that have closed over the past 20 years is regrettable.  While only a few have closed over the past five or six years, we should encourage people to use them more.</p></speech>

The citizens information service is very much regarded as community-based and independent of Government with a strong voluntary ethos.  As chairman, does Ms Mangan intend to maintain those aspects of the service?  There is concern that there may be attempts by civil servants to make the service more professional and to move away from its voluntary ethos.  What type of consultation will be conducted in respect of future plans?  Is remuneration associated with the position of chairman?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1632" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ita Mangan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#G00400"><p>There were quite a few questions and I will try to take them in sequence.  I can identify with Deputy Byrne.  I bought my first washing machine from the ESB as well almost 40 years ago and I am familiar with the system.</p>  <p>  In response to the Chairman's final question, I do not know.   I think there is but I did not ask.  That is the honest to God truth.  There probably is and it was remiss of me not to have asked but that is the reality.</p>  <p>  Deputies Collins, Ryan and Bannon raised the issue of reconfiguration.  First, there will be a new board coming in as well as myself.  There will other members on the new board and all the decisions will have to be made by that board.  No decisions have been made on reconfiguration or exactly how things will be done.  Certain proposals have been made but no decisions have been made.  Many of those proposals will need to be costed and we will need to see how exactly they would work out in practice.  Everyone will recognise there is a tension between having everything locally and having everything of high quality.  One has to come to a reasonable accommodation on those two issues.</p>  <p>  While I have lived in Dublin for the vast majority of my life, I grew up in the country and I recognise the need to improve the pace of rural development.  I am familiar with all the arguments about post office and Garda station closures and the consequences for local communities, etc.  The CIB of itself cannot make a huge contribution to that but it can make some contribution.  A rural development strategy is being prepared by the Government and that is the way froward on that.</p>  <p>  The Chairman raised the issue of the services provided within the community and by the community and by volunteers.  Again, there is a tension between the requirement to provide professional quality services - they do not have to be delivered by professionals; they can be delivered by volunteers - and the requirement on volunteers to get up to the speed on the various issues.  Members will be familiar with much of the detail of social welfare legislation, about which I know a great deal, but it is extremely complex and it is difficult for volunteers to remain up to speed.  The contribution made by volunteers and community groups must be balanced with the requirement that everything should be absolutely clear and correct because people are making decisions based on the information we provide.  It is important that the service should be fully professional in the best sense of the word, even though it may not necessarily be delivered by professionals on all occasions.</p>  <p>  On the issue of money advice, credit unions, loans, etc., the CIB does not make the rules about what credit unions do but we all know why they ran into problems and there is no point rehearsing all those arguments.  Perhaps we will get to the stage where they recover sufficiently to enable them to go back to making the small loans members mentioned and facilitating people.  We need the concept of the micro-loan as a separate stream of funding from credit unions, the post office or another source.  We need that separate stream to keep people away from moneylenders because it is not in any of our interests to have 360,000 people still using moneylending facilities.</p>  <p>  Deputy Butler raised the issue of credit rating.  New credit rating arrangements will come into effect next year.  I appreciate what he said.  When people fail to meet certain bills, they become ineligible for other credit.  The micro-loan concept could get them over that in that the availability of the loans could be set up in such a way that it would not be dependent on a previous credit rating or that a credit rating for large loans would not affect a person's ability to take a micro-loan.</p>  <p>  I have covered all the major issues raised because members made the same point several times.  I thank Deputy Connaughton for suggesting an honorary award but I would happily do without any such dame awards.</p></speech>

Co-ordination is required across all of the services provided by the Citizens Information Board.  I have always been passionate about making accurate information available to people.  I think I have driven people crazy over the years by insisting on everything being completely accurate.  I will follow that through because people make bad decisions in the absence of accurate information.  Our number one priority should be to provide accurate information to everybody.</p></speech>

People who were supposedly literate and able got caught by the banks because they did not ask the right questions and thus were not given the correct information, or else the information was set out on page 103 of an agreement in tiny writing.  They did not know their loans and mortgages were going to end up in a different country.  Precision of communication, whether orally or in writing, is important because otherwise one ends with nothing to back up a decision.  The decision might have been based on inaccurate or unclear information, with aspects that could have gone in every direction.  This is important across all kinds of politics and life generally.  I wish Ms Mangan luck in her job.  I think she will be great.</p></speech>

However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Their opening statements will be published on the committee website later today.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  Mobile telephones must be switched off completely or switched to safe or flight mode, as they could otherwise interfere with the broadcasting services.</p><p>Rent supplement comes within the remit of this committee.  It is paid by the Department of Social Protection to the lowest-income households to help them meet the cost of housing.  A total of 71,500 households, including 24,000 in Dublin, are in receipt of rent supplement.  It is one of a number of measures aimed at addressing housing issues.  A number of households have transferred from rent supplement to the housing assistance payment, and a further 6,000 households are on the rental assistance scheme. </p><p>To assist our consideration of rent supplement, we are joined by Mr. Pat Doyle and Mr. Brian Friel from the Peter McVerry Trust; Mr. Ashley Balbirnie and Mr. Mike Allen from Focus Ireland; and Ms Helen Faughnan, Ms Jackie Harrington and Mr. Carl O'Rourke from the Department of Social Protection.  I invite Mr. Friel to make his opening presentation on behalf of the Peter McVerry trust.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1642" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Friel" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#H00700"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for the opportunity to discuss issue of rent supplement.  Peter McVerry Trust was founded over 30 years ago and it currently provides services in housing, adult homelessness, residential care for children under 18, and drug treatment.  The charity is also an approved housing body with more than 100 residential units.  In 2014 the charity supported 4,460 participants across its services, an increase of 24% on the previous year.  The majority of those with whom Peter McVerry Trust engages are young single males with complex needs.  Some 57% of those with whom we work are aged between 18 and 35 years.</p>  <p>  The private rental market has traditionally been the destination for single people leaving homeless services because social housing has normally been constructed and targeted to the needs of multi-person family households.  </p>  <p>         The current most pressing challenge experienced by single homeless persons seeking accommodation is that of availability and affordability.  Supply in the rental sector in Dublin currently stands at it lowest levels since 2007 and rents have increased year-on-year since 2010, with significant increases in the market since 2013.  This situation is not only preventing homeless persons from accessing the private rental market, it is also placing those already in private rented accommodation at increasing risk of homelessness as rising rents exceed existing rent supplement caps.  The ability of rent supplement as it currently stands to counter these challenges and support people to secure or maintain rental accommodation is very limited.</p> <p> The Peter McVerry Trust, PMVT, believes that the rent supplement initiative, RSI, provided clear evidence to show that amendments to the rent supplement system could deliver positive outcomes.  The rent supplement initiative first ran as a pilot from December 2012 to August 2013 and was a joint Dublin Regional Homeless Executive, DRHE, and Department of Social Protection initiative involving eight homeless service providers.  The initiative was set up to create a centralised application system, to move rent supplement rates closer to market rates, to do more to meet the concerns of landlords, and to trial the payment of rents and deposits in advance and with rapid turnaround times.</p> <p> After an initial pilot phase a decision was taken to extend the initiative for 15 months operating from September 2013 to December 2014.  During this period the Peter McVerry Trust helped 22 households secure private rental accommodation via the initiative on supplements above the existing caps.  All of these households received a deposit and month&rsquo;s rent in advance.  The average monthly amount approved over and above the cap was &euro;176.  The average monthly rent for the 22 households stood at &euro;684.  Accordingly, the cost of housing one household for one year at these higher rates is &euro;8,208.  This is significantly lower than what it costs to accommodate a homeless person for one year in emergency accommodation and clearly demonstrates the cost effectiveness of schemes such as the rent supplement initiative.</p> <p> Based on figures compiled by the DRHE for the period quarter 3 of 2013 to quarter 4 of 2014 of the rent supplement initiative, 100 households were successfully housed in private rental accommodation.  Of those, 76 were supported by the initiative by way of payments above the normal cap with the vast majority also receiving advance deposits and the first month&rsquo;s rent upfront.  The 76 progressions to private rented accommodation, even at the higher rent supplement levels, represent a significant saving to the State.</p> <p> The Peter McVerry Trust believes that the success of the rent supplement initiative was largely dependent on the willingness to pay over and above the rent supplement caps.  However, another important aspect was the provision of a deposit and one month&rsquo;s rent in advance.  These factors combined to place homeless households on something approaching an equal footing to others seeking accommodation in the private rental market.  The rent supplement initiative was closed to new nominations at the end of December 2014 as the housing assistance payment was rolled out.  However, the learning and experience from the RSI has not fully transferred to the new scheme.</p> <p> While we understand that the housing assistance payment is not the remit of this committee, its consideration is crucial to understanding the context for the strengthening and reform of rent supplement.  Members will be aware that the housing assistance payment, or HAP scheme, is being rolled out across a number of local authorities.  HAP, while based on rent supplement rates, can provide a payment of 20% above current rent supplement caps up to a limit of &euro;624 for a single person household.  However, even with this exceptional payment, it is insufficient to allow many homeless households to secure private rented accommodation, as evidenced by the average rent figures for the rent supplement initiative previously outlined.</p> <p> Due to these issues, while the Peter McVerry Trust has accessed the HAP scheme for some clients, it has also continued to use the rent supplement system to secure private rental accommodation as this often proves to be a more flexible and effective method of securing private rental accommodation based on client need and closer to market rates.  Accordingly, nine of the 12 households progressed to private rented accommodation from the Peter McVerry Trust homeless services since February 2015 secured rent amounts through the rent supplement scheme at levels in excess of the maximum HAP limits.  In the remaining three cases, the rent required by the landlord was within HAP limits, but landlords were unwilling to engage in the scheme.</p> <p> I would like to briefly mention two other issues relevant to the issue of rent supplement.  The next issue that we would like to raise - one that is very relevant to this committee - is the issue of young people&rsquo;s social welfare rates.  Approximately 20% of those supported by the Peter McVerry Trust in 2014 were aged between 18 and 25.  For those individuals, the ability to secure and sustain private rental accommodation is particularly difficult.  They represent the most vulnerable group in adult homeless services.</p> <p> The young people in homeless services who are not in education are receiving the reduced rate of jobseeker's allowance at &euro;100 per week.  Should they find private rented accommodation this &euro;100 must cover a rent supplement contribution of &euro;32 per week and utility and services of approximately &euro;40 per week leaving them with a balance of &euro;28 for food, groceries, transport, and clothing.  Sustaining private rented accommodation on this financial basis is not possible.  If current welfare rates for homeless people aged under 25 remain unchanged these young people are at risk of becoming trapped in homeless accommodation for prolonged periods of time.  That leaves them vulnerable to becoming institutionalised into homelessness and limits their opportunity to gain the required skills for independent living at a time in life when these are best and most readily acquired.</p> <p> The final issue we would like to highlight is the challenge faced by homeless persons in attempting to secure private rental accommodation.  The Peter McVerry Trust&rsquo;s experience in supporting participants to secure private rented accommodation is that in the normal course of events, they will need to view in the region of ten properties before finding a landlord who will consider them for a possible tenancy and even then the processing time, the rate of supplement available and the availability of deposits and rent in advance can put a prospective landlord off.  Even securing a viewing can be difficult as many landlords are reluctant to consider applications from those in receipt of rent allowance.  The process can be extremely frustrating for people in homeless services, and many motivated individuals have relapsed into drug use or have recurrences of mental health issues because of the length of time it can take to find accommodation.  At the launch of the rent supplement initiative, the Peter McVerry Trust increased the resources it dedicates to its accommodation finders team.  The team is dedicated to helping and supporting homeless persons to find accommodation, manage relations with landlords and estate agents as well as helping them to complete all the necessary paperwork.</p> <p> The Peter McVerry Trust would urge that the significant disparity between market rates and rent supplement caps must be addressed to meet the urgent and immediate housing need of those in homeless services.  This could be done in such a way as to provide rent certainty for both landlords and tenants by linking private rent increases to the cost of living index while at the same time increasing rent caps to levels more appropriate to current market rates.</p> <p> We have highlighted through the rent supplement initiative that, on a per household basis, it is more cost effective to increase rent supplement rates than to continue paying for emergency accommodation.  Similarly, it will also be more cost effective to increase young people&rsquo;s social welfare rates, which together with increased rent supplement rates, would allow more young people to exit homelessness.  The Peter McVerry Trust believes that increased costs to the Department of Social Protection resulting from the above measures could be potentially off-set by a reduction in the cost to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government associated with spending on emergency homeless accommodation.</p></speech>

Focus Ireland is one of the leading national homeless organisations in the country.  This is our 30th anniversary.  We provide a range of services but probably the most relevant one for this purpose is that we run the family homeless action team, HAT, for the four local authorities in Dublin so that any family in Dublin that is assessed as becoming homeless is allocated emergency accommodation by the local authority such as a hotel room or a room in a B&amp;B and allocated to our team.  That gives us an in-depth insight into what is happening in families, which is unique and extremely worrying at the moment.</p>  <p>  I do not wish to spend time telling the committee what members as public representatives all know because they all see the scale of the problem.  However, to give a brief indication of it, in June last year, there were 247 families with 489 children in homeless accommodation and just nine months later in March this year, there were 471 families with more than 1,054 children in homeless accommodation.  When we started doing this work specifically for the Dublin Regional Homeless Executive in 2012 there were approximately eight families per month coming into homelessness.  That doubled the year after that and in the following year it doubled again.  That is an exponential growth in family homelessness.</p>  <p>  Members are all aware of that.  I hope they are also increasingly aware that the number of families who get accommodated in emergency accommodation is only part of the problem and that there is an increasing phenomenon of families being assessed as homeless and not being allocated accommodation.  The joint team that we run with the Peter McVerry Trust, as the intake team in Dublin, has come across 13 families with children bedding down in cars or in public places in March and April alone.  </p>  <p>         It is unprecedented in Ireland to have families with children considering sleeping rough.  They have not slept rough because we came into contact with them, but I hope that is something every Member of the House and every member of the committee believes in absolutely unacceptable in Ireland and that everything must be done to prevent it from happening.</p> <p> Everybody agrees on how bad the problem is, and that it is the worst problem in respect of families and singles homelessness we have ever seen.  The question is what role rent supplement plays in causing the problem and what role it can play in solving it.  There was a growth in the private rented sector over the last decade or so from it catering for approximately 10% of the population to catering for 20% of the population.  The vast majority of families who are now facing homelessness were at work during the boom and made their homes in private rented accommodation.  As a matter of public policy in this State, that was a legitimate and growing part of our housing provision.  When they became unemployed they found themselves unable to afford the rent.  The mechanism the Oireachtas has put in place to deal with that situation is the rent supplement legislation, under which people who are in need of assistance to cover their rent are to be given it through that mechanism.  For reasons that are still hard to explain, over the last number of years the Department of Social Protection has decided not to fulfil the obligations under the legislation and provide people with adequate money to pay their rent.  As a result, a large number of families are becoming homeless.</p> <p> It is important to understand that when we talk about 71 families becoming homeless in Dublin last month the overwhelming majority of those come from the private rented sector, and the majority of them received rent supplement prior to becoming homeless.  The majority of them would give the inadequacy of the rent supplement level as the primary cause of their homelessness.  If rent supplement matched market levels, it would not solve our current homelessness crisis - we are not saying it is a silver bullet that would solve the problem - but it would reduce it very substantially and put us in a much stronger position to deal with the rest of the families who become homeless.</p> <p> It is important to understand the two very important ways in which it works.  The first is strict prevention of homelessness, that is, keeping people in their homes when they already have a home and are unable to pay the rent.  The inadequacy of rent supplement means that families pay top-ups.  It would be virtually impossible to find a single household in Ireland on rent supplement that is not illicitly paying an addition to that to the landlord.  Every Deputy and public representative knows it, and it is a scandal that nothing has been done about it.  As the rent goes up further, they fall into arrears and eventually end up being evicted.  If the rent supplement was adequate that would be less likely to happen.</p> <p> Even more significantly, where families become homeless many of them have long experience in the private rented sector and many have lost their flats or accommodation previously, but they were always able to find somewhere else.  Now, however, if a family is evicted from accommodation and becomes homeless, as our colleagues in the Peter McVerry Trust pointed out, there is no prospect of the family being able to compete in the market because the rent supplement the family is given is totally inadequate.  The only way to do so is to top it up.  An additional aspect to that is that the way the rent supplement scheme has been handled over the last number of years means that many landlords are unwilling to deal with rent supplement, not because of a prejudice against people on rent supplement, although that exists, but because of an unwillingness to deal with the Department of Social Protection.  While the Department is very good at customer relations over recent years, it does not consider landlords to be among its citizen customers and has not treated them in such a way.  That will have long-term impacts.</p> <p> What we are saying fundamentally is that we believe the Department of Social Protection and the Minister are not following the legislation passed by the Oireachtas, which states that the purpose of the legislation is to provide a payment towards the amount of rent payable by a person in respect of his or her residence.  That is a significant cause of a large number of people losing their homes and it must be rectified if we are to have any possibility of beginning to come to terms with the scale of the homelessness crisis currently facing us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1648" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Helen Faughnan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#K00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to appear before it.  I am accompanied by Ms Jackie Harrington, who has policy responsibility for rent supplement, and Mr. Carl O'Rourke, who is head of the homeless persons unit and the asylum seekers and new communities unit in Dublin.</p>  <p>  The Department recognises that homelessness is one of the most visible and distressing signs of the social impact of the crisis that has hit Ireland since 2008.  The Department fully acknowledges the difficulties that people are experiencing, including rent supplement recipients, in maintaining suitable affordable accommodation in the current market, most notably in the urban areas where supply is most acute.  In response to these difficulties, the Department has put in place a number of preventative measures to ensure that people at risk of homelessness or loss of their tenancy are supported under the rent supplement scheme where increased rental payments are required.  These measures are kept under constant review in the light of vital feedback which we receive, especially from the non-governmental organisations and Oireachtas Members.  We are operating an individual case management approach which I will explain shortly.  However, this can only work well when those who need the services are aware of what is available and how to access it.</p>  <p>  The purpose of the rent supplement scheme is to provide short-term income support to people living in private rented accommodation whose means are insufficient to meet their accommodation costs and who do not have accommodation available to them from any other source.  The Government has provided over &euro;298 million for the scheme this year.  There are currently approximately 68,000 rent supplement recipients, of whom almost 5,700 have been awarded the rent supplement this year to date.</p>  <p>  In March last, the Department published a review of the maximum rent limits under the scheme.  The review finds that increasing rent limits at this time could potentially add to further rental inflation in an already distressed market, affecting not only rent supplement recipients but also lower-income workers and students.  Between the rent supplement scheme administered by the Department and the rental accommodation scheme administered by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the State accounts for a third of the private rented market.   It is therefore a very significant player in the sector.</p>  <p>  Fundamentally, the main cause of rising rents is a lack of supply in the market, and increasing the prescribed rent limits will not address this issue.  The primary responsibility for provision of accommodation for homeless persons rests with local authorities.  The implementation of the range of actions under the Construction 2020 strategy and the social housing strategy will support increased housing supply, but Government recognises that there is a time-lag in the provision of new stock.  It is also understood that the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government intends to bring proposals in respect of rent certainty to the Government shortly.</p>  <p>  Rather than providing for a blanket increase on rent limits, which will not address the issue, the Department&rsquo;s preventative policy allows for flexibility in assessing customers&rsquo; individual accommodation needs through the national tenancy sustainment framework.  Under this approach, each tenant&rsquo;s circumstances are considered on a case-by-case basis, and rents are being increased above prescribed limits as appropriate.  Staff in the community welfare service of the Department who administer the rent supplement scheme have a statutory discretionary power to award or increase a supplement for rental purposes, for example, when dealing with applicants who are risk of losing their tenancy or in danger of homelessness.  This flexible approach has already assisted over 2,000 rent supplement households throughout the country to retain their rented accommodation.  The Department is also undertaking measures to ensure that cases are considered throughout the country in a consistent manner.</p>  <p>  In addition, the Department, in conjunction with Threshold, operates a special protocol in the Dublin and Cork areas where the level of supply is particularly acute.  The primary objective of the protocol is to ensure a speedy intervention to ensure that families at immediate risk of losing their tenancy get rapid assistance.  Of the 2,000 households I mentioned earlier, over 660 Dublin households and some 20 in Cork received support through increased rental payments as a direct result of engagement under the protocol.</p>  <p>  The Department also provides support to persons towards rent deposits and rent in advance under the exceptional needs payments, ENPs, scheme.  This form of assistance is very important to those on low incomes who rely on the private rental market to meet their housing needs.  Last year, almost 3,000 payments were made towards rent deposits, at a cost of almost &euro;1.5 million.  Some 1,000 payments have been made in 2015 to date.</p>  <p>  A communication campaign has been put in place to increase the level of public awareness of the supports available from the Department.  </p>  <p>          It should be noted that in many homeless cases, highlighted in the media, rent supplement recipients had vacated their accommodation without having discussed their situation with Department officials.  This information campaign seeks to address this issue and to encourage people at risk to contact the Department, Threshold, or the various non-governmental organisations that are represented here today as early as possible to prevent an unnecessary episode of homelessness.  </p> <p> The Department&rsquo;s website and that of the Citizens Information Service have been recently updated.  In April this year the Department issued text messages to more than 50,000 rent supplement recipients advising of the supports available.  Tweets are issuing to departmental followers on a monthly basis.  A national poster campaign is also under way and posters have been distributed to all our departmental offices, post offices, citizen information centres, Money Advice and Budgeting Service offices and to Oireachtas Members.  The Department is considering further circulation of this information to include local authorities, libraries and credit unions. </p> <p> The community welfare service, including through its work in the Homeless Persons Unit and the Asylum Seekers and New Communities Unit, works closely with local authorities, homeless action teams and other stakeholders, including the non-governmental organisations, to facilitate homeless persons to access private rented accommodation.  This level of inter-agency participation ensures greater integration between the key agencies involved in the area of homelessness and related services.  In addition, the Department is represented on the homelessness policy implementation team, led by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, to oversee the implementation of the homelessness action plan.  </p> <p> The Government has effectively two initiatives to deal with long-term reliance on rent supplement - the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, which has been in operation since 2004 and the more recent housing assistance payment, HAP, which is currently being rolled out to eight local authority areas.  To date, HAP has provided support to approximately 2,140 tenants.  In the first quarter of this year, more than 770 rent supplement tenants have transferred to RAS and other social housing options.  Both initiatives give the local authorities specific responsibility for meeting the long-term housing needs of people receiving rent supplement.  When HAP is fully in place, rent supplement will continue to be paid to clients who are already in the private rented sector but who, generally because of a loss of income through unemployment, require short-term income support in order to pay their rent.  Rent supplement will, therefore, over time, return to its original purpose of being a short-term payment. </p> <p> I want to assure the committee that the Department continues to monitor the measures in place to ensure that the appropriate supports continue to be provided for rent supplement recipients.  I wish to advise that a departmental briefing on the flexibility provided under rent supplement has been arranged for Oireachtas Members tomorrow afternoon in order that as many people as possible are aware of the Department&rsquo;s position and can advise people locally.  If it would be helpful, I can give the committee information on the number of supports in place at a local level. </p> <p> Overall, the response to the current extremely difficult housing situation must be multifaceted and the arrangements put in place need not only to meet the immediate need but to be sustainable for the future.  I trust the presentation is of assistance to the committee and I am happy to discuss any issues raised or proposals made. </p></speech>

There is no doubt that even since Christmas and following the death of Jonathan Corrie that this situation has got increasingly worse.  The number who are homeless has nearly doubled and it is mainly families who now find themselves in this situation.  I attended emergency meeting after emergency meeting at Christmas and we brought onstream approximately 260 units for single people, for which there has been a flood in demand.  We also opened a night caf&eacute;.  This major problem is continuing to get out of control.</p>  <p>  A major issue currently has been the haemorrhage from rent supplement and RAS with more people ending up homelessness.  That is due to landlords making various excuses - some of which are genuine although the majority of them are not - as to why they want to get back their properties or they may state that the banks are taking charge of them but, in many instances, we find that is not the case.  We have repeatedly asked why the Government has not introduced some rent controls.  It has continually used the term "rent certainty" and I am getting sick of hearing that term.  We need to address the issue of rents spiralling out of control.  We now have a major housing bubble and a housing rental bubble.  It is every bit as bad, or perhaps worse, than what we had during the worse excesses of the Celtic tiger.  That is how badly this is affecting many people.  It seems there is no rush by any Minister or Government Deputy to introduce a mechanism to stop this haemorrhage.  We need to stop it immediately.  One of the reason that the HAP initiative was introduced-----</p></speech>

No new people will be in receipt of such a payment and that is another problem.  The introduction of the HAP initiative was part of the Government's policy to improve the position, but that has not happened and we are barely holding on to what we have in place.  Moving on to my questions for the witnesses, do they all agree that we need rent controls in place, whether they be tied to the consumer price index, inflation or some such mechanism that is used in other European countries?  Under the HAP initiative, there is no system of deposits in place</p></speech>

The last figure we heard for the number of people in receipt of rent supplement was 78,000 but that figure has decreased to 71,000.  That indicates that 7,000 of that initial number are no longer in receipt of that supplement.  Some of those people are now in receipt of a housing assistance payment but a number of them have disappeared in terms of the number in receipt of the supplement, which indicates that a huge number of those people are homeless.

As always, Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust have succinctly outlined the issues and rent supplement plays a very small role in this respect.  Mr. Brian Friel spoke about the resources needed to secure private rental accommodation and that is one of the key areas.  That is particularly the case when people are motivated, want to get accommodation and they link in with the services.  However, if they are pushed back and the provision of the accommodation is delayed for weeks on end, there is the possibility that they could relapse into drug abuse or return to being homeless.  Can the Department of Social Protection set up a protocol whereby once the witnesses, who are directly dealing with the trust to solve these problems, have the deposits or advance rent payments ready to be transferred, that there would not be a question of every individual having to be dealt with differently or separately?  It is a matter of getting the process moving and dealing with it closely.  The trust would approach the Department and advise that it has a person who needs accommodation, that the rented accommodation is available and that it needs the rental money now.  That approach would not give the landlords the excuse to be able to play around with the issue and say there is a problem.  Mr. Mike Allen was right in saying there is a degree of discrimination in that some landlords will not get involved with the Department because of the hassle of getting the moneys and deposits in place.  I would like to hear the Department's response to that issue.  It is also what I have experienced even with the housing first model.  It is probably not related to rent supplement as such but it is the issue of how the Department links in with the organisations that supply the service for homeless people.  </p>  <p>               People are asked what are their emergency needs, for example, white goods and so forth, but a link should be established immediately with the organisations working with homeless people.  This would mean that things could move quickly when a council flat or private rented accommodation becomes available as there would be a one-stop-shop for dealing with these issues.  The Department and the relevant organisations would work together and one would not find three weeks after accommodation has been found that this, that or the other had not been sorted out.  Everyone must get together to address this issue because the money has to be spent on the people in question in any case. </p> <p> How many people are moving from satellite towns to Dublin to seek support they are unable to obtain from their local authorities?  I am aware, for example, that Traveller families are moving from Kildare to Dublin because the capital is the only area where they can link in to emergency services.  How will the Department address this issue?  The housing organisations in Dublin are under severe pressure as a result of the housing crisis.  I do not know how their front-line staff cope with it.  Every day, five families become homeless and the homeless charities have to deal with them, which is not sustainable.  </p></speech>

As a practitioner in my local area, I could see all sorts of pressures on the rent supplement caps.  In recent times, however, the most pressing issue has been finding accommodation, in other words, it is a problem of housing supply rather than caps on rent supplement.  I spent yesterday afternoon with a client who will be made homeless this weekend because the landlord is taking back the house.  I would be delighted if caps on rent supplement were the only problem.  I telephoned three letting agents yesterday, none of which had a single place available.  Estate agents inform me that they are fortunate if one property becomes available for letting each month.  They would be out of business if it were not for the increase in property sales.  Clearly, an increase in the caps on rent supplement would not work as it would not solve the problem for a family that is made homeless next Monday.</p>  <p>  Rent certainty or rent control - call it what one will - is very important.  The Minister indicated he will soon introduce measures in this area.  While I accept that legislation is also required to address the problem of landlords refusing rent supplement, outlawing this practice will not prevent it from happening. </p>  <p>  The most serious problem is the supply of homes.  One can increase rent caps to whatever level one wishes but it will not solve the problem given the absence of houses.  This is the biggest and most frustrating issue I encounter.  It is shocking to deal with families who are facing the prospect of homelessness within one week.  Trying to deal with these issues is the most deflating aspect of the work I do. </p>  <p>  I am contacted constantly by people asking where they are on the housing list.  They are frustrated by the lack of council homes.  While social housing will come on stream as a result of recent announcements by the Government, it will be between 18 months and two years before homes are handed over to tenants.  I do not know what are the views of the representatives of the Peter McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland on this matter.  The crisis will continue until supply increases in 12 to 18 months.</p>  <p>  This is a multifaceted problem for which there is no simple solution.  Identifying measures that will help to manage the transition from a lack of supply to supply is the greatest challenge for all of us.  No one, either a politician or someone else, can say he or she has a solution or that increasing rent caps will solve the problem.  The issue is more serious than that. </p></speech>

I am pleased that is the case because some people are not as fortunate as others and may need help at certain times in their lives.</p>  <p>  There seems to be a gulf between the views expressed by the Department and those expressed by the Peter McVerry Trust and Focus Ireland.  We have reached an impasse.  The housing charities argue that the rent supplement payment is not sufficient to meet the cost of rent.  Mr. Allen argued that, even if rent supplement were set at market rates, the problem would not be fully resolved.  The Department argues that increasing rent supplement limits could add to rental inflation.  This is only one aspect of the gulf in opinion.  Will Mr. Allen explain the reasons he vehemently disagrees with some of the solutions proposed by the Department?</p>  <p>  The next issue I raise may be a maverick one as I do not have the same experience as other Deputies and Senators who hold clinics and encounter the problem of homelessness every day.  In that respect, I must bow to their better judgment.  I travel the country in another role and every satellite town I visit within 30 or 50 miles of Dublin has half-built or quarter-built estates or finished estates in which no one lives.  No one knows who owns these properties.  Deputy Brendan Ryan is correct that we do not have enough social housing because we took our eyes off the ball when we stopped building proper homes and social housing.  We were all reared around Dublin Corporation and local authority housing where children grew up with a big field in front of their homes.  That approach to social housing disappeared.  Perhaps this is a maverick question but why is there such an impasse about idle estates outside Dublin?  I see them right and left as I enter and leave every town and village I visit.  I ask the witnesses to address this issue.  </p>  <p>  I also ask Mr. Allen to respond to some of the solutions proposed by Ms Faughnan because there is a major gulf between the views expressed by the officials and those expressed by the housing charities.</p></speech>

In 1999, I was elected to Dublin City Council to represent the south-west inner city, an area with among the highest number of social housing flat complexes in the country.  I remember regularly walking around all of them.  Despite the large sums spent on these flat complexes, some of them had to be demolished for various and complicated reasons, including anti-social behaviour and management problems.  During my time on Dublin City Council, people lodged objections to beat the band about the height and so on of large apartment blocks that it was proposed to build near the Coombe bypass.  I often wonder if the same would happen today given the position we are in.</p>  <p>  I was a member of the regeneration board of St. Michael's Estate in Fatima Mansions and Dolphin House.  My greatest regret is the failure of the regeneration board to approve the plan for St. Michael's Estate and allow a new estate to be built.  It was proposed to build between 400 and 500 units.  </p>  <p>               The board meeting got down to the nitty-gritty matters such as people wanting to know the colour of their windows, the handles on their doors, whether they would have a front and back garden and the colour of the bricks.  It became very frustrating.  I left the regeneration board when I was elected to the D&aacute;il, totally frustrated.  After millions of euro going into St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate, we produced a plan but could not get agreement on it.  Sadly, the plan was denied because of a small pocket of people.  The voices of everyone who lived in the surrounding areas were not even heard.</p> <p> Today, we have a beautiful green of six acres left over.  I hope to God we never build on it again.  We had Richmond Barracks, Keogh Square and then St. Michael&rsquo;s Estate on the site which was a failure as social housing.  I hope we never build on it again and give the people who live around this site in Tyrone Place, Emmet Crescent and Thornton Heights a place on which to look out.  It has got to the stage that some of the regeneration boards have long passed the capability of making any decisions.  It is a personal gripe of mine and has nothing to do with the party to which I belong.</p></speech>

I can understand height restrictions but if they had been altered, we would have extra housing units.  The Government has invested &euro;12.5 million to build 52 units in St. Teresa&rsquo;s Gardens and given &euro;3.5 billion as a start-off for social housing building over the next several years.  The Government has given over &euro;500 million to Dublin alone for landbanks for house building.  No one can tell me the Government is not looking at building.  It is, but the problem is when a plan comes to the council, it is rejected.  The latest plan of 67 units for O&rsquo;Devaney Gardens would have seen 67 families coming out of hotel rooms where they cannot live in one room with three children.  It is appalling.  The council needs to wake up and smell the grass.</p></speech>

Athlone has a student population which means there is limited availability of accommodation.  It is equally as bad as in any other city, a point which is not recognised by the Department.  The provisions being put in place in Dublin and Cork also need to be put in place for towns like Athlone where there is a significant shortage of accommodation and people are being put out on the street because they cannot get accommodation in the first place.</p>  <p>  The specific issue I want to raise is on rent caps.  The rent cap for a couple with two children in Monksland, County Roscommon, is &euro;410.  However, because the country boundary is the white line in the middle of the road, the rent cap on the County Westmeath side is &euro;520, &euro;110 of a difference from one side of the road to the other.  The Department&rsquo;s own officials have been pleading with the Department to change this rule in Athlone.  It is the exact same in Ballinasloe where the rent cap in County Galway is higher than it is in County Roscommon.  Again, a white line in the middle of the road is defining that.  The Department is essentially telling people in County Roscommon that if they want to be on rent supplement, they can no longer live in Roscommon and must move to County Westmeath or County Galway to get accommodation.  As they move geographic location, they are taken off the Roscommon local authority housing list and put on the housing list in the adjoining county.  Not only is the Department telling them they cannot live in their own county, the county where they were born and reared and where their children might be going to school, but it is telling them they must permanently move outside of their own local authority area to reside in another county.  The Department&rsquo;s officials are pleading to have these anomalies addressed.  Nothing, however, will be done because the decision has been taken that there will be no movement, even on gaping anomalies like this.</p>  <p>  We are paying out substantial sums of money in rent allowance.  The Department, however, will still not put specific provisions in place to deal with recipients engaged in anti-social behaviour.  A persistent offender in a local authority tenancy will be turfed out on the street because they are causing absolute chaos in a particular community.  They will still get rent allowance from the Department of Social Protection, however.  They can cause absolute pandemonium in communities but the Department will say it is not its issue even though it is paying them over &euro;500 every single month.  It is not good enough that conditions will not be put on this payment.  The law needs to be changed on this.  The same rules that apply to local authority tenants should apply to recipients of the rent allowance scheme.</p></speech>

It is examining these and we would welcome any progress on that issue.  It is not correct that no new people are coming on to the housing assistance payment scheme, HAP.  Out of the 2,140 people who have come on to the scheme, 60% of those, 1,300, are new applicants.  The remaining 40% are existing rent supplement recipients transferring over.</p>  <p>  A protocol is in place with the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities on deposits and ensuring the Department of Social Protection will pay a rental deposit to help secure tenancy.  HAP is looking at the legislation on rental deposits under the HAP mechanism.  At the moment, HAP is new and the Department is working hand in hand with the other agencies involved to ensure the processes are supported.  It is correct that the number of rent supplement tenants has fallen with a 15,000 drop in the number of recipients over the past three years.  That is partly a reduction in the live register but also the transfer of people on to RAS, rental accommodation scheme, and other social housing options.  During the same period, 14,000 people transferred from rent supplement onwards.  There is quite a large churn in rent supplement.  As I mentioned earlier, over 5,400 people have come on to the rent supplement scheme since the beginning of this year.</p>  <p>  Deputy Joan Collins spoke about working hand in hand with the NGOs and having mechanisms in place.  </p>  <p>         The Peter McVerry Trust talked about the rent supplement initiative.  That has been in place since 2012 and is working very well.  Around the country our officials are on homeless action teams, HAT.  We engage with the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, Threshold, Focus Ireland, the Simon Community and all sorts of local organisations.  There is very good engagement and a lot of case conferencing.  If cases are brought to our attention, we will have a rent deposit ready for those people and pay a rent in advance to try to secure a tenancy in that place.</p> <p> I have responsibility for six of the Department&rsquo;s 13 divisions.  I was recently in Cork, where we have a homeless unit which is next door to the offices of the Simon Community.  They work hand in hand.  They were invited to brief the new St. Vincent de Paul volunteers in the Cork area.  The community welfare staff briefed them on a Saturday to make sure they were aware of the supports we have in place because they are in touch with some of the most vulnerable people and we want to help them.</p> <p> Deputy Ryan spoke about housing supply.  That is the biggest issue that the NGOs here today and we and many others battle with.  There is a lot of work being done by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the local authorities.  I will not go into it now but there are directives from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government about the cohort of housing stock that has to be prioritised, etc.  There is a National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, unit coming on stream in Tallaght and other similar initiatives.</p> <p> In respect of rent supplement, it was of particular concern to the Department that leading property websites put up no rent supplement filters.  We engaged with them and they agreed to take down those filters and accepted this was not in line with best equality legislation.  We have a lot of interaction with those types of stakeholders.</p> <p> In response to the questions about rent supplement not being sufficient, and to Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s question, a blanket increase in rent supplement limits across the country would give us little or no available extra supply but as I have reiterated in two very clear directives to the staff, they have flexibility - we call it Article 38 - to examine people&rsquo;s needs on a case by case basis.  In some cases, for example, a young vulnerable person, we will pay above the rent supplement limit, particularly if that person is on a reduced jobseeker's payment.  Issues arise in the boundary areas between Roscommon and Athlone where there is a higher socio-economic group and accommodation is taken up by students in Athlone.  It is the same in north Kildare because of the good manufacturers there, which take up the supply.  The staff, whether in Roscommon or Athlone, have discretion to try to support people to secure that accommodation.  There is direct contact around the country in all our community welfare service units with non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and Oireachtas Members who deal with these people in their clinics should come to talk to us if they feel the flexibility is not being deployed.  There are almost 7,000 staff in the Department, and with the best will in the world, consistency may be an issue.  Oireachtas Members should talk to us or to the divisional managers because this is the safety net and we want to make sure it is deployed effectively throughout the country.</p> <p> In response to Deputy Naughten&rsquo;s question about anti-social behaviour and rent supplement, up to now if a person worked and paid rent, the agreement was with the landlord.  If that person lost their job or was ill and could not pay the rent, we were there to step in to be the safety net for a short period of time.  It was never intended as a long-term housing solution.  Unfortunately, it has turned out that way for just under 70,000 people that we support.  A substantial sum of money, &euro;298 million, has been set aside.  It is a demand-led scheme and resources will be made available to meet the needs.  The contract is between the landlord and the tenant.  The landlords must enforce the tenant obligations.  The Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, was set up with a specific remit in this area to enforce tenants&rsquo; obligations and it has powers in that respect.  We have powers such that if a local authority or someone else complains to us and the landlord has to suspend or terminate a tenancy because of anti-social behaviour, we will stop the rent supplement payment.  The programme for Government commitment in this area is through the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Under HAP, the local authority will pay the rent directly to the landlord.  If there is an anti-social problem it will be handled using that mechanism.</p></speech>

Two issues were raised about Focus Ireland, one was the points of difference between us and the Department of Social Protection and one was about the financial differential.  There are several areas where we are very much in agreement with what is happening.  I am very conscious that organisations such as ours are sometimes seen as hurlers on the ditch, throwing abuse and nothing positive into the pot.  We agree with many of the things that have been said here.  Fundamentally, supply is the big issue, as Deputy Ryan pointed out.  This is at the root of everything.  There will be a massive problem over the next couple of years about supply.  There is no question whatsoever about that.  In the meantime we are doing everything we can, starting with Housing First, in partnership with the Peter McVerry Trust.  We are beating every bush to try to bring additional property into the situation.  Likewise, with the family HAT.</p>  <p>  We are also very much in favour of what is being done about rent certainty and there are some very positive moves there.  We are absolutely behind that.  We are positive about what is happening with the rental accommodation scheme, RAS, and HAP, and particularly the Department&rsquo;s willingness to engage on a case by case basis and the work it does with our sister organisation, Threshold.  We are also all for the multi-faceted approach, which was mentioned.</p>  <p>  The big point of differentiation, and the main point we want to make today, is in respect of rent supplement.  Rent supplement rates were last altered in June 2013 but according to the property website, DAFT, rent rates have gone up 22% nationally since then.  In Dublin, they have risen by between 22% and 40%.  Crucially, we believe that rent supplement is part of the answer.  Nobody argues with that.  For it to work, however, it must relate economically to the market rent.  In a situation where the market rent has increased between 20% and 40% there has to be adjustment to take account of that because, otherwise, rent supplement ceases to fulfil its purpose.  That is the main point we want to make today.</p></speech>

I am the CEO of the Peter McVerry Trust.  I thank the committee for inviting us.  I would like to echo what Mr. Balbirnie was saying.  This is very complex and there are multiple issues at stake.  We have had a very good working relationship with the Department of Social Protection.  Deputy Ellis raised the issue of rent certainty, which we have been pushing for.  In other countries, if people have rent certainty for three to five years' tenure, it gives them time to plan and perhaps to move beyond private renting.  We need that and appreciate that efforts have been made to address it.</p>  <p>  The rent cap has to be part of it.  Deputy Ryan is right that supply is the overwhelming issue.  The trust has been very fortunate in respects of announcements by the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government in the last two years, and there are a number of major building projects on the way.  One is to start in July; the funding for it was granted last year, the building will take place this year and we will not get a tenancy before the new year.  Although the building work will be happening over the next eighteen months to two or three years, in the meantime we have a huge number of people in emergency beds who need to get out.  We also have a great number of people who need to be given emergency beds.  We had the crisis at Christmas, when 260 or 270 beds came in, and they are full now.  If we do not get people out of the emergency beds, we will not be able to bring people in.  Rent caps play a role in that.</p>  <p>  We spent a good proportion of our presentation talking about the rent supplement initiative, which worked very well in conjunction with the Department of Social Protection.  We named 400 people in emergency beds who were ready for private accommodation and we had people out trying to get properties with appropriate levels of rent.  While the housing assistance payment, HAP, allows homeless households a 20% increase in the maximum rent limits, the rents we were agreeing with the Department of Social Protection were above that.  Although we are not discussing HAP, let us not take any scheme or idea off the table.  Let us keep talking about the rent caps, because they are not meeting market rates at the moment, and let us bring back the rent supplement initiative which enabled us to go above the 20% increase allowed through HAP.</p></speech>

I also think the Department of Social Protection is a benevolent city in itself in respect of our citizens.  I am interested in how it is responding to the point that Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust are making.  It seems to be the major impasse, although we all accept all the other things, the losses.</p></speech>

What community welfare officers have got to have, rather than generalised caps, is the flexibility to respond to the market locally.  About a year to a year and a half ago, I did not see that flexibility, but I see it now.  CWOs are now responding to individual cases and upping the caps as appropriate, which is very positive.</p>  <p>  In terms of supply, around the country, including in my own area of Fingal, there are now moves towards providing more accommodation, and the councils are beginning to build houses.  However, we are also seeing people objecting to these houses, while so-called left-wing parties with representatives in this House are voting against those social houses.  We all have got to examine our conscience in terms of the political groupings we are involved with.  Supply is a big issue and we must facilitate it as far as possible.</p></speech>

Very rarely did anyone break ranks, and we got the issue addressed in that Traveller accommodation was built.  The same issue arises for homeless accommodation.  Some parties are putting their head on the platter and backing homeless accommodation while others are being populist.  It is then very likely that the whole thing will collapse.  There should be cross-party agreement that we all stand together and support provision for homeless accommodation and housing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1693" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#P00900"><p>The frustrating thing about the rent caps is that they are far too low.  Homelessness was traditionally a city problem, and when families are being left homeless in rural counties like Roscommon, something is seriously wrong.  That is what I am dealing with at the moment.  There are crisis situations for families trying to get accommodation in the first place.</p>  <p>  To give one example, a young lady came to me last week who was being discharged from an acute psychiatric unit.  No appointment had been made with the community welfare officer and there was very little engagement from the social worker appointed by the psychiatric service with the community welfare service.  The social worker instructed the young woman to do a deal with the landlord and pay him &euro;100 in cash under the table.  The social worker did not realise that &euro;100 is a waste of time as the current market rates are &euro;250 over what she would be able to pay on the rent cap.  Although it is welcome that flexibility is coming in to the system, the other agencies are not aware of it and it is not being brought to their attention, and even that flexibility is insufficient to secure accommodation.  This young woman was advised that she needed to go to a rural area, yet she has to attend an acute psychiatric unit on a weekly basis.  There is no public transport except in the urban areas, so she is going to be left to her own devices in a rural area, isolated, after coming out of an acute psychiatric unit.  She will back in again as an admission.  The system is failing her.</p>  <p>  I can give numerous examples from County Roscommon, the most rural county in the country, in which there is more than sufficient housing stock as a whole.  We have specific problems that are in some instances as bad as those in Dublin because of the inflexibility of the system.  The rent caps are falling far short of the reality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1694" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1193" speakername="Joan Collins" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#P01000"><p>The housing crisis will last for many years unless the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government provides some facility to allow Dublin City Council and the local authorities to build houses.  They cannot do it at the moment and are mainly dependent on the voluntary sector to build housing - organisations such as the National Association of Building Co-operatives, NABCO, Circle Voluntary Housing Association, and Cl&uacute;id Housing.  Some people are saying that we will start seeing houses being built, yet we have 100,000 people on the housing list.  Between November and January last, 6,000 people went on the Dublin City Council housing list.</p>  <p>  This should be addressed in the same way the Financial Emergency Measures in the Public Interest Bill - the so-called FEMPI legislation - was dealt with, on a emergency basis.  In the meantime, very vulnerable people are finding themselves homeless.  Traveller people and others who are not used to dealing with bureaucracy are being told to go ahead and get private accommodation themselves because they cannot be put into the emergency housing.  It has to be resolved and the Department must make it as easy as possible for the NGOs to do that.  That should be the focus of our discussion today, as the other issues are too broad to deal with in this meeting.</p>  <p>  On the idea of the rent supplement initiative, can the Department give a commitment that it will keep it on the burner so that it is at least taken into account?  </p>  <p>               The rent supplement threshold must be increased.  Between 2013 and 2015, the cost of renting in Dublin increased by almost 40%.  As landlords continue to increase rents on a yearly basis, we will be dealing with them in a crisis situation anyway.  We need to do deal with that issue now and address other crises as they arise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1696" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1022" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#Q00200"><p>Many speakers today stated that the market sets rent levels.  The problem is that when there is insufficient housing stock, house prices continue to rise and so, too, does the cost of rent.  We need to find a way to control the market.  In other words, we must ensure rents are not increased by any more than the cost of inflation.  We will be continually faced with crises in this area if that thinking is allowed to continue.</p><p>In regard to the construction of social housing schemes, the mindset that these must include social mix and so on is rubbish.  I come from a working class estate.  The problem with that estate and many other estates is the lack of facilities.  There is nothing wrong with social housing estates; the problem is the lack of facilities, including creches, schools and so on.  There are areas in respect of which social mix may work.  There are plenty of greenfield sites available.  Trying to squeeze housing estates into already populated areas is causing major problems with residents.  An example in this regard is O'Devaney Gardens, some of the residents of which have been waiting ten years for homes and are still <i>in situ</i>.  It is now proposed to invest &euro;6 million in the redevelopment of particular blocks of flats in that complex and make them available to the homeless sector.  The reality is that had sufficient houses been built, there would be more housing stock available for the homeless sector.  There is great opposition to the proposed redevelopment of O'Devaney Gardens.</p><p>The local authorities currently do not have the money required to build social housing.  There has been much talk from Government about the proposed &euro;3.8 billion to be spent on social housing but none of this funding has yet been provided to the local authorities.  Nothing is happening quick enough, be that rent controls or rent certainty.  Despite all of the promises made over the past couple of years, nothing has yet happened.  That is the problem.</p></speech>

People need to speak factually about what is happening at council level.  Planning permissions are being sought but they are being refused.  This has nothing to do with the residents, many of whom I have spoken to.  Only last week, a resident told me that she would have welcomed redevelopment in the area because it would mean her child, who has lived in the area all her life, might be eligible for one of the redeveloped properties.</p>  <p>  Last year, I was approached by a woman who had been in rented accommodation for 18 years, in respect of which she was in receipt of rent allowance.  When I asked her the reason for that, she told me that nobody had asked her to move out.  My understanding was that rent supplement was never to be a long-term solution.  In my view, it was only when landlords started taking back properties because they were in financial difficulty and needed to sell them or because they had family members who had lost their homes and needed them, that people who had gotten comfortable in rented accommodation realised they could be faced with homelessness if they did not get their names on the county council housing waiting lists.  However, what they did not realise was that their eligibility for housing is linked to the year they joined the list.</p>  <p>  I agree there is a real problem in the social housing area.  However, the biggest problem we face in this regard, in particular in the inner circle of Dublin, is land availability.  There was a time when there was plenty of land available along the Coombe bypass.</p></speech>

The issue of rent supplement and people being left long term in rented accommodation will not be resolved by councils rejecting planning permissions every day of the week.  That is the problem now.  I will give an example.  Three blocks of flats at St. Theresa's Gardens have been redeveloped to accommodate people until such time as new homes have been constructed for them.  A similar proposal was made in relation to O'Devaney Gardens but it was rejected at city council level by way of a motion put forward by the Lord Mayor of the city, which is an absolute scandal.  We should be ashamed of ourselves.</p></speech>

Will people, in particular lone parents, who obtain increased working hours and as a result move from jobseeker's allowance to the family income supplement, which is a lot more favourable to them financially, lose their rent supplement?</p>  <p>  Has the Peter McVerry Trust and Cl&uacute;id, as housing agencies, been able to access finance to purchase leases or build houses?  If not, are there are plans to do so?  Also, what progress, if any, has there been in relation to the NAMA social dividend in terms of social housing supply?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1701" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2015061000002#Q00700"><p>In regard to NAMA, I think we have done very well to get this far without having mentioned NAMA.  In regard to the social dividend to be delivered by NAMA, in my view, there was an exaggerated expectation in terms of what it could deliver and, therefore, disappointment.  Everything that involves NAMA takes an enormous amount of time.  Ms Faughnan referred earlier to the additional units in Tallaght which were supposed to be opened last month.  Another month on, there have been further delays in relation to the Tallaght issue, which is related to the points made by Deputies in relation to properties elsewhere.  There is a need for greater oversight by Government of what NAMA has and how it could be utilised.  More could be done on that than has been done.  Focus Ireland and the Peter McVerry Trust are housing associations as opposed to housing agencies.  Focus Ireland has approval from the Housing Finance Agency but has not yet drawn down any of that funding.  As stated by Ms Balbirnie, we have a significant plan to deliver our own housing.  However, it will be only a small contribution to the overall picture.</p>  <p>  Reference was made to the difference in perspective between us and the Department of Social Protection.  The strongest argument put forward by the Minister and the Department is that any increase in the rent supplement threshold will result in increased inflation.  There are two responses to that.  First, there is no evidence of that.  I have looked at the economics of supply and demand.  If one looks at what the Department has done, it is quite clear there is no correlation in that there has been a 20% to 40% increase in rents and no increase in rent supplement.  In making a policy decision which has enormous consequences for people, one requires evidence.  Second, this is not what is set down in the legislation enacted by the Oireachtas.  That legislation does not make any reference to "with awareness of the housing market", rather it provides that the maximum must relate to a person's need to provide accommodation for themselves.  There should be much closer scrutiny by the Oireachtas of the Department of Social Protection in this matter.  </p>  <p>  On the point made by Deputy Ryan, we are not saying that an increase in rent supplement would solve the problem.  One cannot as an advocate acknowledge a policy that does not solve the entire problem because the immediate response is always that there is no point bothering and so on.  An increase in the rent supplement threshold would make a significant difference.  There is a shortage of housing but the people who will be homeless next month and the month after already have a house.  Some 30% of the people who will become homeless next month and the month after will lose their homes because the rent supplement levels are not high enough.  We all may lament the fact that they have not contacted Threshold or had a chat with a community welfare officer, but the fact is that is not happening.  It is a systematic problem.  Rent supplement has not followed the legislation or the will of the Oireachtas and the result is that a significant number of vulnerable people are ending up homeless.  That is a direct outcome of the policy position that has been taken on this issue.  </p>  <p>         It needs to be recognised by the Houses of the Oireachtas that one of the dozens of things that needs to be done is to deal with maximum threshold for rent supplement.  It will not resolve the majority of cases, but it is the single biggest step that could be taken to resolve it and to allow us as organisations to get back to working together on the other issues that we need to be combining on.</p></speech>

We have not got financial approval yet, but we have taken out two loans this year through private sources to assist with our capital build.  To give a very quick example, we have been working with Threshold and a family on getting the additional moneys required to sustain them in their accommodation.  That worked for a period and then the landlord put up the rent again.  Threshold did a great job in ensuring the family got the deposit back and the month's rent in advance, because they were being asked to leave on 1 May when they had paid the rent for May.  However, we had to house a family with nine children from the Fingal area overnight because, even with the additional valuable supports from the Department of Social Protection, the landlord increased the rent again.</p></speech>

That family, on one low income, could not continue to pay that rent.  If we had been able to go with the rent supplement initiative in that case, we would have been able to go above the 20% of the housing assistance payment and we might have been able to hold them in.  I mention that case to support what Mr. Allen is saying - that the majority of those who are coming our way at the moment already have a property.  We just need to keep them in the property.</p></speech>

There is an awareness in the Department of market rents.  It is critical that we are not operating in a bubble.  The staff on the ground are aware of the market rents and they are increasing support, where feasible, to meet these rents.  For example, at present in Athlone there are only eight three-bedroom properties available to rent.  It comes back to the supply issue.  As part of the review, we looked at the costings of increasing support right across the board.  For example, if we decided we wanted to try to supply 500 extra houses in Dublin, we would be talking about an increased cost of about &euro;63 million annually.  The problem was that that would give us very little bang for our buck.  The people it would put at risk are low-income workers, who could not compete with this.  It is very much a balancing effort.  Staff in the Department have been instructed to look at market rents in the area and to meet the needs according to that.  I assure members of the committee that we will continue to roll out and to support the rent supplement initiative, on which Mr. O'Rourke is the lead person, as long as is necessary.  We will be working with the housing assistance payment homeless pilot in Dublin to ensure this happens.</p>  <p>  Deputy Naughten talked about the psychiatric side, which is very disturbing.  There is a protocol with the HSE.  There is a hospital discharge policy.  Under that protocol, staff in hospitals are supposed to get in touch with the local authority placement service, which has direct links with the Department of Social Protection, if the local authority cannot place someone.  It is crucial that local staff are working on the ground to make that happen.  For example, in the Department of Social Protection, we have a prison in-reach service, for people who are coming out of prison in similar circumstances to hospitals.  The Chair raised the issue of lone parents and jobseeker's transitional payment.  Each case would be reviewed.  If people's incomes have increased, they are working more hours and they are in receipt of the family income supplement, the rent supplement could be reviewed, but it is not a question of closing the rent.  Depending on the circumstances of the case, there may be a small reduction in the rent supplement, but, again, depending on the circumstances, if it is necessary to make an increased payment to ensure that a person stays in his or her house, that will happen.</p></speech>

The legislation is required to put the State in a position where its domestic law will be able to give full effect to the State's obligations under the intergovernmental agreement on the single resolution mechanism, thereby enabling Ireland to proceed to ratify the agreement. </p> <p>  The Bill is short.  The core points are it is to provide for the functions of the Minister and the power to spend.  These are the only aspects of the intergovernmental agreement that need to be dealt with in the draft legislation.  The remaining commitments in the agreement are binding on the State and do not, therefore, require domestic legislation to give effect to them.  Ratification of the intergovernmental agreement needs to be completed by the end of November at the latest to ensure the single resolution mechanism can become fully operational from 1 January 2016.</p> <p>  The purpose of the single resolution mechanism is to provide within a banking union context for a centralised resolution system which will be applied in a uniform fashion across all participating member states.  The single resolution mechanism is the second pillar of banking union and will ensure that if a bank subject to the single supervisory mechanism, were to face serious difficulties, their resolution could be managed efficiently at minimal cost to taxpayers and the real economy through a single resolution board and a single resolution fund financed by the banking sector.  What this means in practice is that should any of our three major banks get into financial trouble, the decision about putting it into resolution will be made by the single resolution board, rather than the domestic resolution authority.  In addition, access to funds from the single resolution fund will facilitate the use of any of the resolution tools in respect of the national banks.</p> <p>  The single resolution mechanism complements the process of harmonisation which commenced with the development of the single rule book for banks in the field of prudential supervision and the development and implementation of the single supervisory mechanism, under which significant banks are now supervised directly by the ECB.  It is an EU regulation and has direct effect.  It applies to euro member states and any non-euro member state which is admitted after appropriate due process is followed.  To date, no non-euro member states have signed up to the single resolution mechanism.  The United Kingdom and Sweden, in particular, have indicated that they have no interest in joining, whereas Denmark seems to be more positively disposed to it.</p> <p>  The target level for the single resolution fund is at least 1% of the amount of covered deposits of all credit institutions authorised in all of the participating member states and is to be reached at the end of eight years.  The figure is estimated to be in the region of &euro;55 billion.  We estimate that the contribution of Irish banks to the single resolution mechanism will be &euro;1.8 billion to be paid over the eight years, which amounts to in the region of &euro;225 million a year.  The banks&rsquo; annual contributions will be calculated on the basis of their liabilities, excluding own funds and covered deposits, and adjusted for risk.  The contributions paid will be a normal operating expense for banks, including State-owned banks.</p> <p>  The intergovernmental agreement was negotiated to enable the single resolution fund &ndash; a key element of the single resolution mechanism &ndash; to be operationalised.  It was signed on 21 May 2014.  A Government decision on 13 May 2014 approved this course of action.  It covers the member states who are participating in the banking union and also provides that where the single resolution board is, for instance, successfully sued for damages, non-participating members will be appropriately compensated.  The reason this needs to be addressed is that in such circumstances, the damages in question could only be paid from the overall EU budget rather than by the actual participating member states of the banking union. </p> <p>  The intergovernmental agreement will facilitate a gradual mutualisation of the single resolution fund over an eight year transitional period.  It will do this through the creation of national compartments within the single resolution fund into which member states will transfer the contributions collected from their banking sectors.  In practice what this means is that should a bank be put into resolution and recourse to single resolution fund moneys be needed to facilitate the resolution, the next step will be the provision of funding from the national compartment of the affected member state.  After this, where additional single resolution fund moneys are needed, funds will then be obtained from the other national compartments.  At the end of the eight year transitional period the single resolution fund will be fully mutualised, in other words, we will have a common pool from which funding will be drawn for the purpose of financing resolution actions, no matter where they happen within the banking union.</p> <p>  In summary, the main purpose of the intergovernmental agreement is (i) to transfer the contributions raised at national level in accordance with the bank resolution and recovery directive and the single resolution mechanism regulation to the single resolution fund; (ii) to allocate during the eight year transition period the contributions raised at national level to different compartments in the single resolution fund corresponding to each participating member state; (iii) to facilitate the  progressive mutualisation of these compartments in such a manner that they will cease to exist at the end of the transitional period; (iv) to prescribe how the single resolution fund can be applied during the transition period.  These changes could not be accommodated within the single resolution mechanism regulation because a number of member states argued that Article 114 of the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union did not provide an appropriate legal basis to collect funds nationally and transfer them to a European fund.  Consequently, it was agreed at the European Council that this issue should be dealt with through an inter governmental agreement which could be formally ratified in accordance with national legal requirements in due time to permit the single resolution mechanism to become fully operational by 1 January 2016.</p> <p>  As the intergovernmental agreement was adopted intergovernmentally, it is necessary for each participating state to ratify the agreement, while at the same time ensuring it has the necessary domestic legislation in place to enable it to give full effect to its obligations under the agreement.  In an Irish context, therefore, to give full effect to its obligations, there is a need for primary legislation as it is an agreement made outside the legal framework of the EU treaties and cannot be directly transposed.  The Bill is short and the core points are to provide for the functions of the Minister and the power to spend.  These are all that need to be dealt with in the draft legislation.  The remaining commitments in the agreement are binding on the State and do not, therefore, require domestic legislation to give effect to them.  Any cost to the Exchequer arising from the proposal is likely to be minimal.  In this regard, it should be noted that the cost to the banks, including those owned by the State, will be borne by the bank&rsquo;s and will not impact on the Exchequer.

With any <i>ex ante</i>fund there is no point in having funds set aside for a systemic crisis because the figure would be too big.  Therefore, one has to pitch at a certain level to deal with normal banking arrangements.  The figure of &euro;55 billion was chosen.  The fund will be called on only after a bail-in has taken place.  Under the resolution mechanism, the banks must bail in first through their equity holders and bondholders and work their way down to a certain level.  Only then can the fund be called in.  The view taken was that while &euro;55 billion might not have been enough to deal with the systemic banking crisis of recent years, in most countries it would have been enough to have dealt with any other crisis.</p></speech>

The principle is reasonable.  Banking systems can collapse in big as well as small countries.  In the event of a banking collapse in Germany, could Irish banks be put in a very difficult position as a consequence?  If the fund were to be used up entirely to prop up banks in a big country, the money would have to be replenished, an extra call would have to be made on the banks here and, consequently, the costs would somehow find their way back to the customers of these banks.  Is that correct?  Such a situation would be far more difficult for us than the other way around because big countries could absorb this better than relatively small ones with relatively small banking systems.</p></speech>

A European fund is available.  This means that if bank issues are to be resolved in another country covered by the European fund, the fund will have to be replenished by banks in countries that are not subject to resolution.  During the financial crisis it would have been to our benefit if all of the other European countries had been paying into a fund on which we could have drawn.  In the future we will have the benefit of being able to draw on a European fund in, I hope, the unlikely event that it happens again.  If a large, significant, systemically important bank in Germany or France were to be subject to resolution, there would be a bigger call; however, this is probably less likely to happen.  It is mainly smaller banks that have had issues resolved.  If it were to happen, all banks around Europe would contribute at the same percentage and annual rate.</p><p>It would not mean a systemic shock to banks in Ireland if a large bank in Germany were to be put into resolution.  It would mean Irish banks would have to make the contributions to the fund they were already making.</p></speech>

Potentially, we could have to keep replenishing the fund.  Am I right?  Mr. Carrigan might say that is unlikely to happen and that it tends to be the smaller banks that go bust, but I want to know if it is a possibility.  I do not think a very big banking collapse is impossible to imagine.  Is it possible that the money we put in is exhausted quickly and we are being asked for more and more?  Is there any end to how much we might be asked to put in if the draw on the fund was big enough?</p></speech>

Despite the nice charts we have on the steps and stairs and how it will all be euro-guided at the end of the day, is there still a risk?  Where are we on that process?

If there is still hope and life in a bank that has got into a little difficulty, a recovery plan is put in place to try to ensure there is a plan of action to address that.  The recovery plan is prepared for the bank itself.  The resolution plan is prepared by the resolution authority, which goes in, looks at the bank and the obstacles to resolving its difficulties satisfactorily, gets the bank to address those obstacles and ultimately satisfies itself that the bank is alive and well and has put everything in place to ensure a worst-case scenario can be addressed if it arises.  Senator Hayden also asked what we now know about the banks.  The benefit of this comprehensive assessment is that we now have a much greater insight into the general health of the banks.  Until now, part of the problem was that there were many banks about which people did not know very much.  A great deal of upset was caused when various things started coming out all of a sudden.  There was a lot of shock in the markets.  Now that the ECB has done an analysis of the banks, it has a much greater understanding of them.  The Senator is right to suggest that some banks have further work to do.  The ECB now knows and understands the issues, whereas in the past many of the local supervisors did not have that type of information.</p></speech>

The European Commission is charged with drawing up a delegated regulation that specifies how the single resolution board is able to invest those moneys.  The single resolution mechanism regulation specifically sets a relatively low risk tolerance for the types of investments it can made.

If there are still losses to be absorbed, there is then a move to the mutualised element of the other compartments.  It has been developed in a way that ensures the mutualisation of the compartments increases rapidly in the early years.  At the end of the second year, up to 60% of the other compartments will be used in a given situation.  If there was an Irish bank in trouble, some 40% of the Irish compartment would be used in the second year, whereas 60% of the compartments of the other banks would be used.  It will work its way through gradually until it is fully mutualised at the end of the eight years.</p></speech>

It is appears to me that this is part of the new architecture being put in place and we are really not 100% sure it will work, but we hope it will.  It appears to be a reasonable attempt to deal with what we have been through.  In layman's terms, it appears the &euro;55 billion or the &euro;1.8 billion compartmentalised for the first eight years is effectively an insurance fund.  Mr. Carrigan may not wish to use that term but it is a fund which can be dipped into in the event that things go badly in the bank.  I would love to have an insurance on my house that I only have to pay for eight years.  It appears illogical to me that we are not committed to a constant percentage of funds on deposit.  If I have money on deposit, is it reasonable for me to contribute 0.5% or 0.1% to be absolutely sure my bank remains viable?  Why is it stopping after eight years?  Is this an arbitrary timeframe in that we will have &euro;55 billion by that stage and that is the fund we regard as reasonable?  We need to get the fund up and running but thereafter is it not reasonable that banks would continue to pay perhaps a significantly reduced amount to this which would continue as an insurance fund, in effect, that they can ultimately call on?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1844" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cathal Sheridan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2015061000002#K01900"><p>As part of the negotiation of this regulation, the view was taken that &euro;55 billion was a suitable sum of money to have in place to help with resolution when it is taken into account that most banks will cover the losses through the bail-in process which is expected to absorb the bulk of losses where a bank is put into resolution.  The view is that the resolution fund is there as a fall-back position to supplement and cover any additional losses.  The view is that it will take a while to build up to that target level as it is a significant sum of money.  That is why they gave it an eight-year period.  Obviously during that period there is a possibility that money will be called from the fund and therefore the fund will have to be built up again.  I think one could probably envisage that banks will continue to pay into that fund to reach the &euro;55 billion or 1% of covered deposits at European level, whatever that happens to be in ten years time, to ensure there is sufficient money available for resolution purposes.</p></speech>

Is it really the case that when we strip down all the jargon around this that this is a political fix, that &euro;55 billion is nowhere near what is necessary?  Is it the case that we have to be seen to be doing something but in reality we are coming up well short?  If we are coming up well short why not contribute?  Why not be realistic about it and decide we need an insurance fund?  We all pay for insurance every year and not just for eight years and it could be that we would have to pay insurance again in three years time because someone drew out of the pot.</p></speech>

What we are talking about is different from insurance in that it is creating a fund that can be called on in the event of certain things happening.  The assessment of &euro;55 billion was made on the advice of the financial experts, the ECB, the European Commission and the input of all 28 member states.  Therefore the views of the 28 governments, the ECB and the European Union were that this was a reasonable sum that would be likely to cover a bank resolution situation in the most likely bank resolution situation to arise.  In the event that more than &euro;55 billion is required, there are provisions for <i>ex post</i>contributions or for back-stops, as we mentioned earlier.  It is different in its structure and in its purpose.</p></speech>

The European Commission was very strongly of the view that this could be accommodated within the treaties.  However, a number of member states had serious concerns and were concerned that there would be a legal challenge.  The very purpose of the intergovernmental agreement is to make this watertight and to protect against a legal challenge which was a concern of certain member states.  It is most unlikely that it will increase the risk of legal challenge.</p></speech>

I refer to accountability of the structures.  For example, in the case of the banking inquiry the ECB has said it is not accountable to national parliaments.  We are making financial contributions via our banks, some of which are State-owned.  What is the accountability structure for the single resolution board or is that the appropriate vehicle to account to either the national or European Parliament or to ECOFIN?  Where is the accountability structure?  We are saying we were not up to the job in terms of our own financial regulation and in a way we are pooling our sovereignty in that regard with these new structures.</p><p>How can we be sure it will manage to do its job just because it is a European initiative?  One of the ways of ensuring it will not fail is by making it accountable.  What is the accountability structure?</p></speech>

I do not have the detail of it but it as it has been established as an agency within the European Commission, it will be accountable to the Commission.  As a European body, it is accountable to the European Parliament and the Council.  Provisions in the regulation set out how it will be accountable to the Parliament.  There is also a specific provision requiring it to reply to national parliaments where they challenge it or raise questions, and to provide annual reports to national parliaments.</p></speech>

The format of today's meeting will be an opening statement to be followed by questions from members.  This is an important year with three very important meetings on development coming up, the first in Addis Ababa in July, the meeting in New York in September and the Paris meeting on climate change at the end of the year.</p><p>Much of our work and some of our sessions between now and then will focus on that because it is a template for moving forward over the next ten or 15 years.<br/><br/>I remind witnesses, members and people in the Gallery to ensure their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting.  If they are in silent mode, they can cause interference with recording equipment being used in the committee room.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  They are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>The witnesses are all very welcome.  I ask Ms Gold to make her presentation.  When that is complete, we will get members to ask questions.  I ask all three witnesses to feel free to get involved at any stage.</p></speech>

As has already been outlined, 2015 represents a critically important year for international development.  Three interlinked summits this year will determine the development framework for the next 15 years.  The first of these events is the financing for development summit in Addis Ababa, which is the third summit in the financing for development process that started in 2000 following the first millennium summit.  The second event is the critical negotiations at which decisions will be made on the post-2015 sustainable development goals.  Ireland and Kenya will co-chair these discussions, which will take place at the UN in September.  The third of the crucial 2015 events is the conclusion of the United Nations Climate Change Conference process, known as COP, which will take place in Paris in December.  Therefore, 2015 represents an exceptional year in terms of the potential for a breakthrough in international development issues and, in particular, in addressing the structural causes of injustice which keep people in poverty today.</p> <p>  The first of these negotiations will take place in Addis Ababa.  In the absence of a step change in the financing mechanisms and structures to achieve substantial breakthroughs in the sustainable development goals, those goals will not be achieved.  The three agendas this year are deeply interconnected, yet are separate.  There are interdependencies between them, but the negotiation tracks remain separate.  Today, we want to highlight four issues that we are bringing before the committee: the need for a recommitment to international public financing, in particular development assistance; debt; tax justice; and the role this committee might take in ensuring there are robust follow-up mechanisms on foot of these processes.</p> <p>  The first issue we are highlighting is the 0.7% target for public financing for development.  The scale of the ambition to meet the sustainable development goals and address climate change requires a step change in international financing.  The harnessing of new resources is a core part of this.  The international community has placed an emphasis on ways to leverage and ensure new resources to ensure the sustainable development goals.  At the same time, however, the existing commitments to official development assistance need to be honoured and met.  It is hard to put too much emphasis on this point at this stage in the delicate negotiations on financing for development.  Official development assistance is both an expression of trust in the multilateral process and a concrete commitment with practical development outcomes.</p> <p>  Developed countries first committed to giving 0.7% of gross national income to overseas development aid as far back as 1970.  This commitment was reaffirmed in 2002.  Official development assistance increased throughout the 2000s and was aligned to the millennium development goals.  Despite this, there remains a delivery gap.  Globally, just 0.3% of gross national income is spent on official development assistance.  This means that a gap of 0.4 percentage points of gross national income remains, by comparison with the commitments made to the delivery of official development assistance.  Moreover, allocations to the least developed countries continue to fall.  They fell by 5.6% in 2013 and by a further 16% in 2014.  Least developed countries rely most on official development assistance due to their limited capacity to raise domestic resources and avail of other sources of external financing.  Therefore, commitments to additional sources of public finance are absolutely critical at this stage of the financing for development process.</p> <p>  Ireland first committed to the 0.7% target at the 2000 UN millennium summit.  Ireland recommitted to this target at the review summit in 2005 and again in 2007.  Ireland's official development assistance, as a percentage of its gross national income, reached a peak of 0.59% in 2008.  We maintained our aid budget during the financial crash.  We have managed successfully to stabilise it at approximately &euro;600 million per annum.  It is to the credit of the current Government that it has managed to sustain official development assistance at this level.  However, the 0.7% target remains in the Government programme.  As the economy has picked up, the percentage of gross national income going to official development assistance has steadily declined.  We are now at 0.39%, according to the figures for 2014.  This level was last seen over a decade ago.</p> <p>  Ireland's aid programme is widely regarded internationally as one of the best in the world.  In fact, Ireland is part of a very small group of donors that remain committed to the highest quality of poverty-focused aid.  Our aid is still 100% untied.  We have one of the highest percentages of aid going to the least developed countries, which need it most.  Some 52% of our aid goes to such countries.  This means our aid has a genuine poverty focus.  Our aid remains 100% grant-based.  Given the quality of Irish aid, and the role Ireland is playing in the international negotiations on the sustainable development goals, D&oacute;chas firmly believes now is the time to recommit to the 0.7% target and to show leadership in the international community, particularly within the EU.  The Government needs to set out an annual timetable to meet the 0.7% target by 2020.  I will now hand over to Ms Eilis Ryan, who is going to talk about the debt situation and how it relates to the financing for development process.</p></speech>

I will explain why debt restructuring is critical for developing countries in an international context, with specific reference to the sustainable financing of fair development.  Many people here will be familiar with the debt crises of the 1970s and 1980s.  This is often seen as an historic issue for the developing world that has been dealt with.  Debt will be particularly critical during the Addis Ababa negotiations for three reasons.  First, approximately 14 cent of every euro that a developing country receives in aid is spent on repaying debts.  That is not a particularly effective use of aid coming from OECD countries such as Ireland.  Second, the debt crises in Africa, Asia and Latin America, which had decreased before 2006, have started to increase again since then.  As repayments have escalated, the number of countries that cannot afford to made debt repayments has started to grow.  Third, many types of new financing will be under discussion in Addis Ababa.</p><p>In particular, private financing and public private partnerships will be discussed which, in the long term, will lead to the state taking on more debt because it is effectively the lender of last resort for many essential services.  <br/><br/>In terms of civil society's position globally on how debt should be dealt with, a number of key points emerge but I wish to focus on the need for an international mechanism to deal with sovereign debt crises when they happen.  At the moment when a country enters a sovereign debt crisis, unlike a private individual or corporation, it does not have a mechanism through which it can negotiate bankruptcy.  There is always a scrambling around, with <i>ad hoc</i>solutions proposed to facilitate the debtor and also the creditor, who obviously wants some level of repayment.  Civil society organisations contend that the absence of such an international mechanism means that debt crises always escalate beyond what is necessary.  Recently an initiative was taken by the Argentinian Government to create a sovereign debt restructuring mechanism at the United Nations which received the overwhelming backing of developing countries, including all of Irish Aid's partner countries.  Including that mechanism and backing it up in the outcome document of the financing for development negotiations in Addis Ababa is essential to ensure that developing countries due not suffer under unjust debt crises.<br/><br/>The fact that there is overwhelming backing from developing countries for this mechanism provides a strong impetus for the Irish Government to show its true partnership with the countries it works with in development.  The Bolivian Government in its statement on debt in the context of the financing for development negotiations called the establishment of a UN mechanism on debt restructuring key to achieving the Millennium development goals and the sustainable development goals post-2015.  That statement was made on behalf of a group of 77 countries which includes Ireland partner countries.  In the countries in which Ireland invests the most money, particularly in terms of humanitarian spending, there are growing debt crises.  The IMF considers both Zimbabwe and Sudan to already be in a state of debt crisis.  Ireland's humanitarian spending is heavily focused on both of these countries but there is strong evidence to suggest that the effectiveness of humanitarian spending is limited when countries are in debt crisis.</p></speech>

Mobilising domestic resources is critical because tax represents the most sustainable, dependable and predictable source of income for developing countries.  It is the income that is most likely to lead to sustainable development and it is the expansion of the public purse that will underpin a state's ability to deliver on its human rights obligations.  Indeed, there is increasing recognition that tax avoidance schemes that deprive states of their ability to collect revenue represent a human rights abuse.  Any proposals as part of the financing for development agenda to strengthen domestic resource mobilisation must be focused on supporting tax systems that generate sufficient revenue, address inequality and have a redistributive effect.  They also need to be fully accountable to governance institutions that are representative of the needs of people living in poverty.  We know, and this committee is familiar with, the obstacles in place that prevent developing countries from generating sufficient revenue.  The most recent figures from Thabo Mbeki of the High Level Panel on Illicit Financial Flows from Africa puts the amount at &euro;50 billion on an annual basis.  The IMF argues that the impact of tax avoidance on developing countries amounts to as much as &euro;212 billion every year.  These numbers are huge and we need an increase in financial transparency to address this issue.  We need to change the rules of the global tax system and we need more inclusive and democratic institutional frameworks under which such changes would happen.  We also need to acknowledge that while a lot of changes in the international taxation system are happening under the OECD's Base Erosion and Profit Shifting, BEPS process, this process is not representative of the needs of developing countries and cannot address their needs and concerns.</p> <p>  There are specific results that we would like to see coming out of the financing for development process that address the issues of transparency and the rules of democratic institutions.  One is the introduction of a country-by-country reporting standard for multinationals so that we know exactly what they are doing in every country in which they operate.  We need to change the rules of the global tax system; we need to change it from the current OECD system to something that is more representative of the needs of developing countries.  We also need to establish a UN-based tax body.  At the moment the international taxation system is being governed or guided by the OECD and is not representative of the particular needs of developing countries.  We would like a concrete outcome from the financing for development process to be the establishment of a UN body to look after international tax matters.  </p> <p>  I will leave it at that for now.</p></speech>

We have tried to outline the seriousness and the interconnectedness of the three conferences taking place this year and it would be appropriate for the Taoiseach to ask a senior member of Cabinet to attend.  We would also urge the Government in the negotiations in Addis Ababa to support those modalities of financing for development which produce equitable and sustainable development results for the world's poorest.  These should include a commitment to the attainment by 2020 of the UN target of 0.7% of GNI for overseas development aid; a continued commitment that Ireland's overseas development aid is untied and focused on the poorest communities and countries; the establishment of an intergovernmental body under the auspices of the UN; and the establishment of a UN-led mechanism for resolving sovereign debt crises.  These are very concrete requests that we would like the committee to consider.</p></speech>

The issues covered are ones with which we would broadly agree and are very important.  In the context of coming up with a successor to the Millennium development goals, it is very important that issues not covered by that process are dealt with, such as climate change, governance, political rights and so forth.  There is an opportunity, in the development of new goals and strategies, to ensure that those very important issues are included this time and given the attention they deserve.</p> <p>  Regarding the role of this committee, we would naturally be very supportive of the Government being represented at the most senior level possible at the forthcoming talks.  It would also be very advantageous and beneficial if the Government was in the position to give a commitment on the timescale for reaching the 0.7% GNI target.  There has been a drop in the percentage of our income spent on overseas development aid in recent years.  I do not think there is any question of us not continuing our commitment to untied aid which has been a hallmark of Irish overseas development aid for decades.  That is a very important message to send out and we should remain, as a country, fully committed to untied aid.  </p> <p>  Regarding the establishment of an intergovernmental tax body, I totally support the views expressed on the need to minimise or eliminate tax avoidance and evasion.  At the same time, however, an intergovernmental tax body would not be an easy structure to put in place.</p><p>Every sovereign state is naturally protective of its own financial arrangements and fund-raising abilities.  If one were to take the European Union alone, taxation remains within the competence of the national governments.  If a taxation measure were to be introduced at EU level, it would require unanimity, which means that each country could opt out, thereby ensuring it would not happen at all.  I can see that is a very difficult issue, which is not to take away from the point, when we read of multinational corporations and their scandalous evasion of tax, that this irks the public greatly.  Such money could be put to good use in many of the countries where they raise serious funds for their companies and earn huge revenues, yet we see the destitution of many of the people in those countries.  The difficulty lies in trying to establish the mechanism that will not override the sovereignty of a country and its ability and competence to put in place its own taxation and fund-raising principles, but I do not take away from the general principle.</p><p> In the submissions, the point was also made that one of the desired outcomes from the Addis Ababa conference would be an adequately resourced, permanent institution.  I would like to tease that matter out further.  We have spoken on many occasions at this committee about how dysfunctional the United Nations is in many instances at present.  The architecture of the United Nations is totally outdated.  As we know, it was established after the Second World War when there was a different geopolitical scene throughout the world.  New political powers have emerged.  The structure and composition of the Security Council does not reflect the political realities of today and there is a crying need for a restructured United Nations, not just to deal with the very important issues before this committee today, but also with many other issues as well, such as responding to other crises and catastrophes that happen throughout the world.</p><p> The public has been very supportive, whether it is its appreciation of the work of different Governments over the decades in building up our overseas development aid or the huge work that is done by many in non-governmental organisations, such as those of the delegates, in promoting, advocating and putting in place services in the most deprived areas.  I do not know if the public would welcome another permanent institution.  It is one suggestion with which, on first reflection, I would have a serious difficulty.  Would there be some unit within the United Nations that could be tasked with dealing with that particular issue rather than creating a new body that will eat up more money and that will probably be dysfunctional as well?  That area would need further teasing out.  Perhaps I have taken a wrong meaning from what was proposed, but it is an issue that I would like to see addressed further.  Again, I emphasise that the United Nations in its present format needs radical restructuring to deal with many crises that are, unfortunately, constantly hitting the globe.  I thank the delegates for the presentations.  The views outlined are, in general, views that all of us could wholeheartedly support.</p></speech>

I have a bit of a difficulty with sustainable development goals, when we put them in the context of the millennium development goals.  While we see statistical improvements, we know that the reality, after many years of millennium development goals, is that we have not seen the progress and improvements it was thought they would bring about.  We still see rising inequality and poverty. The scaling-up nutrition initiative is vital and excellent, but for what are we scaling up children if they are going into famine conditions and if they are coming into situations in which they are going to be hungry as adults?  When we look at opening up access to primary education, statistically there has been success, but again for what are we educating these young people when we know the level of growth in youth unemployment?  The big one, of course, is gender equality, which was a major millennium development issue.  We know that has not been achieved.  It is, therefore, difficult to get excited about sustainable development goals when we are not coming from a brilliant position of having achieved all the millennium goals.  One positive thing is that they are going to be applied to all countries.  I am totally behind it, in particular, the climate change one and the tax.  In my opinion, those two things should have come first.  That they did not has undermined some of the work that has been ongoing.</p> <p>  I acknowledge all the work the groups have done on the tax issue.  What has been lost to the developing world at this stage is horrific and frightening.  One thing which I think has come about because of the groups' work is a greater awareness of the issue.  Whatever good it does, and I think it is positive for the developed world, there is greater awareness of how they are giving with one hand and taking with the other.  Have the groups seen any examples of good practice developing in certain African countries?  We cannot look at Africa without looking at the role of the Chinese.  We had, through the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA, the new Chinese ambassador talking to us at a meeting not too long ago.  It was very interesting to hear his perspective, but there is no doubt about the kind of loans they are making available and the rate at which they are making them available.  Will that upset the apple cart?</p> <p>  Tr&oacute;caire's recent report, Where Aid Meets Trade: Ireland's role in the changing development landscape in Africa, was excellent.  It raised questions about untied aid.  Ireland came out very well but there is no doubt untied aid is under threat.  If it comes under further threat, the sustainable development goals will be undermined.  Where will that be dealt with during the conference at Addis Ababa?  One of the aspects coming out of the report was that economic growth does not necessarily equate with a reduction in poverty.  If that is what we are really talking about, there are concerns.</p> <p>  The frequency of the reviews - at least once every four years - is not enough.  The other issue concerns the accountability of national parliaments and parliamentary democracy, in particular in developing world countries.  Unless they are supported, there will be difficulties.  I think those are all my questions.</p></speech>

As was highlighted in the recent Tr&oacute;caire report, Where Aid Meets Trade: Ireland's role in the changing development landscape in Africa, which was launched together with AWEPA, the framework for international development and the framework for development assistance is shifting very much in favour of looking at where aid can benefit the donor country.  This could be in different ways, be it through benefitting their own commercial trading interests with a particular country or as a benefit in respect of its foreign policy.  Many governments have shifted in recent years towards this new framework.  I am thinking in particular of the Australian Government which now states clearly that unless its aid is of benefit to its own national foreign policy interests, it will not be legitimate aid spending.</p> <p>  This is becoming the new norm within the development sector.  As our report stated, the Irish Aid programme has maintained its untied aid status, but it is under threat from this new dominant way of thinking and the pressures to examine the efficiencies of Ireland's aid itself.  For instance, are there possible win-wins for Irish business in its aid programme, particularly within the agricultural sector.  This is the area that is put forward as a potential area for a win-win relationship.  Certainly, win-wins are possible, but it is critical that the stated objective of overseas aid in the One World, One Future policy remains poverty eradication.</p><p>Ireland's standing internationally has been based on the principle of 100% untied aid and will continue to be based on this principle.</p><p> In the area of sustainable development, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised concerns around the expansion of the sustainable development goals, SDGs, to cover 17 different goals and 167 targets, and Tr&oacute;caire shares those concerns.  The millennium development goals, MDGs, comprised eight clear-cut targets, and for all their flaws they represented what could be achieved in terms of a global agenda, but we now have a global agenda which is so large and so diverse that it is difficult to see how it can be applied.  It is difficult to see what mechanisms could be put in place to achieve all the SDGs within a comprehensive framework.  SDGs represent the whole gamut of public policies that need to be agreed by nationally accountable democratic governments.  The fact that the SDGs have become so expansive puts the onus on the financing for development, FFD, process to deliver on the systemic drivers of poverty and injustice and on environmental sustainability.  Issues of systemic injustice in the monetary, financial and tax system will enable individual governments to deliver on the SDGs as they are applicable to their own countries.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1883" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Sorley McCaughey" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015061000002#E00200"><p>Deputy Brendan Smith asked about the establishment of a new permanent institution, and he makes a valid point.  The financing for development process already has a secretariat in place, but it is woefully under-resourced and it does not have a mandate such as we would like it to have.  It is not a question of establishing a new institution but of providing it with the resources to do its job properly, which would include generating monitoring reports, holding individual governments to account in respect of their commitments under the FFD process and generating annual reports.  At the moment very little happens between one FFD process and the next, and that is in part down to a lack of accountability on the part of the commitments that individual governments are forced to make.  It is also because there is no adequately resourced secretariat to provide the accountability and monitoring that are required to make it effective.</p> <p>  I do not think the Deputy had in mind the establishment of UN bodies when he asked about tax.  Nevertheless, although individual countries attach great importance to the sovereignty of their tax systems, it is clear that it is not working.  Individual countries are losing billions every year, in part because of the degree of competition in which they are engaged with other countries.  We have got to the stage at which tax sovereignty is so important that people do not consider the benefits that might accrue from greater co-operation in taxation matters.  Christian Aid and others have been advocating greater co-operation for a long time in parts of Africa where there are already economic blocs working in co-operation.  Greater co-operation on taxation issues would have very real benefits in maintaining and widening the tax base and enabling these countries to tax appropriately.  The system at the moment is not working and greater co-operation on tax issues is desirable.</p> <p>  I could not agree more on the question of reviewing UN institutions.  It is something Christian Aid and the broader sector have spoken about, but a review of the institutions needs to include a review of the mandate and governance structures of organisations such as the World Bank, the IMF and the OECD, all of whom have inherited or taken on hugely influential roles, particularly in the areas of finance and taxation.  We would support any calls to review institutions, but not just those of the UN.  A review would have to include the Bretton Woods institutions too.</p></speech>

It is encouraging to hear that the Irish aid programme is one of the best in the world.  It is 100% untied, and despite our difficult economic situation in the past number of years, we have managed to maintain the level at approximately &euro;600 million per annum.  All of us in this room support the various goals and objectives described by the witnesses this morning.  It is critical that our Government recommits to the 0.7% target by 2020 and that we maintain our objective to keep the aid untied and target it towards poverty eradication.  As Deputy O'Sullivan said, it is disappointing that the millennium development goals have not delivered to a much greater extent, and much greater effort and commitment will be required to ensure the sustainable development goals are delivered on.</p> <p>  Nobody referred to the fact that much of the failure to deliver as much as had been hoped for may be attributable to political instability in many of the African countries about which we are talking.  Will we not be fighting a losing battle until efforts are made to address the real issues in the region?  These issues are war, conflict, political instability, corruption and human rights abuses, and much of the resources of those countries are spent on armaments, which causes huge poverty in the various regions of Africa.</p> <p>  How would the UN-led mechanism for resolving debt crises work?  Is there any support for a UN tax body within the EU and other countries?  Do the witnesses envisage that a review of the working of various organisations such as the UN and the World Bank will be a central plank of future developments?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1885" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1126" speakername="Jim Walsh" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015061000002#E00400"><p>I thank D&oacute;chas for its submission.  Ms Gold talked about sustainable goals.  Are they too broad?  Do they need to be much more focused?</p><p>Interestingly, last week I was in New York at a meeting in the United Nations on these issues.  Sometimes, it is more about promoting an ideology then targeting and dealing with the real issues.  Interestingly, population growth often comes up.  In Europe, one of the major weaknesses, particularly in Germany and other parts of Europe, is the demographic winter that is taking place, yet we seem to target countries which are above the population replacement rate of 2.1.  If we look back at the history of the western world and economic growth, much of it came about following the baby boom which succeeded the Second World War where many of the economic drivers were because of those changing demographics in young populations.  Do we need to rethink what we are about and leave the ideological players on the sideline rather than giving them centre stage in some of these areas?</p><p> The delegations&rsquo; point about debt was well made.  Without a doubt, if one is aiding countries, as we are doing, and 14 cent in the euro of that, a significant proportion, is used to repay loans, it is like giving the aid to countries which do not need it.  I know there are issues where if people are not repaid, there will not be funding in the future.  There are issues there and we have a good example of that in Greece at the present.</p><p> On the finance side, I agree we need to have a target and reach it.  Should we be moving towards sustainable economic measures?  There is the old adage: &ldquo;Give a man a fish and you feed him for a day; teach a man to fish and you feed him for a lifetime.&rdquo;  I am not sure I see much of that in the development goals.  I might be missing it, but that message does not seem to resonate as strongly I believe it should.</p><p> With regard to tax, a point that was not emphasised is good governance.  Ireland has a good record of charitable donations and of various non-governmental organisations, NGOs, which are well supported by the public.  Where that aid money is seen to be sequestered by individuals and where there is a level of corruption which is fairly obvious, it affects people&rsquo;s willingness to contribute.  What needs to be done in that area?  Should it be a more significant part of the millennium development goals, MDGs?  I know it is difficult to interfere in the internal affairs of countries.  However, on the other hand, if considerable numbers of people are being left behind, suffering discrimination and poverty, that becomes a breeding ground for conflict.  They are all interrelated and need to be tackled in a more holistic way.</p><p> I probably would have a little difference with Mr. Sorley McCaughey on the tax avoidance issue.  Various tax avoidance schemes have been used, not just in Ireland but elsewhere, to drive particular economic sectors and have been successful in that regard.  If one does not create that wealth in the first instance, there is nothing to redistribute.  A taxation system should be fair but often there is not sufficient emphasis on how the money is spent.  We have seen it in this country.  There is not a Department that is not wasting tens of millions of euro which could be avoided with better management and if we had proper effective monitoring and controls and accountability in our public system.  Where people are contributing through taxation, money they earned themselves which is going to the State for public services, the corollary of that has to be that there is equal attention given to the efficiency of how that money is spent and ensure it is not squandered.  When we look at Third World countries, I am sure the situation with regard to expenditure is probably even worse than it is here.</p></speech>

While it is no disrespect to the Minister of State, it is disappointing it is not a Minister at a more senior level attending Addis Ababa.

All reports show it is a mixed picture in terms of delivery with MDGs.  Part of the issue around that has been the time lag it takes for a global agenda to percolate down to become a national and regional agenda.  The MDGs, it is said, took the best part of a decade to percolate down to the realignment of national policy processes.  It is quite ironic that just as the MDGs seem to have built up a head of steam and a new kind of traction to deliver them in the national context, we seem to be moving towards the SDGs, sustainable development goals.  We need to learn from the time lag process when dealing with the SDGs.</p> <p>  Members highlighted conflict, fragile states, human rights abuses, corruption and armaments.  These are real issues in many of the African countries in which Tr&oacute;caire and other D&oacute;chas members are present.  We cannot resolve all of these through a global process like financing through development or SDGs because there are context issues specific to those countries.  However, the financing for development process and the scope of the issues in terms of systemic drivers of conflict and inequality that are contained within that agenda could go far to addressing the underlying burning issues that result in conflicts, for example, resource grabs, the tax injustice that Mr. Sorley McCaughey spoke about, as well as the drivers of extreme poverty and inequality.  They are there within the financing for development agenda.</p> <p>  Senator Walsh raised a point about aid and good governance.  Aid is not the whole answer to international development.  What I sought to underline is that we do not want to move towards a new fad or trend that absolves developed countries of their existing responsibilities.  Basically, we want to avoid moving the goalposts for development finance and development aid when there is a strong need for aid to remain as a cornerstone, especially in the least developed countries.  Aid can be used carefully and very well to good effect to bolster good governance.  Some of the programme work that Irish Aid has been doing has gone far in this respect in using aid to support State credibility and using State institutions such as Comptroller and Auditor General and other institutions that enable receiving states to be accountable and increase the possibility of good democratic accountability.</p><p> On the question of whether the sustainable development goals are too broad, the reality is that at this stage, there is simply very little scope to change them.  As they are more or less agreed, whether they might be too broad or too narrow remains to be seen.  What is good about them is that they incorporate governance issues as part of the framework.  This means that those who are most concerned about issues of governance can now point to the SDGs as an additional method for holding governments to account.</p><p> In terms of the obstacles to implementation, when I consider the whole context of international development today, the main obstacle I see is the significant shift in global partnership towards the substantial use of unaccountable private entities to deliver on new global agendas.  There needs to be a shift back towards democratically elected governments and the role of public finance, in terms both of aid but also other public finance flows in terms of tax and so on, as the cornerstone of the delivery of the sustainable development goals.  What is on the table at present is very weak in this regard, and it shifts too much responsibility onto private, unelected and unaccountable multilateral institutions.  There must be a shift that would see the international agenda being put back into the hands of democratically elected governments.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1891" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eilis Ryan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015061000002#G00200"><p>I will take Senator Mullins's question in regard to the UN sovereign debt restructuring mechanism.  In an ideal world, there would not be recurring debt crises.  As long as such crises remain the reality, however, we need some way of dealing with them when they happen.  It is useful to compare this requirement with the need for personal insolvency legislation, which has become increasingly important in this country in recent years.  As long as we are in a situation where people are facing crises in terms of repaying debts, it is critical that we have in place a rules-based mechanism detailing how creditors are obliged to engage with those people.</p> <p>  In terms of what a debt restructuring mechanism would look like, the first thing we would like to see is that it be located within an independent body and, in particular, that it be independent of creditors.  The IMF, for example, is a significant creditor to developing countries and, as such, it is not appropriate for any mechanism to be located within that body.  As Mr. McCaughey said, notwithstanding the concerns people have about the UN, our view is that it is the only legitimate place within which to locate a debt restructuring mechanism.  Locating it within the IMF would be similar to locating a personal insolvency mechanism within one of the private banks.  There is a conflicted interest in both instances.</p> <p>  The second thing we would like to see is that it would be mandatory for all creditors to engage with the new mechanism.  We are hearing a lot in Ireland about vulture funds and the negative role they are playing.  Where a developing country gets into debt difficulties - we saw Argentina in that situation recently - 85% to 95% of creditors might be on board with restructuring debt, but if 2% or 3% of them are vulture funds, they may hold out and refuse to do a deal.  Taking that stance is sufficient to renew the country's debt crisis.</p> <p>  In terms of the support that exists for a debt restructuring mechanism, the proposal put through the General Assembly of the UN for such a body received overwhelming support, with 124 countries out of 176 supporting it.  That is reflected in the support for the proposal in the financing for development negotiations.  Unfortunately, however, no European country supported the proposal and there is a continuing failure to engage with the negotiations on it.  There is a clear division, in short, between European and other wealthy countries, on the one hand, and the rest of the world, on the other hand, on this issue.  We have heard from the Government that some of this is down to failed diplomacy between different countries.  Our view is that if those concerns are real, they should nevertheless not be used as an obstacle to progress.  We should not bite off our nose to spite our face.  It would be good to move past those concerns and agree that the UN is the place within which a debt structuring mechanism should be located.</p></speech>

The reality is that there is nothing at present which represents their concerns and needs.  That is the starting point.  A report issued last week by the Independent Commission for the Reform of International Corporation Taxation, ICRICT, referred specifically to this issue and how the OECD process, while it has established itself as the mechanism through which international taxation reform will happen, is not representing the needs of developing countries.  There is a requirement for an international body.  Everything in the world these days has an international representative body.  This includes everything from football, via FIFA, through to whatever one wants to name.</p></speech>

There is a need for a body that is representative and inclusive.  That is the basis on which developing countries' concerns can be articulated more effectively.  There is a demand from African countries, in particular, and other countries of the global south to have such a body established.  There is, of course, a degree of resistance among European countries to it.  It is not uniform, across-the-board resistance, but there are some who are very attached to the sovereignty of their own tax systems.  As I tried to articulate to Senator Walsh, we need to start looking at taxation less as a competitive race to the bottom and more as something that could generate benefits through mutual co-operation.  The only body in which that can happen is one that is UN-led.</p> <p>  The issue of tax avoidance might be a conversation for another day.  I will point, however, to the IMF data released last week showing that $210 billion is lost each year to developing countries as a consequence of tax avoidance.  Those numbers speak for themselves.  "Tax avoidance" is a phrase that is bandied about a lot and the concept is generally put forward as being entirely legal.  There is an increasing body of work which would question that.  We only say it is legal because we do not know if it is illegal; it has not actually been tested to see whether or not it is illegal.  It is very important to move away from the idea that tax avoidance is always legal.  There are many tax avoidance schemes with which we are all very familiar that could ultimately be proven to be illegal, but they never get the exposure we have been asking for to determine whether or not they are, in fact, legal.  This goes back to the question of transparency around the activities of multinationals.  Let us get them out in the open through a country-by-country reporting standard, which would allow us to build a bigger and clearer picture of what these tax avoidance schemes are all about.  Let them be stood up to public scrutiny to see whether they are actually legitimate in the laws of the land and in the eyes of citizens.</p> <p>  The question of how the money is spent is a very important one.  During a visit to Dublin in February this year, the UN special rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights made the observation that more than any Green Paper or White Paper, one can tell a government's real priorities by how it taxes people, who it incentivises and who it disincentives.  How a government spends its money tells one all one needs to know.  How the money is spent is the other side of how it is collected, and we need to see these two issues as very much two sides of the same coin.</p> <p>  There was a question about the role of NGOs in the Addis Ababa negotiations.  Some members of D&oacute;chas are being included in the official Irish delegation, while other NGOs will be attending in their own right.  I expect they will all be working very closely together in pursuit of many of the issues we have detailed in our paper today.  Indeed, my expectation is that there will be close collaboration between the official delegation and civil society.  Let us say it will be a collaboration that is both mutually critical and mutually supportive.</p></speech>

We could do this work electronically but there is nothing quite the same as spending time together at such a forum.  Perhaps the other witnesses also want to say something on the issue of civil society.</p> <p>  I shall finish by responding to the question on what are the main obstacles.  I fully support what Ms Gold has said.  I would add the question of follow-up.  It is one of the biggest issues in this process and many other non-binding UN processes.

The conference would be an opportunity for the Government to recommit to the 0.7% target, for example.  That is probably a more realistic expectation.  It is a question of follow-up and the adequate resourcing of the secretariat of the FfD to hold countries to account to what they say in Addis Ababa.  That will probably be an obstacle but it will also be an opportunity, if adequately resourced.</p></speech>

To come back to the issue of financing for development, once every five years is insufficient to address the systemic issues that prevent adequate financing for development.  We need the reviews to be returned to an annual basis.  We have proposed that such work is done through a resourced and mandated secretariat that would produce annual monitoring reports.</p></speech>

Ethiopia is an example to other African countries.

The Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is very happy to join our colleagues on the Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions for this important meeting.  I believe this is the first time that committees have come together in this format in this D&aacute;il so it is a first to have a joint meeting of two committees.  Perhaps we should do it more often where issues overlap.  I understand that members of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality look forward to hearing and engaging with a variety of experts on this topic in a constructive and open-minded manner.  I welcome the witnesses here this morning and thank them for their time in helping us in our considerations.</p> <p>  This is an opportunity to consider the extent to which Ireland is complying with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  We do not have a parliamentary committee on human rights as exists in other countries and this might be considered in the next D&aacute;il.  The Co-Chairman here is also a member of the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and we have established a sub-committee on human rights but have had to confine our work to justice and equality matters.  We have a great interest in these issues because of that.  I must, at some stage, go to the D&aacute;il for parliamentary questions, so please excuse me when I leave.  It is not for any other reason.  Some work there is clashing with work here.  I will hand back to the Chairman for the day and I look forward to getting involved in this.</p></speech>

We welcome a distinguished panel of experts to discuss the issues associated with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, Ireland's compliance and any factors which impinge upon its operation and implementation.  Members are keen to hear their views in this regard.  The meeting format is to invite each witness to make an opening statement of five minutes, followed by a question and answer session with members.</p><p>I welcome Dr. Brian Farrell, Dublin district coroner.  As Dr. Farrell must leave for another appointment at 11.30 a.m., he will present first.  Next will be Mr. Mark Kelly, executive director of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, then Dr. Natasa Mavronicola, lecturer in law at Queen's University, Belfast, and then Mr. Michael Finucane, solicitor, to conclude the presentation.  I welcome all the witnesses today and thank them for forwarding their presentations.</p><p>Before commencing I must inform the witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they will be entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I invite Dr. Farrell to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1917" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Farrell" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015061000002#B00400"><p>I thank the Chairman and the committee for the invitation to speak to them today.  I propose to speak about the coroner system in Ireland and, in particular, medico-legal death investigation.  I refer to the medico-legal investigation of sudden, unexplained, violent and unnatural deaths.  This concept of medico-legal death investigation includes the concept of reportable deaths, and I have provided the committee with some materials, including a list of reportable deaths which apply in the Dublin coroner's district, encompassing the greater Dublin area.  When a death is reported, there will be preliminary examination, and if there is a doctor, a medical practitioner who is in a position to write a medical certificate of death, and there are no collateral issues arising, the death may be registered on that basis.  Where the death is, or may be due to, unnatural causes, or where there are concerns in relation to the circumstances of the death, then the coroner will commence an inquiry, which may require an autopsy or other forensic investigations.  At the end of that procedure, where the death is due to unnatural causes or there are serious concerns or issues in relation to the circumstances of the death, the case must go to a public inquest.</p> <p>  At the inquest there are certain statutory findings that must be made which do not normally give much difficulty: who the deceased was, the date and place of death - the medical cause of death may sometimes raise issues but normally not - and we also look at all the facts in relation to the circumstances surrounding the death, including any acts or omissions directly or indirectly causative of death.</p> <p>  The hierarchy of legal norms in our work are as would apply to any other agency: Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann, the European Convention on Human Rights Act 2003 and statute law and common law.  Under the primary legislation of the 1962 Act, reportable deaths include all sudden, unexplained, violent or unnatural deaths, or where the death occurred as a result of negligence, misconduct or malpractice, or where the death occurred in a place or in circumstances that requires the holding of an inquest, meaning in custody, in prison, in Garda custody or at the hands of agents of the State, or where the deceased died directly or indirectly by unfair means, which is a very wide concept.  We must have a full inquiry and during the discussion we will deal with changes in practice and procedure which have occurred in recent years, especially in what might be termed Article 2 compliant inquests, taking cognisance of the European Court of Human Rights jurisprudence.  We have made practice and procedure changes, but we still must act within the remit or the scope of the primary legislation.</p><p>I will just read two sections from that, namely, section 30 of the Coroners Act 1962 which states: &quot;Questions of civil or criminal liability shall not be considered or investigated at an inquest&quot;.  Section 31(1) states: &quot;Neither the verdict nor any rider to the verdict at an inquest shall contain a censure or an exoneration of any person.&quot;  An inquest is neutral and inquisitorial.  It cannot blame or exonerate but at the same time must establish all the facts surrounding the death and bring in an appropriate finding and a verdict.  There is an optional or discretionary power to bring in a rider or recommendation designed to prevent further fatalities occurring in similar circumstances.<br/><br/>The word &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo; will loom large in our discussions later on.  In the primary Act, the Coroners Act 1962, there are numerous mentions of the word &ldquo;circumstances&rdquo;.  I have provided the committee with a list of some recent case law.  Before I speak about the Eastern Health Board case in 2001, in the Attorney General case in 1998 the Supreme Court elucidated the public policy considerations underlying the holding of an inquest in the following terms: to determine the medical cause of death; to allay rumours or suspicions; to draw attention to the existence of circumstances which, if unremedied, might lead to further deaths; to advance medical knowledge - we will say something about that presently; and to preserve the legal interests of the deceased person&rsquo;s family, heirs or other interested parties.<br/><br/>There was an important <i>obiter</i><i>dictum</i>in the Eastern Health Board case, which I need to read into the record.  The Chief Justice said: &quot;The prohibition on any adjudication as to civil or criminal liability should not be construed in a manner which would unduly inhibit the inquiry.&quot;  That would be because such an inhibition would not accord with the public policy considerations relevant to the holding of an inquest.  The Chief Justice went on to say: &quot;It is clear that the inquest may properly investigate and consider the surrounding circumstances of the death, whether or not the facts explored may, in another forum, ultimately be relevant to issues of civil or criminal liability.&quot;  This is a very important <i>obiter</i><i>dictum</i>arising out of that case.<br/><br/>In relation to Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights, in addition to the substantive obligation to protect life, there is an adjectival or a procedural obligation on the State to investigate deaths which may amount to a breach of the positive and negative obligations in relation to the protection of the right to life.  The procedural obligation means an effective, independent investigation.  In the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, as interpreted in the Middleton case in England, which is the only other common law medico-legal death investigation system in the European Union, in addition to the Irish situation, the House of Lords said, in the absence of full criminal proceedings, and unless otherwise notified, a coroner should assume that his inquest is the means by which the state will discharge its procedural, investigative obligation under Article 2.  That in fact and in practice has been accepted in Ireland as well.  The procedural obligation in Ireland is primarily served by the inquest, but it may also be satisfied by criminal proceedings, a full trial, a tribunal of inquiry or a commission of investigation into the death, so the inquest is not the only means by which the obligation may be satisfied.<br/><br/>The jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights would say that the <i>indicia </i>of such an inquiry would include promptness, thoroughness, and compellability of witnesses.  The scope was also looked at in the Middleton case, which reviewed the jurisprudence of the court and said that the scope was by what means and in what circumstances.<br/><br/>In common law jurisdictions as opposed to European mainland civil law jurisdictions, there is a public hearing, which is the inquest, with involvement of the next of kin.  Middleton and the other jurisprudence also said there ought to be a conclusion on disputed factual issues, which would form part of the findings, and to be effective it ought to lead to a determination of whether, for example, fatal force used was justified in the circumstances or that appropriate procedures were in place to prevent the death occurring and were followed in the circumstances surrounding the death.<br/><br/>I point the committee to the Magee case where the Supreme Court found that legal aid was not available for inquests.  That case went to the European Court.  There was a friendly settlement between Ireland and the court which led to the Courts and Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013, which now provides legal aid and legal advice for inquests, subject to certain conditions.  We obviously have to take cognisance of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights, as interpreted by the other common law jurisdiction, but we must look at our practice and procedure within the remit of our domestic law.  We have made a considerable number of changes in procedures which I will perhaps go into presently in relation to the procedure adopted at inquest.<br/><br/>The difficulty really arises on the net point of the findings and the verdict.  I think it was Middleton in interpreting the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights in relation to the inquest in England and Wales which said there ought to be, in appropriate cases and if so proven on evidence, a finding of systemic failure or systemic neglect and also perhaps in some cases, where so proven, a verdict of unlawful killing.  Unlawful killing is a verdict that is available in Ireland but it is usually brought in in circumstances of deliberate homicide and the verdict is often qualified by &ldquo;person and persons unknown&rdquo;.  It appears that would pose a difficulty under the law in Ireland which prohibits any verdict that would blame or exonerate any individual human person or a legal entity.<br/><br/>I would like to revert in a moment to changes in practices and procedures that have come in in Ireland in recent years.  Suffice it to say that we are anxious to and do establish all relevant facts in relation to the circumstances of such deaths and expose that evidence to public scrutiny.  We look forward to the reintroduction of the Coroners Bill 2007 and the development of coroners rules of practice as recommended by the coroners review committee in 2000.</p><p>We also look forward to developments in the structure of the Coroner Service and to the High Court and Supreme Court's exegesis on the constitutional right to life under Article 40.3.2o of Bunreacht na h&Eacute;ireann and Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p></speech>

He may be of assistance to us during later stages of the hearing.<br/><br/>I congratulate the joint committee on raising this issue as a topic.  It was a pleasant surprise to receive the invitation.  This is a matter about which the ICCL has been preoccupied for quite some time and it is refreshing to see Oireachtas committees taking the initiative to engage directly with civil society and other experts.<br/><br/>We are preoccupied by the question of Ireland's compliance with Article 2 because, on a reading of the Strasbourg jurisprudence and a comparison between it and the practical and legal situations in this country, there are serious deficits.  In my opening remarks, I hope to unpack briefly some of the considerations that are set out in our statement and, more specifically, to talk members through the essential components of what Dr. Farrell referred to as the procedural obligation on the State under Article 2.<br/><br/>I will give a bit of background.  This European Court of Human Rights case developed a number of years ago.  As it had its origins in cases arising in the neighbouring jurisdiction on this island, it is good that the committee has expertise from Northern Ireland to draw upon this morning.  Essentially, the Strasbourg court became frustrated with sets of circumstances in which there were serious allegations of people dying as a result of the use of lethal force by agents of the state but in which there had been no effective official investigations, which meant that it was difficult to attribute responsibility for the deaths.<br/><br/>The Strasbourg court did something that was quite novel.  Rather than it being placed in the position of having to redo the work of the state in establishing the truth every time there was a serious allegation of torture, ill treatment, a killing or a death as a result of medical negligence, it decided to take a different approach and establish whether state authorities had taken the necessary steps to carry out a proper investigation.  The Strasbourg court has gone into the forensic detail of what the component elements of an effective investigation are.  As a result, we and legislators are able to benchmark our laws and practice against the requirements of the Strasbourg court.<br/><br/>There are four principal requirements, which I will go through briefly: independence; effectiveness; promptness; and transparency.  The Strasbourg court has given a specific meaning to each.  First, it is clear in case law that, for an investigation to be Article 2 compliant, the people carrying it out must be independent of those who may be implicated in the death.  For example, it is not acceptable for police officers to investigate a death allegedly caused by police officers.  A further example that we might revert to later is that it is not acceptable for the HSE to investigate a death in which medical professionals employed by it might be implicated, as that would not constitute independence.<br/><br/>Second, Dr. Farrell touched on an aspect of effectiveness.  According to the Strasbourg court, the investigation must be capable of leading to a determination of whether the force, including fatal force, used was justified under the circumstances.  Regarding an aspect that Dr. Farrell did not mention, the court referred to the identification and, if appropriate, punishment of those concerned.  Members might be able to see some of the nature of our concerns about the effectiveness requirement.  While it is true that an inquest in combination with certain other actions, for example, civil actions, may explore much of the territory of an unexplained or unlawful death, it is most unlikely that those proceedings, separately or cumulatively, will lead to a situation in which there can be identification and, if necessary, punishment of those concerned.  I should say that this is a discussion that my colleague, Mr. Finucane, may go into in more detail.  The Strasbourg court stated that this was an obligation, not of result, but of means.  In other words, there is no expectation that, simply because someone is alleged to have been ill treated or killed by a police officer or to have died as a result of medical negligence, there must be someone punished for it at the end of the investigation.  Rather, in the obligation of means on the state, there must be an investigation that is capable of leading to a determination one way or the other.<br/><br/>Effectiveness also requires that all reasonable steps be taken to secure evidence concerning a death that is suspicious in any way.  Eye witness testimony must be taken, forensic evidence must be gathered and, where appropriate, there must be an autopsy with a complete and accurate record of injury and an objective analysis of clinical findings, including the cause of death.  All of these fall under the second criterion of effectiveness.<br/><br/>Third, the investigation must be conducted in a prompt and reasonably expeditious manner.  There are a number of reasons for this criterion, not least being the fact that the value of forensic findings can decline over time if the investigation is not done quickly.  However, there is a further, more fundamental and human dimension to this, as outlined in the well-known European Court of Human Rights case, Finucane <i>v</i>. the United Kingdom, in which the Strasbourg court said in clear terms that it cannot be assumed in the event of delay that a future investigation can usefully be carried out or provide any redress, either to the victim's family or by way of providing transparency and accountability to the wider public, because the lapse of time, the effect on evidence and the availability of witnesses may inevitably render such an investigation an unsatisfactory or inconclusive exercise that fails to establish important facts or to put to rest doubts and suspicions.  An investigation must be done properly.  Otherwise, and for all sorts of human and medical reasons, it may not work if justice is denied or delayed.<br/><br/>The fourth requirement for an Article 2-compliant investigation is what the Strasbourg court has called transparency, by which it means that there must be a sufficient element of public scrutiny of the investigation and its quality in order to safeguard the legitimate interests of those concerned, specifically the legitimate interests of the next of kin in cases of death.  It is not acceptable to the Strasbourg court for investigations to take years during which the family and next of kin are effectively kept in the dark about what is happening.  The failure to keep the next of kin properly briefed on what is happening can, in itself, amount to a potential violation of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.</p><p>My time is nearly up, but we will have more time together to unpick these questions.  When one overlays the four requirements of independence, effectiveness, promptness and transparency, there are two principal concerns that surface immediately for the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  First, there is the issue of the speed of or lack thereof in investigations into deaths in custody.  There have been a number of very high profile cases, including those of Brian Rossiter, Terence Wheelock and other names that will be familiar to the committee, in which it took many years to reach rather inconclusive results.  This raised questions under Article 2.<br/><br/>On the second issue, more specifically in the context of the matter raised by Dr. Farrell, given that our coronial legislation is now 52 years old and has not been reformed in the same way as in neighbouring jurisdictions, it is the view of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties that, <i>de facto,</i>in the case of persons who die in circumstances that give rise to inferences of medical negligence, there is no effective remedy available in this jurisdiction which is capable of complying with Article 2.  Even if we were to travel a certain distance with Dr. Farrell, along the road of considering that cumulatively an inquest and civil proceedings could amount to a vindication of rights under Article 2, there is another problem.  This procedural obligation amounts to a proactive obligation on the State, which is why it is so important Oireachtas committees are examining this matter.  It is the State that must take action to comply with Article 2 in terms of a set of circumstances in which responsibility is bounced back to the family who are told that an inquest may not vindicate their rights under Article 2 but that they can always initiate civil proceedings.  In the view of the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, that is simply unsatisfactory and it is all the more unsatisfactory when the regular pattern is that not only must the family take the initiative to bring civil proceedings but they will be fought tooth and nail through the courts year after year by expensive senior counsel paid for by the taxpayer.  That is our view and we are happy to explore it further with the committee.  <br/><br/>I thank the committee for taking up this matter.  The Irish Council for Civil Liberties is of the view that the position in this jurisdiction is that there is an undeclared violation of Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights because of shortcomings in the speed of investigations and coronial proceedings.  It would be very positive if committee members, as legislators, were to proactively look at the matter and bring back onto the agenda the Coroners Bill 2007 which has languished on the Order Paper for such a long time, as well as looking at other measures that might be taken.</p></speech>

As some elements of my opening statement might involve repetition, I apologise in advance.  I am grateful to the previous two experts for giving an eminent account of aspects of obligations that arise under Article 2.<br/><br/>I will go back to and recount the obligations that arise under the heading of right to life under the European Convention on Human Rights.  A number of state obligations flow from that article, or in combination with Article 1, of the convention which provides that, &quot;The High Contracting Parties shall secure to everyone within their jurisdiction the rights and freedoms defined in this Convention&quot;.  The negative obligations arising consist of duties to refrain from certain actions.  There is a duty not to intentionally take life and a duty not to use potentially lethal force.  There are narrowly carved exceptions to these obligations which include taking action in defence of any person against unlawful violence in order to effect a local arrest but the force used must be no more than what is absolutely necessary.<br/><br/>Positive obligations constitute duties to take positive action to respect, protect and fulfil the right to life under the convention.  There are general, operational, investigative and redress focused obligations which are intermeshed under Article 2.  General obligations consist of framework duties to protect the right to life by law and through establishing appropriate institutions and mechanisms for the protection and prevention of the unlawful taking of life.  Operational obligations involve duties to take positive steps to protect particular individuals from real and immediate risks to life, as well as duties to plan operations in life endangering circumstances in a way that will minimise the risk to life.  Investigative obligations involve duties to investigate suspicious deaths.  Such obligations have been explored in some depth, but I hope to unpick them even more.  Redress focused obligations encompass duties to secure redress through compensation and-or, potentially, the criminal process or, at least, through the capability of initiating proceedings leading to a criminal process for breaches of the right to life.  These obligations are often cited in connection with Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which deals with the right to an effective remedy. <br/><br/>I will further unpick the investigative obligations.  The components of an Article 2 compliant investigation were unpicked predominantly in case law linked with Troubles-related deaths by the European Court of Human Rights.  They include the following requirements.  The authorities must act on their own initiative in initiating an investigation on their own motion; the investigation must be independent and impartial <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the potential individuals involved in the taking of life or any negligence involved in the loss of life; the investigation must be effective; the investigation must be reasonably prompt and proceed with reasonable expedition; the investigation must be sufficiently open to public scrutiny and it must also sufficiently safeguard the interests of the next of kin.<br/><br/>I want to zoom in a little on some failings which have led to findings of breaches of the investigative duty under Article 2 in regard to Troubles-related deaths.  In the McKerr group of cases adjudicated on by the European Court of Human Rights in 2001 a number of systemic shortcomings in Northern Ireland were identified in the fulfilment of the investigative duty under Article 2..  They included: a lack of independence of the police officers investigating loss of life from officers who were, potentially or actually, implicated in the incident; a lack of public scrutiny and sufficient disclosure and information to the victim's family; the fact that the inquest procedure at the time did not allow for any verdict or finding which might play an effective role in leading to a prosecution for any criminal offence; the non-disclosure of witness statements to the applicant's family; the fact that public interest immunity certificates relating primarily to public safety or national security prevented the inquest from examining relevant matters and documents in finding out the circumstances surrounding the loss of life; the non-compellability of essential witnesses, including central figures involved in the taking of life; the lack of prompt commencement and reasonable expedition; the lack of investigations, in some instances, into allegations of collusion by agents of the State in the taking of life; and the lack of legal aid, an issue which has been mentioned, for representation of the victim's family and the safeguarding of their interests in the proceedings.  <br/><br/>Following these cases, a package of measures was instituted to remedy the deficiencies identified.  They include the Historical Enquiries Team; the ability of the Police Ombudsman to carry out Article 2-based investigations into grave matters; reform of the coronial system; changes in the giving of reasons not to prosecute; options to provide for judicial review of such decisions; and the establishment of the Inquiries Act 2005.<br/><br/>Shortcomings and concerns subsist in Northern Ireland about these measures which are in a state of flux.  However, I want to highlight a few aspects which might be informative and, I hope, meet the purposes of the committee.  <br/><br/>Delays constitute an issue of long-standing.  There is a lack of reasonable expedition in investigations into Troubles-related deaths.  This stems from a number of factors in Northern Ireland, including prolonged delays in the disclosure of relevant information, institutional limitations, limited resources, etc.</p><p>Interestingly, recently the Council of Europe's Commissioner for Human Rights indicated that the UK remains in continuing breach of its obligations under Article 2 in failing to conduct reasonably expedited and prompt investigations as well as effective investigations.  Nils Muiznieks indicated that the UK Government could not justify these failings on the basis of limited resources.  Another long-standing issue is barriers to truth recovery.  The non-disclosure of documents that are essential to identifying the circumstances of the loss of life has been a significant barrier to truth recovery in investigations into Troubles-related deaths.  Barriers to truth recovery and to delays to the investigative process involve redactions or delays or attempts to issue public interest immunity certificates.  While after the reform - witnesses are now compellable in inquests in Northern Ireland - a compellable witness may decline to answer any question tending to incriminate himself or herself or his or her spouse and this is also in conjunction with human rights against self-incrimination in various proceedings.</p><p> Another long-standing issue remains the independence and impartiality of the mechanisms instituted to investigate suspicious deaths.  Concerns have been raised by different bodies and actors with regard to proceedings by the Police Ombudsman, in respect of the historical inquiries team.  In addition, in the coronial system, the process of appointing a jury is anonymous so the vetting of jurors for any issues of bias is impossible.  There are also ongoing concerns regarding the independence and effectiveness of public inquiries.</p><p> I reiterate the point about effectiveness which has been raised by the other two speakers.  In the European Court of Human Rights case law this principle of effectiveness is tied to identifying whether there has been a breach of either of the positive or the negative obligation under the right to life.  In instances where lethal force was used, for example, it is to find out whether it was no more than absolutely necessary and justified in the circumstances and as the court has put it, to identify and potentially punish those responsible, an obligation not of result but of means, but one which requires the investigative process to remain capable of leading to prosecutions.  This raises some tensions between truth and justice in the view of many transitional justice experts, notably, a tension between mechanisms targeted towards encouraging witnesses to come forward in order to divulge the truth about certain controversial events on the one hand versus the capability of potentially leading to a prosecution of some of these individuals.</p><p> Recently, the European Court of Human Rights has indicated that the investigative duty under Article 2 is in fact related to a framework of criminal, civil, administrative or disciplinary proceedings which are capable of leading to the identification and punishment of those responsible.  It said that this principle of investigation operates to the exclusion of other types of inquiries that may be carried out for other purposes, such as establishing an historical truth.  This is quite a controversial statement from the Grand Chamber of the European Court of Human Rights which seems to prioritise justice perhaps over truth with regard to the investigation of takings of life.  We are not sure how this will entirely crystallise for Northern Ireland and Troubles-related deaths.  However, what we know is that the passage of time and the continued delay and barriers to truth recovery continue to militate against finding out the circumstances of a number of Troubles-related deaths.  Therefore, this is a non-exhaustive but still a very lengthy outline of some of the issues of concern relating to compliance with Article 2 in Northern Ireland.  I remain at the disposal of the committee for any questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1925" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Finucane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015061000002#F00200"><p>I wish to begin by adding my thanks and congratulations to the committee in taking the time to examine this very important but sadly neglected issue.  My experience is primarily in the field of representation of bereaved families at inquests.  I acknowledge that some of the people I represent are here today to observe these proceedings.  If the previous speakers have given the committee what might be called the bird's eye view I will try to give a little bit of the worm's eye view and explain what it is like to be involved in an investigation with reference to the developments that have taken place in Strasbourg but also in Ireland.</p> <p>  It hardly needs to be said that death is something that affects everyone.  At some point in our lives we all experience it, sometimes very directly and sometimes in traumatic and violent circumstances.  However, in all deaths every family deserves the best possible investigation, the most thorough investigation and the most effective investigation possible.  They deserve it without having to ask for it.</p> <p>  There are some things that in Ireland the inquest system has done well for families over the years.  In a small country where communities were intimately related and co-existing, features like empathy and informality served people very well, by offering them an additional support mechanism at a time of trouble in their lives.  However, the problem with this type of system is that it often depended very much on the nature of the individuals involved in the investigation.  If one was dealing with sympathetic investigators who thought as if they were in the family's shoes, then often the outcome would be regarded as welcome by the bereaved people.  In simple terms, when the circumstances of the death or the case at hand might be described as straightforward, then the system was good and met the needs of the bereaved.  However, when it was not so straightforward, when difficult questions had to be asked of people in positions of responsibility and obligation, then the Irish system rated poorly, in my view.  Questions that might be asked, for example, of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, where a person died in police custody, were often met with great resistance, delay and lack of information being provided to families, forcing them into the position of seeking redress in the courts.</p> <p>  In that regard, one case that I would point to and which is referred to in my paper - the Ramseyer case - ended up in the Supreme Court simply as a result of that family's request for information about the investigation into the death of their relative.  It is worth singling out the Ramseyer case because it was not a case involving the use of lethal force by a police officer or member of the armed forces.  Thankfully, those cases are relatively rare in Ireland because we do not have a uniformly armed police force.  The Ramseyer case was where someone died in a domestic incident at home but the family members were very unhappy about the nature of the police investigation.  It is recorded in the judgment of the Supreme Court that the family felt that foul play might be involved.  However, the Garda investigation was so deficient at the time that the family felt that perhaps vital evidence had been lost.  They ended up going to court because the coroner declined to provide them with copies of statements and information that he had collected from the garda&iacute; in the course of their investigation so that they might prepare themselves for the inquest.  There is no right to information contained in the Coroners Act 1962.  There are no rights to many other things and, therefore, one is left in an example case such as this case, which is not straightforward and may well be controversial, with having to seek redress in the courts because the legislative framework does not provide one with what one needs.  In a nutshell, that is the problem with the Irish system as it stands.</p> <p>  Interestingly, the Ramseyer family also considered, although did not follow through with proceedings in respect of another aspect of the Coroners Act, a little-known provision which stipulates that where a coroner is sitting with a jury, the local garda&iacute; shall function to assemble that jury.</p><p>A Garda sergeant is tasked with the duty.  It is not difficult to understand how a difficulty might arise in a case where the investigative forces in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are also responsible for assembly of the jury which will adjudicate on the facts.  Whatever about the anonymous assembly of juries, that one could prove problematic and may lead to litigation into the future.</p><p> If changes are to be made, a useful and effective benchmark against which Ireland might measure its new legislation and legislative framework will need to be found.  This is where Article 2 comes in.  The beauty, for once, of the legal judgment from a superior court is that the criteria be not only easy to understand but can be applied mechanically.  It is not difficult to determine whether a particular investigation meets the requirement of public scrutiny, is effective, prompt, independent or involves the next of kin and family to the maximum extent possible.  It is not difficult to determine whether the State is being sufficiently proactive in fulfilling its obligations to provide bereaved people with an effective, prompt, independent investigation that is capable of establishing all of the facts.  Given that we have clear benchmarks that are capable of being applied in order to assess whether the standard is met, we should grasp the opportunity.</p><p> The case law from Strasbourg originated, more or less, as a result of the quartet of judgments in 2001 referred to by previous speakers.  The court, particularly the superior court in England and Wales, has grasped the initiative and developed the jurisprudence and concepts contained within them at breakneck speed, certainly by legal standards.  We have a really useful, well developed and well researched bank of case law, practical experience and procedural diagrams upon which our own legislative framework could be based. </p><p> As stated, the Coroners Act dates back to 1962.  Fifty plus years is way too long to leave legislation as important as that go unamended.  It needs to be brought up to modern standard.  However, given the wealth of information that is available to us at this point in time and given that much of the heavy lifting has been already done by our neighbouring jurisdictions, we are probably at a point where we could not be better equipped to embark on the reform process.</p></speech>

Before I open up the meeting to questions from members, it is important that I clarify that the issue of Article 2, taken in conjunction Article 1, does not only pertain to deaths at the hands of State agents and so on but to all deaths in suspicious circumstances.  This is really important in terms of the current debate in Ireland.  For example, an independent review panel of barristers is currently examining more than 300 allegations of Garda malpractice.  In fairness, a section of them may not amount to anything but we are all mindful that a number of them relate to deaths, in respect of which families feel they were failed in terms of the investigative procedures.  This is a big deal in terms of families and their access to justice and a judicial system that works and leads to them having the answers they require.</p></speech>

Dr. Farrell referred in his presentation to the importance of families being able to get answers.  The point was made that people dissatisfied with an outcome have to seek a judicial review as opposed to having a right of appeal.  I would welcome Mr. Kelly's view on that point.  I imagine that in many cases people not want to appeal but there would be cases in respect of which people would like to do so.  It appears to me that people have to go to an awful lot of bother to access that which would appear to be a natural entitlement in many other types of court cases.</p> <p>  In regard to the shortcomings in this jurisdiction, as described, are the witnesses proposing the deletion of section 30 of the 1962 Act?  Perhaps they would elaborate on what in their view we need to do to be compliant, with particular focus on a person's innocence until such time as he or she has been through full and proper criminal proceedings and the competing interests in that regard.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1929" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015061000002#G00400"><p>The Deputy has raised three different issues, including the satisfaction or dissatisfaction experienced by families.  Mr. Finucane referred earlier to the Ramseyer case, which ended up in the Supreme Court simply because the family was not satisfied with the information they were given.  Our experience from contact with families, including in some of the high profile cases that rumbled on for years, was that sometimes the underlying reality was that an investigation was being conducted as expeditiously as could be reasonably expected because it was a complex investigation.  The problem that arose was around communication.  Often, because people were not kept informed, they became extremely distressed, and understandably so, and formed all sorts of theories about what might or might not have happened to their loved one in custody, which were in fact unfounded and, ultimately, were found to be unfounded.  Irrespective of future legal reform, there is need for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and its investigative agencies to think through how they can keep families better informed about the investigative process.</p> <p>  In regard to the actions that are available to next of kin who are actively dissatisfied and may have reason to be dissatisfied with the quality of an investigation, the current situation is flagrantly not in accordance with Article 2 of the European Convention on Human Rights.  Let us take a recent case that has been very troubling for a number of people, the tragic death of Savita Halappanavar.  It is very clear that her widower is extremely dissatisfied with the action that has been taken to investigate her death and to vindicate his rights.  A plethora of steps have been already taken, including a HSE clinical review and a HIQA review.  Civil proceedings and so on are also under way.  Yet, Mr. Halappanavar is not, in his own words, finding within our current system an effective means of vindicating his rights.  My contention would be that even the civil proceedings that are currently active are extremely unlikely to do that.  Essentially, where ever a family member or next-of-kin turns - Mr. Finucane may have further views on this - they are likely to find that avenues of potential redress are closed off to them.  The point made by Dr. Mavronicola is also extremely important.</p><p>We not only need to look at Articles 1 and 2 but also at Article 13 of the European Convention on Human Rights on the right to an effective remedy.  Article 13 is usually read together with other substantive articles.  When one looks at the two together in this context, it is our view that first, where next of kin are concerned, there is not currently a process that is compliant with Article 2 and, second, nor is there a means for them to have effective remedy in that context as required by Article 13.  It is a serious situation. <br/><br/>The Deputy's last question raises an issue on which the entire session could probably be spent, namely, what should replace the current framework?  Section 30 of the 1962 Act is a difficulty as it blocks the attribution of responsibility.  There is the Coroners Bill 2007, which was an effort to put in place a more modern framework for coronial investigations.  It has been languishing on the Order Paper for many years now.  It needs to be looked at again because in the meantime, as Mr. Finucane was saying, there have been other developments in Strasbourg <i>jurisprudence</i>and as a result of supreme court cases in neighbouring jurisdictions.  That would be a good starting point. <br/><br/>The Deputy is absolutely right that whatever procedural obligations there are in terms of the rights of the next of kin, there are also procedural obligations of fairness in respect of the attribution of responsibility to particular, named police officers, doctors or obstetricians.  It is absolutely essential that any reform that is brought forward also strikes an appropriate balance in that area.  It is a very technical matter which might be best approached in the framework of draft legislation.</p></speech>

I will not give any specific details.  They are very aggrieved that they have had no information.  Their loved one died in suspicious circumstances and they have had no feedback at all over recent years.  As this case is a live investigation, the whole system seemed to shut down, even in terms of the Criminal Injuries Tribunal and the coroner.  There is a whole range of issues.  Listening to their case, it seems the system is just not working for them.  There are other families with similar experiences.  </p> <p>  It is only in recent times that the issue of Article 2 as read in conjunction with Article 1 has come to my attention.  It was a revelation and I am really pleased that we are here today to consider it in more detail.  In my view, it is a profound failure.  The Coroners Act has been in place since 1962 - over 50 years - and it is now eight years since the Bill that was supposed to modernise it was initiated.  I hope we can kick start the whole debate again through this hearing and begin to put in place a system that deals with the four tests Mr. Kelly talked about.</p> <p>  This is a long-winded way of getting to my question but I have the luxury of being able to do that as Co-Chairman.  I want to get a sense from the witnesses of what they would ask the Minister for Justice and Equality to do, if they were sitting in front of her now.  Could they name three key things she should initiate by way of addressing this area and bringing us into compliance with those articles?</p></speech>

Although it is clear there are deficiencies in the system which need to be addressed, we held 666 inquests last year and, by and large, we have a positive interaction with the public.  Obviously, we try to continue to improve the system.  In regard to the other question----</p></speech>

That is my point.</p></speech>

That is different from stating that the system has failed.  As I said, we have quite a positive reaction from the public overall.  More needs to be done; we need the new Act and we need coroners' rules.  We actually produced draft coroners' rules in 2002, which were published but have never been taken up in statutory instrument form.</p> <p>  Within the context of the existing law, we have made a lot of practical and procedural changes to try to meet the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.  Our investigation is independent.  It is not always as prompt as we would like, but there are issues that would hold back the promptness.  There may be criminal inquiries, matters may go to the criminal courts, etc.</p> <p>  We have compellability and we involve the next of kin as best we can in our investigations and inquests.  Legal aid has been provided.  We have put in pre-inquest hearings so that submissions may be made by the families or by their legal representatives.  Those submissions have to be considered by the coroner who must give reasons for his or her decisions.  We provide witness lists and the pre-release of documents is now common or even standard at all inquests, not just at Article 2-compliant inquests.  When I was appointed in the early 1990s, documents were not released at all.  We now have a situation whereby in most cases, especially where they are requested, documents will be made available.</p> <p>  In respect of the scope of the circumstances of the death, we are looking at the jurisprudence of the Supreme Court and we have a provision for expert evidence to be made available to in the inquest.  We vet the jury and, in any European so-called Article 2 inquest, we would empanel the jury, or GSOC might empanel where the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might assist us in serving the summonses.  We grant adjournments and we have provision in practice for narrative verdicts addressing issues and concerns.  We have the discretion to bring in riders and recommendations which would be addressed to the appropriate authorities.  I am glad to say that we get responses increasingly expeditiously from public authorities to recommendations we have made.  There has been movement on the ground.  However, we need the new Act and coroners' rules as well.</p> <p>  I have not answered the Co-Chairman's questions, I am sorry.  I am just commenting.</p></speech>

We have carried out many inquests in respect of deaths in custody.  We have made many recommendations about things like suspension points in prisons, ligature policies, unstructured release of persons on temporary release and the question of investigation of the scene in prisons.  My experience is that we have investigated these matters.</p> <p>  Our difficulty is the net point.  When one sees some kind of breakdown of the regime in the prison, the law will not permit us to bring in a verdict or words to the effect of "system neglect," much less "unlawful killing" on an institutional basis.  Identification of particular members would offend against fair procedure and natural justice.  An inquest is not a trial.  The European Court of Human Rights has said one of the principal functions is to place all relevant facts on the public record and to bring those facts into public scrutiny.  We are endeavouring to do that, but we need to compare our practice and measure it against the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights.</p></speech>

Let us suppose the members of the deputation were in front of the Minister for Justice and Equality.  What three issues would you ask her expedite to bring us into compliance, as you see it?  We will start with Mr. Kelly and then work our way around.</p></speech>

It is clear that it is required.  I am keen to make clear our view that Dr. Farrell at the least is doing everything he can possibly do within the framework of the current legislation.  The current legislation constrains him and there is no imputation of any sort in anything else that we might have said.  The first point is to bring forward the legislation.</p> <p>  The second matter is the question of the provision of information to families and next of kin, specifically during investigations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That needs to be looked at and systemised.  To come back to my response to Deputy Mulherin, in itself that measure could avoid a great deal of stress and anxiety.</p> <p>  The third thing is that some positive action has been taken by the Director of Public Prosecutions to look at the giving of reasons in cases in which there is a decision not to bring forward a prosecution in respect of a suspicious death.  That is a positive practice.  The potential to expand the giving of reasons and expand, perhaps, the quality of the reasons given is something that might be looked at.  That experiment has been running now for some time.  Again, one might look to the United Kingdom experience where that is concerned.</p></speech>

Perhaps you could respond to both questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1943" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Natasa Mavronicola" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015061000002#J00800"><p>Certainly.  Some of the points made by the previous speakers tie together some of the things I wanted to bring out.  Reference was made to the deaths of people in custody.  One important thing to remember is that positive obligations of the State are amplified in a prison context.  This arises because of the situation of vulnerability and helplessness of the prisoner on the one hand and the position of control that the State exerts upon the prisoner on the other.  The duties to investigate are particularly important within the prison context to learn about potential breaches of positive obligations as well as potential breaches of negative obligations in instances in which State agents might have used lethal force in an unlawful manner against a particular person in custody.  Moreover, they are vital if we are to learn lessons about how to minimise situations in which deaths in custody will occur in future.  The European Court of Human Rights and domestic courts in the United Kingdom place a strong or strict onus on the state to investigate thoroughly any of the circumstances surrounding a death in custody, including death by suicide, etc.</p> <p>  This leads me to the three points I would like to flag to the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The central point that needs to be put forward is the need for a cumulative set of mechanisms to address Article 2 compliance.  This is relevant from the perspective of the investigative duty, predominately, but also in respect of other positive obligations, such as the framework duty to protect life, as well as the negative obligation whereby the relevant people need to establish circumstances in which the State might have actually exerted lethal force against individuals.  The cumulative set of mechanisms is necessary in part because of some of the tensions raised by Deputy Mulherin in respect of criminal justice safeguards in certain contexts.  Particular mechanisms will fulfil different functions and benefit different individuals or processes, either with a single benefit or a combination of benefits.  Mechanisms can vary from being victim-oriented to next-of-kin-oriented, establishing the facts for the purpose of the family's understanding and satisfaction that a transparent investigation into the death of a loved one has occurred.  However, certain mechanisms need to be criminal-justice-oriented or redress-oriented in a different fashion to realise several remedies in an alternative context - for example, where something short of criminal liability is established or where something like negligence is established.  These two angles may not necessarily be fulfilled by one single mechanism like the coroner's inquest.  Therefore, the criminal-justice-oriented mechanisms will potentially end up being fulfilled through an independent criminal investigation, which may leading to a decision to prosecute by the Director of Public Prosecutions.  That criminal investigation could then take place with the requisite safeguards, such as the privilege against self-incrimination, etc.  This is something worth keeping in mind in putting forward reform.</p> <p>  Another aspect or angle of certain investigative mechanisms is the reform-oriented aspect.  This relates to the idea of learning lessons from potentially systemic failings and then reforming the system to avoid such failings in future.  Mechanisms such as independent and effective inquiries could potentially lead to something like that, with a broader reform-oriented benefit.  Of course, such inquiries would have to be thorough, effective and independent to attain these goals.</p> <p>  My second point to the Minister stems from the first point about a cumulative set of mechanisms.  These mechanisms should be capable of potentially communicating with each other.  The institutional mechanisms should be capable of communicating with each other, but with the requisite safeguards for independence and to ensure a defendant's rights are respected.  This is happening, to some degree, in Northern Ireland, given that coroners are able to contact the Public Prosecution Service for Northern Ireland if they believe that there might be a cause to investigate the possibility of a prosecution.  In addition, these mechanisms should communicate in so far as is possible with the next of kin of the potential victim of the taking of life.</p> <p>  My final point arises because the issue of resources has surfaced frequently in Northern Ireland in respect of reform of the system and the fulfilment of investigative duty.</p><p>What has emerged from some of the statements here is that it will ultimately be cost-effective to reform the system to ensure it functions in an effective and efficient manner.  It will arguably reduce litigation and, if effective, will reduce incidents in which breaches of the right to life occur through learning lessons to deter unlawful taking of life.  In that way I believe the long-term cost-effectiveness of reform is definitely visible.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1945" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Michael Finucane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015061000002#K00200"><p>If I was asked to suggest three things to the Minister for Justice and Equality that she might consider for change, the first thing I would suggest that she begin the process of repeal and reform of the 1962 Act as a matter of urgency.  She should begin a process of consultation with all relevant agencies affected by that process and be prepared for a great deal of resistance.<br/><br/>Surprisingly, and maybe even counterintuitively - not from the institutions one might think - in my experience of dealing with inquests and post-death investigations, some agencies and institutions have moved a huge way towards accommodating the process of post-death investigation where a connection with that agency has been identified.  For example, An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has moved a huge distance in providing information and being more open in its engagement with post-death investigations.  It also has assistance from GSOC, which provides cover in terms of independence, expertise in logistics and so forth.  There is perhaps less movement with regard to the prison system because it does not have an ombudsman.  There is a prison ombudsman in Northern Ireland and one for England and Wales.  I think there is one for Scotland also.  There is none here.  There is an inspectorate, but that is a review system and is not the same as an investigative ombudsman.  That should probably be looked at in terms of providing not only assistance but also reassurance to both the prison system and the public that investigations are occurring on an independent footing and are capable of being prompt and effective and creating meaningful change.<br/><br/>Perhaps surprisingly, I would expect to see considerable resistance in the medical sector.  There can be no more difficult post-death investigation than trying to find out what happened to a relative who has died in a hospital.  That might seem like a shocking statement, but I remind everybody here of the recent cases of infant deaths in maternity units in which the Minister for Health subsequently went on the record to say that families were lied to by the health authorities charged with responsibility for mothers and babies in those hospitals.  If people can lie to a family in a maternity situation, anything is possible.  One of the great incentives for reforming the system of post-death investigation would be to remove the likelihood that anyone would get away with that sort of behaviour, thereby creating an incentive to co-operate with an investigation rather than frustrating it, because at the moment the nature of the investigation is very much in the eye of the beholder.  Bereaved relatives may get lucky and find out what happened, or maybe they will not.  At the moment the health establishment has many barriers behind which to hide.  One that was changed recently was the <i>in-camera</i>rule in courts.  The confidentiality of medical information was hidden behind the <i>in-camera</i>rule in order to prevent disclosure of important and sometimes troubling information in many cases, which is not why the <i>in-camera</i>rule was devised.<br/><br/>That is the sort of institutional resistance we will experience, and there will be others, but it has to be met and accommodated.  I am not saying anyone should necessarily lose the ability to be on speaking terms with a particular institution, but these difficult conversations need to take place.  Going through a post-death investigation is difficult, but if there is an objective at the end of it to try to improve things, which may involve assigning responsibility, then we would be on the road to a great improvement in the system.<br/><br/>The second thing I would suggest to the Minister is to review how the Coroners Act is framed and how certain statutory provisions are worded.  For example, sections 25, 30 and 31 all refer to what the coroner must not do, including things that cannot be examined and findings that cannot be made.  This sort of preclusive language is not helpful for post-death investigations.  The new legislative regime needs to invest a great deal more discretion in coroners, who may decide to delay things, decline to release something or postpone the public examination of a particular area for good reason.<br/><br/>One of the problems in the current legislation, which may even come up against a successful challenge in Strasbourg, is that the language is absolute.  A long criminal investigation by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, for good reason or bad, precludes an inquest, and this can result in delays of literally years with no information being provided to family members and no scrutiny of the processes in public.  For example, the examination of a file in the Office of the Director of Public Prosecutions - how it happens, when it happens and why it takes so long - is never subject to public scrutiny in a Coroner's Court because the Director of Public Prosecutions never appears in the Coroner's Court.  A family simply sits and listens to the recitation of section 26(2), outlining that while a criminal prosecution is being contemplated the inquest cannot proceed, and that is it.  A coroner has no discretion in the matter.  When set against the absence of information as well, that is a problem. <br/><br/>My third suggestion would be the development of binding codes of practice to address the way in which coroners' inquests function throughout the country.  I have appeared in Dr. Brian Farrell's court many times.  It is obvious to anyone appearing in his court that the standard he applies is the high watermark of inquests within the current framework.  I was involved in the Ramseyer case, and at the same time as I was going to Dr. Farrell's court asking for information and getting it, I was also litigating the point on behalf of the Ramseyer<i></i>family because of the refusal of a coroner outside Dublin to give me any information.  I had another experience in County Kerry in which the local coroner initially refused to give me information, but after some correspondence and prolonged discussion, I eventually got the information I was seeking.  That sort of variation in standard practice remains a problem today.  The uniformity of investigation standard needs to be addressed.  It is no good have an excellent investigative service in Dublin when everyone else outside Dublin is dependent on getting whatever they can manage or whatever some local legal representative is capable of digging out of the local coroner with extreme and unnecessary effort.  It needs to be standardised.<br/><br/>Ultimately, the incentive for the Legislature and the Government is that if this is not addressed, somebody will end up in Europe getting a ruling and then the Oireachtas will need to legislate under pressure.  There are far too many cases of deaths and far too many deficiencies in the system for it to be left unaddressed any longer.<br/><br/>Savita Halappanavar may have focused attention on the nature of post-death investigation, and that may not even meet the Article 2 standard.  However, that case got what it got in terms of independent investigation and experts brought in from outside Ireland, because it was a matter of world news interest and the health authorities felt a level of pressure they had not felt previously.</p><p>There are many more cases out there.  Many more people are affected.  They will not even get what the Halappanavar family got.  If that is deficient, then how many more potential Article 2 problems are out there?  I would say there are a lot of such cases.  There is no ruling against Ireland at the moment.  This is another reason that now is the time to steal a march on a problem that may well be coming down the line.</p></speech>

I apologise for having to leave in the middle of the meeting, but I was needed in the D&aacute;il.  This is an extremely serious and important matter.  We will be sending these transcripts and the associated material to the Minister and to the Department to urge them to advance this issue.  We are nearing the end of this D&aacute;il, unfortunately.  We do not know how long is left in it.  This is certainly something that has to be taken up and moved on.  There is no doubt about that.  I thank the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions, Deputy Mac Lochlainn, for proposing that we have a joint meeting of his committee and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  This is the first time the two committees have come together in this D&aacute;il.  It is something we need to do a bit more of.  I think this has been the D&aacute;il of committees because there has been so much work going on in committees and so many people have come to the justice committee and the other committees.  It is a way of working, getting things done and engaging with experts like the witnesses who are in attendance today.  We really appreciate that they have given up their valuable time, which is important to them, to come here today and help us with this issue.  I hope we will see results at the end of this process.</p></speech>

I was struck by his reference to the fact that legal aid has been available in certain circumstances or conditions since the 2013 Act was introduced.  What are those conditions?  What are we talking about there?</p></speech>

First of all, under the 2013 Act the coroner has to certify whether a particular inquest will attract legal aid.  The relevant conditions are set out in subsections (a) to (h).  Subsections (a) to (g) really speak for themselves - they relate to deaths in prison or Garda custody, etc.  There is no difficulty with that.  Subsection (h) is quite wide and allows for free legal aid to be granted where the coroner forms a view that the death occurred in circumstances that are potentially "prejudicial to the health or safety of the public or any section of the public".  We have to certify the inquest to the Legal Aid Board, which then has to adjudicate on the case on the basis of a means test.</p></speech>

I would be concerned about that.  In other situations in which legal aid is used, people get legal aid over and over again.  They appear six months later and get legal aid again.  I am concerned about what happens in this regard in the case of a death in custody.  What kind of means are we talking about?  Are the same criteria that are used in other criminal-----</p></speech>

I am not sure what goes on with the Legal Aid Board.  We certify the inquest as being suitable for legal aid.  It is then a matter for the Legal Aid Board.  This has been running since 2013.  We have not yet really seen how it is operating in full.</p></speech>

As a rural Deputy from outside the Pale, I am concerned about what Mr. Finucane said about the lack of standardisation in this area.  Is he saying to me that what people get in Dublin is generally better than what people get elsewhere in the country?  Is that his experience?  Was he just using the case in County Kerry as an example?  As a representative of Longford-Westmeath, I would be concerned that people outside the Pale are not getting what people inside the Pale are getting, as a rule.</p></speech>

Until the Supreme Court issued the Ramseyer decision in 2006, no one could go into a coroners' court nationwide and assert a right to information in advance of an inquest.  Therefore, it depended on whose court one was in.  In the case in question, I was dealing with the acting coroner for County Offaly, who refused to give me any information.  That would not have happened in Dublin.  I do not think it would have happened in a number of other coroners' districts around the country.  I know that in other areas of the country at the moment, coroners are not opening inquests or investigating deaths pending the full outcome of criminal proceedings.  That has become a matter of dispute between myself and other lawyers on the one hand, and the coroner charged with the investigation on the other hand.  I do not think that practice would be adopted in Dublin.  All of that has to be set against the background that Dublin has the largest concentration of people in the country.  As there are 1.5 million people living in Dublin, there are more deaths and there is a need for better resourced and a more well-established system.  I suppose that has to be taken into account as well.  However, there is no reason certain basic minimum standards should not be adopted within that framework.  I am afraid my opinion would be that such standards are not being applied uniformly on a nationwide basis.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I would like to welcome from the EPA, Mr. Dara Lynott, deputy director general, and Dr. Brian Donlon, research manager.</p> <p>  I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise witnesses that any submission or opening statements they have made to the committee will be published on the committee website following the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I call on Mr. Dara Lynott to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I will provide a short opening statement and then I will be happy to answer any questions that committee members might have.  If I cannot answer them today, I will provide written answers later on.</p><p> The EPA is an independent statutory body.  It was established in 1993.  We have a wide range of responsibilities, including the regulation of large-scale industrial and waste facilities, monitoring and reporting on the state of the environment, overseeing local authority environmental responsibilities, co-ordinating environmental research in Ireland and, recently added, radiological protection.  The main role the EPA will have with regard unconventional gas exploration and extraction, UGEE, projects will be its regulatory role through the integrated pollution control licensing process, whereby a licence will be required for onshore extraction of shale gas on a commercial scale.  The EPA does not have a regulatory role at the exploration stage of these projects but the agency will be a statutory consultee with respect to any environmental impact assessment, EIA, conducted by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources in assessing any applications it might receive for exploration licences.</p><p> The agency has also commissioned and is administering a joint research programme co-funded by the EPA, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Northern Ireland Environment Agency into the environment aspects of UGEE, in particular, hydraulic fracturing of shale gas, on behalf of a steering committee comprising the EPA, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, the Geological Survey of Ireland, the Commission for Energy Regulation, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, Northern Ireland Environment Agency, the Geological Survey of Northern Ireland and the Health Service Executive.  I will discuss these roles in more detail presently.</p><p> We are responsible for the development, co-ordination and management of environmental research in Ireland.  We have fulfilled this role since 1994.  Our research is focused on major environmental challenges and the provision of policy-relevant analysis and solutions research.</p><p> In May 2012, we published a small-scale study entitled, Hydraulic Fracturing or 'Fracking': A Short Summary of Current Knowledge and Potential Environmental Impacts.  This small-scale study provided an introduction to the environmental aspects of fracking, including a review of regulatory approaches used in other countries.  The main findings included the importance of well integrity for preventing groundwater contamination, the importance of a knowledge of local geology regarding potential impacts on groundwater quality, the uncertainty regarding the carbon footprint of shale gas and the small number of published peer-reviewed scientific studies in this area.  This preliminary research project and a public consultation in 2013 were used to finalise the terms of reference of a more comprehensive research programme.  The UGEE joint research programme began in August 2014 and is scheduled to be completed in July 2016.  It is funded by a number of agencies.</p><p> The research is being undertaken by a consortium of independent organisations, comprising CDM Smith, British Geological Survey, University College Dublin, Ulster of Ulster, Queens University Belfast, Foster Wheeler and Philip Lee Solicitors.  I have provided more detail on each of these members in appendix A in the document provided to committee members.</p><p> This joint research programme is designed to produce the scientific basis to assist the assessment of environmental impacts associated with high-volume hydraulic fracturing or fracking in Ireland.  The programme of research will assist regulators North and South in making informed decisions about fracking.  Ministers in Ireland and the North have publically stated that the issuance of fracking licences will be dependent on the outcome of a thorough independent investigation of potential impacts on the Irish environment being completed by this consortium.  This precautionary approach to fracking is unique to Ireland.  The research will not replace or diminish the need for any of the statutory processes needed to seek permission for a fracking licence or development.</p><p> There are five main areas to this research.  These include the impacts on surface waters, groundwaters and ecosystems; the impacts on seismic activity; the impacts on air quality; international operational practice and impact mitigation; and regulatory regimes for fracking in different countries.  This research project will examine the potential health impacts derived from impacts on environmental media, for example, exposure to chemicals, vibration, light, noise as well as pollution of soils, air and water.  The project will also examine the prevention of environmental factors from degrading human health.  The consortium will explore the potential role of health impact assessment in the regulation of UGEE projects based on the experience in other countries.  Recommendations will be made towards developing a protocol in Ireland.</p><p> No hydraulic fracturing will be undertaken as part of this joint research programme.  This is a comprehensive programme of research and there are many elements to it.  At present, there has been good progress on the UGEE JRP.  However, I emphasise that no report has issued from the EPA regarding this research programme other than periodic status updates provided to the other funding partners.  The latest status report has been included in the documentation provided to the committee as appendix B.  This provides an update on the progress of each task as set out in the terms of reference, dated 22 April of this year.  The final report will be made publically available on the EPA website.  Further details on this research programme are available on a dedicated website referred to in the documentation.</p><p> The licensing role of the EPA is restricted to class 9.1 of the first schedule of the EPA Acts.  This covers the extraction, other than offshore extraction, of petroleum, natural gas, coal or bituminous shale.  Any proposed project involving the commercial-scale extraction of shale gas would, therefore, need to apply to the EPA for, and be granted, an IPC licence to operate.  Any licence issued for such an activity would also regulate the environmental aspects of any hydraulic fracturing operations taking place as part of the extraction facility.  No such application has been received by the EPA to date.  Any application received in future will be assessed on a base-by-case basis in accordance with the requirements of the EPA Acts.  Key environmental issues to be addressed in any future application include potential for groundwater contamination from methane migration, the impact of any chemical additives to the fracking fluid, treatment and disposal of flow-back fluid, greenhouse gas emissions and water usage.</p><p> Research reports commissioned by the EPA are intended as contributions to the necessary debate on the protection of the environment.  Further research is required to fully understand the potential impacts on the environment from the use of this technology.  The key questions this research needs to answer are whether this technology can be used while also fully protecting the environment and human health, and, if so, what is best environmental practice in using the technology.  The question of whether the existing EU environmental regulatory framework is adequate for unconventional fossil fuels projects is also being addressed.</p><p> This joint research programme aims to inform policymakers and other stakeholders on a range of questions in respect of environmental protection.  The research programme will result in a series of reports that will help regulators North and South in coming to an informed decision if and when a licensing application is received for UGEE in the coming years.  I hope I have given the committee an overview of this project and I am happy to answer any questions committee members may have.</p></speech>

Given that the EPA is at such an early stage in this research, we are somewhat limited in the type of information that we can extract from the agency.</p><p>The appendices have been helpful in that regard.  I wish to focus on Appendix A, about which I am sure my colleagues will have something to say about also.  </p><p> There is serious concern about the involvement of CDM Smith in the research project.  The note on the company's activities fails to acknowledge that it has been heavily involved in fracking in the USA and Europe, most particularly in Poland, as well as Ukraine.  I have read the contents of its website and comments made by its CEO and it seems that the company is, at best, in sympathy with the concept of fracking.  In that context, serious questions must be asked about its independence.  I ask the delegates to address that issue because from an initial reading of the EPA's notes on CDM Smith one would not get the impression that the company had been involved in fracking operations.  I am sure others will quote from press releases issued by the Love Leitrim group which is actively involved in anti-fracking activities in County Leitrim and expressing alarm in this regard.</p><p> Another issue of concern relates to submissions on the terms of reference.  I am a little confused because the Love Leitrim group has stated the study, as it stands, does not answer the question as to how it will look at the issue of health but focuses on the second section of its terms of reference relating to best practice in regulating the gas industry.  However, from what I had read of the EPA's documents, I was satisfied that the health implications of fracking would be part of the research.  I, therefore, ask the delegates to reassure the committee on that point.  I made a submission at the time and raised the matter at the committee because it was a serious omission from the terms of reference and the EPA, in correspondence I had received, had acknowledged that health was a matter that would be looked at in the study.  In its submission the EPA also makes reference to health.  I, therefore, ask the delegates to clear up the confusion in that regard.</p><p> On the progress made in undertaking various tasks, the EPA states one task is nearly complete, namely, A1, an "assessment of existing baseline monitoring (best) practices, including water quality aspects, the location of existing monitoring points with specific regard to geological/hydrogeological conditions to inform best practice for an island of Ireland geological context ... This assessment should also make reference to the legislative requirements to develop an environmental monitoring programme."   The EPA makes the point that it would not be involved in the regulation of fracking were it to happen here.  Is that correct?  The presentation document states the, "EPA does not have a regulatory role at the exploration stage of these projects".</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1982" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dara Lynott" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015061000002#L00200"><p>I will take the last point first.  </p> <p>  The EPA does not have a role in issuing an exploratory licence.  It is not intended as part of the research that exploratory drilling for hydraulic fracturing will take place, rather in the first task to which the Senator referred we have carry out an assessment of how much information we have on groundwater in the area.  To pull it back a little, the EPA has a role in assessing groundwater quality in Ireland.  We report on a regular basis to the European Union on the quality of groundwater.  As part of that process, the EPA has sunk wells all over the country to fill in knowledge gaps in order that we can obtain a national picture.  However, for this type of research and particularly because it is focused on shales in counties Clare and Leitrim and parts of Northern Ireland we need more information on groundwater than we would need for a national programme.  First, we need to ascertain how many groundwater wells are there, what state they are in and whether they are usable.  Then, through the steering group, we propose having "X" number of wells.  These wells will tell us where the groundwater is, its depth and volume, in what direction it is flowing and assist in obtaining an accurate, underground picture of the groundwater in the area.  There is no exploratory drilling associated with hydraulic fracturing as part of this research.  If there was to be exploratory drilling, the researchers would have to obtain a licence from the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, but that Department has stated there will be no exploratory drilling licences issued until the research has been completed.  The expected date for completion of the research project is 2016.  Once an application is made in respect of the commercial drilling of shale beyond exploratory stage, those involved will have to come to the EPA for a licence.  At that stage we will have a regulatory role, but that is beyond this research period up to 2016 and exploratory licensing which will happen within a particular period of time.  After the exploratory phase, if hydraulic fracturing is commercially viable as determined by those involved, they will have to come to us and a number of other regulatory agencies to go through the normal regulatory processes.  </p> <p>  On the health implications, our view is that the issue of health is part of the study.  As I said in my opening statement, the health impacts associated with pollution of environmental media are definitely part of the project.  That means the level of air, water, vibration and noise pollution will be assessed as part of the project.  It will also look at how a health impact assessment has been utilised in other countries in dealing with this type of project.  We will have a fairly good handle on the health impacts associated with environmental pollution of the various media involved.</p> <p>  The Senator referenced CDM Smith, which is a very large consultancy firm.  Like many large legal and accountancy firms, it has a lot of clients and provides advice on a wide range of issues.  It is part of a much wider consortium which includes the Geological Survey of Britain, University College, Dublin, the University of Ulster and Philip Lee Solicitors, among others.  In our tender we deliberately went looking for experience in this realm.  The tender document stated: "The proposed project team is expected to include members who have comprehensive understanding of geology and hydrology, as well as an in depth knowledge of a range of legal, environmental, health, socio-economic and technical issues, as well as knowledge of mineral and fossil fuels (preferably unconventional gas) extraction practices and technologies".   We looked for people with experience in this area, but we went through an open tender process which involved 27 people from 14 or 15 organisations in assessing six bids from various consortia to conduct this very important research valued at &euro;1.25 million.  That independent group came to the view that CDM and its consortium was the best.  All of the consortium members were required to sign a conflict of interest form, which they did.  We are happy that the group conducting this research is eminently qualified to carry it out and will do so in a peer-reviewed, independent manner and that the research will be fit for purpose.</p></speech>

Having said that, I do not think we should be here.  This is a personal as well as a political issue for me.  Senator Paschal Mooney lives close to the area most immediately threatened by fracking, but I practically live in it.  I know the real fear people have as we discuss the matter coldly and scientifically.  I am not a scientist or an engineer, but I am a person who is passionate about the beautiful unspoilt landscape of north Leitrim and County Fermanagh.</p><p>One could not have picked a more beautiful part of the country to set out to destroy and it hurts me that members are obliged to sit here and discuss mechanisms that might tell them it will be all right to destroy this landscape and to destroy the livelihoods, health and well-being of those who live in this landscape.  This is why I believe members should not be here.</p><p> The request to submit expressions of interest was sent out by the Government's predecessor and I must state that had I been in the Oireachtas at the time, I certainly would have tried to block it.  There was no public discussion and no D&aacute;il debate over it.  I have used freedom of information requests, parliamentary questions, telephone calls and meetings with civil servants to try to establish what was the trigger to issue those advertisements seeking expressions of interest.  I cannot get such a trigger point and one need not be cynical to assume that somewhere in the midst of all that off-the-record discussion and debate, extensive lobbying was going on in behalf of the energy industry.  I find it extraordinary that those requests for expressions of interest and exploratory licences were issued in the dying days of the previous Administration, not just here but in Stormont as well.  That is not and cannot be a coincidence.  There is a puppeteer with a hand up a glove some place in all of this.  I simply have not been able to identify what person, company or companies are lobbying the group and who is the puppeteer in this regard.  I will park this issue now for the present.</p><p> Mr. Lynott has used the word "independent" at least four, if not five, times in his presentation.  CDM Smith is a cheerleader for the fracking industry and no reasonable person will place any credit in any report for which it is leading the consortium engaged by the Environmental Protection Agency, EPA, in this regard.  It is on the record as being cheerleaders for the fracking industry and neither I nor anyone else will place the slightest credibility in a report that comes out from a consortium led by CDM Smith.  It was an extraordinary decision to engage CDM Smith and I do not care what it has signed as that is what it does.  This is what its shareholders expect it to do, namely, to get fracking into Europe, the United States and Ireland.  That is how it makes its money.  It is not doing this for what it is getting from us or from Stormont, which it would regard as a pittance.  Are these people acting in the interest of those who I represent in the north west of Ireland or are they acting in the interests of their shareholders?  The answer is clear.  What I consider to be extraordinary is that any Government agency would expect the likes of me and the people I represent to believe it could be independent as it cannot.  I do not care how many Chinese walls are in place; Chinese walls are paper walls.</p></speech>

First, how can the EPA expect that reasonable people will treat the report that will emerge from this process eventually as independent when the project is being led by cheerleaders for the fracking industry?  Please tell me more than they have signed an undertaking, because that does not answer the question.  How can reasonable people be expected to believe this will be independent?  Are not two people, who formerly were in the British Geological Survey, working with Tamboran Resources, which has one of the licences here?  I realise this will entail additional work for the joint committee but I will be asking that the EPA comes back before it because although the report is dated 26 April, I only received eight days ago.  It is just me and a man from County Kerry and I need to talk to many different groups that were involved in this matter to analyse what the joint committee has received thus far.  For example, it does not state which consortium companies are doing which modules of the work.</p> <p>  Mr. Lynott spoke about the health impact assessment but is will that be a public health impact assessment and who will be carrying it out?  There is no reference to the already-existing body of peer-reviewed medical information and I am informed there have been 400 different reports within the past 12 months of which 170, if not more, have been peer-reviewed.  It is clear that a huge effort is being made by the fracking industry and by political supporters of that industry to get this introduced throughout the world.  I have just received word in the course of this meeting that thankfully, the European Parliament has voted in favour of an amendment calling on member states not to authorise fracking until it can be proven to be safe for the environment and health.  That is very welcome.</p></speech>

Its sole role is the protection of the environment for the people of Ireland.  We have been doing research for a long time and commission research where there are complex issues coming down the line that need more information to allow everyone to come to an informed view or decision on them.  We were the first to come through, with a 2012 preliminary study, to try to carry out literature-based research on all the available data and studies that exist.  Moreover, from that we developed a scope of work on which we subsequently went out for public consultation.  We have a robust and independent system, which is the same system we have used for all &euro;74 million worth of research we have commissioned since 2007.  Since then, we are relying on 27 people from An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Commission for Energy Regulation, the Departments of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of the Environment in Northern Ireland, the EPA, the Geological Survey of Ireland, the Health Service Executive and a number of universities.</p><p> We relied on those 27 experts to go through all six tenders - there was not just one tender, there were six - to identify who was most appropriately suited to carrying out this research.  We relied on them to use their best judgment in an unbiased way.  This is publicly-funded research, it is not research commissioned by private industry.  The money for the project is being invested by the Environmental Protection Agency, the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources and the Northern Ireland authorities.  We must ensure that this research is peer reviewed and robust.  We have a steering group comprising a number of independent, publicly-funded individuals who come together and use their best knowledge to determine whether this research stands up to scrutiny.  Ultimately, the latter will have to be the case because it will not be published anywhere unless it is peer reviewed.  I reiterate that no hydraulic fracturing will happen as part of this research.  No exploratory licence will be granted until this research is completed.  All regulatory processes will come into play if and when some private entity decides to become involved.</p><p> CDM is one part of a large consortium which includes Philip Lee solicitors, Foster Wheeler, UCD and British Geological Survey.  Its role is to co-ordinate this research.  CDM is a significant player in environmental consultancy worldwide, employs 5,000 people and it consults on every aspect of the environmental impacts of projects.  We are satisfied that the process we have undergone was robust.  The process of peer review and oversight by the steering group is also robust, designed to ensure that the research will stand up to scrutiny.  We are of the view that it will provide answers in respect of the questions we have put forward.</p></speech>

It contributed to a report for the German federal ministry in 2012 in which it was recommended that hydraulic fracturing should not be banned but that its application should only be allowed with strict regulation in place and should be accompanied by intensive administrative and scientific supervision.  Moratoria subsequently implemented were independent of the study in question and responsibilities of the individual states.  One member of the consortium, therefore-----</p></speech>

People are concerned that this work is being done in order that a checklist can be provided in respect of aspects that must be monitored and measures to be put in place to minimise any potential impact.  However, they fear that what is being worked on is something that will indicate that provided certain actions are taken, fracking can safely proceed.  If neither Dr. Donlon nor I can look at the companies involved in the consortium and say that there is not a single instance where one of them stated that in the case of a particular installation - again, not to mention a country - it would be wrong to allow hydraulic fracturing to proceed.  When I refer to hydraulic fracturing, I mean UGEE.  I have also become used to calling it fracking.  There is not even one installation in respect of which any of these companies stated that the latter should not be allowed to go ahead.  In global terms, this country is a small garden in the Atlantic.  If we poison a bit of it, we will poison it all.  It will not matter to those in the Chinese market who are buying infant formula from this country if the water in the north west is poisoned.  All they will do is stop purchasing our milk products.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.1999" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1177" speakername="Denis Naughten" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015061000002#N00700"><p>I thank the representatives from the EPA for coming before the committee.  I have an interest in this matter.  The main focus is on Leitrim and Fermanagh but the former shares a border with north Roscommon.  If fracking is to take place, it will probably will be expanded outwards because the geology of north Roscommon is very similar to that of Leitrim and the entire Lough Allen basin.</p> <p>  Hydraulic fracturing is very new technology and that is probably why there have been very few peer-reviewed scientific journal articles published in respect of it.  I wish to ask a number of questions but before doing so, I wish to pursue a particular matter.  Is it not the case that what we are doing with our counterparts in Northern Ireland in this particular field is unique?  Am I correct in stating that it has not been done anywhere else in the world?  The results of this research will be extremely significant because not only will it have implications in respect of fracking in Ireland, it will also have major implications for fracking throughout the world in the future.  The latter is the case because research of this nature has not been carried out to date.  In other words, there is not a body of research available which reflects that which is going to be produced here.  Whatever the outcome of the research - and subject to it being properly peer reviewed - it will be extensively quoted, probably for generations, as the litmus test with regard to whether fracking should take place or the conditions under which it should take place, not just in Ireland or Europe but across the globe.</p> <p>  A number of questions arise.  I recall attending a presentation in Dawson Street at which some of the key researchers in this area were brought together.  The major issue which arose at that event related to well integrity, which, based on the research that has been carried out to date - limited though it may be - is the single biggest threat in respect of fracking.  As a result of the fact that this is a new technology and because the wells involved are relatively new, how does the EPA analyse the long-term implications of well integrity?  Does it consider the example of the storage of radioactive material in the UK in this regard?  Such material was stored to a certain standard a number of years ago but now the UK has been left quite literally with a time bomb.  How does one go about trying to make these particular storage facilities secure?  How does one design a project to examine the issue of well integrity, not just for the present but for 100 or 150 years from now?  Perhaps our guests will provide answers to these questions.</p> <p>  Mr. Lynott referred to exposure to chemicals.  To date, the emphasis has been on the chemicals that are included in fracking fluid in order to try to release methane gas.  The advocates of fracking and those companies which are considering becoming involved in using the process in our part of the country inform us that they will not use these chemicals.  Is the EPA examining the feasibility of being able to carry out fracking without the use of such chemicals?  Surely if these chemicals are not required in order for the fracking process to be carried out, then the US Environmental Protection Agency would not have licensed their use in the first instance.  I am more concerned about the material that could actually be released from the ground as a result of the process, even if only water and sand are pumped in.  There are some toxic chemicals in the ground.  I am sure Leitrim and Roscommon are no different to anywhere else and that there will be arsenic, lead and other toxic chemicals in the ground which will be released as a result of the fracking process.  Does the research being carried out contemplate the impact of those chemicals that can be released from the soil as a result of fracking?</p> <p>  The third issue I wish to raise relates some of the very dispersed housing that is found in rural areas.  Many environmentalists in this country have been critical of this.</p><p>This means that the implications of fracking in Ireland are different from those in continental Europe or in the US, where most people live in clusters in towns and villages.  The number of people who would be affected by fracking in rural parts of continental Europe and the US is very limited.  There are far more people involved here, even though we are taking about rural, isolated areas.  There is a much higher population density here than in many parts of Europe where fracking takes place.  Is that issue being taken into consideration?  In regard to the design and structure of our housing - Deputy Michael Colreavy will understand this - many stone buildings are still inhabited today, which is not the case in many parts of the US, where there is mainly timber frame housing, or in many parts of Europe.  Even very small vibrations could have a long-term structural impact on property.  Is that being taken into account?  </p><p> Deputy Colreavy mentioned the company Foster Wheeler.  That company constructed the two peat-fired power stations at Shannonbridge and Lanesborough.  As we are aware, it made a miscalculation of the acidity in the peat, which led to both of those plants having to be shut down and completely refitted.  Seasonal staff in Bord na M&oacute;na lost out on employment for a whole season because of this retrofitting which had to take place.  Some of the best consultants, even though they are advising the European Union, sometimes get it wrong also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.2001" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dara Lynott" time="11:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2015061000002#O00200"><p>I thank Deputy Naughten.  In answer to a number of his questions, I would say this is unique.  It is unique in that we are using a proportional approach.  Other countries rushed to exploratory licensing rather than standing back and doing the research on it.  Ireland and the EPA have decided to do this research.  Subsequently, Departments have decided to take their decisions regarding licensing.  A number of countries have started and stopped and are now doing the research with a view to determining whether this is a good or a bad thing.  The second unique feature of this research is that looking at research in the US is not applicable in many cases to Ireland.  The geology of Clare, Leitrim and Fermanagh is quite unique and very complex in terms of hydrology and geology.  For that reason the EPA was very much focusing on trying to get as much information as possible to capture the complexity of the geology and hydrology.  Part of that is also about seismicity - the potential for earthquakes.  In addition, there is the radiological nature of some of the groundwaters that are very deep underground, which have much longer exposure to rock containing radionuclides.  All of that is part of this study.  I cannot answer the Deputy as I do not know.  Like the Deputy, I will be waiting for the study to tell me what the issues are.  Well construction is definitely part of this research.  Also, what I call decommissioning, or long-life decommissioning, is part of this research.  A broad swathe of research is trying to accurately map the complexity of the system.  It is also looking at construction standards and impacts.  Our own initial study in 2012 said that well integrity was a key point.  If the well is not constructed correctly, that provides a pathway from the surface or from the mid-layers to the lower layers or from the lower layers to the mid-layers.  That is a key issue, and the research will have to look into it.</p> <p>  With regard to housing dispersion, another unique aspect in Leitrim is the housing patterns compared to very uninhabited areas of the US where fracking is taking place.  A huge part of the study will have to look, particularly in terms of seismicity, at how houses are dispersed and where they are dispersed.  I agree with the Deputy that this raises the bar in terms of environmental impact.  That too will have to be answered by this research.  I agree with the Deputy.  The research is unique to Ireland because of the geological pattern that stretches from Clare through Roscommon and Leitrim to Northern Ireland and also reaches into Scotland.  Dr. Brian Donlon will confirm whether I am correct, but I think Scotland recently stopped any fracking activity until it starts its research into this area, because it realises also the complexity of the geology and the hydrology.  </p> <p>  I reiterate that there will be no hydraulic fracturing taking place as part of this research.  It is about understanding what is under the ground in Leitrim.  That will be there for generations and for the whole of the country as a resource for the country.  Data will be collected whether hydraulic fracturing happens or not.  Those groundwaters and that geological information will become part of the national canon of environmental information that is available to everyone, pro- and anti-fracking, to use as they wish.</p></speech>

There are reports that members may have seen in which people say they can do it chemical-free.  This is part one of the tasks they have to do.  Another task is on the flowback fluid and looking at treatment and disposal methods and best practice; that is task 7 of project B.  Therefore, the two points raised about chemicals and flowback will be addressed in the project.</p></speech>

My colleagues have a personal and in-depth knowledge of issues, particularly in Leitrim.  This is a fundamental report and study.  Every single aspect has to be adjudicated on.  It cannot be possible for anybody to find that a part is missing in terms of underground water, health or whatever is the issue.  There is genuine concern that those who have an input into the report may have a biased view.  That view must be dispelled in whatever way is possible.  The report, which will be in place for generations, must be one million per cent trusted, without question from any sector, because the concerns that people from Leitrim and elsewhere have expressed to me must be addressed.  Every aspect has to be taken into account because this is a fundamental report.</p></speech>

If they cannot stand over the research that is produced or if somebody knocks a hole in the research after it is published, their names are tarnished.  I have absolutely no doubt that they will not put their name to any report that they cannot stand over or that is not fully peer-reviewed.  This is a unique study.  It will be reviewed by every government and every exploration company in the world, and every advocacy organisation will examine it.  If there are errors, mistakes or discrepancies, they will be pointed out very quickly and exposed.  It is in the interests of the EPA and all the other bodies involved to ensure the issues are comprehensively addressed and that no questions are left unanswered.  It is fundamentally important that no questions are left unanswered before either this Government or the authorities in Northern Ireland consider even exploratory fracking, not to mention fracking on a commercial basis.</p></speech>

I believe I know the answer to it, but I take it that the scope does not include the EPA considering factors such as the impact on house values, the cost to local authorities of road repairs and replacement and socioeconomic considerations.  Is it intended that these factors will be included in the scope of the project?</p></speech>

An environmental impact statement would suggest road traffic be considered, in addition to vibrations and noise.  From a traffic-calming perspective, the size of roads would have to be examined in an environmental impact assessment.  The cost and who pays would be considered only in the event that a licence was imminent or as part of planning permission as part of a local authority development levy on a developer that would come into an area.</p></speech>

We have conducted research which has been valued at &euro;75 million and dates back as far as 2007.  We have a tried, tested and robust method of carrying out research.  We carry it out by using the right people who help us to decide who should conduct the research and the right people to review the research outputs.  Ultimately, as Deputy Denis Naughten indicated, the research has to stand on its own merits in the international community and that makes many people stand to attention.  I do not believe we are ahead of the game.  Unlike the US Environmental Protection Agency, in 2012 we commissioned an initial small-scale study.  We were the ones who proposed this research study to begin with, knowing what was coming down the line.  It is our view that we will have the information in advance of any licence being issued.  This has been indicated by the Ministers in the North and the South.  That is a much stronger position for an environmental protection authority to be in.</p></speech>

We were asked by the other funding partners to present a short report on the status of the research.  On request, in January we gave a one-page report to the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  We were again asked by the Department, I believe on foot of an appearance before this committee, whether we could provide the other funding partner with a status report.  There is a little confusion about it being called an "interim report".  It is not an interim report but a status report on the current position and whether we are nearly finished.  It is not intended to be a full-blown interim research report.  There has been some confusion in that regard.</p></speech>

The purpose of this afternoon's continued meeting is to engage with the Donegal-based driver rehabilitation programme that is run by Pro-Social Ireland.  We are sitting jointly in accordance with D&aacute;il Standing Order 84 and Seanad Standing Order 72.  This is a rare occasion and is the first joint sitting in which I have been involved.

As the Co-Chairman stated, the purpose of this meeting is to discuss with the witnesses their driver rehabilitation programme, which we are interested in from a justice point of view.  We have done a great deal of work on rehabilitation, penal reform and so on, as the witnesses may be aware.  All parties and none on the justice committee are agreed that any alternative to criminal sanction should be explored and used to the maximum.  This was the thrust of a report on penal reform that we issued a while ago.  We also considered community courts and other such initiatives with a view to keeping people out of the criminal justice system, including prison.  Any initiative like the one being discussed today is most welcome.  We look forward to what the witnesses have to say, particularly about the impact on recidivism and how effective their approach has been.</p></speech>

I thank members for inviting us to this meeting to discuss our project.  My name is Gary Doggett and I am the co-ordinator of the Pro-Social drivers programme.  With me today is our chairman, Mr. Mick Quinlivan, a retired garda with 31 years of experience who is currently working in the community and voluntary sector, specifically mental health, disability and youth.  Our treasurer, Mr. Paul McCusker, is a lecturer in business studies and community development.  He is also the treasurer of the Donegal Youth Service and Youth Work Ireland at national level.  Our lead facilitator is Mr. Martin McFadden, who is sitting at the end.  He is an integrative counsellor and a founder of the Friends of Bill W Club in Donegal, which is a support centre for the recovery community.  He is highly regarded within mental health and addiction services and works on a daily basis with challenging clients who present with behavioural issues.  He is also a trained facilitator and trainer.  My field is adult education.  I have an honours BA in community development and have written a thesis on strategies to reduce reoffending.</p> <p>  The aim of the Pro-Social drivers programme is to reduce the number of deaths on our roads.  We also want to reduce road traffic reoffending and to avoid an escalation of offences that lead to criminal records.  The year 2012 saw the first year-on-year increase in fatalities on our roads since 2005.  These numbers represent human lives and devastation to families.  From the justice perspective, there were more than 24,000 convictions for road traffic offences in 2012.  These are members of our community.  We are trying to reduce the number of perpetrators and victims of road traffic offences.</p> <p>  Donegal has a recent and tragic history in terms of road safety.  It was against this backdrop that, in 2012, our organisation was approached by representatives of the criminal justice system in Letterkenny with a view to putting together a driver rehabilitation programme to try to reduce the high incidence of anti-social driving behaviour in the county.  All of the research that we have seen to date as well as our personal experiences have shown that it is generally personal factors rather than technical skill that are the main cause of risky or careless driving behaviour.  With this in mind, we put together a course that took into consideration four factors that we believed would be the most conducive to safe driving.  These are emotional control, social responsibility, driving under the influence and the consequences of anti-social driving behaviour.</p> <p>  Our clients are generally referred to us by judges, the Probation Service or solicitors.</p><p>This is a key strength of the programme in that it is an indication of the integrity of the work we are doing and of the trust placed in us by professionals in this area.</p><p> We meet our clients on a one-to-one basis to discuss what they need to do to complete the programme.  They then attend three-hour modules delivered over a four-week period.  After the initial induction is a module on emotional control which addresses the way that we respond to certain situations while behind the wheel.  The next module is on social responsibility which looks at the responsibility we all have as members of our communities.  This is followed by a module on driving under the influence.  This module is very important as we find that many of the younger people with whom we deal have poor skills in peer refusal.  We try to give people the skills whereby they can learn to say "No" to their friends and encourage their friends to drive in a safer manner.  The last module is on the consequences of anti-social driving behaviour.  Since the outset, our thoughts have been mainly with road traffic victims.  With this in mind, we have always wanted to create a space in which victims can voice their own pain and explain what they have been through.  Generally, we invite someone who has lost a loved one, someone who has been in a bad collision or a representative of the emergency services to give a talk on the last module.</p><p> To date, we have run 12 courses which have been successfully completed by 110 people.  So far, we are informed that only one person has reappeared before the courts.  It is our understanding that probation-led reports have shown that the recidivism rate for road traffic offences is in the region of 28% within two years.  The majority of those offences occur within the first year.  International research has shown that driver rehabilitation programmes can reduce reoffending by up to 50%.  I will now pass the joint committee to our treasurer, Mr. Paul McCusker, who will set out our strategy for moving forward.</p></speech>

We are looking to mainstream it.  The key strengths of the programme are as follows.  We have a relationship with the Judiciary and statutory bodies, including the Garda and ambulance service, which is very positive.  We are seeking to offer them two things; in particular the Judiciary.  Those are certainty and consistency.  It is not enough for a judge to think a course is going to run, he or she must know it will.  Currently, we run courses on demand and have run three so far this year on a voluntary basis.  We would like to offer certainty.  We would also like to roll the programme out on the basis of certainty.  Second, as a community group, our board is voluntary.  We have councillors and representatives from the business community.  We are very sensitive to the needs of all members of the community.  That is one of our key things.  Within the group itself, it is very much person-led and person-centred and that requires resources.  It will require investment.  Our hope from today is that the joint committee will make positive representations to the Department to enable us to grow the programme.  This morning, we have had a huge amount of interest from other counties about coming down to develop programmes.  We have been asked to come down and talk to people.  There is a need for a programme such as this.  We do not see ourselves in competition with other activities but as a complement to them by bringing a different perspective to bear.  On a more international stage, we have been approached from other countries including the Czech Republic, Estonia and Austria.</p> <p>  There is a great deal of learning going on in this area.  By no means does anyone know all the answers.  We can look at them together, however.  In terms of the ongoing challenges, texting is becoming more and more of an issue.  We will need strategies to address that.  The RSA has some phenomenal advertisements which are scary on the distance a car can travel in 15 seconds while a person is texting.  These are issues in respect of which we will have to adapt our programme.  We are also getting invitations from groups outside the road traffic area to see if we can adapt our programme for their needs.  We would like to invest time in doing that.  The approach we have applied to road safety can also be applied to other areas, including public order offences and within schools to address cyberbullies.  Those who are doing the cyberbullying need to be dealt with as well as the victims.  We see those areas as ones we would like to explore in partnership with other groups.  We have always adopted a partnership-based approach to developing this model.  Mr. Doggett and Mr. McFadden in particular have worked very closely with other organisations.  We are members of the road safety working group in Donegal and liaise with anybody who is in this area.  We need and would like to get the resources and space to do that.</p> <p>  The programme has been very successful and the wind of opportunity is there right now and should be taken advantage of.  We have a loose plan to develop this.  Phase 1 involves a pilot programme in seven counties.  This is the proposal we put to the Minister, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, when we met him in Donegal two months ago.  It is a geographic but also a rural thing.  The seven counties are around Donegal as that is where we are based, but it would be moved down then and eventually come to Dublin in 2020.  It will take five years to plan and come into an area with a working programme.  Over the past five years, we have developed a way of working that is very much based on dialogue with the major stakeholders in the community.  We liaise with the judges and garda&iacute; and we do not prescribe.  Everybody is involved and anybody who wants a say has one.  Mr. McFadden will talk about how the programme runs, but it is very much a partnership-based approach.  We have no statutory powers and we do not want any.  It is in essence a group of people getting together in a room to discuss something which is of huge importance to everybody.  We would like to take it from there.  Outside of the numbers, the success of the programme is that all of those who have done the courses continue to speak very positively about what they learned quite a while later.  That cannot be quantified.</p></speech>

It is lovely to get the opportunity to present to everybody.  I will try not to duplicate anything my colleagues have said.  My aim is to give a flavour of the content and delivery of the programme and what makes us different.</p> <p>  This is the first programme of its kind in the country, as I am sure the joint committee is aware.  It is very much a cognitive behavioural approach.  My own orientation as a counsellor is interpretative and I draw on different skills and tools to work with particularly difficult or resistant clients who present.  The participants who come to us usually come through a solicitor or are referred by a judge.  As such, they come with a certain amount of resistance and do not really want to be there at the start.  We must, therefore, work with them.  It is very important that we meet them individually first and find out a little about who they are, what they are coming with and what are their needs.  Building that rapport and trust is very important.  It is possibly the first time they have sat down with someone and had that kind of conversation.  When we get to the delivery of the programme, week one is around emotional control and basic communication, which is very important.  Driving is a highly complex social activity that has a language all of its own.  A lot of the time when one talks to these kids, they are not aware of what they are doing and why.  That is part and parcel of why we have been successful.  We have dug underneath and gone to a different level to find out exactly why they are behaving the way they are; much of the time, they have not realised why themselves.  As such, it is a classic cognitive behavioural approach.  If we can change the thinking, we change the behaviour.  That is very important.</p> <p>  We give value to the course when we start off.  We always contract with the group to give value, safety and confidentiality to its members so they feel they can express themselves within that forum.  That is very important as it is something they may not be used to.  The programme is client and person-centred.  It is a collaborative, shared learning experience.</p><p>Mr. Doggett will agree with me that we have also learned much from the participants coming through the programme.  It is about maintaining balance also.  We are working on a very serious issue.  Road safety is highly sensitive, and we are very conscious of that, but it is also about getting the participants to engage and, to date, that has been superb.  It is also about raising awareness and getting people to understand that they have a social responsibility in that there are other road users.  It often goes deeper than just road safety.  It goes across the board in terms of their own work or family environment.</p><p> We try to change that automatic thinking to more skilled thinking, and we have drawn from a number of people across Europe who have lent some of their programme to us.  There is one from Canada, for example, which involved one of the men coming here to train with us for a week on reasoning and rehabilitation, based on a 30-year, evidence-based programme that works with young offenders and so on.  We have drawn from many places and pieced all that together quite well.</p><p> In terms of the delivery, it is not a lecture as such, but we have group discussion, PowerPoint, some role play and case studies, so it is quite good.  </p><p> On the aims, we try to get participants to think about self-control.  Impulsiveness is a major aspect, particularly with young people, and it is what gets them in trouble in the first place.  We try to temper that slightly or at least get them to become aware of it.  It is about getting them to stop and think.  It is about trying to get them to think about their thinking, to use more critical reasoning and to consider objectives and different decision making styles.  This is all heavy stuff for young people, but all I can say is that my experience to date is that it works when it is done in a simple form.</p><p> Social and societal skills are very important.  Some people can come in who might not necessarily have a set of skills.  We have found that peer influence has been a huge issue also.  We identified that early on and brought in part of the final module where we do some work on peer reviews and skills.  It is about how one can say "No" and not lose face.  That is very important for young people.  We dig into the moral values and core beliefs as well, which is also very important.  It is about raising awareness and getting that emotional management.</p><p> On the last day we bring in first responders from the ambulance service and someone who has been involved in a serious collision.  We do a talk and then review what we have done over the previous month.  What I have found, and this goes back to what I said at the outset, is that these guys come in every morning and they are quite resistant and closed, but as the programme wears on, they become open, involved and engaged, and they go off and tell their friends.  It is by no means a get-out-of-jail card.  They work for the certificate they get, and it is beholden on us to hold up the integrity of the programme to maintain that.  To bring it forward, we ask the committee members to endorse the programme for us.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses for the presentation.  It is intriguing and a solution to an issue.  Reducing fatalities and improving behaviour were the two main points.  I want to ask some questions, following which I will open to floor to members, who I ask to stick to asking questions as much as possible, and I will try to lead by example.  On the figures, reference was made to the fact that there was only one re-offender.  Is that a definite figure?  Did it come from the Garda?</p></speech>

Also, reference was made to the aim of rolling out the programme across the country.  What cost are we talking about?  I will put all my questions together.  On the workings of the programme, is this a case in which a young person or whoever is in court and the judge recommends that they do this course?  Might they do this course if they are in prison as a result of a road offence, or is it for people who do not have to serve a sentence?</p></speech>

We do not know the exact figures but we would aim to have between 600 and 800 participants through courses in that time.</p> <p>  In terms of the way we work it, when we go into an area, we liaise with the judges and then work with the solicitors.  We then work with the Garda in terms of familiarising members with what we are aiming to do and get their buy-in.  We then talk to community groups, which is done mainly by Mr. Doggett, and then the course rolls out with referrals from the court system.  Mr. McFadden and Mr. Doggett work on that together.  We have worked on this in Donegal for the past three years.  That is the roll-out.  We go into jurisdictional areas and work with the judges to get referrals, and then roll out the course.</p></speech>

We have a serving member of the Probation Service on our board.  She sat the course and was so impressed that she decided to join the board.</p> <p>  The programme started out mainly with referrals from Judge Kelly.  The referrals would come on a person's first hearing.  They then have to go back to the courts after they have completed the course.  Early on we were very aware of the problem that some people may respond better than others while others might not respond well at all.  We wanted to differentiate between people who worked hard for the course and those who were just in attendance because they had to do it.  In consultation with the Trasna programme in Dublin, Mr. Paul Mooney kindly allowed us use its evaluation system.  We use some of the categories they use, so we evaluate clients on their punctuality as a social skill.  That is the number one requirement, because if they cannot turn up early or on time for the course, it is not a good sign.  We also look at participation, because it is a peer learning environment, and we believe it is very important that everybody gets involved in the conversation.  We understand that the group work theory and practice in the first course is very awkward for everybody, and we do not expect anybody to get involved the first time around, but we tease it out a little and give everybody an opportunity.  These things are explained to everybody in that one-to-one meeting.  We show them the marking sheet on which they are marked on their punctuality, their participation, their demeanour - it is clearly explained to them that they must come in with a positive attitude and not sit there texting or using their phones - and teamwork.  Those are the four areas on which they are marked from 1 to 5.  They are marked 1 if they arrive very late and 5 if they are camped outside the night before waiting for us to arrive.  We do not expect that, but we want people to be aware that there is a system in place.  We find this a great motivational tool as well because it helps us to keep things in order.  We are very aware of the victims who have suffered loss through the actions of some of our clients.  We do not want people to feel it is a get-out-of-jail-free card, a term we heard previously.</p><p>We want the wider community to be reassured that anybody doing our programme must earn their certificate.  The other rules we have are all clearly explained at the outset.  At the start, referrals mainly came from the judge.  When people appeared in court for the first time, it was suggested that they do the programme.  We would then evaluate the client and the results would be sent on to the judge and possibly to the solicitors, if requested.  After that, the person would go to court.  That is outside our remit.  Our remit is to deliver a course and whatever happens on the basis of our evaluations has nothing to do with us.  We have found recently that we are getting more and more referrals from solicitors, which was surprising.  We gave a presentation to the Bar Association a year or two ago and we have had massive buy-in from solicitors, which has been great.  Much more recently, we have found that we are getting more and more clients coming to us who are looking to get their licence back.  This has been brilliant, because with the initial shock of losing one's licence, a person might be inclined not to behave in that way again, but two or three years down the line attitudes may have softened somewhat.  It is a good time to get people to change their attitudes before they get behind the wheel of a car again.</p><p> We have never seen ourselves as a replacement for the current system.  We consider ourselves to be a complementary asset.  However, we understand the difficulties with the punitive system.  If a person in Donegal is getting a ban for the same offence as someone in Dublin, it is a very different sentence, as there are no transport links in Donegal.  That is what we are talking about as an escalation of offences.  People may get behind the wheel again of necessity, although we do not condone that behaviour in any way.</p></speech>

I will make a very brief commentary, because Deputy Pringle and I are Deputies for Donegal and all the public representatives in the county have huge admiration for the work of Pro-Social Drivers.  I am from the Inishowen peninsula.  As mayor of my home town of Buncrana, I had to comment on a road tragedy on television.  I remember going through the figures on deaths.  I came forward with a horrendous statistic: 25 young people under the age of 25 had been killed on the roads of Inishowen over 18 months.  We went through a terrible period, so for us to come from that tragic history to having a story like this is remarkable.  The Chairman was right to ask the question about re-offenders, because having just one is an incredible achievement.</p> <p>  I am mindful that the two Chairmen are representatives of rural communities, and Deputy Fleming, who has joined us, is also from a rural community.  In rural communities, public transport is very patchy, so young people grow up with a culture of cars and having to drive.  The objective of Pro-Social Drivers, practically speaking, because it is based in Donegal, is to engage with a number of rural counties and with working groups there.  I would like to see this mainstreamed.  I am a big admirer of what the witnesses are doing.  Could they talk through taking an approach with all rural communities similar to Donegal first and then working their way down, hopefully, if we can get support from the Minister or whatever Department?  Could they tell us how that would move forward?</p></speech>

I am not a member of either committee, but it is important for me to come here today to support Pro-Social Drivers because is a very important programme.  I had the pleasure at the end of one course of presenting certificates to participants in Letterkenny.  It is clear from the presentation today that it is a very valuable programme.  There are 24,000 convictions annually for road traffic offences, some of which are custodial sentences, and if we can help reduce those convictions, as well as re-offending, which is key, there is a substantial saving to be made.  While the proposal for &euro;200,000 to roll the programme out in seven counties over two years might seem like a lot of money, there will be a saving to the State, which is vital.  Does Mr. Doggett or Mr. McFadden see their role, if this were rolled out nationally, as training people to deliver the course on a national basis?  While there is an argument regarding rural counties in terms of difficulties around transport, I also see an important role for the programme in urban areas.  The Chairman also asked whether it would be possible to deliver this within the prison system.  The witnesses might address this, as it would be very important in terms of recidivism.</p></speech>

I thank both Donegal Deputies, who have been very supportive of our programme, as have all Deputies across the county and across the board, which is fantastic.  Our aim is to bring the programme around the country, and that we would be in a position to train the trainers.  We are very mindful of our present location.  It is local and quite insular and there would be challenges for us in bringing the programme to different parts of the country.  There would be different localities, situations and environments, and we are very conscious of that.  That is what Mr. McCusker would also have said.  In our strategy for the next five years, we have taken all that into account.  Certainly, to expand the programme, we would be looking to place facilitators in different parts of the country to work within their own areas.</p></speech>

The youth sector has tried restorative practice quite successfully.  Our experience to date is that judges, garda&iacute; and first responders are fully supportive in whatever capacity and would roll in behind us.  This morning alone, Mr. Doggett's phone has been buzzing, as he is our media guru.  People in the community will buy into it.  They want to see every strategy used and every possible opportunity taken to stop the carnage.  In the case that Deputy Mac Lochlainn mentioned, one of the five young people killed coming from a nightclub was buried in her graduation outfit.  She had spent four years getting a degree and she was buried.  All road accidents are so tragic and senseless and we must do anything we can to stop them, bar locking people up.  Our aim is to stop them and to get young people and drivers to pause and reflect and give them a chance.  It is making a difference and we hope that we will go up a level and it will make a wider difference.</p></speech>

It is quite interesting.  We have explored that area ourselves.  In putting this course together, we are very conscious of following best practice.  We do not want to go out on our own and be mavericks; we want to see what is going on in other countries.  We have spoken with the Kuratorium f&uuml;r Verkehrssicherheit, the road safety board in Austria, which has been running driver rehabilitation programmes since 1978.  I believe they have become mandatory since 1995.</p><p>The Czech Republic sent us a programme it uses within its prison system and we have had informal discussions about it.  We have spoken to a person with whom we have good connections and that person has spoken with prison officers about the possibility of doing something similar.</p></speech>

I only have a synopsis, but who would be regarded as high-risk drivers?  Are they people who have been in custody for offences?  Should we rate the entire general public?  Some people, myself included, would probably benefit from brushing up their knowledge of the rules of the road.  If I had to face a driving test now I would probably not pass it under modern standards.</p></speech>

Because of the size of the county we have a generic course but there is space for lesser offences such as where somebody has transgressed the speed limit by a small amount.  What we are doing is not particularly conducive to safe driving in the context of such matters.  We are most productive in the areas of dangerous driving and careless driving.  There is also driving under the influence of drugs or texting or using the telephone while driving, though it is hard to believe people would even consider doing something like that.  It is fantastic how Ireland has changed over the years, even in areas such as smoking.  We have changed our whole attitude around these matters and we have changed the way the public thinks about them.  The same happened with seat belts, though that took a while.  We need to educate our clients and the fact that they have come before the courts in the first place is an indication that there is a problem.</p></speech>

When one goes to the scene of an accident one's first concern is for people who are injured and we try to look after them.  The culprit, the perpetrator, the person who is in the wrong in the accident, however, could be your brother, my brother or anybody's brother here.  It could be somebody who has worked a double shift and fallen asleep on the way home.  There are so many tragic stories.  These people are not necessarily criminals.  They are very unfortunate and should not really be treated as criminals.  There are serial offenders who have to be dealt with, however, and I would not want to give any of them a get-out-of-jail-free card because I know what the consequences of this type of driving are, having seen it at first hand.  We have to have a level-headed approach to this.  It is not about revenge but about making everybody safer and better at driving.</p></speech>

At the moment the course is taken as a consequence of the participants' behaviour, so it is based on experiential learning.  They have touched the wet paint, so it is real to them, whereas if one delivers a programme to a pupil in transition year they think it is never going to happen to them.  The programme is good because we have people's engagement.  They have to be there, but when they buy into it, as they have done, it is always a bonus.</p></speech>

Have they thought about speed restrictors?  Younger drivers are often prone to speeding and maybe speed restrictors would be desirable.  They might also be desirable to insurance companies and it would be one way of getting cheaper insurance.</p></speech>

Technology only works if the person using the technology has the will to use it.  Speed restrictors can work but the attitude of the driver and his or her demeanour while inside the car are what we work at.  We do not have a driving programme and we do not teach technical driving skills as they are all very good drivers already.  We focus on their behaviour from the word "Go."</p></speech>

There should also be more emphasis from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport on getting rid of black spots.  There is a need for soft landing ramps in certain places, and some counties have more than others.  There is a particular need for them near schools and in built-up areas.</p></speech>

Youngsters drive fast, but one can put a speed restrictor into a car as easily as into a lorry and it would restrict them whether they liked it or not.  I have been an advocate of this but I do not know if the delegates have done anything about it.  Is there an incentive for youngsters who do a course in terms of their insurance?  Youngsters are being crucified with insurance and are a target for insurance companies.  The prices they are being charged give them an incentive not to have insurance, and we have to something for them, as they just do not have &euro;3,000 or &euro;4,000.  Some insurance companies provide a certificate for youngsters who have completed a certain amount of driving, which qualifies them for lower insurance costs.</p> <p>  A lot of good drivers are actually off the road in this country for one simple reason.  They are elderly and never had a licence from the days when they did not need a licence, something which was the reality in rural parts of Ireland.  They drive a truck, car or tractor better than a person with all the licences in the world but because they were nabbed on the road for not having a licence they were put off the road, even though they had been driving for 30 years.  They cannot get a licence now because many of them did not have the luxury of going to school and they are afraid to go into a van to do the test.  We are pushing people outside the law who are perfectly fit to drive.  Do the witnesses agree?</p></speech>

We are members of the Donegal road safety working group and that is the only input we have.  We can offer our opinion on such matters, along with the rest of the committee.  Speed restrictors are not necessarily our area, as we do not only deal with speeding offences.  We deal with myriad offences not necessarily related to speed.  The point about insurance companies was interesting.  We have worked on this for three years now and we have explored many different options to continue our work, but it is a struggle to get the supports we need.</p><p>We have been working for three years now.  It is a struggle to get the supports we need.  We have explored the idea of insurance companies reducing premiums for those who have done the course.  We thought that if the companies bought into that idea, it might be a good way of getting support.  We might explore that possibility again in the future.  Unfortunately, I do not think what was said about the elderly is really relevant to the work we are doing.  I hope I have answered the questions.</p></speech>

There have been some developments recently.  The Probation Service has bought into our services to a significant extent in the last year or two.  We have a board member from the Probation Service, which has recommended our course to a judge on the other side of the Border in Derry.  He accepted our evaluations in one case in the past.  Two more cases are pending.  It has been recommended that two clients attend our course.  We have had very good international co-operation so far.  When we were setting out on this journey, we looked at much of what is going on in other countries.  We were very conscious of providing a good service.  We wanted to see what is working in other areas.  One of the original authors of the reasoning and rehabilitation model, which was mentioned earlier by Mr. McFadden and is well recognised internationally, is based in Estonia.  He very kindly came over, basically at cost, to deliver training for some of our facilitators.  We have had massive buy-in from those guys as well.  As I mentioned earlier, the authorities in the Czech Republic have more or less handed us the programme they use within their prison system.</p></speech>

I do not think I have done so before now.  Our board of directors includes a serving member of the Probation Service, a community liaison officer, a public representative who is also a health care worker, an education specialist who deals with disadvantaged groups, a qualified counsellor who specialises in bereavement counselling and a representative from the business community.</p></speech>

That is very good to know.  I have a few other questions.  Insurance companies have been mentioned.  I noticed in the documentation that was furnished to us a reference to the cost in some other jurisdiction.  It was mentioned that the cost per participant is approximately $300.  Did the witnesses give us this document?  I think they did.  The document also refers to "economic bottom lines of about $2,400 in net taxpayer-only benefits per participant".  Is Mr. Doggett familiar with that?</p></speech>

It is a question of feeling the pain, if I may use that term.  The mammy quite often phones up to book the course.  I recently had a mammy sitting in on the interview with the young man.  This guy was about 25 years old.  When I brought up the cost of the programme, the mammy said "sure I'll pay for it, didn't I give birth to him?".  When I asked her if she was driving or sitting in the car, she said "No".  I told her I would much prefer the young man to pay for it because he needed to learn.  That is very much where we are at from a financial perspective.</p></speech>

We are fully compliant with everything.  We are a voluntary group.  There is quite an overhead accruing, even as a voluntary group, in order to stay legal.  That is where the need for support arises.  We have received an incredible amount of goodwill from Donegal.  A question was asked about Donegal County Council.  People have put a great amount of time, energy and effort into this project.  That is a demonstration of the goodwill that exists.  This brings me back to my original point.  We have to provide certainty.</p></speech>

It is a question of having a seven-county structure in place with certainty.  We would hate to arrive in and promise things we cannot deliver.  We would not like to say we will run courses only for those courses not to materialise because of factors within our control.  That is the reality of the &euro;2,000.  Basically, it costs &euro;100,000 a year to run this programme over seven counties and deal with the demand.  We do not know what the demand is because no one else is offering this.  We estimate, based on the figures in Donegal, that between 600 and 800 young people would come through.</p></speech>

Could I ask about insurance costs and so forth?  It appears to me that it would be a huge advantage to insurance companies to have this type of programme rolled out across the country because the savings they would make, for example in reducing accidents alone, would be pretty big.  Has the positive benefit per participant in monetary terms - the net bottom line - been analysed?</p></speech>

Insurance is one of the two of the areas in which we have thought about this.  We have already discussed the possibility of young people who come on the course beforehand getting a reduced premium for taking part in the course.  That would seem to be a no-brainer.  We were also looking at the possibility that larger corporations might be interested in the emotional control module, which provides half a day of training for staff in the area of emotional control.  It is particularly difficult to drive in the city.  It is a highly charged emotional experience nowadays.  It is another area we have been considering.  As Mr. McCusker said, there is some uncertainty in this regard.  When we have some form of certainty, we can explore these possibilities in more depth.</p></speech>

I was listening to Mr. Doggett on radio at an early hour this morning, but there was another news item later where somebody was being released after four years of a seven year sentence.  While I do not know the details of that, he had escaped and re-offended at some stage.  There is the human side of this, so I am glad there is a balance and that this is to improve behaviour and save lives, not to give people an escape route from being dealt with if the offences are serious.</p> <p>  I understand the Government's Road Safety Strategy 2013-20 has made provision for the introduction, subject to legal advice, of rehabilitation and driving awareness courses as court-based sentencing options for specific offenders.</p></speech>
