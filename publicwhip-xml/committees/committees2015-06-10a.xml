We begin today with session 1 public hearing and discussion with Mary O'Dea, Central Bank-Financial Regulator.  In doing so, I would like to welcome everyone to the 31st public hearing of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  Today we continue our hearings with senior officials from the Central Bank of Ireland and the Financial Regulator, who had key roles in the crisis period.</p><p>At this morning's session, we will hear from Ms Mary O'Dea.  Mary O'Dea joined the Central Bank in 1987.  She was the Financial Regulator's consumer director from 2003 through to July 2011 and sat on the board during this period.  In February 2009 to January 2010, she was acting chief executive of the Financial Regulator, having stepped in when Patrick Neary retired.  She is currently senior advisor to the executive director of Ireland at the World Bank.  Ms O'Dea, you are very welcome before the inquiry this morning.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The bank inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers that can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identified.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are now before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence to the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath.</p></speech>

Thank you, members of the committee.  The committee has asked me attend today to give evidence covering the period when I was acting chief executive of the Financial Regulator.  I was appointed acting chief executive in January of 2009 for a period of about three months initially.  This appointment was extended a number of times until the newly-appointed chief executive took up his position in January 2010.  At the time of my appointment, I held a statutory office of consumer director, a role I continued to hold throughout my year as acting CEO.</p><p>As consumer director I was responsible in law for consumer information and consumer protection codes.</p><p> My period as acting chief executive of the Financial Regulator started on 12 January 2009 and ended on 4 January 2010.  It was a crisis period on a number of fronts, including bank funding and liquidity, bank governance, investigation of legacy issues and putting a system in place to manage the bank guarantee scheme.  At the time, the organisation itself was also in crisis with uncertainty around the restructuring of the Central Bank and the regulator and its governance.  The financial crisis continued throughout 2009, internationally as well as domestically.  Anglo Irish Bank was nationalised in January and the Government announced capital injections for AIB and Bank of Ireland.  In April, the Government decided to set up the asset management company, NAMA, which would take larger non-performing loans from the balance sheets of the banks.  Confidence in the regulatory system was at an all-time low.  The system of supervision and regulation that had been in place internationally and in Ireland had proved to be inadequate.  At the same time, significant new responsibilities had been assigned to the regulator associated with the bank guarantee.  In addition, our investigations were producing new information on serious governance matters at certain banks.  As acting chief executive, I, along with my supervisory team, took the following actions with the full support of my board.  From the end of January, we significantly increased the volume and frequency of periodic reporting by each bank in the areas of profitability, impairment provisioning, regulatory capital, liquidity, lending and governance.  This information formed the basis of a comprehensive quarterly report to the Minister.  We introduced a more intrusive level of supervision requiring active and frequent engagement with domestic banks.  Officers of the regulator attended meetings of the boards and relevant committees, such as the credit committee, of these banks to assess at first hand if governance practices were working and to send a strong signal to the banks that the regulatory regime was different and that our expectations were different.  We monitored the strength and weaknesses of banks' governance systems and challenged banks where we felt that their processes were weak.  A report on governance issues was also included in the quarterly report to the Minister.</p><p> I set up an interim management structure to help address the fundamental issues we faced in banking supervision.  In January '09, I also advised the board that these arrangements were appropriate on an interim basis but that they were not a lasting solution.  A more permanent organisation structure, of course, could only be adopted when there was certainty as to the new regulatory structure, including its governance.  It was clear that the level of intensification required for banking supervision could only be achieved with the addition of significant extra resources.  We increased resources in the interim to manage the crisis more effectively, recruiting an additional 20 staff, including specialist staff where there was a deficiency, such as credit and liquidity analysts.  By the end of 2009 there was over 75 staff in banking supervision, 35 of whom were dealing with domestic banks.  We also set up a special investigations unit with around 25 to 30 seconded staff at various times and initiated a number of investigations into some specific events which had unfolded in 2008.  Part of these investigations were reported to the Garda at an early stage, while others continued throughout 2009 with a view to exercising the regulator's own administrative sanctions powers in respect of any regulatory breaches involved.  We took care to ensure that the use of the regulator's enforcement powers did not jeopardise any action on the part of the garda&iacute;.  As some of these matters are now subject to legal proceedings, I cannot, therefore, comment further.</p><p> To summarise for the committee, during my period as acting chief executive the new approach to regulating the guaranteed banks included a significant increase in information reporting requirements, more regular on-site presence at each bank, periodic attendance at board and committee meetings, greater review and scrutiny of management information, more frequent meetings with key officers, requirements for and reviews of business plans and challenging and monitoring of key variables affecting these plans, heightened focus on governance structures and processes and the introduction of a code of conduct on mortgage arrears and a statutory code of conduct for business lending.  We engaged with and challenged the banks regarding various revisions of their business models throughout 2009, as we considered how best to maintain a viable banking system.  In addition, the sensitivities of their profits, capital and funding to various assumptions were challenged to ensure that the plan was robust.  In meetings with senior credit executives, we consistently challenged the banks to make more realistic assumptions of the position of their loan portfolios.</p><p> During 2009, our focus was on crisis management, as we assessed the scale of potential problems.  Early in the year, our governance concerns were directed at the institutions in most difficulty.</p><p>We set out these concerns in our quarterly reports to the Minister.  For example, in June 2009 there were three banks who were seeking a new CEO, two who were seeking new chair, two seeking heads of finance and two without risk officers.   For new appointments we applied a fit and proper test.  This involved gathering information about a proposed person's qualifications, experience and personal history.  Aside from the boards of the banks, in 2009 it was clear that the expertise of staff in the lending areas was focused on sales and not on arrears management where there was a pressing need for expertise.  Furthermore, preparations for the transfer of loans to NAMA tied up the credit resources as this process was lengthy and complex.  During 2009 we used our supervisory powers extensively.  Seconded inspectors were appointed to carry out special investigations into possible breaches of law or regulatory provisions.  Over 70 separate engagements were held with banks at the level of acting CEO, ten administrative sanctions enforcement actions were concluded in that year, and fines which were ... ranged from &euro;7,500 to &euro;2.7 million were imposed with one disqualification direction.</p><p>  During 2009 the integrity of financial reporting gained heightened significance and in that year we fined one bank &euro;600,000 for breaches of regulatory reporting.  I believe it's fair to say that the supervisory teams were in constant dialogue with the banks during this time, probing the extent of their liquidity and solvency problems and addressing the emerging issues appropriately.   In March of '09 to ensure that our staff would feel comfortable heightening their concerns where there might be areas of disagreement, I circulated a written procedure to staff relating to the escalation of significant issues.  In June of that year, the Government announced the new regulatory structure and asked the chairman of the regulator and the Governor of the Central Bank to work together as much as possible in advance of implementing this new legislation.  In any event, this was necessary since almost all issues relating to banking at this stage had some sort of financial stability angle.  During 2009 there was one IMF Article IV mission to Dublin, which reported in June, and referred briefly to regulatory and supervisory initiatives that were already in train.  The main focus of the report was of managing the fiscal situation and the establishment of NAMA and a special resolution mechanism.  It also noted that Ireland needed to be guided by evolving European Union guidelines.   </p><p>  During my year as acting CEO in '09, the quality and effectiveness of policies and regulations both from a European and an international perspective had already been declared insufficient and reforms were well under way.  For example, in February of that year, the de Laroisi&eacute;re Group published its report.  The EU Commission had sought the report in '08 to advise on the future of European regulation and banking.  It formed the basis for many of the subsequent changes to European regulation and supervision.  Certain specific findings of the report are worth recalling, and I'll mention two quotes from the report, the first of which I misquoted slightly in my written statement.  It says that both by banks and supervisors there was "a misunderstanding of the interaction between credit and liquidity", and this led to "an overestimation of the ability of financial firms as a whole to manage their risks and a corresponding underestimation of the capital they should hold".  Having learned from the international crisis, the regulatory model in Europe is now much more intrusive and challenging with the associated significant additional staffing in place.  The Single Supervisory Mechanism has now changed the nature of banking regulation much more fundamentally in Ireland and elsewhere.  Ireland, as part of Europe, will benefit from the changes in the European structure such as the single resolution mechanism, which allows for banks participating in the banking union to be resolved appropriately if the needs arises in an efficient and centralised way.  And, most importantly, there is now a clearly defined mechanism for dealing with these issues, which will be very much recognised by the financial markets.</p><p>  The banking crisis resulted in an enormous cost for Ireland and for Irish people.  The Financial Regulator and the Central Bank did not take sufficiently strong action at an early stage in the build-up of the property bubble, which might have mitigated the worst effects.  In the environment of the time, I have no doubt that had the regulator taken stronger action to restrict lending, this would likely have been unpopular, could have been questioned and criticised, and pressure could have been brought to bear to reverse such action.  So, one lesson from the crisis is that the regulator, now the Central Bank, needs to be supported in making difficult decisions because for a regulatory system to be effective it will include taking preventative action at a time when this action is likely to be unpopular.  </p><p>  Ireland has now moved from a principles-based approach to an intrusive and challenging approach to regulation, and this is appropriate given the lessons we've learned from the crisis.</p><p>But we must be realistic in our assessment of what changes the regulatory and supervisory system can achieve.  For example, in the US, which has a much more rules based approach, there was also spectacular failures of banks and insurance companies.  There, many changes have now been adopted through new legislation and the conversation is not so much about more intrusive regulation but about stronger enforcement action, stronger consumer protection and changes to the culture of banks.  There is no perfect formula for a regulatory system that would prevent financial crises and, indeed, no regulator can operate a zero failure regime.  However, in working towards a better system, transparency and recognition of risk is, in my view, one of the most fundamental pillars of appropriate supervision.  The relationship between risk and return rarely changes, so that a careful examination of the relevant profit centres of any financial institution is a key part of identifying where the risk is.  It could be derivatives trading, commercial lending, credit card insurance but if the relative profit seems high, the likelihood is that there's an unknown or unrecognised risk for which the bank is being rewarded.  The bank's board, first and foremost, and then the regulator should follow the money, especially seemingly easy money, to probe these risks, both at an individual bank level and at a system level, paying particular attention to the most extreme scenarios.  Today, we are unlikely to know the genesis of the next crisis, so we need to have a system which can react quickly to changing circumstances, including domestic, European and international circumstances.  And finally, we also need to be confident to bring issues to the international arena where we see fractures in the system that are best addressed by regulators collectively.</p><p> Thank you, Chairman and committee.  I'm happy to answer any questions now.</p></speech>

I suppose it was the system that was in place at the time, admittedly, but did you ever express any reservation as somebody who was a part of that system?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.21" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Dea" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#E01000"><p>I did buy into the system of principles-based regulation.  It was the internationally ... seen as the best model at the time.  At the time, when that system was in place, I had the role ... the statutory role of consumer director and actually I think principles-based regulation worked very well in relation to consumer issues because we were in a very new regime.  We'd had no best practice to follow in relation to the super ... the supervision of the consumer issues.  If you recall, it was issues of consumer failing around National Irish Bank and around DIRT issues that led to the set up of the consumer area.  And if I may tell you how I think it worked better on the consumer area, we were able to build into the consumer protection code specific principles, such as you must act in the best interest of your consumer and we were able to codify that.  So when we wanted to take an enforcement action in relation to a consumer protection issue, we could look at not just the particular rule that may have been breached but also the principle - for example, acting in the best interest of the consumer - that was also breached.  So I think codifying those principles on a principles-based regulation on the consumer side, actually worked extremely well.  On the prudential side, of course, much more depended on very complex supervisory models and it was a completely different system.</p></speech>

When did you come to that position in light of the fact that large profits existed in financial institutions, particularly in some forms of the financial institutions, in the period in which you were working in the regulator?  Did you change your view to that being a new position for you or is that ... was that always a position that you held?</p></speech>

And at that stage, precisely what we did do was look very closely at credit risk.  So we looked at areas where we thought that there was problems, the build up of credit was one.  And seeing that, we built into our consumer protection code the concept of suitability in lending which didn't exist anywhere at the time.  And that included affordability, so we introduced the concept of affordability.  We also banned pre-approved credit cards.  Prior to that, 42,000 customers a month were getting some ... a letter in their door saying you have been pre-approved for extra credit.  We banned those completely.  We also introduced requirements in respect of consumer protection loans so that if you consolidated, you know, your car loan and holiday loan and all of that into one, the provider was then obliged to tell you precisely how much extra this cost.  So we introduced that requirement and we issued a number of warnings in relation to credit.  You recall in 2006 when the SSIAs matured, a lot of people were getting large sums of money then.  We were the only people who said "please use your money to pay down debt" and pointed out to consumers that this might be a good idea rather than use it for a different type of investment product.</p> <p>  So in my role as consumer director, I believe that's a principle that I followed a lot.  Having said that, I would also say that reflecting back now and listening to all of the various groups internationally saying what went wrong in the crisis, I do think that sometimes we make matters much more complex than they need to be.  And that's why I was thinking to myself that we can boil it down to be a lot more simple.  And I think that a lot of what we were doing on the ... in the prudential area was looking at extremely complex models rather than focusing on these more simple issues.</p></speech>

I asked him a question about it when he was a witness before the inquiry.  I want to reference him correctly.  He stated ''an issue in relation to a corporate governance matter in a particular bank which I think reflected poorly on the authority'' was the reason for his departure.  Do you have anything to ... anything more to add to that or anything maybe with regard to wider corporate governance issues in relation to the Financial Regulator and their role with banks at the time?</p></speech>

I remember moving from the consumer building was separate.  I remember physically going into the seventh-floor building in the Central Bank and reflecting on all of the issues that needed to be addressed.  Obviously the key thing was the banks' liquidity and the capital position of the banks.  That was the key issue that we were focused on.  But as well as that, the organisation itself was in extreme crisis and the people that I was then asked to lead as the chief executive were in an extremely difficult situation.  Many of them had worked in the regulator, which was a great of ... great sense of pride and public interest working there and now they were filled with doubt and questioning so ... and at the same time working all of the hours day and night to make sure that they stabilised the situation.  So actually I think giving leadership to the organisation to carry out its extremely important role during the crisis period was a key priority of mine.  Also, bearing in mind that at that stage I thought I would be in the seat for three months so I was trying to look at it from that point of view ... what could we best do at that stage?  And then most particularly there were a number of very specific investigations, the details of which I won't go into for legal reasons, that had to be started and that we had to make sure that we did appropriately and very thoroughly.  So there were a number of issues and that's really focusing on the banking side.  Remember the organisation is vast and I was also holding the position of consumer director and mortgage arrears were a serious issue for people at that time.</p></speech>

There was a major turnover going on in relation to governance, which meant that institutions were left with not an appropriate governance.  They were missing a CEO, they were missing a chair, they were missing a chief risk officer for quite a period of time at precisely the time where you needed these institutions to be operating at their most effective in order to be able to bottom out the position of loan arrears and deal with liquidity issues and sell off assets and take serious decisions there so-----</p></speech>

As I said to you, I think the organisation itself was in crisis.  There was certainly a feeling of blame and there was definitely a feeling within the regulator that the Central Bank should have seen the broader systemic issue, and I'm sure a feeling within the Central Bank that the regulator should have seen the more micro-prudential-type issues.  So yes, there was that feeling.</p></speech>

The nation's finances were in peril but Ireland's banking elite were celebrating in a private room in a discreet hostelry near Dublin's Stephen's Green.</blockquote>You were reported as being one of those who was in attendance at that particular event.

Ms O'Dea, can I ask you, when you were consumer director, and in the period of the development of the bubble, do you think there was a shortage of people and skills in the banking supervision department at that time and, then as you went on to chief executive in February 2009, what was the situation then?  We had in evidence from Mary Burke, for example, that three staff were supervising AIB and IL and P together, and a further three, Bank of Ireland and Anglo.  What was your view of that situation?</p></speech>

The way the process worked was that I consulted with my team in the consumer area and we figured out what was the appropriate resources that we needed, pay and non-pay, to do the job.  There was a similar exercise done in the prudential area.  And then we proposed those resources to the budget committee at the time.  Now, my interactions, if you like, with the budget committee in terms of resources, I do recall that the prudential area were looking for more staff.  I do recall that, at some stage, it could have been around 2007-2008, it was a significant amount of staff, and I remember when we went to the budget committee to discuss that large increase in staff.  And I think there was a couple of issues, as I recall it, going on with the budget committee.  That, while they had no objection <i>per se</i>to additional staff in the supervision area, that they wanted to be convinced that there couldn't be efficiencies gained from the organisations.  For example, in relation to IT or shared services-----</p></speech>

This would have been, certainly in the later years ... but I think there would have been a bit of a theme maybe for the last four or five years where the committee would ... wanted to be assured that we were taking all efficiencies in terms of IT and shared services.  We shared some services with the Central Bank and the committee wanted to make sure that there wasn't any duplication.  That was one issue.  And, in fact, I think the reason that the committee thought it was a good idea to commission Mazars was precisely to get to the bottom of that and see were there efficiencies that could be gained.</p></speech>

That was really the discussion that took place at the board but also it is important to recall, I think, that if this was a model of principles-based regulation ... this was not a model of intrusive regulation and I think you'll see that later the Mazars report had said that resources were just about right in terms of that particular model which, of course, by the time Mazars came along, we were not implementing any more.  So it was in a completely different context I believe.  If I may just though say that the second thing I think ... affected the thinking within the budget committee was the inability to actually fill the vacancies that was there, so that there was really no point in approving additional vacancies when the ones that were there weren't actually filled.  So I think that was the second part of the issue.  And that's why ultimately, I think, they commissioned the Mazars report and they asked the deputy director general of the Central Bank, who was responsible for filling the various positions within his line of reporting, to attend the board meetings.</p></speech>

The bottom half of that page ... this relates to discussions on various committees about staffing and it is 2008 when alarm bells were going off in relation ... and yet there seemed to be a discussion here on staff saving, cutbacks.  Can you tell us what's that about?</p></speech>

Now the Central Bank and the regulator are independent of Government but nevertheless, the tradition has always been if there was a public sector change in pay that the regulator and Central Bank would follow that change in pay and they had committed to delivering the savings of ... I can't remember, was it 10% or something like that of the pay bill ... I can't remember what the specific amount was.  But they had committed to delivering the same savings that the Government Departments were being asked to deliver within their own budgets.  So that was, if you like, in the context of the various austerity measures being introduced in 2008.</p></speech>

So that was a time of great uncertainty.  You'll see on the next document just across the page, when I was appointed in 2009, I did bring it to the attention of the audit committee that this was a significant operational risk operating with such stretched resources and actually it wasn't until 2010 that those resources, in fact, were approved and came in.</p></speech>

"The complement [of staff] should be augmented by 275-300 staff to ensure appropriate supervision of regulated entities".  Quite a significant increase.

It was quite clear - though, as you say, although it was too late to prevent what had happened already in Ireland - it was still absolutely necessary and is absolutely necessary that we have this more intrusive model for the future.  I think we've learned that.</p></speech>

At that stage, I would have been the consumer director and my role around the guarantee was very specifically in relation to consumer information.  A lot of people were very worried about their savings and we would get phone calls at about five times our normal phone calls of 100 calls a day, so it was up to about 500, people worried about their savings, and so myself and my team were trying to provide appropriate and correct information because the situation was constantly moving and also preparing contingency plans with the retail banks at line level to make sure that there wouldn't be a large retail run on a bank.  So, my role was very much around the consumer issues at that time.</p></speech>

What was the attitude of the banks to this new approach?</p></speech>

The more we drilled into the loan books, the more we could see difficulties in terms of provisions.</p></speech>

So, I sent a team into Anglo to do that.  We seconded officers because we needed people with special forensic skills and we seconded them in and sent them in immediately.  I was surprised at the attitude that Anglo took in relation to those inspections.  For example, at all of the inspectors' meetings, initially, there were stenographers and I'd been a long time around supervision and I'd never come across somebody having a stenographer at an inspection meeting and it slowed the process quite a bit for us.</p><p>There was also a lot of claims of legal privilege, which of course people are entitled to do, over documents.  But it seemed to us that they were, they were very frequent and they were very much slowing the process.  And we believed that it was in the best interests of the country to have these issues investigated thoroughly in a speedy fashion.  And-----</p></speech>

Ms O'Dea, on page 7 of your opening statement, second paragraph ... last few sentences, you said: "In the [United States], many changes have been adopted through new legislation and the conversation there is not so much about more intrusive regulation but stronger enforcement action, stronger consumer protection and changes [in] the culture of [the] banks."  In relation to all that has happened here and by common consent, the disastrous consequences of reckless lending that has been alleged, do you believe that legislation should be changed in this country to provide for jail sentences, for example, for serious breaches of financial rules and regulations that should be upheld?</p></speech>

Yes.</p></speech>

I think that has to be very carefully set out and I think, as you said yourself, the consequences are so significant that there should be a greater consequence for doing it incorrectly.</p></speech>

Now looking back on it, whose interest do you think was served mainly by the financial institutions over that period of time?  Was it the interest of profit-seeking private institutions?  Did that predominate over the interests of ordinary people?  That's question one.  And question two is-----</p></speech>

I believe I acted as a strong advocate for consumers during that time and provided appropriate information to them, specifically in relation to credit issues as well, and also to set out codes and enforce those codes and again, I believe that I did that.  I think you'll see in the Mazars report it suggested that the consumer information could be seen as best in class.  However, I do believe that the actions of the regulator and Central Bank were not adequate to prevent what ultimately happened and I regret that.</p></speech>

When 100% mortgages were introduced, we issued new information in relation to that.  We warned consumers about negative equity and how you could build up negative equity in relation to that, and we talked about affordability.  But I will also say, Chair, that at the time of the 100% mortgages, when they were introduced and the discussion, I actually felt it was the wrong discussion, because there were 80% mortgages that people couldn't afford, and that the issue was really about affordability.  And there may be some people who had, you know, many means that could afford 100% but the issue to me, from a consumer perspective, was much more about affordability.</p></speech>

It wasn't a case that they had a mortgage and a holiday home, and a car, and maybe a credit union loan, and it was all being bundled into one.  New home owners coming into the market were buying homes at eight and nine times their average incomes, which was an increase.  They were moving ... buying mortgages that were moved from 20 years out to 35 years.  They were being presented with 100% mortgage products and there were a whole host of other measures.  I'm trying to get a clear picture from you.  Did you direct banks or did you advise them, or did you say: "We're going to bring in a law to stop you from doing this"?</p></speech>

A guideline is something that, we, we would like you to do this and we'll talk to you more about it if you don't.</p></speech>

Under the law as set out, we were allowed to set out what was called a code, but actually it was enforceable by a fine up to &euro;5 million.  So, it was an enforceable code.  And that enforceable code was in relation to suitable lending.  So, if somebody was getting a mortgage for example, of 35 years that they clearly couldn't afford, then the institution would be in breach of the suitable lending requirement.</p></speech>

Did it work? And then I'll bring in Deputy McGrath.  Did those measures actually work?  Did it stop mortgages going up to 35 years?  Did it stop income ratios increasing where people buying a home for the first time would have been traditionally buying a home in three to four times their household income were now buying it on ten times plus?  Did your intervention into the banks in that regard work?</p></speech>

Unfortunately, it was too late.  I believe it should have been brought in earlier.  We had to carry out regulatory impact analysis in relation to those rules and that delayed it.

You're very welcome, Ms O'Dea.  Can I start by asking, prior to 2008 the regulator had proposed a number of initiatives to impose more explicit requirements on banks; such as directors compliance statements, corporate governance guidelines and fit and proper requirements.  What was your view of these initiatives, and can you describe the circumstances in which the board chose not to implement the original proposals for these initiatives?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.139" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Dea" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#N01000"><p>Yes, thank you.  I have looked back over those - the various initiatives that came in.  To be honest, most of the issues that came to the board ... as I said, I was there at my statutory capacity as consumer director and I would have looked at them from ... through that lens.  With the benefit of hindsight, they should have been brought in earlier.  I think probably in a couple of cases the issue was over complicated, so for example if I take the case of directors compliance statement, there was a similar provision being brought in in company law, and there was a lot of toing and froing as to whether or not the provision that the regulator was bringing in was cutting across that, or was not in line with that.  And I think the issue was actually, now that I look back at it, made much more complicated than it needed to be.  I think it was also impacted by the, the statutory role ... that had been built in in relation to the growth of financial services where the regulator didn't want to introduce something that was uncompetitive.  So I think that also affected things, but as I look back at those, they should have been brought in earlier.  And actually, I contrasted with later in 2009, when we took a different approach in relation to directors loans and related party loans, were we knew their was a provision coming in under company law and nevertheless we moved ahead quickly and brought in the provision as the regulator.  And that was more onerous than the one in company law, but we still felt that was appropriate.</p></speech>

In fact, in 2009, and it's very hard to recreate this, it was extremely ... crisis management and trying to stabilise the situation so there wasn't a pause to set out a strategy and ... the practice changed.

So, I don't recall a specific decision being made, but there would have been no question of operating any other way than in a very intrusive way.  And if you recall, what we were doing at the time in relation to the banks required daily and frequent contact ... contact at that stage, it was extremely intrusive.</p></speech>

Now I should add, though, that it was very difficult to do the more intrusive regulation without having the resources at that stage, and there was a sequence there in terms of, first of all, getting the governance of the regulator correct ... we didn't know whether there was going to be one board, two boards, how that was going to be set up.  Then we got a new Governor.  Patrick Honohan came in, then the chief executive was appointed, and then the strategy and resources flowed.  So there was a natural sequence there.</p></speech>

And I think the situation in relation to Anglo had been complicated by all the other issues that were going on at the time.  But I think it was the size and scale of the loss escalated over the period of time.  It was necessary, of course, to have ... because despite the fact that Anglo was nationalised, our regulatory relationship with Anglo didn't change in anyway.  So we still had regulator-to-regulated relationship and the solvency of Anglo was extremely important in terms of providing liquidity because we couldn't allow it to trade or provide services at all unless it was actually solvent.</p></speech>

We brought in two types of specialists.  We brought in auditing specialists and we also brought in valuation specialists.  And I think it was really with the two of those working together, particularly the valuation specialists, that allowed us to get a much, much better understanding.  And actually, one of the things that I noticed clearly in 2009, when we did actually bring in particular types of very specialist staff into the regulator, the value of those staff in terms of being able to even have that conversation with the banks of the type of land, the value of land, what type ... of whether it was land bank or whether it was close to development or anything like that ... those conversations, to me, became much richer and much more meaningful when we had our own specialist staff in those areas.</p></speech>

My particular role was in relation to the consumer area and we were on the phone constantly to each other updating the information, because we had to very careful that the information we gave to consumers was exactly right.  We couldn't simply say, in a trivial way, "Your money is safe".  We had to actually say precisely what that means, precisely what was guaranteed.  You'll recall the deposit protection scheme increased over that period of time, so we had to make sure we gave them that information very, very quickly.</p> <p>  And the other issue was, having seen Northern Rock, our focus on the consumer side was not on the wholesale run that others might've been looking at but very much on the possibility of a retail run, queues forming outside of a bank and what that might do in terms of a visual.  So we were extremely worried about it and we were constantly ... we ... you know, we got a phone call to say, there was a photograph of a bank, you know, with two people standing outside, we'd immediately be on to say "Please rectify the situation".  And then, on the consumer information line, we had to pull staff to make sure that we could answer ... because a phone ringing out would send a really signal.  So we had outsourced that service but we had to make sure we increased our capacity in relation to doing that.</p> <p>  And then, the other issue I remember is, on the day after the guarantee, we had about 15,000 visits to the website.  So nowadays, of course, a lot of people get their information from the website ... 15,000 people ... we'd a thousand calls ... and again, we were ourselves trying to understand precisely what the guarantee meant for consumers and we had to portray that information in an accurate way.  So it was continuous, really, all through 2008 and into 2009.</p></speech>

Okay.  So the ..., I think the legislation was very good.  I think bringing everything back within one organisation had to be done because something had to be shown to revive confidence in the system.  Something different had to happen.  But I would also say that I don't think the structure, of itself, was actually a major causal issue because, I think, even in a new organisation, in a single organisation, you're still going to have two specialist areas - one looking at financial stability issues, one looking at micro-prudential issues.  And if those two areas don't have absolute clarity of role and don't work together very well, then, I think, you can the same problem.  So while I think changing the structure is a good idea, I think that that wasn't, of itself, the same problem.  And if I may add one thing, because I wouldn't be true to my previous role as consumer director, if I didn't say that I thought it was also very important that the new structure retained the two pillars: one of setting out the enforceable codes, which I've talked about for consumers; and the other one of providing consumer information.  And while consumer information has moved out of the Central Bank, that pillar stayed within the new consumer agency.</p></speech>

I actually think it was both.  I think the model itself was clearly inadequate.  I think we've seen that.  I also agree with the comment in Patrick Honohan's report that there should have been more follow-through, things shouldn't have gone on back and forth for so long, that there should have been ... and more significant consequences to particular actions, so I think it was both.</p></speech>

I certainly couldn't do it in that forensic level of detail, but I think one issue that you haven't mentioned that's also extremely important, possibly the most important thing, was the failure to identify the credit bubble as it emerged, and the failure to spot that it wasn't a soft landing.  And there I think you have the IMF, the OECD, the ECB, many others in that particular category.  And I would add that as something that was extremely important in what happened in Ireland.</p></speech>

We were ... carried out the much more intrusive level of supervision, we challenged every day, and I think probably the biggest issue in terms of the question that you've put to me was around the banks' business plans, so at that stage the banks were providing their business plans for what the future of their business would be.  And we saw a lot of ... because we could see all the business plans we saw a lot of overlap around what they were doing and therefore questioned the profitability that would be there.  We also then sought to identify, well, what were the major issues that would lead to that profitability and really challenge those in a much more robust way.  So that was probably most of 2009.</p></speech>

Because there's an area of confusion around this.  So can you just, on the record, what administrative sanctions were available to the regulator?</p></speech>

I know it was in time to introduce the consumer protection code and enforce it, and we had actually been very vocal with Government to say that we wanted the fine increased to a level of &euro;5 million at that time.</p></speech>

What about, we'll say, prudential lending?  About, we'll say, breach of guidelines, where effectively that they could only, we'll say, up to 200%, 250% in terms of ... within any category of loans?</p></speech>

And that's what we did with the consumer protection code.  The model in relation to prudential regulation is that they were not codified, that they were set out as guidelines, but they could have been codified, if that's the question you're asking me?</p></speech>

You made reference in one of your earlier contributions where you spoke about that you ... the 100% mortgage and how we react to the 100% mortgage, and you said that ... it was about the capacity to repay.  So the question I suppose I'd ask is: would you not take into your thinking that, with 100% mortgage, that you were leaving the borrower far more exposed in terms of negative equity in the fall in the value of their property, and that there was a certain, we'll say, element of enormous amount of risk in allowing the 100% mortgages to continue?</p></speech>

It was in our consumer information that we put on the website to warn consumers that if you took out 100% mortgages this is what could happen.  But I don't have the figures on this, but I do suspect that the majority of people who are in terrible situations with their mortgages now are not actually the 100% mortgages, that actually it was even lower levels of that that were the issue in terms of affordability.</p></speech>

I just want to get your position on this 100% mortgage.</p><p>To use an analogy, it's like the Road Safety Authority telling people to put on their seat belts and people should be listening to them and putting on their seat belts.  But if a car manufacturer's making cars without seat belts, then somebody else has to do something with the car manufacturer.  It's one thing to tell people to be mindful of availing of 100% mortgages, it's another thing to say "Stop providing them".  Do you have a view as to whether 100% mortgages were a suitable product and that they should be been taken off the market?</p></speech>

And I fully support the actions now taken by Governor Honohan in relation to this.  At the time 100% mortgages were introduced, what we did at that stage was say "You can only sell them to customers where they can afford them and where they are suitable" and that warnings had to be given in relation to negative equity.  So that's what we did, if I can distinguish, at the time, for hindsight.</p></speech>

I just want to ask a question on that, if I may.  In paragraph 20 of their report they say "The authorities did not formally produce any estimate for aggregate bank losses.  They have focused on the needed restructuring of property-development loans, which they rightly view as at the heart of stress faced by banks".  Why didn't you have any estimates for aggregate bank losses at the time?</p></speech>

And, in fact, even after that, even after NAMA was set up - and NAMA had specialist valuers - it still took a significant length of time after that because, basically, land banks had to be looked at, individual loans had to be looked at, connections had to be looked at, what collateral was there.  So it took a longer time to do it than you might have expected.</p></speech>

I think at that stage they were looking at what might have been done in other countries and in other countries it wasn't just the larger loans but it was also some smaller loans.  I think here the Department were of the view that it would be the larger loans.  And again, there was a sequence in there.</p></speech>

And, again, I think at that stage NAMA took the approach - and NAMA will explain to you how this worked much better than I - that they would take all the connected loans.  And, in fact, that actually sped up what you rightly said was a very long process.  That actually sped it up by taking all the connected loans and, again, some countries had done this differently.  So the IMF would be looking at what other countries had done and in some other countries they had done it differently.</p></speech>

In paragraph 25 of that same report it states that, "Staff noted that nationalization could become necessary, which would be seen as complementary to NAMA."

So once we knew what the level of the loan losses were going to be, those type of decisions would then be much easier, of course.</p></speech>

So it didn't surprise me that there wasn't any enforcement action.  And I think in the case of one particular issue that came to the board, as I recall it, rather than dealing with it as an enforcement action with the fining type powers, it was dealt with by way of an additional capital requirement for a particular firm.  So that would have been dealt with in that way but the model that was adopted was that the enforcement actions would be predominantly on the consumer area.</p></speech>

Can I ask you, Ms O'Dea, the IMF mission in 2009 referred to the lack of a resolution regime.  Can you explain the Financial Regulator's views on the need for a resolution regime in 2009?</p></speech>

At the time and actually, to me, it's a clear sign that nobody envisaged what was going to happen across Europe because there was no special resolution regime for banks.  Banks have to be treated differently, as we now know, in terms of how they're resolved.  It has to be done in a particular way and the IMF were simply pointing out that this should be a standard part of the toolkit for any regulatory crisis.</p></speech>

It states:<blockquote><br /><br />The parties ... [now this involved both the regulator and the Central Bank] will cooperate fully in their relations with and participation in international fora on financial stability issues.  In some cases, this will involve dual representation in certain fora.  In cases where only one party is represented, the other undertakes to contribute information and advice in advance of any meeting.  The party attending will fully brief the other after the meeting.</blockquote>Did that mechanism actually operate in the period between 2003, when it was drawn up, and 2009?</p></speech>

The issue of credit growth was discussed several times.  Eventually, there was the additional capital requirements, as you know, in relation to the CRD, that were brought in which were unfortunately too late and not sufficient enough and, of course, the issue of credit growth as I have already explained to you in my consumer role, led to the particular actions we took there.</p></speech>

F&aacute;ilte romhat, Ms O'Dea.  Can I first ask you during your period as acting CEO of the Financial Regulator you'd initiated a number of changes to increase the intensity of banking supervision.  Can you describe to the committee some of the key changes you made during that period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Mary O'Dea" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#S01200"><p>Yes, if you just bear with me for a moment, I just made a reminder of them here.  So one of the things we did was we increased the reporting.  We had reports on things but they were, unfortunately, not frequent enough for us, so we increased the periodic reporting in profitability, impairment provisioning, regulatory capital liquidity, lending and governance, and then we had a monthly report where we could analyse these.  We also sat on ... some of the inspectors would sit in at board meetings or credit committee meetings so that we could see them operating in practice.  One of the things, I think, that we had learned at that stage was that we had been overly focused on the process and not so much on the outcome.  And that by actually sitting in at the board meetings you could see the outcome and we were very, very focused on credit and credit decisions at that particular time.</p></speech>

You mentioned, and correct me if I'm wrong, to Deputy McGrath that during your period principles regulation was not active, that you weren't practising, is that correct?</p></speech>

More challenging regulation is what I would call it.  And again, rather than check the model, we were checking the outcome.  We were engaging with the banks, we were much more challenging with the banks.</p></speech>

I didn't know that there was a middle one called intrusive regulation.  Is that an international standard-type of regulation?</p></speech>

But actually, principles-based regulation has a lot of rules.  There was an awful lot of rules that were set out.  And this is a really important point actually, because when we came to do some of our investigations, some of our particular investigations, one of the things that we looked at were what rules were there that could have been breached whether or not they were set out by Europe or whether or not they were in law.  And we were then able to either report those if they were into the legal territory or liaise with the guards and this was something I did in my time to say, '' an we go ahead and pursue some of these breaches of the requirements without infecting any process that you have?''  So we liaised with the guards in relation to that.</p></speech>

Did you scrap those principles when you took ... when you abandoned principles-based regulation or were they still in place?</p></speech>

We were in absolute crisis mode.  We certainly weren't revising rules at that stage.

There was ... you didn't ... you didn't have to change any rules, you didn't have to have a change of documents, you just actually decided to send investigators into the banks, which were always the power within principles-based regulation and asked for more reports and asked for more documents.  Is that not the case that there was no real change to the type of the regulation, it's just how you applied the type of regulation?</p></speech>

But you are right to say that the law elsewhere hadn't changed.  The practice of doing regulation had changed not just in Ireland, actually, but it had changed everywhere.</p></speech>

There was discussion about the press release, I think, from the Government sent out on June 18 2009 and I'll quote from the document.  It says: ''The reference to a specific differential regulatory focus for international financial services located in Ireland.  The Central Bank's-----</p></speech>

''The Central Bank's concerned that this might be perceived in the market as us suggesting lighter tough regulatory approach for IFSC entities than to domestic entities which could have negative reputational consequences for new structures''.  So the question I am asking you is: what were the concerns of the ... at the time in relation to this idea of light touch regulation for IFSC?  And during your period of acting regulator of ... of the Financial Regulator ... did you have to deal with legacy issues of IFSC banks, for example, like Depfa Bank-----</p></speech>

And we thought that this would be very negative both as a matter of substance and also as a matter of reputation.  So we did actually say that we don't want any perceptions whatsoever and drew the attention of the parties, the Government parties to that to say that they should be very careful how this was phrased because we didn't want to have that differentiation.  And then in terms of the day-to-day dealings, the main focus of 2009 was very much on the domestic banks.  The main focus was on the domestic banks.  There were also discussions with other international regulators about banks who had a presence here.  So there were discussions around that but the principal focus was on the domestic banks.</p></speech>

Just to come back to some earlier issues, just to tidy it up.  Just because or as you've said yourself, Ms O'Dea, no enforcement sanctions were taken.

Again, it depended on the issue.  One of the things at the time that we were very intolerant of was regulatory reporting issues.  The information was absolutely crucial to the decisions that we made, so if banks were not reporting information accurately, we took a very serious view of that and immediately moved towards a sanction regime.</p></speech>

Briefly Ms O'Dea I just want to ask was the excessive credit growth that took place in the economy a matter that should have been covered or looked into or examined by the regulator or the Central Bank in the period which we are discussing?</p></speech>

I think both organisations, and I answered another question in relation to the structure, about having a clear level of role and responsibilities.  My understanding all through that time was that the Central Bank clearly had the role for systemic financial stability and I think the build-up of a credit bubble within the economy falls within that jurisdiction.  Also my understanding was that the regulator had responsibility for looking at the micro-prudential areas, so I think the build-up of credit within particular institutions would fall within that.</p></speech>

Between 1996 and 2006 the price of a home for an ordinary person increased by the equivalent of the average industrial wage each year for ten years.  Now, the profiteering and the speculation that was responsible for that situation was driven by massive lending by the banks, including the banks taking wholesale funds from international institutions and laying them out, and then changing rules like mortgages increased from their parents 20 years to 35 or 40 years etc., etc., so that young people who were desperate to start a home, you know, were forced to go under this system.  Did your office and the Financial Regulator board fail miserably to protect young people caught in this bind or not?</p></speech>

And I think that is absolutely true and as consumer director, as somebody who held the position of consumer director, I think it absolutely true to say that consumers are in a very difficult position and I regret that the regulator was unable to prevent that situation.</p></speech>

And the fact that the regulatory system didn't go into a mode of alarm and opposition to this and try and stop it, why did that happen when it was so obvious how the ... this generation was just being screwed to the wall by what was going on by banks and developers?</p></speech>

At the end of this process Ms O'Dea, this committee is going to make findings, findings with statements of fact and recommendations and this will be one of the areas that we will be specifically referring to in our report.  You spoke all morning about the advice that you were giving customers outside there and potential customers.  I want to get down to the detail of what you were doing with the banks during that time.  So can I ask you, you mentioned that the banks have to do affordability checks on high loan-to-value mortgages.  When you continued to see that the high-value mortgages were being handed out by banks, despite your guidelines, which you just spoke about the moment, were any investigations ever done into the affordability checks that were done by the banks?</p></speech>

Agreed.  And the Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis now resuming in public session, I can remind members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  Today we are now continuing our hearings with senior officials in the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Regulator and, our next session, we will now hear from Mr. Cyril Roux, deputy governor of the financial regulation, Central Bank.</p><p>Mr Cyril Roux was appointed to the position of deputy governor of the Central Bank on 1 October 2013 with responsibility for financial regulation.  Prior to taking up the role, he served as first deputy secretary general at the French insurance supervisory authority.  He also served as a board member of the ANC, the French accounting standard-setting authority.  Mr. Roux, you're very welcome to the committee today.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You're directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information that they have come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and the answers which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In addition, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the joint inquiry into the banking crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So, with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the affirmation to you.</p></speech>

As regards the first theme of inquiry, I'm not close enough to the Irish experience of the previous decade to provide this knowledgeable committee with special insight.  That said, I'm well aware of the severe economic hardship brought about by the crisis.  Many Irish households and Irish firms still suffer from it today.  Hence all parties, including the Central Bank, must continue to do their utmost to prevent a replay of the banking crisis and to protect the financial stability of the country.  I'll share with you what I know of the reforms put in place here after the crisis and before I joined and I'll present the further European reforms that I have replaced them with in the past year and a half.</p> <p>  In October 2013, as I came into office, two independent, large-scale exercises were in train to assess the effectiveness of the domestic framework that had been designed and put in place by my predecessor, Mr. Matthew Elderfield, between 2010 and 2013.  The first exercise was a balance sheet assessment of the three remaining covered banks, conducted as part of the 2013 financial measures programme.  It concluded with a view that the covered banks were mostly in financial working order and required only moderate strengthening of their provisions, which they did bring into their year-end accounts, in the main.</p> <p>  The second large-scale exercise was the IMF review of Ireland's observance of the Basel core principles for effective banking supervision.</p><p>The IMF found that since the crisis has begun the Central Bank had taken substantive steps to rebuild its functions in financial regulation and supervision, including changes in the institutional setting, changes of senior staff, and increases in the quantity, albeit from a very low base, and the calibre of supervisory staff.  The IMF acknowledged the design and implementation of a proactive and intensive approach to banking supervision, the expansion of prudential requirements and improvement in enforcement powers.  Overall, the IMF ascribed to the Central Bank as of 2013 a satisfactory level of compliance with the aforementioned Basel core principles for effective banking supervision.<br/><br/>Taken together, these two reviews gave me sufficient assurance that Irish banks, and Irish banking supervision, albeit not without further progress, had been put on a more solid footing and that I could direct our 2014 efforts to moving towards the entry into force of the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  This entailed two major lines of work.  The first line of work was internal and organisational - I will describe its outcome later.  The second line of work was a comprehensive assessment.  Under the leadership of the ECB, we conducted, like all the other national supervisory authorities of the eurozone, an asset quality review and a stress test of the top 120 eurozone banking groups.  The results were published in the comprehensive assessment report of the ECB in October 2014.  The ECB found that around one out of five eurozone banking groups was in need of recapitalisation.  Out of the top four Irish banks, only Permanent TSB was found to need supplementary capital to fully withstand an adverse stress test.  PTSB subsequently raised the required capital in May of this year.<br/><br/>Let me now change tack and describe the overhaul of the banking regulatory framework.  Domestically, between 2010 and 2013, the Oireachtas and the Central Bank introduced several pieces of legislation, codes and regulations which much strengthened the requirements weighing on commercial banks and the hand of the Central Bank in supervising them and enforcing against their breaches.  These new requirements were additional to the prevailing European capital requirement directive.  Internationally, between 2010 and 2013, three large initiatives unfolded that are directly relevant to matters of the inquiry. <br/><br/>First, in 2010, the EU adopted the European system of financial supervision, comprising the European Systemic Risk Board and the three European supervisory authorities, including the European Banking Authority.  The ESRB is tasked with micro-prudential oversight in Europe, while the European Banking Authority is in charge of banking supervisory convergence and drafting secondary legislation.  Also in 2010, the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision addressed the inadequacies of its second agreement and replaced it by the third agreement of Basel III.  The third agreement formed a basis of the new prudential banking regulatory framework in Europe, adapted under the Irish Presidency of the EU and enshrined in the fourth capital requirement directive, CRD IV, and the capital requirement regulation, CRR.  They have been in force from 1 January 2014.<br/><br/>Finally in 2012, the EU Heads of State and Government decided on the banking union, which also started to come into force in 2014 as far as the Single Supervisory Mechanism is concerned.  The changes have been profound.  I will try to give you a flavour of the depth and breadth of this new, multifaceted regime starting with CRD IV and CRR.  Both the quantity and quality of capital that banks are required to hold are now much increased, whereas up to the end of 2013 banks could operate with as little as 2% of capital.  They need now at least 4.5% of a more tightly defined equity.  Furthermore, the new regulatory framework introduces the possibility for macro-prudential authorities to impose several additional capital requirements, known as buffers, to all banks in their jurisdiction.  The Central Bank has been designated as the macro-prudential authority for this purpose in March 2014.<br/><br/>From 1 January 2016, as agreed throughout Europe, all banks will also have to begin building one of these buffers, the capital conservation buffer, for an additional 2.5% of risk-weighted assets.  Liquidity requirements were domestic until then.  They are now harmonised at a much tighter level under the liquidity coverage ratio of the CRR.  The existing Central Bank liquidity requirements, which were introduced in January 2007, are being replaced by this LCR, which will be fully binding in 2018.  The CRR also introduced a net stabled funding obligation, and a leverage ratio requirement which caps banks assets to no more than 33 times Tier 1 capital.<br/><br/>Finally, the quality and granularity of banks&rsquo; regulatory reporting have also been significantly enhanced from January 2014 by the CRR, and subsequent guidelines and standards of the European Banking Authority covering financial reporting, credit risk, operational risk, own funds and capital adequacy ratios.  The transformation of the regulatory framework for banks, from what it was up to the end of 2013 to what it is becoming, does not stop at prudential supervisory requirements.  Lessons were also learned about the way to resolve the difficulties of banks that are failing or likely to fail.  This has entailed another change in regulatory framework through the adaption of the bank recovery and resolution directive, BRRD, and enactment of the Single Resolution Mechanism.  The BRRD and the Single Resolution Mechanism aim to create a predictable framework for resolving banks that fail in the future.  BRRD provides a toolkit for resolving banks, such as a bailing-in of unsecured liabilities in lieu of the bailing out of the banks by taxpayers.  The Central Bank has been designated as a national resolution authority, and is already working with the banks to double up resolution plans in line with BRRD requirements.  For larger eurozone banks, including our own, resolution decisions will be made from January of next year, by the single resolution board in Brussels<b>.  </b>It will avail of the new propounded resolution funds in the eurozone, which are to be gradually mutualised.<br/><br/>Let me now turn to the transformation of the supervision of eurozone banks from 2014.  As I mentioned earlier, in 2012, EU Heads of State and Government agreed to transfer the responsibility for supervising banks to the European level, with the establishment of the SSM.  Eurozone banks have come under the supervision of the ECB since 4 November 2014.  The ECB directly supervises the largest European banks, including Bank of Ireland, AIB, Permanent TSB, and Ulster Bank, with our assistance and that of other national supervisors.  We supervise the smaller banks, under the oversight of the ECB.<br/><br/>The revamped banking supervisory framework that was put in place at the Central Bank by Matthew Elderfield has mostly been superseded by the SSM.  Our domestic supervisory engagement cycle, our approval procedures, our internal supervisory guidance, enshrined in PRISM, were effective from 2011 to October 2014.  They have now been replaced by the prescriptions of the SSM supervisory manual, which are guided by a similar, if not more tough, intrusive and sceptical ethos.<br/><br/>Daily supervision of the larger banks is conducted by joint supervisory teams, mostly made of central bank staff, but always headed by an ECB co-ordinator based in Frankfurt.  These co-ordinators propose draft decisions, during consultation with us, to the supervisory board of the ECB where I sit.  When approved, these draft decisions are submitted to the governing council and finally signed by the President of the ECB.<br/><br/>In the Central Bank, banking supervision was re-organised and further strengthened in the course of 2014.  Approved headcount in banking supervision was brought up to 140, and the actual headcount has increased to 124.  We have thus reduced, albeit partially, the numerical gap with eurozone standards.  Instead of two generalist divisions, we now have three: one is dedicated to ongoing supervision; one to specialist expertise; and a wholly new third division carries out on-site inspections year-round.  This structure aligns the Central Bank with the organisational requirements of the SSM and further enhances our supervision.</p><p> Let me conclude by restating a few key messages.  In our country, the institutional arrangement of financial regulation, the engagement framework and practice of prudential banking supervision were overhauled during the tenure of Matthew Elderfield in the wake of our domestic banking crisis.  As of 2013, much repair had been achieved.  On the European stage, the lessons of the global banking crisis resulted in an overhaul of regulation, supervision and resolution that has started unfolding at the end of 2013.  While the EFSF was put in place in 2011, CRD IV, CRR and BRRD come gradually into force from 2014 up to the end of the decade.  The SSM is operational since November 2014 and the SRB will assume its functions in January 2016.  These new European regulations and institutional arrangements have, in the main, superseded the domestic response of 2010-2013 to our national banking crisis and they are designed to address the challenges of public banking oversight and resolution at a European level, in the area of national decision making that prevailed until 2013.  Thank you.</p></speech>

So, with that said, to get matters under way, if I can invite Deputy McGrath to lead off the questions.  Deputy, you have 15 minutes.</p></speech>

Mr. Roux, you're very welcome.  And can I start by asking you do you believe that you now have sufficient powers to take direct action against banks, if that were necessary, to avoid another financial stability crisis?</p></speech>

It's not that I have sufficient powers - I am part of a system which decides.  So I do believe that the ECB has sufficient powers, but they are the decision maker now.</p></speech>

And you might just explain how the regulation is working in practice now, the division of responsibilities between the Central Bank in Ireland and the ECB.  You have gone into it in an element of detail in your testimony which you provided but can you just advise the committee how that works in practice?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cyril Roux" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#Y00600"><p>Yes.  It's fairly ... it's fairly long but anything that is prudential supervision, prudential powers, that are listed in CRD IV, CRR, there's a single decision maker and that's the governing council of the ECB, for the largest banks - so, in our country, for the four that I've listed plus the subsidiaries of eurozone group.  For instance, KBC is ... is also ... decisions on KBC are taken by the ECB because KBC is one of a top 120 groups.  I've only listed the four Irish ... either Irish headed or when the head is outside of the eurozone, but ... so for these ... for these banks, the decision ... the decisions on prudential matters are for the ECB to take.  The decisions for the smaller banks are for us to take, but under the oversight and the rule book of the ECB.  So we have to replace our procedures by the ECB-mandated procedures.  So that's for prudential supervision.  But we do more than prudential supervision, of course.  We do also the supervision of ... conduct supervision - that's outside of the ECB - and we do anti-money laundering - that's outside of the ECB as well.  So we remain fully responsible for these parts.</p></speech>

And I do so in the context of <i>The Irish Times</i>article this morning detailing some correspondence you had with the Department of Finance, albeit in relation to the insurance sector, but you raised some important issues in your letter to the Secretary General of the Department of Finance where you refer to a staff vacancy rate in the enforcement division was close to 40% due to Government pay restrictions.  Would you like to comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cyril Roux" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#Y00800"><p>Certainly.  So I think the staff working on banking ... well, you have the staff in banking supervision that I alluded to in my opening remarks, so with the three divisions that we have there ... so I think we've calculated the number of people we need.  There's a benchmarking exercise done at the ECB.  So we are towards the lower end in terms of number of people but ... so that will be revisited by the ECB benchmarking all national supervisory authorities.  Then you have the staff in enforcement and the staff in policy - banking policy - and developing the regulations.  So ... the issues are not exactly the same for the three blocks.  So I would say for prudential supervision, we have some vacancies.  We have 124 people when we have our approved complement ... or we have estimated we need 140.  But I think, here, where we are an outlier is mostly in terms of supervisory experience.  There's a lot of people coming and going and this is very different, for instance, from what I've experienced in France where you have on-site inspectors that stay for 15, 20, 25 years.  So when you compare the lengths of experience of our staff ... although they're remarkable staff, but they're gaining experience ... they just have fewer years of experience than their counterparts.</p></speech>

So the only possibility for staff to be paid more is to change jobs and they change jobs, so we have a lot of churn.  Because there are vacancies and there's a lot of opportunities within the Central Bank to apply to new jobs, so you see people changing jobs to get paid more, which is, of course, the ... the thing ... the thing-----</p></speech>

So it's ... it's not as if, you know, there's only an inflow - there's inflow and outflow.

Yes, but now ... what didn't exist at the time and exists now is that we have also an on-site division of 40 people and these ... sorry, and these 40 people will go on site in these banks and other banks, so, the on-site work is now, has to be added to these teams.  And then we have a third division, the analytics divisions were we have specialist expertise.  So if you want a special focus on, say, commercial real estate risk, credit risk in commercial real estate in this bank or that bank, you go to that third division.  So, in fact, you know you have to add up these teams, of four to six people, plus a co-ordinator in Frankfurt, because they have a line through Frankfurt.  Then you have the on-site inspectors, and then you have the specialist expertise on credit, risk liquidity risk, operational risk, etc.</p></speech>

I mentioned that in my statement.  But maybe to give more flavour, for instance, the FINREP reporting.  We moved from eight templates to 46 templates, so that's CRR and the allotment of CRR,  so the amount of reporting is, is much increased.  So we have a lot more granular data and we are ... the supervision done now through the SSM is heavy on data and reporting and, and quantitatively-based, so we have a lot of information on ... on what is building up in, in the banks ... so, yes.</p></speech>

Can I ask you Mr. Roux to clear up one thing ... this issue of principles-led regulation, which was used in Ireland and is being cited as the method of regulation in the developed world.  Where did it come from?  What's the provenance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-10a.504" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Cyril Roux" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061000002#Z00900"><p>I listened to a few of the ... the other witnesses, and I'm struck by the fact that on ... there is this wording: "principles-based" versus "rules-based".  And when people describe it, they don't describe principle-based versus rule-based, what they describe is putting the onus on the banks themselves to solve their problems, or not taking ... being sceptical and challenging the banks.  And, to me, this is nothing to do with being rule-based or principle-based; it's, it's an ethos.</p> <p>  So, I think you can build a very challenging principle-based supervision, if you are, you know ... Or you can be a book checking rule-based supervisor.  The question is whether you have the skills to challenge.  You, you go into ... into the meat, into the substance, so you go into the collateral evaluations and you go into the impairments and you go into the accounts and you're challenging.  It's not really ... I think the moniker of principle-based or rule-based do not really describe the change in regime.  And the other reason why I think it doesn't really describe this is, okay, we have CRD IV now ... and it's more detailed, but we had CRD III and CRD II before and they were quite detailed.  So there are rules; there were rules as well before.</p></speech>

Is that what you're saying?  You can put it in your own words, but-----</p></speech>

What I would say that, Europe has chosen a very detailed rule book approach.  So if you compare the Basel III accord and the CRD IV,  CRD IV is supposed to be the transcription of the Basel III accord, but it's way bigger, way more detailed.  So that's the European approach, we want tonnes of rules.  Now, you know, the more you write rules, the more you write loopholes into rules, so, you know you could very well ... you can very well have thousands of pages of rules, which we have, and still miss ... you know, miss the ... miss the trick.  So what you need is the mindset not to check the boxes but to challenge, to be sufficiently skilled to have the right, the right people.  And these right people they have to be, you know, accountants, and experienced supervisors and, and lawyers and ... quants and credit risk analysts, etc, people that know their stuff, and be able to challenge the banks.</p></speech>

But can I ask you, Mr. Roux, to give us your view on the responsibility for the regulation of the banks in Ireland in the years leading up to the crisis?  To what extent can it be attributed to weak rules at a European level, or to what extent do you believe it is related to the system of regulation in Ireland and the manner in which that regulation was actually carried out?  Where do you apportion a weighting on both of those?</p></speech>

And a recognition of that is that when, in 2014, through the comprehensive assessment that I referred to in my speech ... there was the asset quality review of the comprehensive assessment and we were able to convince the ECB that we could reuse the balance sheet assessment of 2013 because it was so comprehensive, it was so challenging and there was a lot of quality assurance built in ... we have a very detailed work, that we convinced them that we could reuse this.  So I think, when I arrived, we knew very well the Irish banks.  And I think, it's a credit to the team, it's a credit to financial regulation but also to Governor Honohan and the rest of the bank, because the quality assurance was given on this by the financial stability division in the central banking part of the bank.  You know, loan loss forecast ... I think there was a lot of work done on the banks since the beginning of the decade and our knowledge of the banks are ... is really very good.</p></speech>

Well, I think the people best placed to judge are people that are professional supervisors and know what good supervision look like and bad supervision look like.  And who are they.? Peers?  So ... or the IMF? And we go through constant IMF and peer reviews.  So, for instance, fitness and property standards, okay, this is last harmonised than capital requirements.  So we have guidelines and ... from the EBA.  The EBA conducted a review of our fitness and property performance in 2014 and out of all the countries in the EU, only eight were fully compliant and were at the highest standard of fitness and property surveillance, and Ireland was part of that.  Now, I think we can get some comfort on this bit.  And then you have how we monitor large exposures.  There's another review there by the EBA.  Then you have the IMF reviews.  The IMF teams ... they go throughout the world looking at the way, you know, national supervisory authorities operate.  So I think we can take their reviews, you know, seriously.  So we had the 2013 review, which was published in Spring of 2014 ... they're coming back, and in the spring of 2016, they will be back here and they will do a financial service programme review, an FSAP review.  And so we'll be doing another round of you know, assessment of our effectiveness.</p></speech>

Okay, so I will answer, you know, exactly, on enforcement ... on credit institutions ... so, since I arrived ... okay, I'll look at 2013 and 2014 ... 2013, Allied Irish Banks entered into a settlement with us for failing to ensure the accuracy of its liquidity reporting and to have internal controls in place and there are ... Allied Irish Banks admitted to the contraventions, they accepted a reprimand and penalty of &euro;490,000.  Citibank Europe entered into a settlement with us on contraventions of liquidity requirements and also paid a monetary penalty of half a million.  In 2014, Ulster Bank had, as we know, IT governance failures as, you know, 600,000 customers were affected ... deprived of banking for close to a month and they accepted a reprimand and they got a maximum penalty we could inflict on them, which was &euro;3.5 million.  The maximum ... maximum is &euro;5 million but when you come forward and you accept to enter into a settlement, you have a 30% discount, so &euro;3.5 million was the maximum amount that we could settle with.</p><p>In 2014 we entered into two other settlements, UniCredit Bank for &euro;300,000, and Bank of Montreal for &euro;650,000.  Now, there are other cases that are ongoing, and these are settlements, but there are other cases that are ongoing, and they ... the bigger the case, the longer it takes.  And we have also cases where the party is not willing to settle, and so that has to be referred to inquiry.  So it goes to the legal department and then it goes to inquiry and it's a very lengthy process of, you know, of enforcing penalties on these banks.</p></speech>

We supervise 10,000 financial service providers, 10,000, and out of which we have 200 banks.  So there's not only the, you know, the four banks that we talk about all the time but we have a number of wholesale banks, and branches and subsidiaries of wholesale banks.  As you know, we supervise the credit institution ... the credit union sector.  We have a number of ... hundreds of insurance companies and re-insurance companies.  We have thousands of retail intermediaries and ... all told, so that's 10,000 people ... 10,000, sorry, 10,000 firms that we supervise.

Well, up until the Central Bank supervisory and enforcement Act of August 2013, as I said, the maximum fine was &euro;5 million.  Only breaches that have happened since August 2013 can be punished by a bigger penalty, which goes up to 10% of turnover.  But, as you mentioned, elsewhere there are much, much bigger penalties and it is baffling to me, although you could extract billions, tens of billions, hundreds of billions, you know, there is still wrongdoing committed.  So that's really incredible that you have ... take the biggest French bank being fined or entering its settlement with the US authorities for I think something like $9 billion and then saying subsequently that it won't affect their dividend.  So how much money do you need to extract?  It's just ... it seems ... it seems almost ... it's never enough to deter, it seems.  It's just amazing.  So I think your question is well posed in saying, well, then you have to go into individual responsibility and white-collar crime.  But the white-collar crime, I think that's an issue that, you know, I would ... certainly the Governor spoke about that not long ago.  But it's something that is, you know, partially beyond me.

And Professor Lane's testimony as well where he raised this sum initially.  And the proposition, I think, that was put forward by Professor Lane at that time is, we need to consider to move the fines onto the bankers and away from the banks.  As long as the bank is actually absorbing the fine it's just put in as part of the profit and loss margin, but the actual ... the people who are making the decisions are not affected by it.  Would you have any consideration with regard to that proposition?</p></speech>

But I think maybe, you know, it's what deters is criminal proceedings and jail terms.  Now, the level of evidence to put people in jail is very high.  It's, you know, the kind of requirements that we're looking at are requirements on firms, you know, they have to have sufficient liquidity and solvency and reporting rules.  But to attach a failure to any single individual is a very high bar in this jurisdiction, so, you know, it's something that's to be considered in the round.</p></speech>

I think it was a, you know, a much-needed response and a much-needed improvement in the specialisation, in the organisation, in, you know, in framing banking supervision.  So I think that it's ... it's fair to say that when I arrived, I had a much, much better banking supervision than when he arrived.  But then I had to replace that by something else.</p></speech>

But the system, the PRISM system, no longer applies to Irish banks because now it applies through the ECB system, IMAS.  Now, where is IMAS coming from?  Well the ECB looked at the various systems across the eurozone and ... to decide not to build something from scratch but take one and build from it.  Which one did they choose?  They chose PRISM.  So they took the Irish system and built on it.</p></speech>

Some people might find that astonishing after all we've been through.  So could I ask you if the Central Bank anticipated non-compliance, had it been aware of this and, if so, why did it not address these issues in advance, or ... and what has been done since to rectify the situation?  Are all those compliance issues now resolved?</p></speech>

So I'll take them one by one.  The first is independence accountability, that's Basel principle 2.  So the independence of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator has been found to be compromised in Ireland by the fact that the Secretary General of the Department of Finance  is a member of the CBI commission.  And the other independence issue that has been raised by the IMF is the fact that members of the commission, including myself, can be removed without explanations being given.  So, I see that, for instance, in other countries, such as France, if the French Deputy Governor cannot be removed, cannot just ... cannot be removed unless for, you know, just egregious behaviour, but he cannot be removed.  I can be removed today, and with no explanation given, and other members of the Central Bank commission.</p></speech>

So I think here we've made some progress as we've increased staffing in banking supervision by moving the approved resources from 110 to 140, and when the Central ... when the IMF came, the number of people in banking supervision was just a little under 100, and now as I said, we're 124.  That's a 25% increase.  So I think we've, you know, we've closed much of that gap.</p> <p>  The second is supervisory techniques and tools.  So here I think the Central ... the IMF, as I mentioned, recognised that we have made a lot of progress.  I've mentioned ... I quoted other parts of their internal review that we've made substantive steps, but there were things in that were not ... we're not up to the standards.  What are the things that we're not up to the standards?  But we're not looking at the returns in the way as thoroughly as the IMF wanted, so we get a lot of returns, but they felt that other supervisors would spend more time in looking at them and challenging them, and I think that's quite different now in the SSM.  So I think that's very clear, and we'll see next year it's different.  The other thing is they felt is we didn't have enough on-site supervision, so that's closed as well because we ... and third, we didn't spend as much time as we needed on the low impact supervision.  Again, I said with 10,000 regulated entities, 9,500 as low impact as PRISM said that we should have only low ... reactive supervision.  That's not acceptable for the IMF.</p></speech>

The IMF felt that section 17 of the Criminal Justice Act of 110 asked for statutory guidelines to be issued and we looked at that and the Department of Justice said "Well, we can't issue these guidelines because that would be inconsistent with the primary legislation".  So, in fact, I think here we have the right legislation, it's just that there was a power under the Act that was not being used by Department ... by Minister for Justice.  It's really not a question for us to enter technically but I do think that on substance, it's addressed and the reason why I'm saying that I believe that on substance it's addressed, it's because of FATF, the Financial Action Task Force in 2013, concluded that we were technically compliant with its standards, so I think they know better.</p></speech>

Have ... has the bank learned considerably from the disaster that happened, the crash, the bubble etc.?</p></speech>

We have more specialist expertise.  It's better staffed ... what is lacking is just lengths of experience.  So, you know, just the distribution of experience is such that our staff are mostly junior staff and we can't keep them.  So, when you compare our staff to the staff that is available in other, in other supervisory authorities, they are younger, they have less experience.  We don't have as many people with five to ten years' experience but to have these people, you need to pay them.  You need to able to have a career progression and a pay progression and at present, we can't do that.</p></speech>

It is a bit ambiguous because a number of banks are under public ownership.  There are special ... there is the emergency liability scheme covering them.  So there's ... the State is also the shareholder of the banks.  So, it acts as, you know, in several capacities, so I think it's a bit ambiguous in that but there's no avoiding it.  Now, I think the bank ... the Central Bank should be fully independent as, you know, the IMF said and I do think that also to foster that independence, the regulation should be fully paid by the industry and not half paid by the taxpayer.</p></speech>

And that's something that Governor Honohan has raised before, before Oireachtas committees here in this House.  Mr. Roux, can I refer to the core booklet, Vol. 1, page 26.  I'll read out the section and it's very short.  It's headed "Examples of Interactive Engagement".  It says "Based on a review of [the] sample of board papers during 1992, 1995 and 2000, we have not identified matters escalated to the Board where it was decided that it was necessary to pursue prudential breaches by credit institutions on a more formal basis other than through interactive engagement based on moral suasion."  The policy of approach in prudential breaches through interactive engagement based on moral suasion, based on your experience, would this be normal or not approach for a central bank to take?</p></speech>

Some breaches are inadvertent and some breaches are willful.  Some breaches are ... come as a result of insufficient or defective processes and procedures, some not.  Some firms will self-disclose and they will come to us and say "We have had this breach and we are corrected them".  Some will actually try to hide, so you know, suppose you have a firm which has normally good controls and has an inadvertent breach and they come straight to us, it will treat them differently than a bank that is actually, you know, willingly breaching things and not telling us and I think we need to always move on two fronts.  So, we have to decide whether we go to ... we refer this to enforcement but that's ... referring to enforcement doesn't solve the issue in itself.  So, you have to solve it on a supervisory front as well.</p></speech>

One of the companies that you regulate, on their website promoted that they were basing a facility which provided light-touch regulation without the costs of an offshore entity, without the ... or a tax haven without the costs of a tax haven.  This was their promotional strap on their website.  Can I ask you, how could a company that you regulate promote itself in that way?

So, if they want to say they benefit from light-touch regulation, they are ... you know ... that would be a misrepresentation.</p><p>So, that's what I would say and I think, you know, soon after I arrived I ... representations were made to me by the IFSC and members of the IFSC that we couldn't regulate them in the heavy-handed way that we are regulating the ... the ... you know, domestic banks.

It's very important that people speak up and say what they think and have, you know ... have the different opinions.  So I think in the present system we have put in place risk governance panels for institutions or medium high or both.  We have risk governance panels and it's not just the team supervising them that is present and discuss, but you have people coming from other part of the ... of the house ... of the bank and they can read independently and they say, ''Well, this is not what I think you know, I have read the evidence, I know the bank less than you do but it seems that you are missing this or that '', and so these are a very good place to have frank exchange of views and it's valued to be contrarian.  So that's for the banks themselves.  And then we have other, you know, we have other committee meetings and we foster this ... this exchange, we do.</p></speech>

I mean reading the Honohan report I can't tell how things were.  What I can say ... I will, sorry to ... to take this opportunity, but I must say that since a month ago, the Freedom of Information Act has been ... is now applicable to the Central Bank.  So it's very good so, you know, people can look at every single of my credit card receipts and I have no objection to that.  But we do have requests to see all the e-mails that are exchanged internally and I find this really problematic.  Okay, so there are exemptions in the Act, you know, so we have to go though every single e-mail to see whether that falls under the exemption or whether it's commercially sensitive or, you know, which reveal ... but the fact that any time I write an e-mail or someone writes an e-mail to me they have to think whether it will ... it has the potential of being published.  And I'm not talking about e-mails that I wrote long ago; we have requests for e-mails that I wrote last ... you know, yesterday or up to the date of the submission and it's very detrimental to the way we function.  So we are writing less and it is very problematic.  We are also in meetings all the time.  I am away in Frankfurt, in ... in London, the Governor is away.  My staff are all over the place and it's problematic now, really.</p></speech>

That's part of the 2013 Act.  There is a section ... a part of that Act on whistleblower disclosures and protections.  We have a whistleblower bureau.  So if anyone in the public has, you know, something to say , which is evidenced of course, it's not just, you know ... yes ... it has to be evidenced or you have something to say and you can show that, you know, you have a basis for saying it but then their identity will be protected.</p></speech>

You know, so one of the first things that were done at the beginning of the decade was to impose fitness and probity standards.  So there was no fitness and probity standards when Matthew Elderfield arrived and they were imposed at the end of 2011.  There was a general review of boards.  I think 26 members of boards of the main retail institutions resigned.  So there was a lot of scrutiny and challenge and I think the boards now have been very different from what they were a few years ago.</p></speech>

So, what do I think about the commission in which I am in and the members and ... you know, I have no issue.  I think that they are all dedicated to the public interest and, you know, it's just the arrangement is a bit unusual.  I think the arrangement is a bit unusual because the way the legislation is made is that the  ... lot of powers are vested into the commission and not to the Governor or Deputy Governor.  And then they have to delegate most of their powers to the Governor and Deputy Governor.  It's an unusual arrangement.  It would be better to ascribe powers directly to the Governor and to the Deputy Governor and give to the commission the powers that they can actually exercise, you know, meeting every month as an oversight board, really.  They can't manage a bank, you know.</p></speech>

I think for Dexia, which is a main ... the main problematic bank there was ... it is a bank that is ... strides across three countries - Belgium first, then France and Luxembourg.</p><p>And for Dexia ... Dexia is being run off with a guarantee of &euro;90 billion shared between the three states.</p></speech>

I think we are all discussing here credit risk linked to mortgages and real estate, but there are lots of other risks that could hit us.  The biggest one is interest rate risks.  If interest rates go up by 3% or 4%, what is going to happen to households, to mortgage holders, to the firms?  This is a very serious issue?  It is a very different issue than the one we are talking about.  This is maybe the main risk, because experience is that when interest rates rise they rise very quickly and very much.  That's one risk.  Another risk is cyber risk.  We are quite concerned.  All banks experience, every day, attacks on their system.  One day they will ... they will go through and they are determined attempts to take down the European payment system or settlement system or banking system.  So these are very different risks and they're very alive and they're quite different from those of the past and the way to address them are quite different as well.</p></speech>

It's a valiant effort.  Basel II was mostly capital requirement, not very much capital.  Now we have much higher capital requirements that can be increased, we have liquidity requirements, we have a leverage ratio requirement, we have disclosure requirement, we have requirements on the compensation of risk-takers.  So instead of looking on one dimension, which I think was wrong and doomed from the start, we are now asking a number of requirements and a number of dimensions.  But you are right, it isn't tested and, you know, there might be some flaw.  It is just the best we can do.</p></speech>

Are there risks from these sources of financing that, Basel III or that, are unregulated by sectors within finance?</p></speech>

The European economy is mostly financed through bank lending, and that's different from, as we know, the US economy which is mostly financed through market funding.  So the capital markets union, that is one of the primary objectives of the current EU Commission is to grow market funding and you grow market funding by using non-banks - it is exactly the definition of that, it means through the issuance of securities, including equity.  I think it's a good thing that there is more finance through equity finance rather than debt finance.  And we have too much debt finance in the economy and that exposes more risk.  You can always decide not to pay a dividend, but you have to pay your coupon.  If you don't pay it you are defaulting.</p></speech>

I have to impact with these ... we have the fund industry, say money market funds for instance, they are regulated and we are a big place here in Ireland of money markets, and they are really regulated.  I strongly object to something you haven't said but I hear sometimes that anything that is not a bank is a shadow bank, so not regulated.  This is not true at all.

I am a board member of the European Securities and Markets Authority and I can tell you that we are looking at incredibly detailed rules.  That's the European way, it's very, very prescriptive and very detailed and very granular.  It's just very different, we don't go through capital requirements, we go through rules about client assets and custodians and settlement systems and it's a different environment.  But you're right, I think it's very good that you give me this opportunity to say well finance is not just banking and actually banking relies on this surrounding of markets and funds and other sorts of funding.</p></speech>

These are ... list the powers of the supervisory authority, and the supervisory authority is the ECB.  So, we have lots of instruments, and, if I can just take a minute, it's not as if, you know, you have supervision - and supervision is just about, you know, moral suasion and meetings with people - and then you have enforcement.  A very ... the biggest power we ... we have, I think, is that we decide the capital requirement.  So, it's not just a calculation.  We do calculations but then it's judgment based.  And when you decide, as we did here in Ireland, that the banks need 10.5% of ... of core tier 1, you force them ... or you force the State to recapitalise them.  When you ask PTSB, through the comprehensive assessment, to reach 5.5% in a stress test and they're below that, you force them to raise hundreds of millions.  So, that's not enforcement, that's supervisory powers.  You put the bar where you think it should be and then that's, you know, that costs hundreds of millions or billions.  It's a very important power.</p></speech>

Up to 4 November 2014, you know, the ECB and us were working on the comprehensive assessment but decisions were made by ... by me, you know, in a sense.  So, for instance, when Bank of Ireland issued equity at the end of 2013, you know, they wanted to make a number of ... of operations on the capital structure and that needed a supervisory approval.  So, you know, I decided, you know, what I would agree on and what I would not agree on with the bank.  And now that would go through the governing council of the ECB.</p></speech>

No, it's just, where I'm coming from with this is you pointed out to ... to Deputy McGrath earlier on that you feel ... when it's talked about the rules based and it's talked about the principles based, it's possible, you said, to have a principles based which is sufficiently intrusive with enforcement, and you could equally have a rules one that isn't so good.</p></speech>

So I'll just say two things.  First, France is one of several countries in Europe where on-site supervision is very ... very developed.  Right, there are 200 people there doing only on-site supervision and they've done on-site supervision for ... for decades.  So we have very experienced on-site supervisors and they ... they're quite robust, quite sceptical.  So, that's a signal strength of French supervision in banking and that has been brought to ... to the SSM and brought to Ireland.  The other thing is that it's very ... you know this principle based, I don't understand it, you know, you had the CRD and that was detailed enough, and then you had a further detail in secondary legislation in France, so the code that you had to apply is, you know, hundreds of pages long.  So, people would ... would apply the <i>code mon&eacute;taire et financier</i>, and that's a very detailed code.  So, that's the way, you know, that's the way we worked, you know, we'd say &quot;Well this ... this prescription here or that prescription there is infringed&quot;  and ... and you ... you ... but-----</p></speech>

So, enforcement ... and while saying it takes years, you know, and it ... it doesn't solve anything.  You just say "Well we've noticed that in the past or recently you didn't do this", so you take years to develop, and you do the enforcement case, but you need to do the supervisory power.  So, we ... you instruct or direct this to be solved by such and such a date.  So, we say we'll give you three months to solve this, you know?  For instance, you have a large exposure.  You have too ... too much exposure to one counter-party, okay, so you've reached that.  Okay, you do the enforcement case, that will take you several years.  But you want this to be solved and ... and, so you ... you have to get into a robust conversation ... how long will it take the bank to reduce that exposure?  And you can't ... sometimes if it's not just a securities that you're holding but a property or something, you know, to unwind you have to discuss it with the bank how much time you give them to unwind it.  So, that's a ... that's a supervisory dialogue.</p></speech>

In comparison to the level of financial reports you've seen in your regulatory career previously, which I ...

You know, mostly because they have now been integrated with what we call COREP and FINREP, so constantly they did reporting and financial reporting.  So, these are standards that are actually developed at the European Banking Authority and they are used throughout.  The ... there were some elements that were-----</p></speech>

There are some parts that were not under COREP and FINREP, that's the liquidity reporting, because liquidity rules were domestic ... so, were national.  So the liquidity ratio ... the French liquidity ratio is different from the Irish liquidity ratio when the reporting is ... is, you know, is ... according to domestic legislation.  So, that would be quite ... that would be different.  But, for-----</p></speech>

So the own funds, the description of the own funds, the breakdown, the calculation of the requirement, all of that is in COREP and FINREP.  For liquidity, it is not the same requirement so it is difficult to say.  Everything that appears in the requirement is then detailed in the template, it is quite different.  Anyway, now that is of the past really.  Now we're working on a harmonised template.  We are developing the liquidity templates.</p></speech>

And then I would say it is not all about the supervisor.  It is also about the business model of banks.  So the French banks in the main are universal banks, so they do not do only property-related lending; they do a lot of customer finance.  We don't have ... there is no credit unions so the small loans are also part of the business model of the banks.  Then, I guess, the structure of the economy is such that there is more industry to finance, so there is more industry financing.  Aircraft leasing, aircraft financing and shipping is also done within the banks and not outside of the banks.  It is different as well in the way that mortgages are protected through mortgage insurance and they are re-financed through securitisation and covered instruments are quite different from covered banks and the covered instruments, they are very different animals.  Also they are a lot more internationally diversified than----</p></speech>

It's actually the first thing I said to the Governor when I arrived, even before I arrived in September 2013, I said, "well it's great, you know, all the work that you have done but there is one big supervisory element missing and that's on-site supervision".

We challenge ourselves, we try and recruit IT specialists and to take that one example, so we are very alive to the fact that there are a number of risks weighing on the banking system and the financial system, not just credit risk.</p></speech>

In an earlier exchange with Mrs. O'Dea this morning on the genesis of crises and how they arise, one of the things that came under discussion was the belief system that because the previous crisis has now seen measures implemented that it is different now to what it was in the past, which is a belief system saying that it most likely won't happen again.  So in that regard, could I ask you what changes and recommendations, if any, are still outstanding from the previous reports and are there plans to introduce these changes into the future?</p></speech>

For instance the CRD IV and the BRRD and the single resolution mechanism, all of that will take the better part of a decade to unfold.  We are not finished.  There are wider risks in the financial system and they are being addressed through a great many regulations, such as securities financing, CSDR, SFDR and all of these regulations that will unfold.  There is something quite important I think that is outside of my remit but it is very important, is the accounting part.  We are still working with accounts that are based on incurred losses, not expected losses.  For an insurance supervisor this is astonishing and they will have to wait until the end of the decade to move to expected losses in the accounts of banks.  This is really bad.  Another thing which I think is really problematic is the tax advantage which is given to debt financing, so we are just encouraging a debt finance economy instead of an equity finance economy.  It is not good.  So there are things that are very important.</p></speech>

Mr. Roux, I would like to ask, you mentioned that the decision to take actions against large Irish banks rests with the ECB.  Can I ask who recommends that action?  Is it the supervisory teams of the Central Bank of Ireland or the supervisory teams from the ECB?</p></speech>

The joint supervisory team is made of people in Frankfurt and people here for banks which are smaller than or which are, you know, not the very biggest bank in Europe.  There is one person in Frankfurt for our banks, for each of our banks, so that person is called a JST co-ordinator and it is that person who decides with, you know, working through their hierarchy what to do.  But they are working daily.  They are exchanging throughout the day, every day of the year on these banks.</p></speech>

So, I think the ... look, this is what the Governor told me, I haven't looked in the case.  I understand that a case can, you know, that the basis of his exchange with the Department of Finance, that a case can still be made based on the published intention of the Government at the time the contract was written.  So, this is contract law, this is exactly, I think, I would say, this is exactly the kind of discussions we no longer want to have under BRRD and that's why we're working on resolution plans and we are working so that the securities issued, the bonds that are issued by banks or by their parent, by their holding companies, are very clearly "bail-inable" and we don't have this-----</p></speech>

Can I ask if risks which you identified yourself, such as interest rate risks, the risks of IT systems in banks, for example, are they now greater risks for the banking system than concentration risks, such as lending too much to any one sector of the economy and, if so, what is the Central Bank doing to reduce those risks?</p></speech>

So this is ... so when we do our planning at the ECB - on "What are we going to spend time on?  Where are we going to do our on-site supervision?  Where do we concentrate our work?" - we have decided in 2015, and it will probably, you know, continue next year, that we spend more time ... we devote more time on this.  So, it's just allocation of resources and expertise.  Now, on the regulation front, there's more as well.  The Basel committee, for instance, has published a consultation the day before yesterday on management and monitoring of interest rate risks.</p></speech>

And we deal with session 3 this evening ... or this afternoon's public hearing is with Mr. Tom O'Connell, former assistant director general and chief economist, Central Bank. The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session and can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.</p><p>Today we continue our hearings with senior officials from the Central Bank of Ireland and Financial Regulator and at our session this afternoon we will hear from Mr. Tom O'Connell, former assistant director general, chief economist at the Central Bank.  Tom O'Connell joined the Central Bank of Ireland in 1970 as an economist, he was appointed assistant director general of the economics division in April 200.  As chief economist, his responsibilities were economic analysis, research and publications, monetary policy and financial stability statistics.  He retired in 2010.  Mr. O'Connell, you are very welcome before the inquiry this afternoon.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should then be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.</p><p>In addition, there are particular obligations of professional secrecy on officers of the Central Bank in respect of confidential information they've come across in the course of their duties.  This stems from European and Irish law, including section 33AK of the Central Bank Act 1942.  The banking inquiry also has obligations of professional secrecy in terms of some of the information which has been provided to it by the Central Bank.  These obligations have been taken into account by the committee and will affect the questions asked and answered which can be lawfully given in today's proceedings.  In particular, it will mean that some information can be dealt with on a summary or aggregate basis only, such that individual institutions will not be identifiable.</p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  And members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are to be confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis and you have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee and will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence to the inquiry.  So, if I can now ask the clerk, in commencing proceedings, to administer the oath to Mr. O'Connell.  Thank you.</p></speech>

If I may take it ... the committee through my opening statement.  Thank you.  Ireland&rsquo;s banking and economic crash should never have happened, should never have been allowed to happen, with all the consequences of huge increases in unemployment, rising emigration, enormous debt, suicides, etc., that we have seen. As well as addressing the aspects that I have been asked to deal with by the joint committee, I would like to talk about our experiences from my perspective as the head of the economics function in the Central Bank from 2005 until 2009.</p> <p>   In his report on the crisis, Professor Honohan described what happened here as a world-beating property bubble.  As early as around the turn of the millennium, the head of the IMF Article 4 mission to Ireland, James Morsink ... I remember him saying to us that a country could not prosper on the basis of selling property to one another at increasingly elevated prices - an obvious truism.  The huge excesses here are well known, but I think that it is worth recalling some examples.  As Donal Donovan and Antoin Murphy have noted in their book on the crash, the size of Anglo Irish Bank&rsquo;s balance sheet in 2007 was six times what it was in 2001.  The former chief executive of Bank of Ireland himself has stated that it took Bank of Ireland 200 years to grow its balance sheet to &euro;100 billion; it took only four further years for the second &euro;100 billion to be added on to reach &euro;200 billion.  And, of course, Bank of Ireland was the most conservative of all the Irish banks.  A further example of the absurd mania at its height was the fact that a small site in Ballsbridge was acquired for &euro;174 million at the height of the crisis -at the height of the boom, I should say - and purchased not so long ago for &euro;22 million, that&rsquo;s a fall of 87% ... you know, an indication of the huge excesses that we experienced.</p> <p>  If I can turn to the independence of the Central Bank, as you know, the Central Bank&rsquo;s independence is established in law, essentially as a result of the EU treaties and the ECB statute.  There's a reason why central banks are legally independent - so that they can take tough, unpopular decisions when required, without regard to populist government priorities.  This applies, in particular, to monetary policy issues.  However, it has to be asked how independent the Central Bank was on other matters.  Patrick Honohan, in his report, stated that the authorities displayed undue deference to the banks.  In my view, this applied equally to the authorities&rsquo; relationship with Government.  Was the Central Bank going to act independently, and to possibly take unpopular decisions, if the Governor was always appointed by the Minister, with whom he had worked intimately for many years prior to his appointment, and with the Secretary General of the Department of Finance always serving on the board of the bank?  Further, the boards of the Central Bank and regulator were also heavily weighted with political supporters of Government.  In practice, it was my experience that any concerns or issues raised by staff for airing in the public arena were invariably watered down so as not to reflect adversely on matters of concern to Government.  That was an undesirable state of affairs.  While vested interests can be cheerleaders for asset prices, the authorities have a duty to be unflinching, straight and upfront on these matters.</p> <p>  I think it would be useful for me to reflect on the governance arrangements in the Central Bank.  The decision-making entities in the bank in my time were the board and the Governor.  The staff provided reports and advice to the board and Governor through the director general and deputy director general - what we economists would call the "kitchen cabinet", if you like.  Now, some time ago, Dr. T. K. Whitaker, perhaps Ireland&rsquo;s most eminent public servant, regretted the passing of the stage where public servants gave their advice and opinions objectively without reference to political or populist issues, or to anticipate what might be welcomed by the Minister.  In the Central Bank, it was difficult to get views through that might impinge on vested interests.  For example, as land and property prices escalated to bizarre and absurd levels, I had written, in a low key way for the bank&rsquo;s bulletin ... comment in its quarterly bulletin, that there was a need to consider the issue of rezoning more land for building in order to increase housing supply .  That&rsquo;s also an issue of course of continuing relevance at present.  I saw Colm McCarthy writing in the newspaper last Sunday about that.  But that was blocked from reaching a higher level in the bank in the light, in my view, of political and property interests on the bank&rsquo;s board.  Of course, as the demand mania for property took off against the background of restrictive zoning which limited the supply of housing, the inevitable result was huge property price inflation.</p> <p>  I think I should also say a few words about the relationship between the Central Bank and IFSRA &ndash; the Financial Regulatory Authority - at least from the perspective of the economics function in the bank.  While, at the operational level, the bank interacted with the banks through market operations - in the wholesale payment system target, for example - there was little or no contact after 2003, when the new regulator was set up, on major policy matters.  As far as I could see, contact with banks was primarily effected through IFSRA.  This was such that at a certain point, I think towards the mid-noughties, the Governor began to arrange high- level meetings with the main banks at occasional intervals to discuss ... discuss the big issues.  I would have attended quite a lot of these.  Further, in the bank, we had no knowledge of the large exposures of the banks to individual developers.  Such data were rigorously concealed from my level in the bank.  Of course, we were aware that banks&rsquo; aggregate lending was increasing enormously and was concentrated in the property sector.  I had a discussion with one of the consultants that was brought into IFSRA after the crash.  I mentioned to him the name of one large developer, he, in turn, asked me how much I thought that ... that developer might have outstanding in borrowings.  I suggested &euro;1 billion; he said I could triple it.  That, and newspaper reports that 15 borrowers from Anglo Irish Bank had borrowings in excess of &euro;750 million each, together with the disclosure at your inquiry here that 20 developers had total borrowings of between &euro;21 billion and &euro;22 billion, were news to me.</p> <p>  It's sometimes said that nobody seemed to know that a property boom or bubble was developing.  That's ... that is completely incorrect in my view.  You will recall, for example, that, in his evidence to your committee here, Peter Nyberg - himself the author of a report on the collapse - asserted that it was obvious that a property-lending mania was afoot.  At the decision-making levels in the bank, either people were unaware of what was happening, despite the clear evidence, or they were aware and chose to do nothing.  Either way, it all seems quite incomprehensible to me.</p> <p>  While the bank, in its public utterances, presented a low-key assessment of what was happening, that is not to say that it was not fully aware of the major excesses.</p><p> While the bank in its public utterances presented a low-key assessment of what was happening, that is not to say it was not fully aware of the major excesses.  The annual financial stability reports reviewed comprehensively what was happening and Patrick Honohan&rsquo;s report acknowledged that the three major excesses were well recognised in the FSRs, the Financial Stability Reports: there was the huge increase in bank lending, the concentration of this lending in the property sector, and the very large reliance on the ... by the banks on potentially volatile wholesale funding.  The main body of the stability reports set out extensively how almost all indicators were pointing massively in the wrong direction.  By contrast, the overall assessment and tone which reflected the views of the two boards tended to be reassuring &ndash; talking of a soft landing, and so on.  In fact, I should say that one member of the board did have grave doubts, to the effect that I can recollect his words still ringing in my ear, "It was all a house of cards and would all end in tears".  However, his views appear not to have had any impact on policy-making in the bank.  Notwithstanding that director&rsquo;s views, it was probably necessary, in any event, to present such a rather hopeful overall assessment in public since the Central Bank could hardly conclude that the banks were about to collapse.  However, whatever the published assessment, the authorities should have been working assiduously behind the scenes to curb the huge excesses and reckless lending of the banks &ndash; egregious risk-taking, as Patrick Honohan has termed it recently in his speech.</p><p> I don't want to go right through the whole thing, but I point out on page six of my opening statement there that, as another confirmation of us being aware of the problems emerging, the governor and his letters to this minister pre-budget frequently flagged the very high increase in the bank lending and the property prices and by implication, the natures of something above that.  So it wasn't as if we were unaware of these things.  In fact, you may recollect, the government itself, through the department of the environment had around ... I think it was 1999 ... requested three reports from the economist, Peter Bacon, to assess what could be done to alleviate rising property prices.</p><p> Around that time, a memo was sent from the economics function of the bank to the then governor, recommending that bank lending to the property sector needed to be reined in.  For many years in the past, some of you may recollect the Central Bank had actually imposed credit ceilings on banks in the interest of prudence.  The response to the note, which was sent up to the governor, was that he would have to consider bringing this proposal to the board, which is fair enough.  However, at the top of the note were the words, evidently added subsequent to the first comment, "That is out of the question".  I have a copy of that memo as well.</p><p> Other specific responses given to me in reply to my pleas to rein in the banks were, verbatim: "The Central Bank is not going to disadvantage the Irish banking sector", and "The Central Bank is not going to collapse the construction sector", when, you know, construction sector really took off and we were completing 90,000 houses, or close to that, in 2006.  On another occasion, when bank lending to the property sector was increasing at the astronomical rate of 65% year on year, I urged a very senior member of the Financial Regulator staff, that bank lending to the property sector needed to be curtailed.  The response that I was given was that the lending was secured on property &ndash; that's true in almost all other property-related banking crashes that proved to be worthless when property prices crashed from unsustainable levels.  I, personally, was also specifically prevented from bringing forward to the bank&rsquo;s financial stability committee, data on house price levels across Europe that showed the extraordinary heights prices had reached here relative to elsewhere.  In fact, prices here were higher than anywhere else in Europe, any capital city, Amsterdam, Brussels, etc, except for central London.  And of course, central London is a special case where you've got Arab sheikhs and Russian oligarchs and so on, buying properties.  So, the net result was that the powers-that-be preferred to adopt an ostrich-like approach to the massive problem.  I offer a few more examples there of the extent to which people were not willing to recognise the problem that was emerging at the top of page 8.</p><p> If I may go on ... in fact, in addition to the red flags in the stability reports, which Patrick Honohan recognised in his report, a financial expert has also reviewed the annual reports of the Central Bank over the years in the journal studies of spring 2009 and he has come to the same conclusion that the authorities were well aware of the dangerous situation that was developing, but decided to do nothing.  In fact, what Peter Nyberg, who interviewed me ... the author of the Banking report ... he kept asking me "Why did nobody do anything?" ... several times "Why did nobody do anything?"  And I am afraid that the answer has to be that the authorities simply did not wish to do anything.  And actually, Peter Nyberg also asked me why I did not publish a newspaper article on the bubble.  I said to him that that would have been highly unorthodox - it would be like a civil servant, you know, writing an article in the newspaper, criticising the minister of financial policy ... it just wouldn't be on ... in any event, I don't think it would've had an effect at a time when the Taoiseach was saying that anyone who was questioning the sustainability of what was happening should go and commit suicide.  And in fact, you should recollect in the event when Morgan Kelly ... Professor Morgan Kelly wrote about the probability of a crash, he was derided - he was literally shouted down at an economics conference where he was presenting his paper on the property market.  So, you know, people didn't want to know.</p><p> In fact, one also has to ask whether there was any appreciation in the commercial banks that things were getting out of hand.  On the face of it, it would seem that certain divisions of the banks &ndash; maybe the capital markets divisions - were in fact well aware that we were experiencing a property bubble.  You have to ask, "Why else would the two main banks have decided to sell off their headquarters buildings and major landmark branches at colossal prices at the height of the bubble?"  Was it the case that their lending colleagues in the banks were, at the same time, even financing, in whole or in part, the acquisition of these premises?  And from the Central Bank side, you know, one has to ask, "How did the Central Bank see the erosion of the banks&rsquo; deposit base being halted as the Central Bank pumped increasingly vast amounts of liquidity into the banks to prop them up?"  In fact, you may be aware of the fact that the total ... the maximum amount ... or at its peak rather, the amount of liquidity pumped out into the banks was &euro;140 billion, you know, with the ... both from the Central Bank and the ECB.  I mean, once you spell that out, that's &euro;140,000 million - there are 12 digits in that.  So, you can well understand why the ECB was jumping up and down when the accommodation provided to Irish banks was at ... was at that massive level.</p><p> Now, if may I turn to a few words about the role of economists in the Central Bank.  During the critical period 2000 to 2007 when the property mania was at its height, none amongst the top 3 executives in the bank was an economist &ndash; not that economists are the fount of all wisdom, I would have to admit.  This would have been less of an issue if there was a willingness to listen to the views of economists, I would admit.  You may recollect the Canadian expert, Rob Wright, saying to you here that he noted the relatively small number of economists employed in the department of finance, having 7% of staff being economists compared with 60% in Canada&rsquo;s department of finance.  This aversion to economists really carried over to the Central Bank, I would admit, and was part of the problem.</p><p> In addition, the Financial Regulator employed very few economists.  A member of top management in the bank put it to me on one occasion, that the bank wants economists and other specialists to be "on tap but not on top".  So, economists were in a sort of cul-de-sac.  And this rather recalls the episode in the early 1920s when the governor of the Bank of England, Montagu Norman, said to the chief economist, "You are not here to tell us what to do, but to explain to us why we have done it".</p><p> However, it is the norm now in almost all central banks for economists to occupy the great majority of the top decision-making positions for the obvious reason that central banks are primarily concerned with issues in the area of macro-economics, monetary policy and financial economics.  On the other hand, in Ireland, the top positions in both the bank and Financial Regulator were filled traditionally by administrators and accountants.  Accountants by their work and training are concerned with detail, but do they always see the bigger picture?  The clean bill of health given by external auditors to all the banks right up to and even beyond the crash would suggest otherwise.  In fact, you may recollect, I checked it out there on the website, the Anglo-Irish bank profits in November 2008 were declared to be &euro;784 million and that was post the Lehman's problem in September 2008.  It would seem to me that accountants tend take a more backward-looking perspective on a balance sheet ... I mean, that's maybe what they're expected to do ... whereas examining a balance sheet from an economics perspective would entail a more forward-looking consideration.  Perhaps, in the wake of the crash, now, it could be argued that the type of appointments within the Central Bank structure, has lurched too far in the other direction, with economists predominating at the top of the bank and regulatory function.  In my view, there should be a diversity of skills and backgrounds at the highest level of the bank and Financial Regulator.</p><p> Having said that, it is quite extraordinary that, at the highest level, there seemed to be a blindness to the fact that there had been a whole series of recent property-related banking crashes - we had them in Japan, Finland, Sweden, the savings and loan sector in the US, Norway, the Lawson mini-boom in the UK 1989, 1990.  Of course, the sub-prime crisis in the US itself and the related securitisation of mortgage assets that led to massive losses for many international banks was also a property-related phenomenon.  And one shouldn't forget that in the years leading up to the crash, the Bank for International Settlements, the BIS, of which Ireland, through the Central Bank, is a shareholder, had also been warning consistently for some time about the runaway evolution of asset prices with wholly inadequate attention being paid to risk.</p><p>Despite all of that, there seemed to be little interest in such experiences elsewhere, with the implicit belief that they had little relevance for Ireland.  In my view, this was a manifestation of a closed mind and an unwillingness to learn.  While economists were well aware of these banking debacles, their relevance to Ireland did not seem to register at a level where it should have done.  The view seemed to be, as the clich&eacute; has it, that the time ... this time is different, or we are experiencing a new paradigm.  <br/><br/>Now, some people suggest that it was the collapse of Lehman's that brought down the Irish banks.  Now that event didn't help clearly, as Lehman's failure did greatly affect liquidity flows, interbank lending, etc.  However, as the UCC economist, Seamus Coffey, noted in a radio interview some time ago:<blockquote>Ireland's crash derived from developments between 2002 and 2007.  Our problem was a pre-existing property bubble, before Lehman's hit.</blockquote>And related to the fact of the enormous increase in bank lending, Irish banks of course were significantly dependent on borrowing from the wholesale markets, which were greatly affected by the Lehman's event.  Countries that had no such bubble, small countries like Belgium, the Netherlands, and Finland, they experienced some problems associated with the failure of Lehman's, but nothing on the scale of Ireland's banking crash and collapse.  Our problem was a banking insolvency one.  As Professor Honohan's report put it, the source of our problems was homegrown.  Those who suggest that Lehman's brought us down are almost wholly wrong, and are merely seeking an external scapegoat, not the first time this would have happened in Ireland, in my view.  <br/><br/>It was also suggested that, being in the eurozone, we were the victims of huge capital inflows to Ireland.  This again is a fairly thin argument.  Ireland participated in a quasi-monetary union with the UK from 1825 to 1979, when we joined the EMS.  We have plenty of experience of living in a monetary union.  We also joined the euro with our eyes open.  If monetary conditions were not particularly optimal from Ireland's point of view, the corollary was that other policies should be used to deliver the appropriate economic conditions.  This would have meant,<i>inter alia</i>, restrictive fiscal policy as well as a tightening of bank regulation.  However, this would have run counter to the naive populist policies of the then Government.  <br/><br/>In summary, it was crystal clear from about the turn of the millennium, and even before, Ireland was experiencing a major property bubble; &quot;a world beating one&quot;, in Professor Honohan's words.  It is not credible that those who ought to have been aware of what was happening were in the dark.  One can only surmise that, as Professor Alan Ahearne has said here to your committee, too many people were benefitting from the boom time for prudence avoidance ... prudent avoidance measures to have been taken.  Such necessary measures would not have been popular, but that should not weigh with those whose duty it was to ensure the country did not experience the catastrophe that we so painfully and unnecessarily suffered.  <br/><br/>Now I know, Chairman, that you want to derive some lessons from the crisis too, so I've jotted down a couple of points there, but I will leave it to yourselves, you know, to take those on board as you see fit.  Thank you very much.</p></speech>

I wouldn't disagree too much with that, you know?  But, as I said, even though a lot of the ... nearly all the indicators were pointing in a very bad direction in the body of the report.  The financial stability reports normally had to conclude, and in fact when I was interviewed by Donal Donovan and Paul Gorecki  from the ESRI for the Honohan report, I'd no sooner taken a seat for the interview when they say ... they took out the 2007 financial stability report and they read the third paragraph, I can recollect, and they put it to me: "Wasn't that very complacent?"  And my recollection of that paragraph was that it starts ... it said "The risks in the financial stability .. in the financial system have increased and our" ... it's all worrying but it'll be all right on the night.  Now a central bank probably couldn't say anything else, you know, other than that, so ... in fact, as you probably know, the financial stability reports have ceased since then, and ... because they could never conclude other than that "things are manageable."  If they said, "The banks are going to fall over", you'd have a run on the banks massively.</p></speech>

I think it was the ... Michael McDowell, sometime in or around early September 2006, made a comment about it, the housing market was slowing down anyway but the speculation over stamp duty certainly had an immediate impact upon it, and the ... there was a slowdown in purchase as well.  There was an assessment that the housing ... that the housing sector and construction sector was 24% of the Irish economy, twice of what it should have actually been, there was a whole load of information there with regard to loan-to-values, 100% mortgages, and, as was borne out later, that there was a structural deficit as well that was going to be faced because a lot of taxes were based upon consumption, and if consumption dropped, as we saw with the entry to the bailout programme, there was a shortfall of &euro;30 billion.  So when I put that proposition to Mr. Neary, Mr. Neary's response was, "Well, in the background that you have just presented there, Chairman, I think it does call the assessment into question."  This is the 2000 financial ... or the 2007 report.  "And you know I think reading that now and looking back on it, I think the message coming out from that statement to me is 'don't spook the horses.'  That's clearly the message there."  Was the report ... would you agree with Professor Neary's, or care to comment upon Mr. Neary's statement there that it was an exercise in not spooking the horses?</p></speech>

No matter how ... I mean, if the analysis of the indicators proved to be positive, you could certainly say things were fine.  If the analysis proved to be negative, a central bank had to sort of put a positive gloss on things rather than frightening the horses.  I think you're right.  So it's a sort of a predicament, you know.  You may recollect when the Northern Rock run happened, it happened because somebody, and I'm not sure whether it was the Bank of England or some commentator, they mentioned that emergency liquidity was being supplied to Northern Rock.  So the use of the word "emergency" caused that run.  So, you know, that would confirm to you that you had to be very careful, and maybe be elliptical about one's assessment of the overall picture, but it was pretty clear to me that, you know, we had a major property bubble and it had to burst at some time.  One could never say when, but that was underlying the ... what was happening in the Irish economy.</p></speech>

I'll give you two examples there.  It'll come up on the screen at the moment, you say, "when around 2005, ... Alan Barrett had expressed a view in an ESRI Quarterly Economic Commentary that the banks were in a rather fragile state, I was instructed to request the Director of the ESRI to ensure that such comments were not published in future".  You then go on say, "In the 2007 Financial Stability Report [that we just discussed], a deliberate decision was taken to delete the conclusions of a research study updating the extent of the overvaluation of Irish property services".

Well, in relation to the Alan Barrett comment, which was at ... I think it happened at the launch of the ESRI quarterly commentary, and I think the reference to the fragility of the banks was actually in the quarterly commentary, I was, I was asked by somebody senior to me in the bank to ring Frances Ruane in the ESRI, which I duly did, and asked that, you know, those references should not arise in the future.  Now to some degree that's understandable, you know.  If the leading research institute is commenting on the possibility of the banks collapsing, I mean, it's one thing to try to sort of cool down those comments but I would argue that behind the scenes, something should be done to prevent that happening and that really wasn't happening at that time.</p></speech>

When I used to go to Paris to ... with people to look at the reports, almost every line was parsed, and any, anything of a negative nature needed to be taken out.  So, for example, if ... let's say if the OECD was saying that the house price increases are "very significant", they would be asked to maybe alter that to "quite significant", you know.  I felt it was quite embarrassing.  My attitude to these things was the IMF came here for the Article IV missions; we spoke to them, we gave them our views.  My attitude was, let them go off and make up their own minds and come back and if their view is different from ours, having considered what we had said to them, so be it.

In fact, Peter Nyberg spoke to me about that quite a lot but I would maintain they were realistic, not necessarily contrarian.  It was the non-contrarians who were being off the wall.</p></speech>

In that regard, but if we were to take the context of the contrarian, if you take the Nyberg report or the Honohan report, that they talk about the herd instincts, so somebody who was operating outside the herd would have been a contrarian even though they might have been talking the world of sense.  In that regard, can I put the question to you that was there contrarian opinions in ... being expressed at the time and how were they expressed in the Central Bank?</p></speech>

I mean, for example, I used to say to my colleagues, almost every day, we had to have more land zoned.  In fact, I used to joke with them and sort of say ... I mean, because the restrictive ... the restriction on housing supply ensured by the restrictive zoning meant that when the demand for housing went up you'd have vertical supply curve, land went up, house, property prices went through the roof.  I used to say to the people that you could, you know, zoning should be freed up everywhere bar Stephen's Green, Howth Head and Killiney Head - jokingly, because, you may recollect, I mean ... and, in fact, Jerome Casey, who was a construction sector analyst who wrote about this extensively and he said, he noted that in north County Dublin, the zoned land was owned by eight developers.  There was a cartel, if you like.  And, in fact, even some of them were intermarried, so-----</p></speech>

The Central Bank is not going to disadvantage the Irish banks and by that they mean ... that was happening at a time when the, the ... some of the foreign owned banks, like Ulster Bank and Bank of Scotland Ireland were going mad with 100% mortgages and they were throwing confetti around the ... loans around like confetti.  So, it was said to me that yes, we're not going to, to inhibit the Irish banks.  In other words, we're going to let them compete with these mad guys, you know.</p></speech>

Governor Hurley, when he was before this committee, stated:<blockquote><br /><br />I was not aware of contrarian views within the Central Bank, which differed in substance from the Bank's overall assessment[s].  Views, which set out a[s] different risk assessment[s], were not made known to me or to the Board in my presence.</blockquote>Would you care to comment upon that?</p></speech>

I would have often ... I would have often said informally, I won't say daily, but I would say weekly - and I'm under oath - I would have said to my senior people that things were going crazy; the banks have to be reined in.  I said this many a time.  In fact, when the ... they mentioned there that one of the leading people in the regulatory staff, I said to him that property and construction lending at that particular point was growing at 65% year on year.  Now, you have to recollect, this was in the euro area.  The ECB indicated that the appropriate growth in the money stock in the euro area was 4% to 4.5%, credit and money 4% to 4.5%.  We were at 65%.  You know, I mean that was 16 times-----</p></speech>

Subsequently, the financial stability department would be liaising with the regulator about information or data, that sort of thing, but they weren't really actively involved beyond that point, you know.</p></speech>

In actual fact, the head of the financial stability department, although he had the title senior adviser, he was on the same salary as me, so in fact, he often, in practice, dealt with the director general who was the chair of the financial stability committee ... so ... but I would have had a lot of sort of lateral contact with the head of the financial stability department and, you know, we worked in the bank and we had written papers for a long time together and so on.</p></speech>

In fact, it's pretty common for asset price adjustments, particularly in stock markets, as you know ... whatever ... a currency thing ... for commodity markets to get abrupt drops.  In fact, quite often you'll get an overshooting downwards.  Now, housing market will be ... sort of ... you ... maybe you'll get a slower adjustment, if you like, but you probably can't ... you can never say <i>ab initio</i>... as I think it's more in hope than in confidence you'd talk about soft landings.  But, if sentiment, sort of, decreases monotonically or gradually, you might get a ... a ... a gradual fall but you certainly couldn't rule out ... I mean, for example, the instances in Sweden, Finland, Japan, the savings and loans in the States, they were pretty precipitous falls, you know.  So, I suppose the Central Bank had to come down on one side or the other ... was there going to be a ...  could we say there was going to be a hard landing?Well, for starters you wouldn't know <i>ex ante</i>if it's going to be soft or hard but, in general, I suppose, all central banks would tend to, more in hope than in confidence, say &quot;We'd hope for a soft landing rather than a hard landing&quot;.</p></speech>

And, you know, we were seeing a gradual fall, I guess.  The stability report came out probably in November 2007, so you were seeing a sort of a gradual fall ... a fall away and it was probably an extrapolation of that but there would have been, to my knowledge, no analytical or no high-powered analysis to prove that, you know ... of the binomial possibilities, that it was going to be a soft rather than a hard landing.  You could possibly extrapolate from the peak property price period in February 2007, given that up through autumn there'd been gradual falls but, you know, if something was going to hit the system, people like the buy-to-let investors and so on might've had to get out quickly, you know.</p></speech>

You say in your opening statement, talking about the financial stability reports, that the overall assessment in tone which reflected the views of the two boards tended to be reassuring and you imply that this was in contrast to the main body of the financial stability reports, which would you have drafted.   So what are you saying there?  Did that language come from the board?</p></speech>

I mean, they would have had a day long consideration of the body of the report - all the details, data and so on - and they would form their views and that would be embodied in the editorial, sort of.  So, I always felt there was a potential disconnect, if you like, between the body of the report, the technical analysis and the overview.</p></speech>

In particular, there was no update of the McQuinn-O'Reilly (2006) model.  However, an internal staff updating of this model undertaken in April 2008 (after publication of the 2007 [report]) indicated that house price overvaluation was estimated to have reached almost 35 per cent by mid-2007.</blockquote>In your opening statement you say that &quot;a deliberate decision was taken [in preparing the 2007 financial stability report] to delete the conclusions of a research study updating the extent of the overvaluation of Irish property prices&quot;.  So, first of all, was the 2006 Quinn-O'Reilly model updated in advance of the 2007 financial stability report?</p></speech>

But again it's more ... you could say it is a bit of wishful thinking, you know.  Nobody can ... can say <i>ex ante</i>whether it is going to be a soft or a hard landing.  I mean, when the stability report came out in November 2007 that was eight or nine months since the peak of the property market so there had been, sort of, a gradual decline and maybe the ... extrapolating that the hope was that that would continue and they wouldn't have a complete collapse, you know.</p></speech>

Soft landing was reassuring.</p></speech>

I mean, I think in that third paragraph of the financial stability report which both Donal Donovan and Professor Gorecki put to me ... I think it was sort of said that the risks are increasing but they are manageable, you know.  It means the same thing,.  If they're manageable, we're looking ... we're looking at a soft landing.  But I wouldn't attach too much significance to the particular words that were used and in a way, I mean, any Central Bank probably had to sort of say, ''Well, it will be all right on the night'', or words to that effect, you know.</p></speech>

So I mean, what sort of a ... if you look at ... go back to the stability report in 2007 you had the body of the report all indicators pointing in the wrong direction.  And then you have an overall assessment of what's happening.  I mean, the ... could ... if I mean I was asked to do an objective assessment, an objective overview on the basis of the indicators, I would be inclined to say, ''Yes, we are headed for big trouble''.  But, a central bank being a central bank can't really say that, you know; it has to, sort of, pull its punches really.</p></speech>

I said, ''No.  That's Central Bank speak and it's negative in fact".  In fact, you probably know loads of people have made a good living out of parsing the words of Greenspan or Bernanke or Mervyn King or whatever, you know, if they altered their statement from one month to the next.  So in Central Bank speak, in my view, the overall assessment was possibly ... probably quite negative, even if it had used the words ''soft landing'' and ''things are manageable'' and so on.  But if you read between the lines, as people who were familiar with Central Bank speak would do or would want to do, you could see that was pretty negative, you know?</p></speech>

And I remember there was a huge ... I think it was the second largest pension fund in the world from Holland came over.  We wouldn't normally meet them but I think I was told since they're so important you have to go and meet them.  Now these guys in 2005 were utterly and totally sceptical of Irish bank shares.  But I mean I had to sit there in front of them and sort of say, "Well, yes, they are problems over there all right".  In the event they didn't invest, but, I mean, people in the know were clear that things were problematic.  And, you know, they'd be the people who were reading Central Bank speak and they would have seen that third paragraph in the FSR in 2007 as being a negative message, rather than a positive one, in my view.</p></speech>

You mentioned in your opening statement political and property interests on the bank's board making it difficult to get certain views through, but earlier you also said that contrarian views didn't drift up to the board.  So, which is it?</p></speech>

I wouldn't call them contrarian views.  But I ... they were sort of realistic views.  Yes, I mentioned that example of the need for more zoning of land, which was a crying need at the time.  I mean, as I said, these guys had cornered the market in zoned land in north Dublin.  In fact. there's another case ... it arose in Waterford ... in Dungarvan I think.  I mean, it mattered greatly where on a map the line for rezoning was.  So when I put that up ... because you had to increase housing supply, particularly in the greater Dublin area and you weren't going to do that unless you had more land zoned.  So when I put a very tentative point in the comment which was the editorial for the bulletin, to push it up the line to say we need to consider, you know, more zoning or whatever or, you know, some very milk and watery language, that was deleted.  It didn't go beyond ... it didn't get to the board.</p></speech>

And the county manager in the course of the trial said that if you zoned a particular piece of agricultural land, that would have increased in value tenfold.  So, the zoning of land, as you blokes probably know very well, more than I do and county council and so on, is a very contentious issue.  But the point ... the economic point is that one needed to increase housing supply and, therefore, zoned land ... more zoned land had to be brought on stream.  And I was trying to hint at that in my draft comment, which never went beyond that.</p></speech>

You didn't leave that lying around the place.  I was shown it the odd time but it was never actually physically given to me.  I might have perused it over somebody's shoulder or being asked to look at something like that.  But so, being ... being ... not seeing the large exposures, it was, sort of, par of the course.

Some of them were in the property sector themselves ... there were business people and others.  Had they got the full information?  I'm not sure, but I mean ... the drafts, or papers if you like, were filtered through to the board and it was up to the top people in the Central Bank to decide what went or what didn't go, you know.</p></speech>

I mean that point about the zoning was an important point, I mean it's not a ... it's not an issue where there's any impropriety involved or anything like that, in my view, but it's just a common sense economic point that housing supply had to increase and in order to do that you needed more zoned land.</p></speech>

And the memo came back with the words, "That is out of the question", added to the memo.  Why did that happen do you think, and was that information brought to the board?</p></speech>

They wouldn't have been aware of that?</p></speech>

You know most things would have been on the table.  Now, I can recollect in the past though, having said that, that, you know, from the economics department we might have suggested maybe some tax change or whatever, but that would typically have been not ... that wouldn't run because the view in the bank was that taxation was a matter for Government and we don't sort of suggest that they tax X and subsidise Y, you know.  So they would be, sort of, general economic issues, talking about the stance of upcoming fiscal policy in the budget recommendation, maybe bank lending property prices would have figured quite strongly, I think, too, yes.</p></speech>

Is that correct? You didn't give advice on taxation issues.  Is that what you said?</p></speech>

Yes ... I think ... I can recollect way out back in the past we probably did, you know.  We put something in about maybe something should be taxed, let's say for environmental reasons or something like that.  But the view was that it's not for us to say what taxes should go up or taxes down, it's really for Government, you know.</p></speech>

Just to get through a few ... the mandatory pieces first.  Was there any interaction with the banking supervisory team on macroeconomic or financial aspects, for example, on the strong credit growth in the years preceding the crisis?</p></speech>

In fact ... yes, maybe you're, sort of, asking about, you know the interaction with the regulator, or between the bank and the regulator and there would have been quite a lot of fora there.  You had the memorandum of understanding between the bank and regulator for starters.  Then you had the ... the Governor used to have a Monday morning meeting, you know, dealing with current issues and so on, and we'd all be there together.  You had the financial stability committee itself, of course, which dealt with things.  The regulator and the bank would have been on that.  And, of course, we were on the same floor, so we'd bump into one another quite a few times a day.  But having said that, I mean, to take one example I remember when the Se&aacute;n Quinn thing burst, you know, I wouldn't have had any-----</p></speech>

By my recollection that's 40 years.  Now you probably have a better understanding than any of us inside in this room as to what the obligations of section 33AK actually are.  If you want to waive them, inform us that you want to do so and I'll try and guide you but I would be advising you in that regard, okay?</p></speech>

When the problem thing arose ... I wouldn't have interacted with my financial regulatory colleagues on the same floor about that but I think I mentioned maybe to one of the guys at the water fountain on one occasion, "This is an issue for you", and they'd say, "Yes, it is an issue", so you know we wouldn't be going into detail on it, no.</p></speech>

On page 40 of the Regling and Watson report it is mentioned that by far the most serious macro-financial flaw was the over-exposure of institutions to commercial property.  From the documentation seen by the inquiry this particular theme of commercial property financing appears not to have been regularly discussed at the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland board meetings before 2006 and was still playing a smaller role in residential property in 2007.  In your opinion, why was there so little attention to this theme until, kind of, late/post-2007?</p></speech>

I was sent actually 400 pages, you know, the two volumes to look at there.  When I went over it, commercial property lending and the area was covered in the stability report.  In fact I can recollect the material that was sent to me.  Lending to the commercial property sector was, back in 2002-3-4, rising at 40% to 45% you know, which is very, very high.  But I would agree with you that it didn't receive maybe the degree of prominence that it should have got because if you look at the banking crashes in most countries - Japan, Sweden, Finland and so on - it's commercial property that brings people down.  Now to some extent, my view also is that the residential mortgage area was politically more important and, therefore, it should be looked at more carefully.</p><p>I mean, politicians, like you folks, were very concerned about that, and that was also reflected in the great emphasis on the consumer function in the regulator.</p></speech>

Vacancy rates would have been flagged, for example, rents and commercial property would have been flagged quite a lot, but I ... as far as I can recollect, there was probably only one special article on commercial property, maybe in the 2007 financial stability report.  You could argue that it should have been treated more extensively at an earlier stage, I think, on reflection.  That's probably right, yes.</p></speech>

The fact that they went ahead and engaged in all this lending.  For some naive reason they probably assumed that things would be all right in the night.

I mean, what ... do we need to know ... although, it may have been relevant alright that it was concentrated on half a dozen property developers, but we were probably sort of roughly aware of that anyway.

Now, naturally, this is of huge concern to ourselves here, in the public interest, in trying to get to a report at the end of this process.  If you are saying on one hand, albeit a slip of the tongue, and a Freudian slip to use the word "concealment", you're also saying here, specifically due to, what is your view of political and property interests on the bank's board, that notwithstanding the fact that at the water fountain, when you meet people, and the three other more only positions that are senior to you, that you have difficulty getting important vital information to the board.

Okay?  And may I remind the witness that he is still under oath until we do resume at that stage, and I now request that the public Gallery would be cleared.  Yes, sorry, I now propose we go into private session.</p></speech>

There were three different occasions where you intimated that there were political and property interests across the boards of both the regulator and the ... and the Central Bank in one part.  You later talked about concealment and granted, you wanted to correct that word.  And the third issue then, where you mentioned the property and political interests at the board which in your view, had prevented your views getting across.  And I was simply putting forward to you, was it reasonable in your view to say that it was impossible to get your views to board level given your proximity to it, your seniority in the organisation?</p></speech>

I ... in relation to the OECD chap, for example, you know, one of my subordinates, I asked him to ring the OECD ... to ring the newspapers, because I can recollect distinctly the OECD view about over-valuation of property was on, it was either page 3 or page 5 of <i>The Irish Times</i>, top of the page.

Looking through the CBFSAI reports between 2004, 2009, could it be said that the emphasis was on economic development, retail sales, industrial output, the live register, productivity, inflation, house prices and so on, and not sufficiently to the financial aspects of the banking industry, which, I think, we're agreed is what brought us down in the end?</p></speech>

Well, they would have been indirectly in the sense that there would be commentary on what was happening to credit, bank lending, the concentration of that lending in property and so on but I can't recollect ... it would have been left probably to the financial stability reports to comment on the balance sheet of the banks, you know, their funding structure and the extent to which they were dependent on wholesale funding, that sort of thing.  So there wouldn't have been an overt commentary on the, certainly the entire structure of commercial banks' balance sheets in the regular quarterly bulletins.</p><p>It would be on evolution of the money supply, which would include bank deposits of course and bank credit.  As you probably know, regularly there would be ... there's a statistical survey or analysis of the sectoral distribution of credit.  So, you would see ... and there would be a short commentary issued by the bank press office, I think, about how credit was going to the different sectors, property, construction, etc. etc., but I, I think you're, you're, broadly speaking, right though, if you're talking about, technically, the quarterly bulletins, they probably didn't focus especially on the overall picture of ... for, for the commercial banks.</p></speech>

There is a ... on page 64, "the Bank was not aware of ... action ... taken by [any] other national central banks in the Eurosystem, which the bank", i.e., here, "was not already taking".</p></speech>

I mean, as you know, at the time the European Central Bank had no function in supervising national banks in different countries.  So, it probably wasn't on their horizon to any great degree, I would have thought.  The EU Commission, of course, you know, would ... would be doing their surveys of Ireland, like the OECD and the IMF and they ... they would be alert to that, certainly, yes.</p></speech>

I mean, you'd often have, say, things like a demand for money function and so on but the interactions between banks, I mean, interbank borrowing, interbank lending ... of course they're chopping and changing every day of the week, so, it is very difficult to capture that.  So, usually in, in economic modelling, financial sectors are, are very ... they're stripped bare, largely.  So, the ... you'd have ... you'd have a credit functioning ... figuring all right, and the money supply on the liability side but not an awful lot of interaction, you know, within the, the financial sector.</p></speech>

So, I, I wasn't fully aware that the independent articles had been taken out.

After the separation of the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank, the economists were deployed with the Central Bank and they ... the Financial Regulator had access for their purpose.  Were there many tasks carried out by the economics section of the Central Bank for the, for the Financial Regulator and how frequently was this interaction?</p></speech>

I'm trying to recollect.</p><p>For example, yes, there was a question of whether ... there was a view around the place, if you like, that the Irish banks had got massively into property, as you're probably aware, in Britain, Ireland and the US and there was a view that maybe these property ... or prices in ... property prices in those areas wouldn't be correlated, so it would be helpful if they weren't correlated because the diversification benefits for the banks would be there.  So, there was a study done on that, for example, which actually indicated that the property prices tended to be correlated, you know, so that wasn't a very positive result.  So, that was an example.  There were also a few articles written on stress tests, that sort of thing, you know, the methodologies to be used etc.  So-----</p></speech>

You weren't effectively someone who was, a person who was a junior that had just joined the Central Bank.  You were in the Central Bank at that stage nearly 40 years.  You were probably one of the most longest serving officials in the Central Bank.  So, therefore I'll ask it one last time.  Do you feel you should have considered your position on an integrity basis?  Could you have done more?</p></speech>

The only other option, I think ... well, I could have resigned.  Would that have any effect?  We don't know.  I could have written an article in the press, say, around 2003 or 2004.  Would it have had an effect?  I doubt it, when people were, you know, enjoying the boom and the fruits of the boom.  I doubt it.  People would dismiss you, you know, as a crank as it were.</p></speech>

Well actually the ... you've the Governor, you've the director general - who is effectively the CEO - and below that you have the deputy director general.  Now the deputy director general was really focused on markets, you know, providing liquidity to the banks, the payment system.  His reasonability was the markets, liquidity provision, and the target payment system.  So he ... while he would get sight of the economics article and so on, but he wouldn't really ... well he wasn't an economist, but he wouldn't really have had that much input into the economic side of it.  So the Governor and director general were the key people as far as we were concerned, you know.</p></speech>

It was a matter for the regulatory side.  The regulatory people were dealing with the individual banks who were ... whose lending was increasing, I think, as you said at various sessions, 30%, 35%, 40% per year, and ... and ... I mean, to give you an example of what I did when ... when I saw the quarterly data on sectoral credit and I saw the sectoral credit, the property-construction sector going ... increasing at 65%, I went to a leading person in the regulator and said "Something has to be done."  They said "No, it's okay.  It's secured on property."</p></speech>

You refer to the ... the ... the crises and the crashes in a number of ... many countries, even in the Nordic countries in Finland and Sweden and that.  Did ... did you ... and then what happened in Ireland in some senses was quite repetitive of what happened there.  Did you ever try ... or your group of 60 economists try, in any really structured way, to learn the lessons of that and put it in front of the board or the Governor, the regulator?</p></speech>

But, no, actually one of our ... two of our team went to Sweden to actually review their case at the time and I think there were some even simulation exercises which might have been done in conjunction with the Swedes.  So, we tried to learn something from them.  But, you know, my view, as I said in the opening statement, was that the ... the view ... or the implicit view amongst the senior people was that crashes elsewhere weren't relevant to Ireland.  In fact, I know for a fact, if I may add, there was an IMF study done of one particular crisis which was handed to a senior person in the Central Bank and it was declined on the grounds that it wasn't relevant to Ireland.</p></speech>

And, in fact, I wouldn't have been the only one because the Government had requested the three papers from Peter Bacon to look into what could be done about the ... the property price boom.  Yes, so, anybody in a senior position in ... in the regulator or the Central Bank has to take responsibility.  So, I mean, the whole thing was wholly avoidable in my view.  It was unnecessary.</p></speech>

I'll come back to that.  Specifically, the Financial Regulator was in the habit of holding round-table meetings with banks.  Did you ever take part in those meetings and, if so, could you tell us a little bit about it?</p></speech>

In fact, the ... the people who chaired it really were the director general and, yes, I think the Financial Regulator was there too.  So, up to a certain point ... to a certain year, we used to have the round table with the banks prior to doing the stability report to see what issues were there, you know.  And the ... that would feed in then to the stability report in a broad sense.  Beyond a certain year ... I can't remember the year, but the round tables were held after the stability reports were produced.  I think the main point really was to get over the message that these risks were out there and the banks should be aware of them, you know.</p></speech>

So, the ... the bank side ... my colleague Frank Browne would make the presentation about the issues and so on, based on the stability report, and, you know, we tried to have a conversation then amongst on the banks.</p><p>Now maybe the banks were a little reticent because there were maybe seven or eight or nine of them there and they weren't going to be that forthcoming themselves.  So the interaction was probably a bit inhibited, I think, really, you know.  But it was ... the main objective, I suppose, was to get over the message to them of the risks that ... as we saw them.</p></speech>

But when you think of it, in that itself, is bizarre, because they wanted more capital to engage in more lending ... to make the bubble worse, you know.  So the thing was ... that's an issue, I think, that should be looked into.</p></speech>

So at a particular point I can recollect he evidently felt that he would need to get to know the chief executives and the chairmen and so on.  And that might have been probably around ... it would have been obviously after 2003 when the structures were set up.  Maybe around 2005.  So he would have had regular meetings then, maybe six-monthly, say, with the chief executives and the chairmen and maybe some credit officers of the banks.  So I would have met a lot of those with him and the director general as well, you know, so that was the forum where the big issues, if you like, were discussed, including, of course, the first thing put to the banks would be, "Your lending is increasing massively, property lending too"; and they sort of invariably said things were okay, you know.</p></speech>

Well, with a ... yes, we would probably have ... the Governor would have been putting it to them, I think, that we're sceptical about things, you know. "Are you getting out of hand, are you going over the top?"  So we wouldn't have sort of said, "You're absolutely going bananas."  But they would invariably tend, to my recollection, would, at the time, would ... their point would have been, "Yes, we have everything under control", you know.</p></speech>

I was sent some of the letters from the Governor to the Minister.  I think he tended to be ... the letters tended to be, sort of, conservative for the most part, you know.  It may not have gone so far as to build ... recommend building up a cushion, but you must remember the pension reserve fund was there at the time, you know, and certain amounts were being set aside.

Can you ... can you clarify maybe your role.  As chief economist of the Central Bank of Ireland, would it be a case where they, you know ... these types of statistics are available to the public, they're published by the Revenue.  I'm not sure if they were at that time but I know at this stage they're published by the Revenue quarterly.  Anybody with a calculator can figure out what type of proportion of taxes make up such and such.  How would the chief economist of the Central Bank of Ireland have to assume these matters back at that time in 2004 -2005?</p></speech>

But, no, well, I think at the time things like VAT, you know, VAT on construction ... that wouldn't have been separated out, so people wouldn't have known that.  Now, we did a few studies late in the day, I think, admittedly, maybe around 2006-2007, trying  to focus in on the ... the property-related taxes.  The main one, I think, was the stamp duty, you know.  But you'd have to go behind the whole picture to get the VAT thing and that certainly wasn't upfront at the time.  But, yes, we were informally well aware, of course, that ... I mean, the construction sector - I think as maybe the Chairman was saying earlier on - directly employed one in seven in the economy.  If you take a broader view, you-----</p></speech>

And when you were chief economist ... obviously, under your position of chief economist, you had the number of divisions, one of them would have been statistics - wouldn't that be ... that'd be correct - economic analysis and monetary policy and fiscal stability.  When ... when these agencies, external agencies, were talking about a cushion to build up for the time when property transactions would fall, did you commission ... or ask any of the divisions below to actually ... "Let's actually look at what proportion of the State's revenue is made up of property transaction", or can you recall when, if any, that you actually asked for that type of research to be done?</p></speech>

But we were obviously aware of the fact that, yes, I mean, construction activity in the round was generating was a lot of tax revenue, which could fall away in due course.  So, we may not have quantified it, you know, at that early stage, but it was done later, yes.</p></speech>

I wouldn't regard it as a financial stability issue.  I mean, if consumption falls away, you know, VAT and excise duty will fall away, as they do from time to time, so, I mean, it might have had a effect.  Unless you got a massive collapse in the construction sector, as we had ... that did have a big effect.  But if construction were to fall back from say, one in seven in the economy being employed to one in eight, it wasn't going to be a big issue, you know.  You may as well, sort of, look at other tax headings and ask "If something were to happen there [you know] should we look into that carefully?"</p></speech>

I'm not sure if the IMF, the OECD and ECOFIN were all warning about property-related transactions or, for example, VAT-related transactions.  I think the question really is ... is what did you do after being prompted by external agencies in relation to this matter?

Not many people, if I recall, wrote anything about commercial property, and that was what caused the damage for Irish banks' profitability and caused them to require significant capital inflow.  </blockquote>I'd ask you two things.  Do you concur with that statement?  The second thing is, as chief economist, who had the ability to commission papers on commercial property, what did you do, when did you do it and what did you do with those papers if they were commissioned? </p></speech>

We didn't specifically commission research on commercial property for a separate paper but, I think, if you look back at the stability reports, they would have dealt with commercial property, you know.  For example ... I'm reminded the material sent to me pointed out that, say around 2003-04, lending to the commercial property sector was rising at 40% to 45%, so there would have been commentary on that including vacancy rates, rental incomes and so on, embedded in the stability reports.  Now, I think, later on then, there were special articles, if you like, in the stability report but that came late, I think.</p><p>Now I think later on then, there were special articles, if you like, in the stability reports but that came ... came late, I think.</p></speech>

You've been informing the committee - and we thank you for that - about the difficulties you had in trying to get your message out.  You now inform us that you had the ability to commission papers on behalf of the Central Bank and you did not commission any paper in relation to commercial property, which, you agree, was the reason that caused the banks to collapse eventually.</p></speech>

But I mean, if you're talking about a paper with separate covers, if you like, as research papers that I've done and issued from time to time, was there one on commercial property?  That didn't happen, I think, until about 2006 but we did have certainly commentary on commercial property developments - vacancy rates, rental, capital values of commercial property so they were all there and we knew that, you know.  So the commentary was there.  Maybe they weren't as highlighted as they might have been in special research papers until late, yes.</p></speech>

Back in the day, you'd wake up in the morning.  Property would be on the radio, it would be on the television.  You'd go for a pint that night and it would be the conversation at the table that you'd be drinking at and it would be at the table that I was having a pint at.  So talking to your colleagues about property you didn't have to be in the Central Bank.  You could have been working in a slaughterhouse or down making yo-yos or whatever.  Everybody was talking about property.  So I'm not ... I'm trying to get a quantification in my head from you as to as to how much general chit-chat you had on property in the Central Bank and on the 7th floor and how many documents you actually put your name to the end of that expressed concerns.</p></speech>

That's ... what I want to get at is a quantity of documents and research materials like Deputy Doherty indicated.  Presentations that had your name at the end of them that were reflecting the type of concerns that you're expressing here that you had many, many informal conversations about this over in ... in the building.  But I am trying to get a quantification as to how many documents you put your name to the end of that actually substantiated that position.</p></speech>

What I'm looking for is specifically something and it's not that you went out to<i>The Irish Times </i>and wrote an article or to the<i>Irish Independent</i>or the <i>Cork Examiner</i>for that matter or it's not that you would were going to do a Morgan Kelly issue but an internal memo, some correspondence that went into a formal structure.

Well, the one I would have been certainly responsible for was the one dealing with ... again, my name mightn't be on it because board papers didn't usually have ... often have the name on it, the data on house price levels throughout Europe where we were the highest by far in 2003 and, of course, it went higher.</p></speech>

And bearing in mind that there is section 33AK rulings where we wouldn't be getting that explicit.  But it would be very insightful for us if you could write back to us and maybe tell us where some of that documentation is that could assist us in locating it where your name is specifically at the end of it, rather than a composited document that was done as part of a team.  Could you that do that please?</p></speech>

Further to my earlier request there, for correspondence, Mr. O'Connell, what I would be looking for there is specifically material in which the key issues go beyond what was already in the public domain, not the general chit-chat that we were talking about earlier, but specific issues that you were feeding up the line.

I would have thought so because Ireland's collapse has not been a complicated one.  It is not like ... the Irish banks did not get involved in the sub-prime mortgage assets in the states, some of which were divided up and they got credit ratings on.  People have called it a commoner garden plain vanilla property crash.  So it did not require any sophistication to figure out what was happening, if you saw the data in front of you relating to property prices and bank lending.  I think I said in the opening statement, you had about ten other banking crashes similar to that in the previous 20 years.  So it did not require any sophisticated sort of simplification for the board members to figure out what was happening.</p></speech>

You were expected to.  In fact I remember famously a chap made a presentation at a conference.  It was about the money markets, money market interest rates, there was sort of a sophisticated econometrics.  He was told by the then Governor at the time "When you go to that conference I don't want to see anything in the paper and I don't believe in econometrics."  They were the two points made to him.</p></speech>

I will change briefly then to the OECD reviews from 2006 and 2008, noting that house prices had overshot their fundamentals.  In 2006 they did not rule out a hard landing but predicted that a soft landing was more likely.  In both 2006 and 2008 it concluded that the banks were sufficiently well capitalised to be able to absorb any likely shocks.  In your opinion, was the OECD's conclusions the result of data that they had obtained from the Central Bank or financial services regulator, or was it as a result of any independent analysis that they conducted themselves?</p></speech>

In fact my reading of the OECD, people have been saying that the IMF and OECD got it wrong totally, they missed it.  But actually if you look at the technical stuff in the IMF papers, I think there was annex 1 in maybe IMF 1999.  It was pretty clear that they were looking at overvaluations.  I think the OECD, this chap van den Noord and somebody else did a special article.  They made the point that if ... People were talking about fundamentals in relation to the property market here.  But when you think of it, the fundamentals would have been things like peoples' incomes and population and so on.  That is fair enough.  That drives the demand for housing, but that should not drive the price of housing.  If the demand for televisions goes up, for example, you don't expect the price of televisions to go through the roof.  In the case of housing, a house can't be produced as quickly as a television set.  That is where the zoning issue comes in, because housing has to be somewhat elastic in supply.  If it is not, you have got a big price increase when demand increases.</p> <p>  The OECD analysis, I think it was van den Noord and somebody else who wrote the article, I will glance at it again, they pointed out that if you look at the demand for housing and the fundamentals, if in the estimation period for your demand function, if the determining factors are actually themselves influenced by the boom, you are explaining boom prices in terms of boom explanatory factors, but that is not correct.  So they went back, because you are explaining boom in terms of booms which is circular.</p><p>They went back and said if you abstract from the boom period and you look at the econometric analysis up to, whatever it was, 1998, and you extrapolate further on from that, then, they said, the overvaluation is 50% and I wouldn't disagree with that.</p></speech>

I mean, the overall assessment, maybe in both the OECD and the IMF, tended to differ from what the technical analysis projected and in fact you could ... that can only be explained, I suppose, in terms of the people who are doing the overall assessment reckoned that, "Oh, this is a special, technical exercise, you know, it's a little bit ... okay, we can't be sure about it.  It's interesting, but it doesn't carry over to the main message."</p></speech>

One final area that I want to cover, in your opening statement and again without naming any names, but you stated that in the Central Bank, this is a direct quote: "In the Central Bank it was difficult to get views through that might impinge on vested interests."  I just want you to maybe briefly outline for the inquiry what those vested interests were and how they manifested themselves, really, in the operations of the Central Bank.</p></speech>

You try to put a gloss on things and that carried over, as I said earlier, to IMF and OECD assessments too.  If they were coming up with a negative message, you tried to twist their arms or at least various people tried to twist their arms, to put a gloss on things and not to put a negative picture forward.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connell, on page 4 of your written statement, you state, about halfway down through the second paragraph:<blockquote><br /><br />Around that time, a memo was sent from the economics function in the bank to the then Governor recommending that bank lending to the property sector needed to be reined in; for many years in the past the Central Bank imposed credit ceilings on banks in the interests of prudence.  The response to the note was that the Governor would have to consider bringing the proposal to the board.  However, at the top of the note were the words, evidently added subsequent to the first comment, &quot;That is out of the question&quot;.  (I have a copy of that memo.)</blockquote>Could you provide that memo to the committee, please?</p></speech>

I would have thought probably around the time when the Bacon reports were called for, that was around 1999.  In fact, I remember the Central Bank, in its commentaries at the time, would have been flagging, significantly, property price issues because I can ... I can recollect actually Shane Ross, in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>talking about the Cassandras in the Central Bank, you know, which sort of means that they're whinging about ... they're crying wolf, if you like.  So, back then, I mean, the ... in fact, yes, back then, even before the year 2000, there was a property bubble emerging.</p></speech>

In fact, when I went to a D&aacute;il ... an Oireachtas committee, I think it was to do with SME lending, which was an issue there a few years back - still is, I suppose - but I remember saying to them that property prices in Dublin were actually 12 times average national incomes.  When you come to think of it, the traditional benchmark, I think, as you Chairman said, was two and half times income.</p></speech>

It's commercial property that brings down banks.  So the focus ... I mean, what the origins of the focus on the residential mortgage market was I can't quite recollect but, I mean, it would be pretty obvious the indicators for house prices are out there, you know, or were out there.  Commercial property prices there's ... I don't think there's an official CSO statistic or series for that.  And if you look back at the stability reports you'll see, for example, CBRE indicators or Lisney's or whatever were used. So they were private ones, you couldn't ... I'm sure they were well complied but, there weren't official data there which by ... so there was the political importance of the housing sector and the fact that the official statistics related more to the private housing sector than commercial ... that probably explained why the focus tended to be on the housing sector, even though, I mean, history is replete with cases where-----</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connell, you're very welcome.  Can I start by asking you about the crisis simulation exercise conducted by the Central Bank?  You're familiar with that.  Feedback from staff involved in the crisis simulation exercise cited suggests, for example, too much information, too many voices.  Concerns were expressed by the Department of Finance regarding confusion over the roles of the Central Bank and the regulator and other comments.</p><p>Based on these comments in your opinion, can the simulation exercise have been deemed to meet the expectations?</p></speech>

So ... I think that maybe the material you sent to me there points out, you know, what the three different parties, how they, how they viewed this simulation exercise and what deficiencies they saw in it.  So ... did it serve its purpose?  That one did, I suppose in the sense that it did uncover problem areas.  I can remember I think at the time the Department of Finance, for example, they were in a room on the seventh floor and they were there for a long time and nobody came near them for about 20 minutes or half an hour and they wondering what it's all about.  So there was sort of lack of communication, things like prioritisation of data was necessary.  There was just too much data flying around, it wasn't clear which was important or whatever.</p></speech>

Given the parties comprising the domestic standing group, can you outline the possibility that there was a deficiency in the DSG operating model which may have resulted in the group's failure to identify early signs of the crisis?  I know that's in light of the comment you said there that by 2007 the goose was cooked, as such.</p></speech>

I think the first meeting was probably middle 2007 and at that point the liquidity problem had arisen straightaway.  I think it was 9 August.  BNP, I think had a problem, a liquidity problem.  In fact the governors across the eurosystem had to come back from their holidays to look at things.  So, they were straight in ... the DSG was straight into monitoring liquidity and in fact if you look I think at the material, the minutes and so on and the reports on the DSG for quite a while beyond that, it was very much focused on liquidity and the fact that the Irish banks were finding it more difficult to get access to funds and ... particularly to short-term funds, sorry to longer-term funds.  They couldn't roll over longer-term funds, so the Department needed to be kept apprised of that ... on a continuing basis, just to see, you know, how things were developing.</p></speech>

Things were going bananas you said, that was obvious from the data, that you told your superiors things were going crazy, the banks had to be reigned in, that a crash was inevitable, since 2004 there was mad lending, overvalued assets.  So, can I interpret from that, that you saw the crash coming?</p></speech>

And if i can go back to ... house prices were 12 times average incomes.  In fact I remember at that time, I said that to a D&aacute;il committee, an Oireachtas committee.  At that time <i>The Financial Times</i>, funnily enough, had a report by the Bank of England that house prices were seven times incomes in the UK, and the Bank of England said it was extremely worried about that.  So, Irish house prices had to fall by about half, clearly.  Or if you look at the ratio between house prices to incomes ... the dominator incomes, I mean if we had good times, per capita incomes in real times might increase by 3% and 4% a year.  So there was no way you were going to get that ratio down to four, five, six without a massive crash in property prices, so it was inevitable.  And in fact the Government itself, by its action in calling for the Bacon reports, as early as 1999, was clearly concerned about what happened.  But, subsequently, post I think the budget in 2002, tweaked things a little bit, after that house prices really took off.</p></speech>

But when the, when the Lehman's thing hit, and the shock to the credit markets really hit in September 2008, the whole thing was escalated to a higher level.  You know, the Governor, the Financial Regulator and the secretary of the Department of Finance came into the picture then, because you know, taxpayers money was at stake.  But ... I certainly wasn't in the loop on the guarantee at all, you know.</p></speech>

I mean, that sequence of events was certainly going to happen, but, I mean, I've been saying for years to people in the bank, that we had to rein in the banks.  You saw the answer I got ...

Yet, there was no response.</p></speech>

So can you just square for us what you had been saying all day today, and what you have said to me just now, with an extract for example, from the quarter 4 2007 economic bulletin, where you talk about property and prices, you said, &quot;Developments in residential output and property prices this year indicate a move towards a more sustainable position.&quot;  There's no hint there of an imminent collapse.  You said, &quot;Prices have eased somewhat and the supply of new houses is also adjusting to meet new market conditions.&quot;  You refer to:<blockquote><br /><br />... the underlying demand for housing in the economy [remaining] strong reflecting continuing income and employment growth.  In addition, the performance of the rest of the construction sector should help to ease the impact of the adjustment in the housing sector [etc, etc].</blockquote>And there is a lot more like that.

In fact, I remember my predecessor used to say, he has his own personal views, but, I mean, at these fora, meeting the press and so on, you're given the bank view.  Now, quarter 4, 2007 ... I would think that, as I said earlier, property prices peaked in February 2007, and you are, sort of, getting a gradual decrease at that point.  So, it was probably a hope or expectation that that sort of gradual decline, if you like, would continue.</p></speech>

So you're saying that on the one hand, you could hardly have a coffee break without issuing a stark warning to someone more senior than you about what was going to happen, and yet, you wrote this.</p></speech>

I've forgotten what I've said myself.  But I probably ... the gist of what is there was probably originally written down by me, but ... no, I can only see ... well ... I mean, a central bank can't in any case, as I've said earlier, they can't ... you can't talk about a crash happening, because you'll have it in the morning.  So, it was that comment I would suggest, as I say, probably reflected an extrapolation of what was happening since the previous February and the hope that that would continue.  I mean, it was clear that with one in seven in the workforce working in the construction sector, that had to fall to one in 14, which was the average in Europe.</p><p>So there had to be some adjustment, and I can recollect some outside commentators, the OECD and so on, saying that, you know, you'd have to move a large part of the construction workforce into the other sectors of the economy or else you'd have big difficulties.  So it was ... yes, that was probably an optimistic assessment of what the fallout would be, and, I mean, I wouldn't deny it that the timing of the Lehman's thing precipitated a big adjustment, but that is just what was going to come anyway.</p></speech>

One is this inference that you make on page 2 of your witness statement that the need to consider the issues of rezoning more land to increase housing supply was blocked from reaching a higher level in the bank in light, in your view, of political and property interests of the bank's board.  The political side I think we can understand to mean that people were directly appointed by politicians.  But can you clarify, the property interests of the bank board; are you referring to the ownership of property by individuals on the board, just in general terms, if you can clarify that, what you mean by that?</p></speech>

But, I mean, I think the aversion to mentioning zoning, even though it was a terribly low-key reference which I had in the draft, you know, I think the aversion to carrying it through into the final document was because zoning was a controversial area.  I mean, we had ... didn't we have the tribunal going on down below, you know, about the planning and so on?  Was it the-----</p></speech>

I'm just going to wrap up on just a number of items so.  One was an issue touched on Deputy McGrath there, and it's the housing report that you published in 2003.  There's a footnote, I think, where ... that specifically relates to yourself in terms of further information, if it's required.  It would indicate at that time that there was still time to take action to cool down house prices.  You referred earlier to the Bacon report, okay, the measures were in place, they were then removed, but the graph hadn't, and evidence earlier to this committee would show that the graph increased significantly 2003 onwards.  But in 2003, there was still time.  So can I ask you what action did you take, if any, regarding to the findings of this report, and if no actions were actually taken, and what I mean by specific actions is that you go in and you put a tight position on something, what actions, if any, were taken?  And if they weren't, why not?</p></speech>

And, I mean, I felt it wasn't really for me to sort of suggest actions, you know, because the ... I put the issues forward to the board and the Governor and in fact, actions could or would be taken only by the regulator and the actions taken would be as highlighted by Patrick Honohan's report.  You know, credit ceilings, or sectoral limits, moral suasion.  I mean, some of these things may have been tried with ... by the regulator.  But, in fact, I remember Con Horan saying to you folks here that in 2005, he suggested moving to take some actions, and he said to you that the CEO of the Financial Regulator took it up with the director general of the Central Bank, and to Con Horan's disquiet, that was put off until 2006.</p></speech>

I'd like to return to what action you may have taken, Mr. O'Connell?</p><p>Yes.  Well I ... I was on the bank side.  I couldn't take any actions <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the banks.

I think it might be of interest, Chairman, too, because one of my former colleagues who has a legal background said to me that - I think the question of the Governor's guidelines arose at some point and he ... my colleague, my former colleague, informed me that in actual fact the financial stability report constituted the Governor's guidelines because if the Governor had issued guidelines he was required, in accordance with section 33(d) of the 2003 Act, to put the guidelines in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  So for example, in the crisis situation he would have had to say, &quot;We're raising the capital ratios for all the banks, or putting sectoral limits on them.&quot;  And of course, in a crisis situation that would cause panic.</p></speech>

In ... as a senior economist and in your opinion and given that the role of the Central Bank is to maintain financial stability and that is what your No. 1 duty of care as a member of the Central Bank would have actually been, at what point did a microprudential issues with banks become macroprudential in terms of financial stability?</p></speech>

At the point where, I suppose, their ... the loan deposit ratio began to get out of hand, and I mean, that was ... if the ... when the loan deposit ratio began to exceed 1, or go beyond that, that effectively meant the banks were overtrading and they were relying on wholesale funding at that point.

And just to finalise, you can add whatever you wish then by means of conclusion as well, Mr. O'Connell.  You began your statement to the inquiry today with the remark that Ireland's banking and economic crash should never have been allowed to happen.  So, without getting into specific personalities - we're maybe dealing now in an institutional level - do you think that it shouldn't have been allowed to happen at an institutional level, and can you maybe identify which institutions were predominantly to take responsibility for this?  Is it the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, the Government, the Department of Finance?  Who is it?</p></speech>

I mean Greenspan famously said he believed, with the light regulation, he believed that bank executives wouldn't run their banks into the ground.  So the banks' boards and senior management were in the first line.  The second line, which not many people have focused on, is the institutional shareholders who had their funds at stake, investment management funds and so on - life companies.  They had large shareholdings in the banks.  I mean, why did they not rein in the banks?  And then behind that, you had the authorities - the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator.  So, they all had their part to play.  Now, unfortunately, with the principles-based regulation the authorities were sort of behind the curve on that, but the primary responsibility was clearly with the banks' boards and their senior management.</p></speech>
