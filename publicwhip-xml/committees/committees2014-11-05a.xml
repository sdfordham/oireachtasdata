The Bill was amended on Committee Stage in the Seanad and was referred to the select sub-committee by order of the D&aacute;il on 9 October last.  The Bill will amend the Civil Registration Act 2004 in order to address a range of issues identified since the passage into law of that Act and streamline the service available to the public.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Social Protection, Deputy Kevin Humphreys, who has special responsibility for activation, and his officials.  As this is the Minister of State's first appearance before the select sub-committee, I take the opportunity to congratulate him on his appointment.</p></speech>

These also include an unborn child who dies in the womb of the mother due to death of the mother but otherwise meets the weight or age criteria herein;&rdquo;,&rdquo;.</blockquote></blockquote>On Second Stage I made reference to a particular case involving an unborn child, Mollie Enright.  I stated that she was killed as a result of a road accident in which her mother committed suicide.  I very much regret that what I said did not reflect the actual situation.  Apparently, she was killed as a result of injuries sustained by her mother, Mary Enright, <i>n&eacute;e</i>Walsh, in a road collision with another motorist, Robert Stoker.  The Garda was seeking Mr. Stoker at the time as it was believed he was suicidal and a danger to himself and others.  I apologise to the family of Mollie Enright for any distress caused and I wish to have the record corrected in respect of this matter.<br/>There was a very brief discussion on the matter to which amendment No. 1 relates on Second Stage.  The essential purpose of the amendment is to ensure that the births of children such as the late Mollie Enright can be registered.  I recall the Minister of State indicating that the Government would bring forward its own amendment on either Committee Stage or Report Stage - I am not quite sure which - and perhaps he will outline where matters currently stand.</p></speech>

There have been occasions when I have also got names and facts a little mixed up.<br/>The position with regard to the matter in question is that we have taken the advice of the Attorney General, who has stated that there is no need for an amendment.  We have since contacted the family's solicitor and contacted the relevant Department.  The advice of the Attorney General indicates that where a baby dies <i>in utero</i>as a result of the death of its mother and where it meets either the required weight or gestational age criteria, it comes within the current definition of &quot;stillborn child&quot; contained in section 2(1) of the Civil Registration Act 2004.</p> <p>The current definition of the stillborn child allows that where an unborn baby dies in the womb of a mother, due to the death of the mother, a stillbirth may be registered in accordance with section 28 of the 2004 Act.  I hope this will give some comfort to families bereaved in such circumstances.  The clarification we have received from the Attorney General is that it can be registered.  There is a case before the court, so I am acting on the advice of the Attorney General.</p></speech>

He states that the crucial words in section 2(1) of the 2004 Act are undoubtedly that the term stillborn means a child who "at birth" and that with all due respect to the learned Attorney General's view, he cannot agree that the use of the words "at birth" can include the removal of the remains of a child in the course of a post mortem autopsy, as occurred here, and that the procedure is not even to be equated with a surgical procedure, as might occur at a birth by caesarean section.  The conclusion of his opinion is that he is aware the Civil Registration (Amendment) Bill is currently on Committee Stage in the D&aacute;il and that it seems to him to that the present lacuna in the registration system can only be cured by a statutory amendment to the definition of "stillborn child" to expressly include an unborn child of a given weight and age who dies in the womb of the mother as a result of the mother's death or, alternatively, that such an unborn child in such circumstances must be provided for in a separate category.</p><p>  I know the Minister of State has received the advice of the Attorney General but this is the advice of a very respected senior counsel who practises extensively in this particular area of law and which runs directly counter to it.  Did the Minister of State say there was a case before the courts?</p></speech>

This is the case about which the Minister of State is talking.</p></speech>

The definition of a stillborn child is contained in section 2(1) of the 2004 Act that provides that a stillborn child means a child who at birth weighs not less than 500 grams or who has a gestation age of not less than 24 weeks and shows no sign of life.  The advice from the Attorney General is quite clear.  In regard to the particular case about which the Deputy is talking, we are in correspondence with-----</p></speech>

We will come back to it on Report Stage but it seems a bit peculiar in that no further damage would be done to the system by accepting the amendment.  It would put the matter beyond any shadow of a doubt.  Simply because the Attorney General takes one statutory interpretation and a senior counsel takes another view that a bit extra is needed, it seems very flaithulach to say the least to be going to court with taxpayers' money paying the costs.</p></speech>

If it does not stand the test of the court, I urge the Minister of State to look at it again to ensure there will not be a difficulty in the future.  The Bill does not address it and the Attorney General's advice is that we do not need to address it because it is, in some way, covered.  It obviously has not been covered to date and that is the problem.  The advice was not available in that certificates were not issued, otherwise families would not have gone to court to try to ensure their child was included on the stillbirth register.</p><p>  I am happy there is some progress and that some discussion has taken place on this but we need a commitment that if the findings of the court are contrary to the advice from the Attorney General, we will come back to this quite quickly and look at the proposal Deputy O'Dea and others have.  There is a range of ways to tackle this.  It would require a single paragraph in legislation if the court does not accept the Attorney General's advice.</p></speech>

Everybody is trying to do the same thing here for families going through the trauma of a stillbirth.  The case Deputy O'Dea mentioned is particularly unfortunate.  There can be unforeseen consequences of amending the legislation.  Stillbirth registrations have taken place.  There seems to be a particular problem here.  The coroners have been written to notifying them of the Attorney General's advice.  I hope this will resolve the matter.  I thank Deputy O'Dea for being constructive and not pressing the amendment.</p></speech>

It goes on to provide that if the mother attends alone, she must provide information as to the father's name and contact details.  There are a number of exceptions to that.  The first exception is that she does not know who the father is.<i>Nemo dat quod non habet</i>- if one does not know the identity of the father, obviously one cannot provide that information.  <br/>The second exception is where she does not know the whereabouts of the father.  In that case, nothing at all about the father appears on the certificate.  It seems only reasonable and fair that, at a minimum, the father's name appears, even if she does not know his whereabouts, and that the last known address be put on the certificate, as provided for in the amendment.  If that is a bridge too far, at a minimum, his name should appear on the certificate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-05a.38" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1033" speakername="Kevin Humphreys" time="13:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ED22014110500004#C02500"><p>On the basis of the information, the registrar will make all reasonable attempts to contact the man named as the father and request him to provide particulars in regard to the birth.  That is the key.  There is an element of natural justice here.  Before somebody's name appears on the birth certificate, he must be contacted and confirmation, information and evidence must be given.  For somebody not to be informed or contacted, and for it not to be ascertained whether he agrees he is the father, is questionable.</p> <p> If the mother of the child attends with the Registrar, and she gives the last known address, telephone number, e-mail address, etc., the Registrar will do his absolute best to identify and contact the father and ensure that the father's name is on the birth certificate.  Were somebody to arrive into the Lombard Street office, as it would be in Dublin, stating, "Kevin Humphreys is the father of the child", with no contact made with Kevin Humphreys to ask is he the father of the child or had he any contact, there has to be some sense of natural justice that the person would be contacted and told that his name is going on the birth certificate to state he is the father.  Unless such contact is made, it would be difficult to sustain in natural justice.  We must ensure that the register is robust and that the father is contacted, if at all possible, to ascertain whether or not he is the father of the child.</p></speech>

However, I will not hold up the passage of the Bill.</p><p>  Given the substantial change, it is interesting that those who would normally lobby us in terms of human rights and changes to the law, such as the Law Society of Ireland, have not been in contact on this.  There is a degree of compulsion, albeit in some ways welcome because in a small society in Ireland there are elements of genetics, elements of the rights of a child to know his or her father and a range of issues on which everybody is exercised, but there are also the rights of the mother on occasion as well, for instance, in the case of rape.  Will there be a compulsion, if the woman has not reported it?</p><p>  In the case of young people, for instance, there is a consequence, if a 15 year old who got pregnant declares on the birth certificate of the child a 15 or 16 year old father, that the father could be charged.  We had this debate not so long ago where one is dealing with a child in one sense, but also with a criminal offence which now is reportable.  In such a case, any official, doctor, nurse or registrar would have to report it immediately to social services and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, and rightly so, but it is in some ways the unknown consequence.  I am not saying that we necessarily create a loophole, but we must be aware that sometimes when we try to do right there can be instances where the outcome is not favourable.  Perhaps that is covered in part of the Bill which allows the Registrar not to register if there is compelling reason and in that case, it might be that the Registrar would say to leave it a few years.  The problem is that if the Registrar said that, he would be breaking the law.</p><p>  There are many instances where the mother will not register the father, maybe because at the time of birth he is abusive or for one or more of a range of issues, and there is a retrospective registering of the father.  Similar to Deputy O'Dea's last request, in a case where a father challenges this and says "No", will the State pay for the DNA tests at that stage if he refuses to acknowledge or be named on a birth certificate if he has no role in the life of the mother or child?  I ask this because it will be a challenge.  There are a lot of fathers who are aware of their responsibilities, have denied them for years and will not take it easily that they are being named on birth certificates.  Somebody must foot the bill to ensure, if they are the father, that such is recognised through a DNA test or some mechanism.  In that instance one is getting into compulsion.</p><p>  I am not opposed to the section but am striking a note of caution.  The system has worked quite well up until now.  For many years there has been a problem where for beneficial financial reasons some might have signed the birth certificate with the father's name on it.  I might come back to the matter to see whether I can tighten it up a little at Report Stage or I might leave it to the Minister.  We have at least raised those concerns.  Perhaps the Registrar, when this is passed, can have a detailed note on what to do in specific instances, but I would be interested in those complex cases involving the teenage years of 15 and 16.</p></speech>

This is a reforming Bill.  To his credit the Deputy recognised in the House the benefits to the father of the inclusion of the father's name on the birth certificate.  It is progress.  We are making technical amendments to ensure that the register is robust.</p><p>  I will try to answer some of the questions the Deputy raised.  On the child safety element of not including the father's name, on receipt of a statutory declaration from the mother that it would not be in the best interests of the child to have the name of the father included, the Registrar, taking into account the evidence available to him or her, may decide not to include the father's name on the birth record.  In the case of the safety or best interest of the child, that allows for the mother to give a statutory declaration.</p><p>  On the case of those underage, we cannot deal with everything within the register.  In the cases the Deputy outlined, that would have come to notice at a stage much earlier than the issue of a birth certificate.  The question of whether or not to prosecute an individual is a matter for the Director of Public Prosecutions.  All matters relevant to the DPP are proper to my colleague, the Minister for Justice and Equality.  We have liaised with the Department of Justice and Equality to ascertain the current statutory powers of the DPP in prosecution of minors which is covered under section 3 of the Criminal Law (Sexual Offences) Act  2006.  There is an element of discretion within that Act.  We will forward that section of the Act to the Deputy afterwards or, if he wishes, I can read through it now.</p></speech>

I appreciate that this does not fall under the remit of the Minister of State or the Department of Social Protection.  The corresponding rights should be given to the fathers.  Obviously, fathers have rights and responsibilities.  As far as I am aware, in Scotland and the other jurisdictions in the UK, if one's name is on the birth certificate one gets automatic guardianship rights.  I am sure that is qualified in a manner like that outlined by the Minister of State, for example, when issues arise regarding the best interests of the child.  The proposal made by the Department of Justice and Equality in a forthcoming Bill does not nearly go far enough.  It continues the discrimination against unmarried fathers.  To be honest, it does this in a kind of moral or judgmental way.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh said things have worked well, but I do not think they really have.  In addition to my anecdotal knowledge of cases, I have some family law experience from my time as an apprentice solicitor.  I was not involved in this area when I worked as a solicitor.  When I was dealing with cases, I felt that many unmarried fathers, or even fathers who were married, were pushed away from playing a part in their children's lives.  It is the law that does that as much as anything else.  I suggest that if they were given more rights, they would take more responsibility.  As I recall it, a finding along these lines was contained in a study that was carried out at one stage by an academic at Waterford Institute of Technology.  The study basically suggested that the rules and regulations of our society, and the manner in which things operate, are pushing unmarried fathers away from playing an active part as parents.  While I welcome this legislation as a start, I think the corresponding legislation should be used to follow the example of other jurisdictions that give full guardianship rights to unmarried fathers whose names are on birth certificates.  I just wanted to make that point.</p></speech>

She will appreciate that her suggestion cannot be contained in this Bill, which deals with the register only.  I understand what she is saying.  I do not think there is a Deputy in the House who has not dealt with a case in his or her constituency involving a man who is not getting an opportunity to participate in the rearing of his own son or daughter.  That full participation is often blocked by legislation.  There is quite a campaign in this regard.  I would have great sympathy for it.  A children and family relationships Bill, the general scheme of which was published last month, is currently being drafted by the Department of Justice and Equality.  I think the ideas expressed in the Deputy's comments would fit very well into that legislation.  I am not sure whether that Bill will come before this committee.  On a personal basis, I will be very interested in the progress of that Bill through the Oireachtas.  I am sure every Deputy who is present has encountered on many occasions the scenario outlined by Deputy Tuffy.  It is not just the father who is affected - there is also an impact on the grandparents and the wider family.  I hope the forthcoming children and family relationships Bill can capture this in some way.  When one is drafting legislation, it is very difficult to use it as a blunt instrument where families are concerned.  I hope the Bill in question will make a good effort to deal with some of the points raised by Deputy Tuffy.</p></speech>

What is the relevant level here?  The major change we are being asked to agree will make it quite difficult for non-EU citizens to marry.  At the very least, it will make them jump through an extra loop through which Irish citizens do not have to jump.  Due to the level of emigration in recent years, many young Irish citizens have travelled abroad.  In the coming years, some of them might come back to Ireland with a fianc&eacute; in order to marry here.  We need to be careful to ensure what we provide for here does not restrict a loving couple in any way.  Is the problem of marriages of convenience of such a scale that it requires a substantial change in law?  We have heard about it in the newspapers, especially in the tabloids that love to run with stories suggesting that problems like this are rampant.  The number of marriages involving EU or non-EU citizens in Ireland is not that high.  I think it was higher in 2009.  Some of the criteria that will be considered are quite interesting.  They show how much we have moved.  One of the factors to be considered is whether "the parties to the intended marriage have lived together in the past or if they currently live together".  I can imagine Archbishop McQuaid looking at that many moons ago.</p> <p>The questions on where they have lived are interesting, particularly if it was abroad.  There is always the test with regard to how they know each other.  Many years ago I was on a television programme similar to "Mr &amp;amp; Mrs" on Teilif&iacute;s na Gaeilge when it was in its infancy; that is how far back it was.  I do not think between us my wife and I got any of the questions right.</p></speech>

One must be careful not to make it difficult for people who intend to get married while, at the same time, protecting the State and our society from people abusing the marriage registration system.

Section 4(C) mentions the registrar forming an opinion and these are guidelines to help him or her do so.  I reassure the Deputy that the registrar will be trained on this through an extensive programme.  In no way does it undermine the important element of marriage.  It reinforces the institution.  Anecdotal evidence exists that there is a problem and a concern has been highlighted with regard to protecting women against trafficking.  It is an important element of the Bill, which is a preventive measure before it gets too problematic.  As information and data is collected during the period, it will show it is necessary.</p></speech>

There is a difficulty because every case depends on its own facts.  The legislation will give the registrar discretion, but in exercising this discretion he or she must examine various issues and obviously this list is not exhaustive.  If one does not pass the test on one or two of the issues, it does not necessarily mean there will be a conclusion against one.  The balance is difficult to achieve.  The Minister of State has probably done the best job he could in trying to find a balance because an individual decision will be made in each individual case.</p></speech>

It is the equivalent of an attempt at fraud.  If this is the case and it happens on a number of occasions, it will dissuade others from attempting it.  This would be the quickest way to ensure this provision in the legislation would not have to be used.</p></speech>

At present what we have is not sufficient, so we will introduce a slightly higher bar.  Registrars are extremely experienced in this area and will also have support and training.  The Deputy is absolutely correct, as once someone attempting a marriage of convenience is challenged, he or she will take flight.  I hope the introduction of the legislation will prevent an abuse taking place.  I thank Deputy O'Dea for his remarks.  It is a difficult area in which to draft legislation.  This is an extremely good attempt to do so but it needs to be kept under review.</p></speech>

The registrar should decide what documentation and information to seek in respect of immigration status.  Some foreigners who present here left their own countries with just the clothes on their backs.  Some of them had to flee in very extenuating circumstances.

These measures are mirrored elsewhere in the Bill in provisions combating marriages of convenience.  There is some concern that a link potentially exists between the trafficking of women, particularly young women, and taking part in a marriage or civil partnership of convenience.  It is crucial these women are protected against these forms of exploitation.</p><p>  Section 21 of the Bill provides that where one or both of the people notifying a registrar of their intention to enter into a civil partnership is a foreign national, they must provide documents and information regarding migration status as specified by the Registrar General.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-05a.105" nospeaker="true" time="13:45:00" ><p>Section 25 introduces a number of provisions to combat civil partnerships of convenience to make such civil partnerships more difficult to contract in the future.  A list of criteria that the registrar will consider when forming an opinion that a proposed civil marriage is one of convenience is set out in this section.</p><p>The section also allows for the registrar to receive an objection stating that the proposed civil partnership consists of a civil partnership of convenience and in forming the opinion there are grounds for the objections to refer the matter to the superintendent registrar for a decision.  The request to produce documented evidence will assist the registrar in forming an opinion as to whether a proposed marriage or civil partnership is one of convenience.  We are concerned about the entering into a marriage or a civil partnership solely for the purpose of securing migration advantage.  That is an important element of the Bill.</p><p>The Deputy's amendment No. 5 to section 21 proposes that when deciding which documents and information to seek, the Registrar General shall take into account the particular circumstances of the individual in question.  That relates to the point the Deputy was making.  The registrar who will be operating those procedures is very experienced and deals with persons from a diverse range of cultures and circumstances on a daily basis.  The policy in regard to seeking documentary evidence will be operated in line with the principles of natural justice.  Does that reassure the Deputy?</p></speech>

He is accompanied by his Bank of Ireland colleagues, Mr. Liam McLoughlin, chief executive retail Ireland, and Mr. Pat Farrell, group head of communications and Government relations.<br/>In terms of the format of this meeting, Mr. Boucher will make comments on the presentation circulated to committee members.  In advance of the meeting questions were gathered from committee members and submitted to the Bank of Ireland.  I thank Mr. Boucher and his staff for responding in writing to these questions and the responses have been distributed to committee members.  These responses, together with the input of the witnesses today, should mean all of the key topics will be covered but, nonetheless, a question and answer session will follow to clarify matters.<br/>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to switch off all mobile telephones.  I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are further directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>Before I ask Mr. Boucher to begin I want us to agree on some ground rules to ensure everyone has an opportunity to ask questions as this will allow for the best meeting possible.  I am proposing that lead speakers for each group have ten minutes.</p> <p>I propose that lead speakers for each group will have ten minutes, followed by other committee members who shall have five minutes and anybody else wishing to ask questions, who will also have five minutes.  The clerk to the committee and I will be keeping an eye on the clock and I will advise members when a minute is remaining of their time to allow them to wrap up because I will be keeping them within their allotted time.  If members have further questions I will be happy, time permitting, to allow them to speak again once I have given everyone a fair opportunity to put their questions.  It would not serve the purpose of the meeting if the time is used to make statements because witnesses would not have the opportunity to respond properly.  I ask members and witnesses to keep their questions and answers short and to the point to facilitate the best interaction possible.  I ask members' co-operation to assist in the smooth running of the meeting.  Is that agreed? Agreed.  I invite Mr. Boucher to make his presentation and ask him to limit it to approximately ten minutes.</p></speech>

As members will be aware, Bank of Ireland received an investment of &euro;4.8 billion from the taxpayer.  The bank has repaid that in full.  We paid in excess of &euro;6 billion in cash to the taxpayer and the taxpayer retains a valuable 14% discretionary shareholding in the bank.  There are ongoing developments in the regulatory landscape at European level which relate to our sector, including the single supervisory mechanism for banks which officially came into being yesterday, 4 November 2014.  As part of these reforms, the European Central Bank recently announced the results of its comprehensive assessment of 130 banks, including Bank of Ireland group.  The overall result for Bank of Ireland confirmed that the group has passed the ECB comprehensive assessment with substantial capital buffers.  With regard to the wider economy, we see a strengthening of the economic recovery.  The latest Bank of Ireland economic outlook, which was published last month, projects growth of 4.2% for 2015, up from our forecast earlier this year of approximately 3.4%.  The economy is, therefore, recovering more quickly than we anticipated.  Our meeting is timely in that context.</p><p>  We provided a comprehensive presentation to members in advance of our meeting, including an overview of the bank; a guide to our strategic objectives, an update on issues relating to the comprehensive assessment; our interim management statement, which issued on Friday and is the latest information we have provided to the market on our performance and prospects; and an overview of our main businesses as they relate to our Irish operations.  We have also returned to the committee the answers to a range of questions.  We have given as much detail as we can in answering these questions and we have also provided guidance on where the relevant information is listed in our annual reports.  We have also supplied additional documentation in the form of various public announcements.</p><p>  As a public company we make extensive disclosures on a wide range of issues through various formats and media.  Given that we are 86% owned by the private sector, certain information is in our judgment commercially sensitive and due to our responsibilities to all shareholders and my duties as director, we have to signal that we strive to ensure members have the necessary and appropriate opportunity to understand our strategy.  As a public company quoted in the London and New York stock exchanges, all information we have provided has been verified.  As this is a public discussion and we have issued a public document on the bank's trading performance, I am obliged to say on record this is not a guide to future performance of the bank and is not a solicitation for people to buy stock in the bank.</p><p>  The State's 14% discretionary shareholding in the bank is a matter for the Minister for the Finance.  Under our approved EU restructuring plan, with all State aid having been repaid, the relationship between the Minister and the bank is governed by our relationship framework agreement, which recognises the bank as a separate economic entity managed on a commercial basis and engaging with the Minister in accordance with best institutional practice.  Our goal for this meeting is to present to and discuss with the committee our performance and strategy based on the best institutional shareholder practice.</p><p>  Slides 5 and 6 of our presentation summarises an extensive document and refers to a number of issues.  Bank of Ireland has made considerable progress over the past 12 months, and certainly since we appeared before the committee 12 months ago.  This has been assisted by the fact that the economic environment in our core markets of Ireland and the United Kingdom has continued to improve.  We have completed the repayment of the taxpayers' investment and the taxpayers have made a profit.  On today's market capitalisation of &euro;9.7 billion, the 14% shareholding that the taxpayers have in the bank has a notional value of approximately &euro;1.3 billion.  It is a significant milestone on top of our repayment to the taxpayers that we are now profitable and generating capital.  We have passed the ECB's comprehensive assessment with significant buffers.  We have robust funding and capital ratios which provide both security and support for our strategic growth objectives.  Our defaulted loans have decreased by &euro;1.9 billion between June 2013 and September 2014, and our new lending is on target.  Our Irish consumer, business and corporate banking target in our financial plan for 2013-17 is new lending into the economy of &euro;33 billion.</p><p>  In terms of the economy as a whole, our view is that it is going through the classic phases of an economic recovery in a restructured economy.  The main feature that has emerged over the past 12 months has been that internal demand and consumption are complementing the growth in exports.  Bank of Ireland is the largest lender into the Irish economy.  We are the No. 1 bank for SMEs.  Based on our information and verified analysis of Central Bank information, we have provided over 50% of new non-property lending to SMEs in 2014 to date.  We have enjoyed particularly strong performance in our agriculture, motor finance and commercial finance businesses.  We provide more than 50% of new lending to the agriculture sector.  Bank of Ireland's corporate bank has a market share of more than 30% and well over 50% of foreign direct investment companies bank with us.  We have a market share of approximately 25% of savings products.  Our mortgage business in Ireland is providing one in every three new mortgages.  Our life assurance business, New Ireland, is the No. 2 overall provider of life pensions and investments in Ireland.  In Northern Ireland we have a universal bank offering.  We have been through a significant cost restructuring programme to position ourselves in that market.  We are determined to remain in Northern Ireland and to position ourselves to reflect the particular dynamics of that market.  In Great Britain, through our partnership model with the post office we are one of the largest challenger consumer banking franchises.  With 3 million customers, we have more customers in Great Britain than we do in our Irish businesses.  In addition, we have a very profitable acquisition finance business which operates in the US and continental Europe and which has negotiated its way through a number of credit cycles utilising its cash flow lending expertise.</p><p>  Slides 14 and 15 deal with the components of the new banking union.  Members will have noted the results for Bank of Ireland, which confirm we have significant buffers.  Slides 17 to 20 are directly extracted from the market announcement we made last Friday.  I will not go through them other than to highlight that our revenue has continued to go up and our new lending is on target.  The group has remained focused on tight cost control while we continue to invest in our people, businesses and infrastructure.  We confirmed in our announcement that we are in the process of a ballot by IBOA represented staff on a comprehensive new career and reward framework which was recommended by an independent arbitrator.  Our asset quality trends have continued to improve in line with our expectations.  We believe this reflects the work we are doing and the overall improvement in the economy.  The figure for total defaulted loans has decreased by &euro;1.9 billion since June 2013 to &euro;16.4 billion on 30 September 2014.  We continue to generate capital at a significant pace and have seen an increase of 180 basis points in our common equity tier 1 ratio from 12.3% at the end of January to 14.1% at the end of September.</p><p>  Slide 24 provides some information on our new lending in Ireland.  It is not up-to-date to the end of September but in our September update we indicated that lending growth had continued at roughly the same pace.  We can see where our lending growth has gone, particularly in our Irish business, in our SME business, in our corporate banking and our mortgage business.</p> <p>Slide 26 shows a confirmation of the group's balance sheet at the end of September.</p></speech>

It is a confirmation of the capital strength of the group, which is very important, obviously to give security to our depositors and other providers of services and also to demonstrate that Bank of Ireland is very strongly capitalised to be able to achieve our strategic objectives in Ireland and in our other businesses.</p><p>  From the questions we received in advance from the committee, appropriately, there was a significant focus on asset quality and mortgages in particular on our Irish mortgage books.  We have responded to those as best we can in the questions and we tried also to provide updates on that in the pack.</p><p>  Slides 28 to 43 provide a mix of the position at the end of June, and wherever we have been able to do it, we have brought it up to date to the position at the end of September.  I am advising the market that the information at the end of September is new disclosures.</p></speech>

There is a significant amount of information on mortgage arrears on slides 28 to 43, confirming that our mortgage arrears have come down by 24% from our peak.  Nine out of ten of our private dwelling home, PDH, accounts and eight out of ten of our buy-to-let mortgages are up to date.  For nine out of ten private homes and eight out of ten buy-to-let cases where the customer has identified, through an SFS, a problem in paying, we can provide a sustainable solution.  The solutions are set out on the slides, and in excess of 86% of those solutions and restructures are being adhered to.</p><p>  There was a particular question about SME loans and defaults on the SME loans, in particular, the Irish SME loan book.  The left-hand side of slide 43 shows that the defaulted loans on the Irish SME book or business banking book continued to reduce.  It shows that our provision coverage had increased and it confirms that in nine out of ten of the challenged customers, we have restructures or resolution strategies in place and in 90% of those cases they have been adhered to.</p><p>  We have given significant information in slides 46 to 59, which is a reference point for the business and in particular focuses on our Irish businesses, which I will quickly go through.  In terms of the time factor and reflecting the Chairman's request, I will wrap up by saying that now and for the future the Bank is focused on supporting and benefiting from the Irish economic recovery, developing our relations with our existing and new customers, continuing to provide and develop solutions for customers in financial difficulty, effectively managing the developing regulatory environment, generating capital, managing risk, developing qualified, trained, committed and motivated employees to work as a team to deliver our objectives as a business, increasing our profitability, and through all the above having a sustainable business.  Sustainability is important in terms of the way we look at our businesses, providing sustainable propositions to our customers and sustainable returns to our shareholders.</p></speech>

In regard to the net interest margin on standard variable loans, the margin the bank has in respect of those loans at over 3% seems quite high.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-05a.155" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110500005#F00700"><p>The margin is not necessarily based on it because we have a liquidity risk with mortgages.  A mortgage is a 20 to 25-year instrument and we take liquidity risk in the provision of mortgages.  We look at those as they operate elsewhere.  Yesterday the Irish Government, which is, in effect, the base risk-free investment, issued a 15-year bond at just under 2.5%.  Our fixed rate offering is 4.99% and that is a 2.5% margin.  For our margin, and, in particular, for our capital allocation models and the capital allocation the Central Bank requires to hold against our different books, we must take into consideration our loss experience.  Our loss experience on our Irish mortgage books has been different from what it has been in Europe.  Another comparator I would note is that we have a business in the UK and our mortgage business in the UK is roughly the same size as our Irish mortgage business.  It is a very similar type of market structure and I will return to why that is the case.  The spreads and margins in the UK in which we operate are the same.<br/>Some reference has been made to a comparison between Irish rates and European rates.  A couple of features I would note in that respect is that the loss experience is different, so the capital allocation is different.  However, a very significant feature of a number of the European markets is tax-based subsidies for bond markets.  An example is the <i>Pfandbriefe </i>market in Germany where banks operate as originators and issuers and they sell their mortgages on to bond markets.  If we take into account that there is tax-based or taxpayers' subsidy for those bond markets, it is not comparable.  The more comparable market in terms of market structure and access to bond markets is the UK market against the Irish market.</p></speech>

As my time is limited, I can only cover some of the key issues.  I want to continue with the issue the Chairman raised, in particular about the pricing strategy for standard variable rate mortgages.  The bank is currently charging in the region of 4.5% for a new mortgage if the loan-to-value is over 80%.  How can Mr. Boucher justify that when his stated cost of funds is 1.15%, which have come down by about 30% in the past 12 to 18 months?  The bank's margin has increased very substantially.  Most people would regard a variable rate product as one where if the market conditions are bad, the rate is going to go up, but when the market conditions are good, people expect the variable rate to come down, but that has not happened.  When was the last standard variable rate reduction by Bank of Ireland in respect of mortgage products?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-05a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110500005#F01000"><p>The last reduction would have been in 2008 or 2009.  There has been no significant interest rate cycle in that period.  The group's net interest margin has improved in the 12 month period from 1.65% to 2.08%.  That is progress but is certainly not an exorbitant margin.  We have to get 98% of our credit decisions right before we can make any money or cover our costs at that particular margin.  As I was trying to identify in my answer to the Chairman's question, the structure and liquidity risk one takes against mortgages are important.  We are providing a mortgage which has a significant liquidity risk.  We have a repricing opportunity but we are giving a 25-year commitment of money to the customer.  We cannot raise that money so it is not necessarily comparable to look at our overall cost of funds.  For example, if we issue a covered bond or unsecured debt in the markets, we are issuing it at about 2% to 3%.  The Irish Government in raising 15-year money in the market at 250 basis points.  One has to take account of the nature of the product one provides, the liquidity risks, the historic credit losses one has taken and the capital one applies.  There are a range of factors in that.  We have to enhance our margin but we try to ensure our products are competitive on an ongoing basis.  We are a commercial business, we operate in a competitive market and we must ensure our products are sustainably competitive, that we can continue in the market, attract customers and do business.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-05a.159" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="14:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014110500005#F01100"><p>The bank's margin has increased very substantially.  Its cost of funds has reduced very substantially by about one third in the past 12 to 18 months and yet Mr. Boucher is telling me it is about six years since Bank of Ireland has reduced the standard variable rate being charged.  One of the bank's main competitors, AIB, has stolen a march on it in the market and has reduced its rate.  I presume Bank of Ireland will have to follow suit.  Mr. Boucher will not confirm that today but, ultimately, the market will dictate the bank's reaction.  I submit to Mr. Boucher that the bank is taking advantage of variable rate customers.  They are being exploited.  It will come as a surprise to nobody that a bank seeks to maximise profits, but this bank is profiteering on the backs of variable rate customers.  Mr. Boucher made the comparison with the UK market which he said is the best comparison with Ireland.</p> <p>Across the Border, Bank of Ireland offers a 1.98% fixed rate up to January 2017 if I have a low loan-to-value ratio of 60% or a 2.09% fixed rate or a variable rate of just over 2% for at least two years if my LTV ratio is 75%.  There is a more competitive environment in the North.  If, after two years, Bank of Ireland does not keep the rate low for a customer, he or she can switch to another bank.  Customers in the South do not have that option.  How can Mr. Boucher justify such a massive difference between the rates Bank of Ireland charges in the Republic and the rates it charges in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, given his statement to the effect that both markets are remarkably similar?</p></speech>

We can buy fixed rate money and we offer fixed rate mortgages.  We are still surprised at the lack of take-up of fixed rate money in the market.  We note that the Government has made a decision to try to fix rates over a period.  We try to offer attractive fixed rates.  We would encourage customers to consider fixed rates.  A fixed rate gives a customer certainty and control of his or her finances in so far as that is possible.  We provide attractive and competitive fixed rates.</p><p>  As the Deputy stated, we operate in a competitive market.  We review our rates on an ongoing basis.  We also bear in mind our responsibilities to all of our stakeholders - our depositors, our shareholders and the taxpayers whom we have repaid.  The strategies of other banks are something we keep an eye on, but we have learned not to follow them slavishly.  We consider other banks, the sustainability of their propositions and their ability to attract capital to fund themselves and meet all of their commitments to their stakeholders.</p></speech>

He was the one who drew the comparison with the UK market, calling it remarkably similar to Ireland's.  He stated that the average rate Bank of Ireland charged in the UK was approximately 4%.  However, the offering it makes to new customers in Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK is remarkably competitive and strikingly different from the offering it makes in the Republic.  Mr. Boucher has cited a rate of 4.5% at a time when its cost of funding is probably 1% or so.  That is a remarkable margin to charge for variable rate products.  I am not just referring to mortgages but also to personal loans for which Bank of Ireland charges approximately 12%, to credit cards for which it charges 20% or so and to loans to small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, which are paying way over the odds.</p></speech>

We must take into account liquidity risks, especially as regards mortgages.  It is a 25 to 30 year proposition to customers.  As such, we must take a liquidity risk for that duration.  The Government has taken out a 15-year bond at 2.5%.  It is difficult to compare one product or its features with another.  We must have subordinated capital.  We must have a range of instruments of various maturities to match our different products.  We are also required to take into account the weighted cost of capital against products.  This must also factor in loss experience.  Our loss experience on our UK mortgage book is different.  To assist the Deputy, though, we will provide him with our UK and Irish mortgage rates so that he can have an appropriate comparative.</p></speech>

I have been signalled that I am moving on to my last question.  It relates to Bank of Ireland's approach to insolvency cases under the formal Insolvency Service of Ireland process.  Slide No. 40 that the delegation has provided shows that of the total 296 personal insolvency arrangements, Bank of Ireland is involved in 109, if I am reading it correctly.  The number of arrangements that have lapsed due to "No" creditor votes is nine.  Will Mr. Boucher confirm to the committee how many PIAs the bank signed off on that have involved material changes to the mortgages' balances?  He informed us previously that the bank would not sign off on any PIA that involved a change in the mortgage balance.</p></speech>

Of those, nine lapsed because there was a "No" creditor vote on them.  At the end of September, 41 cases were still works in progress.  Bank of Ireland voted "Yes" in 45 cases and "No" in 14.

I appreciate that the bank&rsquo;s delegation has answered the question on the provision against this debt.  However, what options were given to these 4,000 plus families before they reached the repossession stage, options such as a mortgage-to-rent which comes to a miniscule amount?</p></speech>

That process starts when the customer is contacted about the arrears on his or her house or property.  We have 790 skilled staff who are familiar with the CCMA process involved.  It starts off with a network account manager in a branch meeting the customer and helping him or her to fill in an SFS, standard financial statement, a standard form from the Central Bank.</p></speech>

In nine out of ten cases where customers have contacted us, we have been able to put solutions in place.  The only impediment is where a customer is not co-operative.  In that scenario we take the customer through a CCMA-approved route towards a legal process.  In 20% to 30% of these cases the customer then actually engages with us and works towards a solution.  Some cases go all the way through to repossession where a case is unsustainable or the customer will not engage with us.</p></speech>

One of the obvious necessities is either a local housing authority or a not-for-profit housing authority being willing to take the property.  We have seen growth in that market.  As we are a lender, we lend to not-for-profit housing authorities.  It is a commercial transaction and filling a need and gap in the market.  Ultimately, what it needs is someone on another part of the chain who will take ownership of the property and then lease it back to the tenant.</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher has said the cash injected by the State into Bank of Ireland has been paid back and showed figures in his presentation of &euro;6 billion and so on.  He is actually being mischievous.</p> <p>It is the equivalent of someone with a Bank of Ireland mortgage of &euro;100,000 and a variable interest rate telling the bank when the interest reaches &euro;100,000 that the interest has been paid back and that he or she and the bank are all square.  That is what Mr. Boucher is trying to tell the finance committee.</p></speech>

There is a breakdown of the figures.  Approximately &euro;1.5 billion in guarantee fees was paid up until the end of 2013 that had nothing whatsoever to do with the cash injection; it was because we had to guarantee the bank.  The rest is mostly made up of coupons in terms of securities.  Therefore, it does not have to do with the cash that was injected.  Mr. Boucher should be more up-front about this.</p></speech>

This is interest on products bought from Mr. Boucher's bank.  It is the exact same scenario as the one I have outlined.  It is interest that was applied to coupons.  I refer to the fee applied by giving the guarantee to Bank of Ireland, not to paying all the cash back.  They are two different things.  Bank of Ireland charges fees on transactions all the time, but when it offers a loan, it still wants the capital back; that is the point.  I do not want to take up the committee's time, but the public will decide this.</p></speech>

He is big enough to say what is required.  He should acknowledge that the capital that was injected into the bank has not been paid back and that what have been paid back are the fees that applied to the products bought in terms of shares in the years in question and the fee that applied to the guarantee issued to the bank.  I refer to other services offered to the bank.  It is important to state this because it cost the State money to provide these services.</p><p>  I wish to move on to the issue of arrears which is the primary focus of the committee in terms of mortgages.  With regard to the data the bank has, Mr. Boucher talked about redemption and improvement in large numbers.  I take it that with people getting back to work or other factors, the financial position has improved.  The arrears capitalisation figure for private domestic homes is 1,060.  Reference is made to a total of 2,373.  Is it the case that there was a natural improvement in these cases?</p></speech>

The forbearance we provide and characterise in our accounts is also set out in the accounts, which show exactly the number of customers who have been forborne outside the MART and its specifics, which pertain to Central Bank targets and measures.  The fact of the matter, as our accounts demonstrate, is that the number of customers in arrears has reduced, as has the number defaulting.  The number of forbearances we have in place has increased.  Some of thee are obviously connected to a recovering economy.  Some are obviously connected to people being able to deal with unsecured or other debt, while some have to do with the actions we have taken.  In any situation there is a combination of factors.

When I questioned him, Mr. Boucher said the bank would torpedo any personal insolvency proposal that required a debt write-down on secured debt.  Is that still the practice and policy of the bank?  Alternatively, is somebody going behind Mr. Boucher&rsquo;s back and writing down debt or  agreeing to the personal insolvency proposals?</p></speech>

In Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s case, we took a market leadership position over two years ago to say unsecured debt should be written down first.  That has been a policy of the bank and reflects the process in which we have engaged.  We pioneered a pilot initiative with the other banks to state that if a customer had a personal loan with us and a mortgage with AIB, we would take the write down and <i>vice versa</i>.  That has been the consistent application of our policy.</p></speech>

The market looks at our challenged loans on the basis of whether arrears are going up or down, whether new customers are coming into that category, the provision coverage against those defaulted loans and the percentage of sticking where we restructure.  The 86% is a position about which we stand in the market.  The market makes a judgment as to whether our restructuring is sustainable.  I concur with the Deputy that restructuring for the sake of restructuring does not do anything for us or for the customer.  We seek to restructure and the market will continue to review the adequacy of our provisions when reporting on our defaulted loans because there is no point in reporting defaulted loans coming down if one restructures then.  I agree with the Deputy.</p></speech>

I think where he has gone with this is exactly where we need to go.  We are here on behalf of the State which has a 14% shareholding in the bank at the moment.  I believe Bank of Ireland is taking a different approach to people in arrears from all other institutions.  We had the announcement yesterday from the Irish Mortgage Holders Organisation as to how it is dealing with AIB customers and the capacity to deal with it in a robust manner.  How many people who are in arrears have had to sell their houses?  As Deputy Regina Doherty pointed out earlier, there are 4,000 people against whom Bank of Ireland is considering taking legal proceedings in respect of their PDHs, their private homes, potentially losing their homes.  In the event of them losing their homes, does the bank keep them on the line for the money they were not able to repay?</p></speech>

They are trying to make a start in life again and Bank of Ireland is putting them on the hook until they pay everything.  If I was a banking analyst, I would recommend buying Bank of Ireland shares at one level because I think it is screwing everybody to the point that it is getting every last penny it is owed out of them.  As the State is a shareholder, we have an obligation to see the bank do well, but I think it has gone over the top on it.  I think it is doing damage to the brand of Bank of Ireland.  People in this country talk.  Bank of Ireland is an outlier in the way it is treating people.  My key point is that it is too harsh.</p><p>  Accountants and financial consultants throughout the country will say that Bank of Ireland is the last institution people want to deal with on mortgages and debt.  The witnesses are potentially damaging the brand.  As a shareholder, I say that is not good enough.  AIB stands in much better stead with the public because it is writing down money and restructuring debts.  It is not coming after people to screw every last penny from them or forcing them to give up their personal homes.</p><p>  I have a fundamental problem with much of this.  At one level Bank of Ireland has a licence provided by the Central Bank.  The State bailed it out.  I do not want to get personal and I wish the witnesses all the very best in what they are trying to do.  However, their line of tack is wrong.  Bank of Ireland is given a licence by the institutions of the country to do the best thing by the people.  I believe the witnesses need to re-evaluate.  I will be writing to the Minister for Finance, as the custodian of the 14% stakeholding.  I will be writing to the public interest directors.  I think the brand of Bank of Ireland is potentially damaged at the moment, largely due to the policy it pursuing.  It needs to ease off a little.  It has gone too far with it on many fronts.</p></speech>

Notwithstanding different views about the issue, we have repaid all the State aid, as has been confirmed by the European Commission.  The taxpayers are in profit in respect of their investment.</p><p>  Bank of Ireland has two State owned competitors.  Whatever definition one uses for repayment, these banks still owe taxpayers &euro;24 billion.  Slide 35, which refers specifically to mortgages, shows that AIB's defaulted loans amount to &euro;5.5 billion, while those of Permanent TSB amount to &euro;4.7 billion.  Bank of Ireland's defaulted loans amount to &euro;1.9 billion and our arrears are half of the industry average.  Our restructures stick for longer and we have more resolutions in place on our book, relatively speaking.  That is the context in which one must look at Bank of Ireland. </p></speech>

While members are allowed to speak and ask questions, where is the policy response?  I am not sure there has been any policy response at Government level since our most recent meeting in April.  Whatever we say about mortgages and repossessions, in the summer of 2013 the Government had a law voted in that facilitated the banks.  Many of us bitterly opposed the legislation at the time.  I am not surprised the banks have used the law to their best advantage as they have been allowed to do so by the Government.  We must show some realism on this issue.  My party continues to bitterly oppose the law in question and we stand up for those who have been driven into the courts as a result of the actions of the banks and the change in the law made by the Government in the summer of 2013.  Those are the facts.</p><p>  The Government introduced a number of schemes, including the mortgage-to-rent scheme, to assist people in difficulty.  What are Mr. Boucher's views on the mortgage-to-rent scheme?  Given that a number of stakeholders are involved in the scheme, it is important to hear the views of Bank of Ireland on it. </p></speech>

Bank of Ireland has proposed 226 cases as part of the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  Of these, 90 are proceeding and 136 did not meet the criteria.  We had a very good discussion about some of the issues arising from the scheme at our meeting in April.  Since then, Bank of Ireland has been involved in active discussions with the various parties, including the approved housing boards and the Department.  I believe we are close to producing a very good protocol in this area.  A meeting will take place in the final week of November to bring the matter to a conclusion.

Why is the rate charged in the North less than half the rate charged here?  Is it the result of the lack of competition in the market in the Republic?</p><p>  Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Banks control a large part of the residential mortgage book in Ireland.  The former has been ahead of the curve in that it has returned to profitability ahead of AIB, yet it is the latter bank that has seen fit to reduce its variable rate by 0.25%.  Why has Bank of Ireland not followed suit and reduced its variable rate?  Why is the two year fixed rate for a mortgage with a loan-to-value ratio of greater than 75% charged in the North less than half the rate charged in the South?  </p><p>  I do not wish to go over old ground but I wish to get to the nub of the issue.  Bank of Ireland has increased its margin by 43 basis points or approximately 26%. </p> <p>This more or less corresponds with the reduction in the general cost of funds to the bank itself and Mr. Boucher might elaborate on that.  The question simply is about what the bank is not doing.  It strikes me as being reasonably logical, in that Bank of Ireland states it is a bank that is in pretty good nick and condition, yet its main competitor in the past week has given a reduction of 0.25% to hard-pressed mortgage holders and to first-time buyers.  Moreover, in the North, Bank of Ireland is giving absolutely identical customers a fixed rate for two years that is half the rate it would give to them in Ireland.</p></speech>

I agree completely.  It has come down.  As we have discussed with all our shareholders and stakeholders, the defaulted loans are still too high.  The question of how the defaulted loans come down is a key criterion on which as a company we are judged by everyone.  The first factor that is a contributor to this is to ensure - in so far as we can and the economy is a function of this - that the number of customers defaulting reduces.  In each of our portfolios, the number of customers defaulted has reduced.  Then, there is the absolute quantum of defaulted loans and what is one's provisional coverage.  What is one's best estimate of one's loss against that?  We hold provisional coverage of just under 50% of coverage against our estimate of potential loss, taking account of the collateral and so on that we hold.  Then, we look at the defaulted loans and whether they themselves are reducing.  Are the arrears coming down, are we holding sufficient coverage ratios and are there defaulted loans?  It is still too high.  It peaked in early 2013 and is reducing.  It is a very significant metric and it is much too high.</p></speech>

That is the product we offer.  If, for example, we stated we could no longer offer someone a 90% mortgage, a proportion of our customers would say they were a bit disappointed but will take the 85%.  It is hard to be definitive as to who would not have qualified.  We make an offer to the customers, who state they would like this or that.  When we assess customers, the primary assessment we make is on income capacity.  We see the mortgage as security but as my colleague pointed out in response to an earlier question, we are looking at loans to individuals based on their assessment of their income capacity.  If we look at the multiple in particular, there are two features to that.  We look at the income multiples and the income multiple is the primary criterion under which we assess someone.  If the income multiple does not meet our assessment of a person's ability to repay a mortgage, the loan to value is not a deciding factor.  We start with the income capacity and then consider the potential drags on people's income.  We also then assume that interest rates will not stay the same forever.  We will assume in a sensitivity test that we will add approximately 250 to 300 basis points to make sure that if interest rates rise, a customer's repayment capacity, everything else being equal, still remains sufficient for the customer to service the mortgage.  Thereafter, the loan to value comes into play.  I do not know whether my colleagues wish to add anything to that.</p></speech>

A material proportion of our customers would not qualify because of the loan-to-value cap in particular.  We believe that a lot of our customers would qualify under the income potential but the loan-to-value cap would cap that number.  There is then an obvious concern as to whether customers would take on unsecured or other forms of higher interest-bearing debt to try to deal with that.  This is an obvious issue we would face.  We will be looking at this issue and will decide on whether to make a submission to the Central Bank.  However, in answer to the Deputy's question, the income criteria are more likely not to be the issue for the customer.  It is the loan to value and the ability to get the deposit.</p></speech>

We go right through the CCMA process to the end.  If we consider the way the mortgage book has evolved, there was a spike in the number of defaults and we restructured as many mortgages as possible.  Inevitably, however, in view of what had happened to the economy and a range of other factors, the issue began to manifest between 2009 and 2011.  There is a factor in that regard.</p></speech>

There are two elements to this.  First, there are repossessions of owner-occupied properties and, second, there are repossessions of buy-to-let properties, in respect of which the ratio is significantly higher than the former.  I refer to the example of the Coyne family whose landlord, I accept, was not a Bank of Ireland customer.  However, tenants are being thrown out of their homes because they are being repossessed by the banks.</p></speech>

We are selling a portfolio of approximately 1,000 homes on the market, of which some 800 are received buy-to-let properties.  We specifically say in the documentation that where there are existing tenants, they will be protected.  It is a case of buyer beware.  We are of the view that if a person is a tenant and meeting the terms of the lease, it may be better for him or her to deal with a different landlord who has the financial capability to meet his or her commitments as a landlord.  There is some potential in this regard.   People who have greater expenses in other markets are coming into ours and stating, "We can provide and meet our commitments."  If we appoint a receiver for a buy-to-let property, the tenant's lease will be taken by the receiver.  A number of potential buyers are looking at these properties for income purposes.  They see the income potential, the consistency of the tenants and the opportunity involved.</p></speech>

Has a more aggressive policy been adopted?  I was contacted in the past week by someone in Tallaght who claimed that Bank of Ireland had initiated repossession proceedings against them in court without any real attempt having been made to negotiate an alternative solution.  In other words, the bank has made a quick move to repossess.</p></speech>

If, however, the Deputy sends the details to me or Mr. McLoughlin, we will have the case to which he refers reviewed.  Repossession crystallises losses for us.  The customer's income capacity is the key element to which we give consideration.  Our strategy on restructuring operates in observance of the CCMA, etc., and is defined on the basis of income capacity as opposed to the absolute value of the property.</p></speech>

I wish to pose two questions, the first of which relates to the standard variable rate and the second to the recent announcement made by the Governor of the Central Bank, Professor Honohan, on loan-to-value ratios.  We have been thrashing out these matters all afternoon and, as I understand it, the position is quite simple.  If a customer is paying at a rate of 4.4% and the bank is borrowing money at 1.5%, the margin of profit for the bank is 3.25%.  What is an acceptable margin of profit for Bank of Ireland in this matter?  Where does the bank stand on the net interest margin?  Is there a level of acceptability of profit and are there circumstances where the bank is taking too much profit and pushing customers too far in the context of the margin to which I refer?</p></speech>

It has improved, but if it had remained below 200 basis points, we would not be in profit.  That is an important factor.  We are obliged to consider different products in terms of their maturity profiles.  It is important for us to bear in mind the fact that in the context of a mortgage, we are taking deposits short in the market and making a commitment to the customer that we will lend to him or her.  Therefore, we have a liquidity risk.  In our asset classes, mortgages drive the single biggest liquidity risk.  In the context of the UK market, one of the biggest strategic mistakes the bank made and our largest single issue was related to the liquidity risk it faced with its mortgage book there.  We had grown the book, depended on securitisation markets and taken money on a three to five year basis.  Liquidity risk is a factor.</p></speech>

No one is going to buy a house for &euro;200,000 tomorrow morning.  People buy houses over a 20 or 30 year period, with an APR, a fixed rate or a tracker rate applying.  The net sum of the final payment will be the actual amount a customer pays for his or her house.  A mortgage has a running rate over its lifetime, as does the margin.  At present, the margin is 3.25%.  I understand the bank is obliged to make a profit, but I want to know if a review is required of the current level of profit.  When Mr. Boucher appeared before the committee previously, we dealt with the issue of split mortgages and the manner in which Bank of Ireland was dealing with them.  At the time it was retaining the interest on the warehouse portion of mortgages to the full extent.  Mr. Boucher went away and reviewed the position and the bank then reduced the margin of profit on the split side of mortgages.  In this instance Mr. Boucher needs to take the same approach because the margin of 3.25% is very profitable for the bank.</p></speech>

However, I cannot make an absolute commitment on how we price our products.  I gave a commitment on the previous occasion to consider the position because I figured we could do something.  However, I cannot make a commitment to the committee in respect of how we price products.  It would be disingenuous for me to leave anyone with the impression that I might be in a position to take action in that regard.  We consider our products on an ongoing basis in order to ensure they are competitive and sustainable and that we can obtain good returns on them.  If our products are uncompetitive, the bank, as a business, suffers.</p></speech>

It now seems that if someone wants to purchase a property, he or she must come up with a deposit of 20% of the overall amount involved.

In order to be sustainable, the housing market must be open to first-time buyers.  However, such buyers come with high loan-to-value risks attached.  In that context, the 80:20 ratio announced by the Governor of the Central Bank presents a difficulty.  In the past people ignored the regulator and the Central Bank and we know to where that led.  There is a great deal of merit in what the Governor of the Central Bank is saying.  In that context, is there a need to consider putting in place a different type of mortgage product which would reduce the risk involved and permit financial institutions to lend above the loan-to-value ratio for mortgages?</p> <p>This would permit lenders to loan above the loan-to-value rate of mortgages.  I say this on the basis that some kind of mortgage insurance is in place, as is the position in Canada and the Netherlands.  Canada is significant as it did not experience a housing bubble like Ireland.  Will Bank of Ireland consider a different type of mortgage that will facilitate first-time buyers and meet the Central Bank's criteria?  It would have to contain an insurance caveat.</p></speech>

One must be very careful when it comes to counter parties because one does not expect mortgages to go bad next year.  Effectively, a person is taking a risk that the Central Bank does not want the person to take.  If people are prepared to take the risk what will they be paid and will they answer if they are called?  We have seen such markets operate and are interested in assessing such a proposal.  If it can work we will participate but the counter party risk is an important consideration.</p></speech>

We recognise that this is a difficult area and we are concerned that if people cannot obtain finance from a mortgage they will seek other sources of expensive, short-term finance.

By definition, first-time buyers are starting out in life and have less ability to amass cash.</p></speech>

I am interested in the comments that were made on an insurance product and it has been noted today that such insurance products were quite common in the 1980s and 1990s.  The loan-to-value ratio was lower in those cases.  I am concerned about the ability of people in contract employment to access funding.  Could the witnesses come back to the committee on how such a product could work in the market?  The Minister for Finance has asked the committee to consider the recommendations of the Central Bank and we should broaden our net as far as possible.  The level of home ownership in Ireland is almost at an all-time low - it has dropped by over 10% in the past five to seven years and that is spectacular.</p></speech>

Are the witnesses aware of a report published recently by the Private Residential Tenancies Board, PRTB, in association with DKM Economic Consultants, Red C and the Economic and Social Research Institute, ESRI?  It recommended an amendment be made to the forthcoming Residential Tenancies (Amendment)(No. 2) Bill to clarify legislation on properties in the hands of receivers, be they rent receivers or otherwise.  The amendment would see receivers step into the shoes of landlords and acquire all of his or her obligations for the avoidance of doubt.  Do the witnesses have a view on this PRTB recommendation?

We have a big business in the UK, including a buy-to-let business.  We are aware of the concept of one-year secure tenancies and the attached obligations and arrangements.  A move towards rental properties will become a feature of the market in future no matter what we do as society is moving in that direction.  There will be more professional landlords.  International companies that specialise in this area see opportunities in Ireland and this is not necessarily a bad thing.  Large companies have the capabilities and expertise to meet obligations as landlords because they see the area as a business.  To run a business properly they need tenants to pay rent and they need tenants to be comfortable in making such payments.  For this to happen such large companies must meet their obligations.  I believe the rental system will evolve to include larger entities that want contracts and certainty.</p></speech>

The report by the PRTB also recommended the introduction of a code of conduct on mortgage arrears relating to buy-to-let properties.  We all know there is now a code of conduct on mortgage arrears relating to family homes but not buy-to-let properties.  This is an important issue due to the instability in the market caused by extensive repossessions of buy-to-let properties.</p></speech>

We are now fast forwarding five and a half years because that was the court of directors then, and this is the court of directors now.  This is key for today's setting and conversation because we can all get lost in the micro-management of the balance sheets, funding and arrears and so on.  On page 62 of Mr. Boucher's submission today, look at the court of directors at the top of that pyramid and see what their key responsibilities are.  I am suggesting that Mr. Boucher should have had the governor and a couple of non-executive directors here with him today.  I am going to go through them with him and ask him to see the point that is being made.</p><p>  On top of the risk pyramid of a &euro;125 billion or &euro;130 billion balance sheet, the board has the ultimate oversight and accountability for the risk and related control environment in the group. It is responsible for reviewing and approving risk appetites, risk framework and policies.  All the detail in here this afternoon has been about the execution of those policies.  Mr. Boucher has hesitated and ultimately refused to answer Deputy Doherty's question as to whether there are no write-offs in cases where the loan had originally been secured but the security is insufficient.  The loan has had full examination and stretching in order to be repaid by the customer and there are no write-offs.  That is a credit policy.  </p><p>  We will go through the members of the court of directors. Governor Archie Kane has been a year and a half in the Bank of Ireland and he comes from England,  from Lloyd's Bank.  Kent Atkinson, director number two, comes from England again, and has also been at Lloyd's.  Mr. Boucher himself is the longest-serving member of the court at seven and a half years.  Next is Pat Butler, who has previously worked mainly with McKinsey and abroad, and has been on the court of directors for two years.  There is only one lady and she is English.  I would say that there are very few Irish experienced people on that board in terms of understanding the effects on the people of Ireland of all the bank's algebra and accountancy.  </p><p>  I will go back to that day in March 2009, when Bank of Ireland got &euro;3.5 billion of preference share injections to keep the group alive.  That was the right thing to do.  But it is not acceptable to be insensitive to the customers of the bank.  In Ireland we have &euro;20 billion or so in mortgage loans on residences.  How many thousand loans are in that?  Is it ninety-something thousand?</p></speech>

That is half a million people.  There have been a lot of suicides, deaths and illnesses because of the unreasonable stress.  Income, or the capacity to repay, is the primary thing the bank considers when it considers loans.  If Mr. Boucher lost his job tomorrow he would have no income.  He should think about that and about the people who have no incomes because they had to take reductions, lost their jobs or have had to emigrate.  </p><p>  There has to be far more accountability, as the top of that pyramid in Mr. Boucher's presentation says.  I am a bit passionate about this, but it is very justifiable passion.  In this world, we all have to do what is right with our lives, not just what the algebra says can be done.  Mr. Boucher said at one stage that we have to try harder.  Who is "we"?  Why is there only one lady on the court of directors?  Ladies represent at least half the households of the 150,000 customers.  </p></speech>

It is because if the management of the bank messes around with provisions, increasing or them or writing them back depending on the policy on whether or not to write off, and depending on the value in the loan-to-value algebra---- by the way, what is "value"?  Where do the values for these properties come from?</p></speech>

Picking up where Senator Hayden left off, the Irish mortgage holders association, IMHO, figures released this week are very impressive. The collaboration between the IMHO and AIB is very successful and I would be interested to hear Mr. Boucher's thoughts on that.  Might Bank of Ireland consider a similar arrangement?  I believe 1,330 mortgage issues have found long-term resolutions in less than 12 months and almost 500 of those involve people who were actually faced with losing their homes.  They have managed to resolve their difficulties through mediation between the IMHO and AIB.  I feel strongly that it would be in the interests of Bank of Ireland as well as its customers to consider a similar approach.</p></speech>

It is not for me to talk about AIB's policies, but certainly &euro;5.4 billion in defaulted loans is a big issue and assistance is required.  We use third parties, although we do not often name them, who assist us.  AIB is using one third party, they have a very significant issue and that is their decision.</p></speech>

I presented the bank's pitch book, which was a publicly disclosed document.  We then had roughly 20 investors, and different investors expressed sufficient interest at that time, in our opinion because the Department of Finance was underwriting it and they could depend on the Department of Finance to have the wherewithal to follow through their investment.  Certain criteria were set out for the investors, including that the Government would not backstop any investment.</p></speech>

They signed non-disclosure agreements.  As part of signing such an agreement, if they decided not to proceed with their investment they could not trade in the bank stock or any bonds related to the stock for a period of six months.  Entering into due diligence is a very important consideration for a potential investor because they are potentially locking themselves out of a market.  Those investors then met a number of my colleagues.  I was the chief executive, so I was intensely involved in the meetings with all investors.</p></speech>

The core investors were Capital and Fidelity - each either the second or third biggest fund managers in the world.  They would have made a separate investment.  Because of the nature of the investment at the time, which was in the middle of a rights issue, the investors had to come together for the specific purpose of taking up the stock.

Just a few additional questions, if I may.  Under the troika programme, which is now concluded, there was provision for a central credit register, to be established as one of the key reforms in the financial sector.  The legislation was passed in 2013 but the roll-out of the central credit register has been delayed.  Can Mr. Boucher advise what impact, if any, that has on the bank's operations, its capacity to make lending decisions and its assessment of customers' creditworthiness?  Does he have a view on whether it would be helpful if that were introduced?</p></speech>

It is a hindrance at the moment because unsecured credit is not verified.  In the other countries we operate in, and in most countries in the world, there is a credit register, where the providers of credit are registered so that people know.  It would certainly assist our underwriting process.  In particular, it might assist with challenge credit management.</p></speech>

They might have a tracker mortgage rate.  Bank of Ireland introduced a product in April 2013 for people on tracker mortgages who wish to move so that if they qualify for a mortgage they can keep the tracker rate plus 1% for five years on that original portion of the mortgage and any additional mortgage is at the variable rate.  The uptake seems to be quite poor.  Bank of Ireland has approved about 400 cases and about one third have been drawn down.  Would Bank of Ireland be willing to review that product to see if it could be made more attractive?  Surely from the bank's point of view, if it is lending additional money to creditworthy customers that money will be at a variable rate, so it will be making a profit on that and clearly it would be transformative for many people in that situation.  Could he comment on that and a related issue of people in negative equity who may be trapped in apartments with two or three children, a completely unsuitable environment for such families?  What help is the bank giving to people in that situation to move if they can qualify for a mortgage?</p></speech>

There have been over 400 applications under the standard terms, which are a five-year product with a 1% uplift in rate.  The reason, we feel from customer feedback, that only one third have drawn down is that they are struggling to find the right house for themselves.  They have approval and that approval stands, but they cannot find the appropriate property to move into, so it is a supply challenge in the first instance.  We are not getting feedback on the product itself.  There are different products in the marketplace from other suppliers that have been launched in the second half of 2014 but they are all about the same.  It is predominantly a supply issue, particularly in the Dublin area.</p><p>  On negative equity, we also introduced last year negative equity trade up-trade down for customers and those products are of a similar nature and have proved to be quite popular for customers who are in that situation but we will give negative equity loans in those situations where customers are in difficulty up to 175% loan-to-value, LTV.</p></speech>

If someone is on a variable mortgage and when they got the mortgage they were in a certain LTV bracket of maybe over 80% but some years later the property value has increased, they have more equity in the property and they fall into a lower LTV band, which would attract a lower interest rate, can they revise what band they are in or are they fixed in the band at which they entered when the mortgage was drawn down?</p></speech>

My final question is in the context of the Central Bank's proposed minimum mortgage deposit, which may or may not happen.</p> <p>Could I ask the bank what impact the introduction of non-recourse lending would have in Ireland?  Would it have an impact on interest rates and the bank's disposition towards risk?  It strikes me that if people are being required to stump up a deposit of 20%, there should also be a commitment on the part of the bank that the borrower's liability would end with the property.</p></speech>

However, I have a few questions for Mr. Boucher.  Does he accept the proposition that his bank, along with others but his would be at the top of the league table, is profiteering in terms of the interest rates it is charging on loans compared to its European counterparts?  This was raised earlier but I was not present, and I apologise for that.  The evidence from the briefing we were given is that the bank is engaged in serious profiteering in respect of the interest rates being charged, compared to what banks in the rest of Europe are doing.  How would Mr. Boucher respond to that?  How does he consider it morally justifiable, given that the bank would not exist today without the bailout it was given by ordinary citizens of this country?</p></speech>

Our net interest margin is 2.08% across the group.  If one compares that with banks in Britain, the US and many European banks, it is a low net interest margin.  Relative to that, it is a recovering net interest margin, but it would not be construed as an exceptional net interest margin.  That is a fact.  There are different funding structures, different loss experiences and a range of things that impact on banks' pricing models.  We compete for our business in Ireland and for our business in the UK, continental Europe and in the US in different parts of our businesses.  We compete on the basis that we want our customers for the long term.</p><p>  We must have products that are sustainable.  We have seen entrants into markets, including this market, who have had unsustainable business models.  They come in with pricing structures or business models that just do not work and they leave or collapse.  Some of our competitors have collapsed.</p><p>  As to the Irish taxpayer, one of the key focuses of this bank, perhaps distinguishing it from other banks, is the absolute focus we had on repaying the State aid and to bring the taxpayers a profit.  The taxpayers have it.</p> <p>What we have returned to taxpayers is cash that can be used for other purposes.  Banks should never have been supported by or needed support from taxpayers.  We must ensure we put structures in place to make sure that will never happen again.  Part of the way we have to think about running our business involves the return of taxpayers' cash for them to do what they like with it, which is very important.  This has been at the heart and a key component of our strategy in the past six years.  To be quite frank, I do not see the same attention in other banks.</p></speech>

In particular, in a lot of European markets there are state-sponsored and taxpayer subsidised bond schemes such as in the internal Pfandbriefe bond market in Germany.  Similar schemes are operated in the United States - the Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac schemes.  Our contiguous market with the same structures, in particular in terms of access to bond markets, loss experiences, etc., is the United Kingdom where there are equivalent broad spreads.  It has a different currency, but the base rates are not and do not look a lot different.  Let us look at the pricing of all of our products.  Our net interest margin is 2.08%.</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher made an interesting comparison between the Europe-Irish and Europe models.  It bears more discussion, but, unfortunately, we do not have the time to do so.</p><p>  I wish to ask about two related matters.  First, there is the matter of repossessions, voluntary surrenders, not just of principal private dwellings but also of buy-to-lets and so on, and the fact that a lot of people have been forced to give up their homes or are being put out of them by receivers.  Why do banks require tenants who are paying rent to be put out?</p><p>  I have not read all of Mr. Boucher's document, but he has said Bank of Ireland is now one of the biggest or possibly the biggest lender into the construction and property and corporate sectors.  He has trumpeted the fact that it is engaged in a lot of lending in these areas.  I put two and two together and it seems all of this property has been made vacant as receivers move in and that commercial property is being bought up by others who are presumably financed by banks like Mr. Boucher's.  Banks get control of this property and in the meantime tenants are put out.  Rents are then jacked up, which is great for the people to whom he lends and the bank, but the consequence is a housing crisis and another property bubble.</p></speech>

Let me give a specific example.  If we appoint a rent receiver to a property to get the rent which is being diverted to the landlord, to whom we have lent the money, we have a vested interest in keeping the income flowing.  I mentioned the thought process in response to an earlier question.  We are  selling a portfolio of approximately 1,000 properties, of which about 800 are buy-to-lets.  We specifically say in the document that we have said to potential acquirers that it is tenancy protected where there are tenants.  For the buyer, it is <i>caveat emptor</i>, as he or she knows the tenants are protected.</p></speech>

However, there has been a significant tightening of corporate governance procedures by quoted companies.  We are quoted on the Stock Exchange.  Bank directors must now be approved by the board of the Central Bank.  They go through a comprehensive and extensive process.  It was public knowledge that my position as chief executive of the bank had been reviewed by a third party on behalf of the Central Bank.  It had analysed my role before the crisis and whether I was a fit and proper person to be chief executive.  There was an independent third party report compiled for the Central Bank.  It is called the fit and proper regime, a regime which applies in the United Kingdom and Ireland.</p> <p>In this respect, the Central Bank has a very important role to play in deciding whether someone is an appropriate person to be a director of a bank.</p></speech>

It is now retail-funded, in particular, by deposits collected.  How do we think about our deposit base in general terms?  Its capital and customer deposits fund the loan book and the liquid assets we are required to hold are funded in the wholesale markets.  Its a model where the bank must be self-funded and each of our businesses, including Mr. McLoughlin's, Retail Ireland, our UK business and corporate business, is self-funded.

We ensure we have enough capital to protect ourselves and our depositors and to meet our strategic ambitions.  The outcome of the stress tests did not come as a big surprise to Bank of Ireland because it had its own internal capital models; therefore, the availability of capital and funding for at least the past two years had not been an impediment to our lending desires.  We had put out to the market that our strategic plan, our own internal stress testing, would have us lending approximately &euro;33 billion in new money into the economy in the period from 2013 to 2017.  Passing the stress tests was nice and it was an important part of the regulatory process, but it would not have had a material impact.  Obviously, if we had failed, it would have had us in a very different context but passing did not mean that the desire or credit appetite changed.</p><p>  One of the most important responsibilities I have relates to the fact that we have private sector capital, which was injected into Bank of Ireland.  They were not people who felt sorry for the bank but people who believed in the Irish recovery and that the bank could participate in that recovery.  They expect us to deploy that capital; that capital can only be constructively deployed by us in lending new money safely.  A significant pressure on us as a management team is to safely deploy our shareholders' capital because if we do not deploy it appropriately, they will sell their shares and put the money where better opportunities can be found.  That is how the private sector works.  There is a significant strategic requirement on us to lend into the economy.  What we must do is make sure it is safe and sustainable.</p></speech>

The view has been that in Bank of Ireland managing its internal ratios in preparation for the stress tests, it was more niggardly in terms of the extension of credit than it might otherwise have been.</p></speech>

I probably feel that in the Irish context, we had been through a lot of stress tests on the AQR processes, etc.  The situation involving us and AIB did not come as a surprise to the market or anyone else.  We account for over 50% of new lending into the economy.  A feature has been the fact that a lot of our new to bank lending would have involved a refinancing of people from other banks.  A particular feature we have noticed since March 2014, particularly in the SME business that comes within Mr. McLoughlin's remit, is that over 50% of our new lending involves customers who are doing new things rather than refinancing or rearranging their finances with banks exiting or where they are uncomfortable, etc.  That is an important component of the recovery.  Bank lending tends to track behind economic recovery and then to go a little beyond GDP.  Our ambition is to beat GDP.  We hope we have competitive propositions and that we are extremely focused on the market.  We lend to all sectors and have particular features.  We are lending over 50% of new money to the economy.  We reported in our pre-close statement on Friday that the pace of new lending was picking up also.</p></speech>

We think lending to that sector must be balanced and kept as a proportion of our balance sheet and that we must manage the risk.  Nevertheless, it is a sector in which we want to participate.  One of the key ingredients that may be missing in some instances is equity.  We will provide 65% or 70% of the finance, but if we end up with equity in a business, things have gone badly wrong for us and the customer.  We are not equity providers.  I will set out a simple sum.  If we provide &euro;1 in equity capital, that deprives us of &euro;10 worth of lending capacity because it is like for like on capital; there is that multiplier impact.  In addition and to be quite frank, we do not have the skills set.  We hope we have a better skills set in lending, but it is quite a different skills set in the case of equity.  We are seeing funds coming in with mezzanine debt, which is higher coupon and a more risky form of debt; therefore, if we provide a figure of 70%, one will have a mezzanine provider who will have a much higher debt and provide 15% but one still needs equity of 15%.  However, I do see funds coming in.</p></speech>

I appreciate that it is almost 6 p.m.  The first time Mr. Boucher came before a committee was in July 2008 when the banks were going through a very difficult time.  How have practices changed in Bank of Ireland?  What has it learned from the experience?  What is now being done differently?  What is happening that was not happening then?</p></speech>

The banks should really fund their loan books from customer deposits.  The capital structures are very different.  At the time, banks throughout the world had capital ratios of approximately 5% or 6%.  We are running at approximately 14%.  That is the level of capital we have available.  We have restructured the way in which our boards function.  We have a very specific risk committee.  We looked at one of our problems or issues - the structure of our balance sheet in percentage terms.  When one's balance sheet is very big, it has the potential to fall and we have shrunk the business.  We have had to get out of businesses in which the asset selection was good but we could not support capital liquidity.</p></speech>

The officials are here to give overview of the banking sector in Ireland.  That is their calling card and they have kindly given us a great deal of material - financial details and percentages, etc. - running to over 80 pages.  I have tried to bring everyone back to our core responsibility of who devises the policies and strategies of the Bank of Ireland group.  I have made the point that most of the court of directors are unrepresentative of Irish households and short on experience of Ireland, in terms of its finance, economy and demographics and everything that accompanied the collapse of the economy.  It is easy to be remote and distant and not to see the impact of what happens when one is in a boardroom and how it translates in people's homes.  The figures show that for every household or customer mortgage in distress, the lives of at least three people are being ripped apart.  That is the average, but sometimes four or more are affected.  It is a serious matter and up to those who understand the machinery of balance sheets, portfolios and ledgers and how it happened to deal with it.  I applaud them for getting the group's loan-to-deposit ratio down to 111%, which is the right figure for the group.</p></speech>

If we take a 160% figure and measure it against the surplus using the 90% figure, the prudential, steady-Eddie bank balance sheet management amount, we will see that the average is 70%.  That figure - 70% - is the keel that should have been obtained if things had not gone out of control over seven years up to 2008 and represents measurable culpability of 75% on the part of the partial creators of the asset price bubble which had developed on the back of the credit pyramid bubble.  That is simple.  Ann and Barry readers could explain it and we do not need a banking inquiry to tell us that.  The banks, particularly the court of directors at the top of the pyramid, were culpable in those seven years.  The auditors were also culpable.  They should have been saying, &quot;Guys, stop expanding your balance sheet at this unsustainable rate.&quot;  I will explain why.  <br/>I am sure the delegates have read Tim Geithner's book <i>Stress Test</i>, which is a good name and has been out for a couple of months.  In it Mr. Geithner writes about the size of the domestic banking sector in the United States, which is just over 100% of GDP, or $12 trillion.  In Ireland the culpability of the boards of banks collectively and AIB specifically is measurable because the weighted average loan to deposit figure was 173% across the Irish-owned banks.  The banking system went from three times to over five times the size of national income.  That is the credit pyramid and that is what the banks did.  We know what they are now saying to the people whose asset prices collapsed.  By the way, the 23% figure is illusory, as I said.  It is not true because the prices of these transactions do not represent the volume of transactions.  In the same way, Bank of Ireland share price today - 30 cent - when multiplied by the shares outstanding does not equal the market value of Bank of Ireland.  Similarly, the 23% figure that is based on a few transactions in Dublin does not apply to the whole property market and the banks have a responsibility to tell the Government that, as they are at the coal face of the experience, as Mr. Boucher knows.</p></speech>

I want to get my head around what is happening in that sector at the moment.  Will Mr. Boucher explain how he is making decisions about lending to property developers at the moment, what proportion is given to them of the finance they need to carry out a construction development and what criteria are being used?  My concern is that we would repeat all the mistakes of the past.  How is that working?  Is the bank lending to people to buy up property that was left over from the collapse?  How is that working?   In the document, there is reference to working in terms of public private partnerships.  Will Mr. Boucher say something about the types of public private partnerships in which the bank is collaborating and how that works?  What is the balance between its involvement and that of the State sector?  Could he give some examples?</p></speech>

We do not finance landbank acquisitions in the construction sector.  They should be financed by equity.   The maximum loan-to-value rate would be somewhere between 65% and 70%.  We need to see pre-sales for the commercial market, but we recognise it is not possible to get pre-sales in the residential market.  Those are key criteria.  We also do not do an equity release from the single property nor do we lend against an uplift in value.  Those are some of the lessons we learned.  One of the other big lessons from the past is the need to keep an eye on the peripheral vision of the market.  We thought we could work our way out of certain situations.  We were not as conscious of to what was going on in other banks.  That was a mistake we made.</p></speech>

We have deliberated on a number of petitions before us today.  We will take the first two petitions together - petition No. P00014/13 from Ursula Witmer on the medical criteria for the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994, SI No. 353/1994; and petition No. P00020/14 from Mr. Thomas Mackey questioning the harshness of the eligibility applied to applicants as a result of the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations 1994.</p></speech>

These petitions were brought to us by people with disabilities who have difficulty getting grants under the Disabled Drivers and Disabled Passengers (Tax Concessions) Regulations.  Given the difficulty that arises here and given that the original legislation and any subsequent amendments date from a long time ago - 20 or 25 years - we would like to see the legislation being reviewed.  On that basis it might be wise for us to ask the Minister to appear before the committee to discuss how that might happen and in the interim for us to gather some more information on the sorts of difficulties facing drivers regarding whether they might be missing an upper limb or a lower limb, or have a problem with a foot or whatever.</p><p>  If they are looking for modifications for their vehicles, we feel the current system is inequitable.  I propose that we invite the Minister to come before the committee to discuss the matter.  In the interim we might invite written submissions from the relevant organisations that deal with disability and driving to see what recommendations and information they might supply in order to have an informed conversation with the Minister and see if we can reach some conclusion.  As it stands, these petitions are very strong.</p></speech>

One clear example is that a person who is registered as blind cannot qualify as a disabled passenger.  That shows the total nonsense of the medical criteria at present.  I reiterate the example of a person without an upper limb being told they did not fulfil the necessary criterion.  Why should a person without an upper limb not qualify as a disabled person to be, perhaps, a disabled driver?  They should be perfectly entitled to it.  It is crazy for a blind person to be told that he or she does not qualify as a disabled passenger.  Of course the entire scheme should be reviewed.</p><p>  I welcome the Senator's proposal that the scheme should be overhauled.  It is outdated and has not been looked at for a long time.  One very important purpose for this committee to fulfil is creating circumstances whereby it would be looked at again.  It is not opening the floodgates, the scheme is either fit for purpose or it is not.</p></speech>

The committee has deliberated on the petition and agreed the following two options.  First, we will refer the petition to the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Social Protection with a number of recommendations.  Second, we will write to the Minister for Finance requesting that where revenue generation proposals are made by the public, they should be fully evaluated and he should report to the D&aacute;il annually on such proposals and evaluations.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  The final petition is No. P00004/14 from Ms Miriam Owens entitled voiceless survivors.  The petitioner has attempted to raise an issue with Caranua, an independent Irish State body for survivors of industrial abuse.  She has withdrawn her petition and the committee has agreed to accept her decision.  Two other petitions were listed to be debated today and we will deliberate on them when we return.</p></speech>

I understand the committee wishes me to address it on three matters today: extending the remit of the Ombudsman Act and recommendations on the extension of powers of all ombudsmen; two particular issues which have been the subject of petitions that have already been dealt with in closed session; and the number and nature of reports being produced by my office in the context of annual and special reports issued.<br/>I will commence by saying that the legislation underpinning the Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces is the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 as well as section 114 of the Defence Act 1954.  In my address today I will refer to the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004 as the 2004 Act and I will refer to the Defence Act 1954 as the Defence Act. <br/>My office was established by order of the Minister for Defence on 1 December 2005.  My office provides military personnel with an independent and impartial external statutory complaint investigation authority.  It is entirely separate and distinct from both the military chain of command and the Department of Defence.  I believe we are fully compliant with the generally recognised principles of ombudsmanship.<br/>The ombudsman provides an appeal from the formal internal military redress of wrongs procedure, a new direct referral complaints system for former service personnel, and a new system for complaints by serving or former service personnel against the actions of a civil servant of the Department of Defence.  The outcome of investigations generally are that the ombudsman makes non-binding recommendations to the Minister.<br/>My office produces an annual report on its activities.  The most recent such report is 2012 which was published last June.  The delay in the publication of that report was due to ongoing High Court proceedings which were entirely outside the control of my office.  The annual report for 2013 is at an advanced stage of preparation.  I intend to publish it before the end of this year.  My office has not published any special reports pursuant to section 7 of the 2004 Act.  I will inform the committee later on the activities during 2013 and 2014.<br/>The ombudsman is appointed by the President on the recommendations of the Government.  Open competitions were held by the Public Appointments Service in 2005 and 2012.  I was appointed to the office in November 2012 for a term of three years.  The Ombudsman Association, which is an international umbrella organisation for ombudsmen, has recommended consideration of a minimum term of five years for all ombudsmen.  I would commend that recommendation to the committee for its consideration.<br/>I wish to say a brief word about the internal military complaints system.  A formal redress of wrongs-complaints system is provided for in the Defence Act for serving members of the Defence Forces.  This has been in existence since the foundation of the State under earlier legislation.  It reflects the unique circumstances of members of the Defence Forces in society.  Soldiers are citizens who have volunteered to serve.  They retain all their constitutional rights.  By joining the Defence Forces, however, they voluntarily submit themselves to a uniquely strict code of military law and discipline.  The formal complaints system provides a key component of personal rights protection for soldiers.<br/>Complaints should be resolved at the earliest possible opportunity.  Every complaint under the redress of wrongs system is notified to my office as an oversight body and recorded on our case management system.  The Minister agreed earlier this year to provide me with additional information regarding the nature of each such complaint, and this will improve my oversight of the internal military system.  I have also proposed a strengthening of the independence of military investigation officers appointed to investigate and report on complaints under the redress of wrongs system.  I received a copy last week of draft proposals for the revision and amendment of the redress of wrongs system on which I will respond to the Department of Defence shortly.  The Office of the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces was created as a result of protracted lobbying by PDFORRA and as an acknowledgment of the need for a transparent, external, independent and rigorous procedure to deal with complaints across the Defence Forces.  In the case of complaints against a civil servant, I believe that there ought to be established an internal, time-limited departmental complaints resolution procedure or process with an appeal for unresolved complaints to be sent to my office.<br/>I will say a few words about my jurisdiction.  I have jurisdiction under section 6 of the 2004 Act to hear complaints from serving and former members of the Defence Forces.  The complaints must concern actions taken by either a serving or former member of the Defence Forces while serving in the Defence Forces, or by a civil servant in the Department of Defence.  Interestingly, the word &quot;action&quot; is defined in the Act as including &quot;a failure to carry out an act or make a decision&quot;.  Complaints must be made not later than 12 months from the date of the action concerned or the date on which the complainant became aware of the action, whichever is the later.  There are no exclusions to complaints under the internal redress of wrongs system except a small provision with regard to military justice decisions.<br/>I am inclined to suggest to the committee that consideration should be given to adding some such restrictions to the redress of wrongs system to limit multiple jurisdictions dealing with the same matters.  As ombudsman, for example, I am precluded from considering complaints on a list of matters included in section 5 of the 2004 Act.  There is also provision in legislation to ensure complaints referred to me are not also referred to the national ombudsman and <i>vice versa</i>.  I recommend to the committee that section 5 exclusions should be reviewed.  A simpler unified system could be provided with a greater degree of consistency between the provisions of the Defence Act and the 2004 Act.  Complaints regarding matters which are clearly administrative actions in some of the excluded areas could and should be included within my jurisdiction.</p> <p>On a comparative basis, I should tell the joint committee there are three models for military ombudsmen throughout the world.  The first one is where the ombudsman is integrated within the armed forces, which sometimes is referred to as an inspector general.  This probably is the oldest form of military ombudsman extant and it still is operational in some countries.  Indeed, the Defence Act in Ireland contains a provision for the appointment of an inspector general.  The second such model is one in which the ombudsman has exclusive jurisdiction over the armed forces and the third is where oversight of the armed forces is subsumed into the functions of a general ombudsman.  In 2004, Ireland opted for the appointment of a civilian ombudsman, entirely independent of the Defence Forces and the Department of Defence, with exclusive jurisdiction over the Defence Forces, that is, the second of the three models I mentioned.  We share this arrangement with Austria, Canada, Germany, Norway, South Africa, the United Kingdom and, more recently, Bosnia-Herzegovina, all of which have similar-type military ombudsmen.  Independence is of critical importance for an ombudsman.  International standards show that the primary indicators of independence for ombudsmen are being independent of government and of those they are appointed to oversee.  I am satisfied the 2004 Act contains appropriate statutory provisions providing for the independence of my office along those lines.<br/>I now wish to turn to some statistical data.  Since 2010, a total of 372 complaints have been notified to my office and since my appointment as ombudsman, more than 200 complaints have been notified to me and more than 70 cases have been appealed to me for detailed review and investigation by my office.  I should state that the ongoing High Court proceedings throughout 2013 had an impact on the number of cases that could be dealt with by my office during that time.  In November 2012, the aforementioned High Court proceedings were initiated, challenging my appointment as ombudsman and on 21 November 2013, Mr. Justice Hedigan delivered his judgment in the High Court.  His judgment ran to quite a long number of pages but I will summarise it under three aspects.  First, he stated that nothing precludes a former member of the Defence Forces from holding the post of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces.  Second, he stated the appointment of a former member of the Defence Forces does not give rise to a reasonable apprehension of bias.  Third, he held the Minister for Defence did not act <i>ultra vires</i>in deciding that the office of Ombudsman for the Defence Forces should be part-time.  I should advise the joint committee that this decision is under appeal to the Supreme Court.<br/>I already have made some recommendations to the joint committee with regard to the powers of ombudsmen in general.  I have noted the proposal of the national Ombudsman to the joint committee that his appointment be made a constitutional one and I would support such a development in his case.  As for the extension of the powers of ombudsmen generally, I have three further recommendations I could make to members if they so wish.  This concludes my presentation to the joint committee.</p></speech>

My predecessor was appointed for three terms, namely, two terms of three years and one term of one year, making a total of seven.  However, the legislation as it stands also provides that if a person had been appointed as ombudsman for the maximum term of seven years, he or she may be eligible to be reappointed.  I do not have a personal view but the International Ombudsman Association sometimes is exercised by the fact that an ombudsman who is doing a good job and is not causing too much difficulty to the powers that be may be reappointed.  The connection of a reappointment to the manner in which the ombudsman had performed his or her duties as the case may be always is a delicate balance.  Consequently, as I stated, the appointing authorities may or may not wish to extend the term of somebody on conclusion.  I do not have a personal view on the matter.</p></speech>

Have such exclusions caused problems for the ombudsman's office or is it that they have caused problems for complainants in trying to get access?  As a consequence, if the exclusions are causing difficulties, are those the cases that end up bypassing the ombudsman in some ways - because they cannot get there - and which end up with this committee or in the legal route of going directly to court, if those concerned believe they cannot get recourse through the ombudsman?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-05a.676" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony McCourt" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014110500005#J01000"><p>The position with regard to the exclusions is there are matters about which a member of the forces is entitled to submit an application or complaint under the redress of wrong system.  It can be processed all the way up to the Chief of Staff and if the complainant does not get satisfaction there, he or she is perfectly entitled to ask to have it referred to the ombudsman.  The first thing the ombudsman must do is to consider whether it is within his or her jurisdiction and sometimes it arises that it actually is outside my jurisdiction because it is excluded by the provisions of section 5 of the Act.  I believe that if we have a complaint system that has been in place since 1922 and that if a provision for an ombudsman to be inserted between the Chief of Staff's decision and the Minister's final decision was introduced almost nine years ago, there should be the minimum of restrictions on the powers and jurisdictions of the ombudsman to deal with such complaints.  Moreover, I believe that complainants may be dissatisfied, having processed a complaint all the way up to the ombudsman's office, to find that the ombudsman is not empowered to deal with it.  There may be reasons he or she is not allowed to so do that are valid under the provisions of section 5 of the Act but sometimes - I refer to matters that can be perceived clearly to be administrative in nature - there should be scope for those to be dealt with, even in the areas that are excluded from the jurisdiction of the ombudsman.</p></speech>

I note that in the ombudsman's report for 2012, he included a breakdown of the cases.  For the record, can he highlight, for example, cases taken against a serving member, as opposed to cases taken against civil servants in the Department of Defence?</p></speech>

It may well be that members of the Defence Forces primarily interact with each other rather than with decisions by civil servants.  Therefore I would not expect there to be as many complaints against the action of a civil servant.  It is not entirely unknown that there would be such a complaint, however.</p></speech>

In these cases, the various formations of the Defence Forces that are listed and the number of complaints recorded in each of them does not take account of the numerical strength of the formation.  Therefore it may not entirely reflect the issues that the Deputy is raising.  There was nothing particularly striking that came to mind in reviewing those statistics and nothing that would cause me any great alarm or concern.</p></speech>

Is there a reason the Ombudsman for Defence cannot investigate this area?  Would he have a concern about that?</p></speech>

The Ombudsman for Defence made the point that there is an appeal mechanism in terms of the overall Ombudsman, Peter Tyndall, but within Mr. McCourt's own office there is no appeal mechanism.  Is that something he feels should be remedied, or does he feel it is acceptable in its current format?</p></speech>

As I perhaps inadequately explained in my presentation to the committee, in any such case where the complainant was dissatisfied with my final decision and wished me to review it, provided there were just reasons for so doing and I considered that such a review was merited, I would feel that I have the discretionary power to do so.  In exceptional circumstances, such as where new information became available which had not been available at the original time - as opposed to information that was available but had not been presented to me - equity would dictate that I should be prepared to review my original decision.</p></speech>

In general, are his recommendations implemented?</p></speech>

It would be in a very small minority of cases that the Minister for Defence would not accept my recommendations, and invariably he expresses his reasons for not doing so.  Clearly, as an ombudsman I would welcome any additional measures that might be taken to increase the percentage of cases in which the Minister would accept my recommendation.  That would be a matter for changes in legislation.</p></speech>

If they are not implemented, we would see it as our role to challenge the Minister or Department as to why not.  If Mr. McCourt comes across instances in which he feels that his recommendation should have been implemented, as is the case with the other Ombudsmen, he should feel free to raise that with our committee.  He can bring it to the Oireachtas and look for us to deal with the issue.  We see that as a key responsibility of our work.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, I do have the power to make special report to the Oireachtas under section 7 of the Ombudsman (Defence Forces) Act 2004.  That is a power that has not been exercised and I expect it would be reserved for special cases such as those to which the chairman is referring.</p></speech>

Our committee in particular takes its responsibilities very seriously and we do not second guess any decision of any ombudsman's office.  They are independent and it is not our role to do that.  We want to strengthen the independence and impact of the ombudsmen by following up on any recommendations that have not been implemented with Government.  We have done and will continue to do that across the board.</p><p>  Mr. McCourt talked about the international examples of defence forces ombudsmen and the different types that are there.  It appears that, in Ireland, the ombudsman's role is essentially to be another appeal mechanism.</p> <p>Therefore, where the relevant member of the Defence Forces has gone through all the various complaint handling processes and has appealed them up through the various stages, the Defence Ombudsman is then the ultimate office of appeal.  Would the ombudsman like to see his office broadened to fit what would internationally be regarded as the role of an ombudsman, to look at, for example, inspection, efficiency, oversight, and more of those types of roles?</p></speech>

In my own career, I do recall one officer being appointed as Inspector General.  I am not sure he was assigned by the Government.  He was a very senior officer, who had recently returned from a very senior UN command role.  I think shortly before he was due to retire he was appointed as Inspector General.  However, I do not think he was given that sort of inspection role one would expect an Inspector General to have.  With regard to extending my role, as ombudsman, in that area, I am not sure about general inspections but I do have power in my investigative role to go to barracks, seek documents, examine records and so on.  Perhaps one of the powers that needs to be strengthened concerns access to documentation.  That might be an area that needs to be further strengthened.</p><p>  We have an excellent system in the redress of wrongs system within the Defence Forces.  It has been there since 1922.  However, we should explore the possibility of the ombudsman having some involvement in that at an earlier stage rather than the final appeal stage.  I would be glad to see the good offices of my office being made available to assist at a much earlier stage so that complaints could be resolved more swiftly than they are at the moment.  That would be possible, in a review of the two systems; the redress of wrongs system under the Defence Act and the ombudsman regime under the 2004 Act.  There are possibilities there to bring a more unified system of complaint investigation.  There would be a lot interest groups who would need to have an input and agree on that before it could be implemented.</p></speech>

That goes for all the ombusdmen.  The Garda Ombudsman will have strengthened powers.  Legislation is currently being moved through the Houses.  That legislation, in draft format, may be strengthened by the time it goes through all the various stages.  There is a desire to strengthen and enhance the offices of the ombudsmen across the different sectors.  They have captured the imagination of the public; an independent adjudicator, a final arbiter on behalf of the citizen and the relevant public servant or, as in this case, member of the Defence Forces.  That is the intention of this series of engagements with the current ombudsmen.  At the end of that series, we will publish a report with our recommendations to strengthen powers and ensuring that the Offices are fit for purpose and can fulfil the roles that the citizens or the servants of the people desire.</p></speech>

First, I am mindful of representations which have been made to my Office by families of members or former members of the Defence Forces which I was satisfied were related to genuine concerns but which were clearly outside my jurisdiction under the statute as currently drafted.  I would suggest my Office should have a discretionary authority to undertake in exceptional circumstances own-initiative investigations.  This, of course, could be subject to prior agreement with the Minister, on a case-by-case basis.  Such investigations should also be allowed to include historic matters and not be subject to the 12 months rule applicable in the Act at the moment.</p><p>  Second, I would suggest that section 8 of the 2004 Act should be amended in line with the provisions of section 10 of the Ombudsman (Amendment) Act 2012 together with any future amendment to the Ombudsman Act to provide my office with improved procedures for compelling the production of documents and information.  That would be a very important provision.</p><p>  The third additional recommendation I would make is that there is a need for the establishment of a mechanism for the provision of independent legal advice and services to my office from time to time.  Clearly, that is based on my experience since I came into office.  I do not think I need to elaborate further on that. </p></speech>

The purpose of this meeting is to engage with Freight Transport Association, FTA, Ireland with regard to the new national postcode system, Eircode, which was developed and will be operated by Capita Business Support Services Limited.  On behalf of the committee, I welcome Mr. Neil McDonnell and his colleagues, Mr. Tom Carr of Palletxpress, Mr. Andy Smith of UPS and Mr. Niall Cotton of BOC Ireland.  I draw their attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also wish to advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statement they have submitted to the committee will be published on its website after the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/>I invite Mr. McDonnell to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

Postcodes are a difficult technical issue, which we will try to keep as simple as possible.  Ireland needs a postcode but not any code.  A postcode is a key part of a country's soft infrastructure and is an indicator of a nation's social imagination and ingenuity.  A national postcode lasts for a long time and the postcode that Ireland introduces next year will outlive everyone in this room.  Eircode is an excellent address database for direct mail, for utilities, for the Revenue and for local property tax but it is a bad postcode.  Eircode will assign a unique identifier to every address in the country but two adjacent properties will have different randomly-assigned Eircodes.  The joint committee's briefing notes provided by FTA Ireland give some of the places that will not have a postcode and I will read into the report some of the types of places that will not have an allocated Eircode.  These include workshops, farm buildings, windmills, piers, jetties, fields, large fixed assets, lay-bys, points of interest, lanes, archaeological sites, roads, natural features, intersections, accident black spots, pylons, parks, motorways, antennae, wells, graveyards, pumping stations, viewing points, manholes or utility access points, car parks, beaches, level crossings, transformers, bridges, forests, bogs, lakes, playing pitches, cycle tracks, picnic areas, public toilets or places along walkways such as the Wild Atlantic Way.  None of these can have an Eircode unless they also have an allocated postal address.</p><p>  In our opinion, Eircode departs substantially from the requirements for a postcode set out by members' predecessors in the last D&aacute;il, which we have set out in annexe 2 of our submission, as well as in the postcode tender, the requirements of which are set out in annexe 3.  In annexes 4 and 5, we compare Eircode with modern Irish and international alternatives, as well as with the United Kingdom postcode, which is almost 60 years old this year.  We give a simple example of the address of our sister trade association in Belfast in annexe 5.  Unlike any of these codes, an Eircode does not recognise when two addresses are adjacent to each other.  We have picked three local addresses in Kildare Street to show this issue to members in annexe 4.</p><p>  Eircode will impose a significant cost on small to medium-sized enterprises, SMEs, in Ireland for no tangible benefit.</p> <p>The companies here today span the freight, parcel and energy sectors.  Delivery to Irish homes and businesses is their day job.  They know what they are talking about and they estimate that savings in the order of tens of millions of euro annually can be passed to the public via an efficient postcode system.  As a national postcode, however, Eircode lacks vision, imagination, ambition and, most of all, practicality.  Ireland needs a modern, open, location-based postcode with a useable structure and sequence.  We here today ask the communications committee to use its influence with the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Alex White, to forestall Eircode's introduction as a national postcode before it is too late.</p></speech>

I have asked questions about Eircode and I have not got convincing answers from the Department.  The first question I asked was about the purpose of introducing this system.  Normally, when one is doing any sort of a technical specification, one first undertakes a functional specification and identifies the problem one is trying to resolve.  Other than getting vague statements such as "It would be the most up-to-date postcode system in the world", I cannot get an answer to that simple question: what problem is this postcode system attempting to solve?  I see no evidence of any independent trial of this structure.  Normally such a fundamental piece of infrastructure would be tested in a small pilot area before it is implemented nationally.</p><p>  I am also concerned about the cost and the over-reliance on management consultants to deliver what should be a fairly straightforward piece of infrastructure.  I am concerned that we may have another Irish Water on our hands.  I very much share Mr. O'Donnell's concerns.

We are a pallet distribution network.  There are four or five similar networks in the country.  We probably represent up to 100 or 120 hauliers around the country.  I do not think any of them were approached at any stage for an input, either from a functional or technical perspective or on a day-to-day working basis.   We have only met here this morning - some of us have never met before although we are from a similar industry - but the bottom line for us is that we have all, without even giving it consideration, concluded that there is no use in this for us whatsoever. We simply would not use this system if it were imposed on us.  We would have get another system to cater for our business.  I understand that the boxes have been ticked for a number of industries around the country but it is certainly not ticking the box for the transport and logistics industry.  It is not as if we can even come and debate the issue here - it is simply of no use to our industry.</p></speech>

I can only speak for my part of the industry, but many of us use barcoding and scanning.  We have waited a number of years for this postcode system to come in because we were identifying a new software application that we could use but now it is of no use to us as we have waited over the past two or three years.  There is none out there that we can implement into a software system that gives us a ready-made, identifiable and sequential way of making deliveries of various products.</p></speech>

In the back of the information pack we have put three local addresses: the Royal College of Surgeons next door, Leinster House, and Buswell's Hotel.  Any of the other coding systems will logically place those in a sequence that a man in a hi-vis vest, a man in a van or a woman behind a computer screen allocating these to customers will understand.  Eircode randomly assigns these.  We are conscious that the providers of this code will say that some other middleware provider will come along with a system, to answer the Chairman's question.  We argue that simply introduces another layer of cost and complexity, which makes Eircode in its bare iteration as one looks at it on a piece of paper of no use to people like this who deliver parcels, industrial gases, energy, or pallets to one's address.</p></speech>

Just to explain, if we get in 2,000 pallets tonight and we have 200 trucks around the country delivering those, we cannot put a run on each truck to say "X1, X2, X3, X4".  If we took Eircode as it is and we followed a system, we could have a truck going to Westport, his next delivery could be in Ballina, and his next one could be back to Westport again.  As there is no sequencing in the system, there is no natural run to put on a truck or a van.  Does that explain the situation?  It is of no use to us; there is no logic to its numbering system.</p></speech>

Our volumes on a daily basis can fluctuate significantly.  We are talking fluctuations, depending on the time of year, of between 15,000 and 25,000 parcels a day.  It is very important to have the flexibility to increase or reduce the number of vehicles we put on the road each day from a cost-efficiency point of view.  It also has an impact on the environment.</p> <p>That also has an impact on the environment in terms of putting excess vehicles on roads.  A sequence postcode enables us to have a logical system to flex the volume between vehicles.  In effect, we cannot use the proposed Eircode system.

It was important to bring a company such as BOC Industrial Gases before the committee to demonstrate that one of the other key failings of the system is that it is only a solution for letter boxes.  If one is going to places that do not have a letter box, this is not a solution at all - good, bad or indifferent, Eircode is useless.  A lot of the type of business that BOC and Niall Cotton are involved in relates to farm outbuildings, warehouses and workshops that do not have a postal address.  If they do not have a postal address now, they will not have an Eircode when the system comes in.</p><p>  We also wish to raise issues relating to tourism and the road network.  From those points of view, Eircode is useless because it only assigns a postcode to a postal address and nothing else.</p></speech>

To take a practical example, most of us buy stuff over the Internet nowadays.  Next year, if I buy a new laptop I will go online to find one.  I will order it and put in my address and new Eircode.  UPC or another such company will deliver the parcel to my house a couple of days later.  Mr. Smith has said the postcode will not be any assistance to his company.  I presume each freight company has its own IT system or delivery system.  Mr. Smith has said deliveries are organised by street, address or business and they are done in a certain order according to existing postcodes.  He said the new Eircode system will not assist him and that he will still have to use the street address of the house or business in order to make the physical delivery.</p></speech>

They must decide to group deliveries in areas, for example, Dublin or Kildare, or whatever location they operate in.  In the United Kingdom, based on the sequence, they can make very logical decisions, such as if a certain vehicle has reached capacity then a subsector postcode could be moved to a neighbouring vehicle so there is not excess mileage and we do not have to add an additional route or have vehicles operating below capacity.  The proposed system does not allow us to narrow down the data.  It is not just a question of IT, it relates to the decision making capacity of individual drivers and they do not derive any benefit from Eircode in terms of decision making.</p></speech>

Would it be fair to say that Eircode is based on a geodirectory system, a unique identifier for every address in the country?  The UK companies say the geodirectory part of it is based on a random number and that is causing them the biggest trouble.  Are there not benefits in a geodirectory system that identifies an individual address over a clustered address in terms of accuracy of delivery, leaving aside the sequential aspect of it?  One still has random numbers but because one has a unique identifier to an address, in addition to either a name, a business name, street name or house number, one has an individual code identifying a precise individual address for deliveries.  I refer to post, including commercial deliveries or parcels delivered by courier or other method.  Irrespective of the random nature of the numbering, that should be a positive development.  If the numbers were not random, would it give rise to data protection issues on the basis that one could identify who lives next door and so on?  Significant issues arise for the address owner.  Among the people who supported a geodirectory-based code are the emergency services, for example.  Given the advantages of an individual address, how does one deal with potential data protection issues?  Is that the crux of the problem?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-05a.740" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="09:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014110500005#H01600"><p>Not at all.  A unique identifier presents data protection issues that do not arise with a less granular structure.  We do not believe there are fundamental data protection issues with a unique identifier.  In the previous D&aacute;il, a similar committee dealt with the issue robustly.  Eircode is an An Post geodirectory solution.  The geodirectory has been bought out as part of the process by Capita plc, a UK company which is buying the database from An Post.  Effectively, all that is happening is that a unique, random seven character string is being added to postal and business addresses in the geodirectory.  That is the nub of the issue.  If the geodirectory was a good solution for getting parcels, freight or energy to one&rsquo;s premises, the delivery companies would be using it now.  Although geodirectory gives a longitude and latitude, that is insufficient data to route because if we go back to simple maths, a longitude and latitude gives a point and what these people want to buy are lines.</p> <p>I hope that makes sense.  They need to join the dots.  A random selection of dots around the country is no good to them from a routing point of view.  This is a GeoDirectory mark 2 solution and the GeoDirectory has been with us for decades.  It is not a solution now and therefore it will not be a solution if it is presented as a random post code.</p></speech>

I have a couple of perspectives.  The university constituencies operate on both sides of the Border and I find it is far easier for me to send a message to a constituent in Clones than it is in Newtownbutler.  It is only eight or nine miles away but one must remember all the details.  There is, therefore, a cost involved in this.  I cannot see, as a user of the post office, that there is any benefit, as I gather that the technology can recognise addresses anyway.  It can read that it is Clones.  Adding seven numbers on to Clones to send a letter under this system accomplishes nothing.</p><p>  Is it true that even in the UK after 30 years there is only about 80% use of post codes but the machines recognise the rest of the mail and it goes through with no delays?  When I read that Ireland is the last country in Europe to do this, it might actually be quite sensible not to implement an unnecessary technology that is about 150 years old, going back to the first post codes in London.</p><p>  Taking up Deputy Colreavy's point, how much money is involved in this, and is it another Irish Water?  The witnesses are major customers and we have heard their points and read their document.  Is there any chance of stopping it from a public expenditure point of view?  We did ask the former Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, Deputy Pat Rabbitte to debate it in the Seanad before he went ahead with it because there was a substantial number of people in the post office who were also against this.  Their volumes are declining very rapidly, so if the existing system cannot handle a declining volume of mail and it has the technology to recognise where Clones is, what is the point of this exercise?  We are indebted to the witnesses as public-minded citizens coming in and to tell us their views on this, but is there any remaining point in proceeding with this project?</p><p>  The final issue is that there are civil liberties types who are concerned about this as well.  That is another hornets' nest that we do not want to disturb.  Is &euro;20 million about to be spent on a project that is not going anywhere?</p></speech>

The second question is whether it is another Irish Water.  It is a good system for the emergency services because they can pinpoint a location, but they are not pinpointing a location on a sequential basis as it is once-off locations that they are pinpointing.  In terms of an Irish Water, absolutely it is an Irish Water for the transport and logistics industry.  In hindsight we will look back and we will ask how we got that wrong as well.</p><p>  The Senator is right to point out that we are the last to introduce a postal code system.  We should be the best.  We are recognised in this country for being technical and digital leaders and now we have an opportunity to implement something that represents that, yet we are not going to do it.  I do not know whether it is too late to do something about this.  That is the big question we have.</p></speech>

There is also an ongoing payment to An Post in respect of the database and there are other costs in the region of &euro;20 million to &euro;30 million.  However, that does not factor in the cost to business if Eircode were pushed onto businesses.  Much of the expenditure in the public service is on cleansing of databases.  Businesses would have to cleanse databases to put in a post code that would do nothing for them.  Businesses will have two choices, effectively.  They may pay money to IT specialists to cleanse databases to adopt Eircode, which will do nothing for them.  The other possibility, or probability, is that they will simply ignore it and bring in proprietary solutions of their own and we will end up with many different solutions.  That has happened, for instance, with the major satellite navigation providers.  Garmin has adopted an Irish solution called Loc8 Code and TomTom has come up with its own solution, MapCode.  A State-sponsored solution would get around this multiplicity of post codes but unless someone gets a grip of it at State level, there is a danger of a plethora of solutions where there should be just one.</p></speech>

Although I am not a member of the committee and I am far from an expert on this area, I have been tracking the sequence of events that led to the choosing of Eircode for a number of years.  I have spoken to many people who have concerns about it.  It seems that the witnesses are saying that because we are late coming to the whole idea of a post code, we had the opportunity to make a technological leap and we are failing to do so, that basically what we are choosing is a database system that is geared mainly towards the delivery of letters, which is a dying method of communication.  What the witnesses are asking for is some sort of a sequential code that is easily recognisable and that has some sort of logical pattern that can be used for their businesses.<br/>I have watched this for a long time and it seems that perhaps a mistake was made in setting the parameters of the system that was to be chosen and that the tender documents and the whole preparation process seemed to be geared at facilitating An Post.  I am not against facilitating An Post but it seems to have happened to the exclusion of everybody else.  I asked a number of parliamentary questions about this and one answer stated, &quot;In addition, the emergency services sees the introduction of post codes as facilitating the speedier deployment of their services&quot;.  I am not sure how that is the case if one depends on a letter-box, since many of the emergency services go to places that do not have letter-boxes.  The reply continues that An Post, which is actively involved in the design process is fully committed to using Eircode.  If An Post was actually involved in the design process, it seems inevitable that we got something that suited its sorting system, and that we did not get something that had other functions and other users.<br/>The witnesses are talking now about introducing a parallel system.  As I understand it, they are saying that the Government Departments that this system suits, which send many letters, may use this system, but that it should be a private system, not publicly used, and that we should introduce some sort of parallel system.  By a parallel system, they mean that the last three digits are sequenced.  I follow on from Senator Barrett's questions about how much it will cost.  Is there a huge cost involved in this?<br/>An answer to another parliamentary question stated: <blockquote>Concerns have been expressed by a number of logistics bodies in connection with the Eircode, most specifically in relation to the non-sequential nature of Eircode.  Capita, the post code management licence-holder has met with a number of these bodies to discuss these concerns and to, <i>inter alia, </i>explain that a sequential post code structure is not feasible or necessary.</blockquote>What is it that is different about Ireland that makes it unfeasible to have a sequential postcode structure?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-11-05a.746" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Neil McDonnell" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014110500006#J00600"><p>The question about the delivery of post is interesting.  It is not a question for us but I would seriously question whether An Post will even use Eircode to deliver.  It has two components: a routing key, which has a geographical basis not unlike the current Dublin postal districts, followed by a four-character random string.  It would be very interesting to ask An Post whether it is going to use the random string to deliver mail or just sort it into the postal districts and continue to do what it is doing right now.  I suspect it is the latter.</p> <p> On the question of cost, businesses like this are presented with a Hobson's choice of spending money to buy a database and then paying someone to interpret that database or simply to continue to do what they are doing right now.  I suspect that most of them, for practical cost reasons - not merely as a money issue - will continue to do what they are doing right now because that still will get them to the end address, albeit on a less efficient basis than is possible, without paying someone extra money for so doing.  These people do not interact with customers or businesses via An Post but interact directly with the public and with businesses.  The issue for them is they take a van, a gas truck or a pallet to a physical address and unlike a United Kingdom postcode or zip code in America that is visible in parts, Eircode is invisible at that physical address.  There is no physical sign that one is at an Eircode.  Consequently, to address the Deputy's middle point on whether there is a utility for this as part of a Government database last, that is entirely up to the Members of the House.  We believe there is huge utility in an address database but not as a postcode and not for people who are in the business of getting from a depot to a house or a business.  This is of no use to them.</p></speech>

The reply to my parliamentary question states it was explained to the witnesses why it was not feasible.  I wonder why it is not feasible in Ireland when it is feasible everywhere else.</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy that no one asked either the Freight Transport Association or its members.  There was no consultation.  There was a launch of the product but there was never a consultation as to what that product should be.</p></speech>

In particular, the mention of Irish Water and what happened there would suggest there may be difficulties in this area coming down the track, which perhaps members may wish to head off at the pass.  Deputy Mitchell mentioned that this system appears to be suiting An Post but Mr. McDonnell is suggesting it does not even suit An Post.  It was mentioned earlier that the emergency services would benefit from this system.  Does it suit anybody else?  What is the point the association is making here?  Is there any need for a postcode at all or what one does it suggest?</p></speech>

How precisely that is presented is technical and is irrelevant to us but we simply need something like that.  The reason we have appended four different examples to our submission is there are functioning proprietary systems available right now.  We do not advocate any particular solution and do not even state it must be one that is in the back of the pack.  We simply are stating there are lots of clever people who already have come up with excellent solutions to this and it cannot be beyond the imagination of the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources to put in place a similarly productive useful system.</p></speech>

The minimum time it will take is one or two days of someone coming in to cleanse the database.  Moreover, whatever one might buy from someone on that day, it will cost more than &euro;500 and less than &euro;1,500 per day to work on a database in one's business.  I will let members figure out what that kind of cost on business will be.</p></speech>

As a database solution, one is paying for the maintenance and the upkeep of a database and as this is a database of 2.2 million unique address, it must be refreshed constantly.  We understand it must be done quarterly.</p><p>  To answer the Senator's question, the pricing was meant to be released in September but it has not come out.  The pricing for neither the Eircode address file, ECAF, which is the thin file that does not contain the longitude or latitude, nor the full Eircode address database, ECAD, which is meant to be the commercial file, is available.  Consequently, we do not know what the cost to industry will be.  However, as Mr. Tom Carr noted, it is not a cost issue.  Even were this service offered to us at no cost, it does not have any utility in it as a postcode.  It is a postal address database, not a postcode.</p></speech>
