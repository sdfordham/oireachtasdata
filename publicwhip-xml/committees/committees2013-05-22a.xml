Agreed.</p><p>  COM (2013) 145 is a proposal for an amendment to the Commission proposal COM (2011) 607 final/2, regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European Social Fund and repealing Council Regulation (EC) No. 1081/200629 - proposal for a Council recommendation on establishing a youth guarantee.  It is proposed that this proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>  White Paper COM (2012) 55 is an agenda for adequate, safe and sustainable pensions.  It is proposed that the White Paper itself does not warrant further scrutiny.  However, in view of concerns expressed by the Department of Social Protection on certain elements of this White Paper, which may have implications for this country, it is suggested that a letter be sent to the Department requesting it to update the committee on developments on the initiatives set out in the White Paper and to provide a comprehensive overview of the issues surrounding the principle of subsidiarity therein.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.10" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Camille Loftus" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013052200003#G00500"><p>I thank the Chair and committee members for allowing us to come before it today.  The End Child Poverty Coalition is a coalition of eight organisations.  We have copies of our submission for members.</p><p>  We have been working for some time on various measures to try to eradicate the scourge of child poverty in this country.  Our perspective on the reforms is that we are very much pro-reform.  We have been advocating for reform for a number of years, and we have been advocating for much more progressive reform than has been implemented.  We have put on the record on numerous occasions our opposition to flat-rate cuts in child benefit, which are highly regressive in nature.  We note that in recent years nearly &euro;500 million has been taken from child income supports.  Cumulatively, when we examine the impact of child benefit cuts, smaller families have suffered a cut of more than a fifth in their child benefit payments and larger families have suffered a cut of one third in child benefit payments.</p><p>  Probably with the exception of young people who are unemployed, no other group in society has been asked to carry as heavy a burden of adjustment as this country&rsquo;s children.  The cuts have gone far enough and we cannot sustain any further flat-rate cuts to child benefit.  We are broadly in favour of reform.  We have advocated for a two-tier structure of child income support for a number of years.  However, we offer that support with a number of very important caveats, the first of which relates to low-income working families.  They are currently eligible for family income supplement, FIS, a vital support within the social protection system to ensure that work does indeed pay and that it is capable of providing a route out of poverty for low-income families.  Every single report in recent years &ndash; they go back more than 20 years &ndash; which has examined a two-tier type structure for child income support has always identified that a residual FIS-type scheme would be required, as a two-tier payment cannot be a simple replacement for something like family income support because it plays a very specific role in the social protection system.  We are deeply concerned that the Mangan report proposes to replace one of the child income supports with the second-tier payment.  That would mean a number of families that are in receipt of family income supplement, for whom it is an even more vital supplement now than it ever was, would face losses five to six times higher than families at the very top end of the income distribution.  It is a fundamental structural adjustment to the social protection system which reduces the incentive to participate in paid employment and would undoubtedly reinforce child poverty and trap families who are unemployed.</p><p>  The ESRI considered the impact of securing higher take-up rates on FIS and the impact that would have on child poverty.  Its estimate a number of years ago was that it would secure a 3% reduction in child poverty rates.  The Mangan report, by comparison, achieves a reduction of 0.2% in poverty.  There are much more efficient ways we can go about doing this.  We believe that if a second-tier payment is to be introduced it is critically important that FIS is retained within the system until a better in-work benefit has been identified.  We cannot get rid of FIS until a better alternative is in place.</p><p>  We are also concerned about the withdrawal cut-off point that was identified in the Mangan report, which is as low as &euro;25,000.  We had an opportunity to meet with the Minister for Social Protection yesterday and she indicated to us that the Mangan report has been asked to examine different cut-off points.  We take some hope from that because we feel the cut-off point is far too low and will result in hardship for a number of families on low incomes.</p><p>  The final point we wish to make is about investment in child services.  We know from work internationally and in this country that if we really want to achieve a meaningful impact on child poverty that it is investment in services for children that is likely to achieve the best results.  We look, for example, to initiatives such as the free preschool year for children as being progressive measures in terms of achieving much better child welfare outcomes.</p> <p> I mentioned that over &euro;500 million in savings has been accrued so far from cuts to child benefit.  We would like to see some of that directed towards enhanced services for children.  We give a couple of examples in our paper such as investment in schoolbooks for children, a second year of preschool education or after-school provision, and resources to strengthen primary health care to ensure children have access to the health care they need at an early stage in their lives.  These are the measures we would like to see some investment in, and we would like to see some of the savings accrued to date clawed back to ensure we get better outcomes for children because there is no doubt that unless we move in that direction, the legacy of this crisis will continue for many years to come.  Those children who have been asked to carry a disproportionate share of the cost of adjustment will bear that cost for many years to come in terms of restricted development opportunities.  Those are our three key points.  I thank the members for their time.</p></speech>

We are the leading national women's membership organisation in Ireland and we represent over 165 member groups from a diversity of backgrounds, sectors and locations throughout the country.</p><p>  For families, particularly women and children, child income supports, and particularly child benefit, are critical.  We know that child benefit clearly recognises the role played by women as care givers and that income may not be distributed equally within the home.  Research has shown that the vast majority of child benefit is spent either directly on children or indirectly in terms of household bills and supports.  </p><p>  In the Irish context, because of the lack of investment in child care, child benefit is seen as a key mechanism in supporting costs around child care.  When the Government introduced a series of increases in child benefit it stated that it was about recognising child care costs.</p><p>  Through successive budgets we have seen a reduced level of child benefit.  The National Women's Council estimates that families with four children have already seen a cumulative loss of over &euro;2,600 per annum.  While some compensatory payments have been made in terms of dependent children, that is not extended to the vast majority of families.</p><p>  We welcome the unanimity in the advisory group's report on tax and welfare in terms of its view that there should be a continued role for universality within the system of child income support.  That is critical, but we are concerned about the ratio indicated in the report between a universal payment and a targeted payment.  </p><p>  While it is acknowledged that families on very low incomes may be compensated for any reductions to the universal element of the payment, it is the experience of the National Women's Council and our members that families on low and middle incomes are struggling to pay for essential household items.  We are aware it is the only support in terms of paying for the costs of child care.  We believe that any further reduction to the current levels of child benefit are unsustainable for the majority of families.</p><p>  With regard to the thresholds recommended in the report, it is recommended that the second-tier payment would be withdrawn when gross income reaches &euro;25,000.<b></b> That is too low, particularly in terms of the needs of many women on low pay or reduced working hours.</p><p>  Assessing gross income is also problematic as it does not take into account families' levels of expenditure commitments.  For example, income could be assessed where expenditure such as accommodation costs, child care costs and health care costs for children might be excluded.</p><p>  Regarding family income supplement, we are at one with the anti-poverty coalition in that we believe it is critical that an in-work support is maintained within the system.  We are concerned about the recommendations in the report in that regard.</p><p>  With regard to reducing levels of child income supports and trading off with services, from a National Women's Council perspective it is critical that services are put in place for children, particularly in terms of child care and also health care services.  We have reached a point in this country as a result of austerity where it is not possible for families to sustain further cuts, and we must see those investments in services being made before any further cuts are considered.</p><p>  In terms of the National Women's Council's recommendations on the report, the current levels of the universal payment must be maintained.  We do not agree with the ratios suggested in the report.  The entrance level at which families become eligible for the second-tier payment must be significantly higher than the &euro;25,000 suggested.  The exit levels or cut-off points must be higher.  It is critical that an in-work support is maintained and clearly linked to employment rather than child supports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013052200004#H00400"><p>Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis na finn&eacute;ithe as ucht an m&eacute;id at&aacute; r&aacute;ite acu.  I met representatives of the End Child Poverty Coalition last week and therefore I have had a discussion on this topic already.  A number of questions arise in this regard but also with regard to some of the pronouncements on child benefit in the past week in particular.  I am one of those who believes in the universality of child benefit.  The argument that we can have a universal child payment and a second-tier payment is a dangerous road to go down because the same argument can be used for the universality of the free preschool education place, a second year of free preschool education, free schooling or anything else.  What are the witnesses' views on that?  The National Women's Council might prefer that if there is to be a change, at the very least it would happen at a different ratio but I would be concerned if we go down that road.</p><p>  I will not dwell on Labour Party election promises - we have had that debate - but last week the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Ruair&iacute; Quinn, stated that the money from a further cut in child benefit could be used to invest in a second year of free preschool education.  In the following days, however, the T&aacute;naiste stated there would be no further changes to child benefit.  Have the witnesses any indication of what is happening in that regard?  They stated that they met the Minister for Social Protection and if she is suggesting that committee should further examine the Mangan report, that suggests the T&aacute;naiste is out of step with either the Minister, Deputy Burton, or the Minister for Education and Skills.  We do not know where we are on that.</p><p>  On the &euro;450 million the witnesses stated has been taken out of child supports to date, do they agree that that &euro;450 million has not been reinvested in child services, which would be contrary to what the Minister, Deputy Quinn, suggested?  He may have been talking about doing that in the future but the existing &euro;450 million cut in recent years has not improved services.  Currently, social welfare payments are viewed as a social transfer and it has been shown that social transfers work in terms of dealing with poverty, especially child poverty.  Is investment in preschool places regarded as a social transfer or an investment in education?  Can they be grouped together?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1131" speakername="Fidelma Healy Eames" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013052200004#H00500"><p>The witnesses are very welcome.  I have some questions for Ms Loftus.  Will she give us a financial example of the way family income supplement, FIS, will be reduced according to the Mangan report?  She said that would put a family into poverty.  She stated also that she believes in keeping FIS until a better in-work benefit is introduced.  What has she in mind?</p> <p>Surely, work should pay and Ms Loftus should elaborate on what are the better cut-off points.</p><p> To follow up on Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh's comments on the proposal from the Minister, Deputy Quinn, I agree it is wise to put money into services for children and that this can benefit parents in a way that an additional &euro;20 or &euro;30 per child also might.  However, given the number of families which need child income supplement at present, I do not wish to see cuts to every family's child income supplement just to provide a second year of preschool for some children.  I am pleased to put this point on the record.  This next question is also directed towards Ms Orla O'Connor and the National Women's Council of Ireland.  Have the witnesses done their sums in this regard?  For example, were child income benefit to be cut for just those families which would benefit from the second year of preschool while leaving all other families alone, how much would that provide?  That would be fair and equitable.  How much of a service could be provided by simply reducing the payment for those children who would actually benefit from the preschool education?</p><p> I will turn to Ms O'Connor, as I am uncertain of what exactly she meant in one of her recommendations.  It states, "The entrance level at which families become eligible for the second tier payment needs to be significantly higher than the &euro;25,000 suggested".  Ms O'Connor should state precisely what she means in this regard.  The next question also is addressed to both Ms Loftus and Ms O'Connor.  There is a chance that the more welfare supports we have, the less attractive we will make the quest for work.  In their view, where is the cut-off point at which one proofs against poverty and simultaneously makes work attractive?  I would be grateful were they to provide some financial examples in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1013" speakername="Brendan  Ryan" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013052200005#J00200"><p>In Ms O'Connor's contribution regarding high-earning families, I think she has indicated she would maintain current levels.  A debate is under way nationally as to whether, at a time of scarce resources, we ought to be paying this to higher-earning families and I would be interested in Ms O'Connor's thoughts in this regard.  As for the recommended threshold of &euro;25,000, when Ita Mangan appeared before the joint committee to present her report she went to great lengths to state this was not a recommendation but was simply an example drawn up by the report's authors.  As a committee, members told her that because it was the only example given, it tends to be perceived as the recommendation.  The joint committee then asked her to draw up some other examples and I believe that is the reference, as members asked her to do that.</p><p>  I have a question for Ms Loftus on cut-off points.  She has indicated the  End Child Poverty Coalition is in favour of reform.  Had the coalition not been asked to appear before the joint committee to respond to the Mangan report, what would be its own proposals, were it simply appearing to outline what the State ought to be doing in this regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013052200005#J00300"><p>I apologise for being obliged to leave the room but I was called out momentarily.  Deputy Ryan has asked one or two of the questions I had intended to ask, as to what were the witnesses' proposals for reform.  As the witnesses are aware, the Mangan report drew on contributions from many organisations.  Did they feed their proposals to the team that drew up the report?  I have my doubts about universality of payments.  For example, without identifying the person concerned, I spoke to someone only last night who recounted an earlier conversation with a chief executive officer of a company who is on big money.  Last year, when &euro;10 was cut from child benefit, he went berserk giving out about it, even though he earns a huge amount of money.  A point members discuss every day in respect of every Department is that many people are being paid what sometimes are immoral amounts of money but they also have an entitlement to child benefit.  My worry is that people who merely are PAYE workers on low to moderate incomes discern that such people still have the same entitlement to child benefit as they themselves enjoy.  It is very hard to understand the reason this is allowed to happen.  As for the &euro;25,000 threshold, that simply was an indicative figure used to state that were one below it, one would be in poverty.  However, to be honest, one would want to be earning considerably more than that to be out of poverty these days.  The sum of &euro;25,000 is very low and I am sure it will not be the figure used because it is too low.</p><p>  During a debate on this issue in the Seanad, the Minister for Social Protection stated she would not make further cuts to child benefit until proper child care was in place. I hope she will honour this commitment and this is the reason the T&aacute;naiste has stated there will not be changes.  I will take up this matter with the Minister again to be sure she will honour that commitment.  As everyone is aware, education probably is the best investment one can give a child but as Senator Healy Eames noted, although the preschool year will benefit families with younger children, it will not be of any benefit to children aged five and upwards who are going to school and so on.  If their money is to be cut, it will be seen to be subsidising people with younger children but families with older children need the money for school expenses and so on.  I thank the witnesses for their attendance and members have noted and will take on board their comments.  I apologise for being obliged to leave during the presentations but members have the full transcripts to hand and will give them due consideration.</p></speech>

It could pertain to their rates of pay or it could be that for different reasons, they are engaged in part-time work.  This could be a choice they have made or could be because their hours have been reduced.  While there is a myriad of reasons, there is a large number of people for whom work does not pay an acceptable rate and this is the reason the State has an in-work payment, such as FIS.  Our concern pertains to breaking the relationship between the FIS and work.  Consequently, if the FIS payment is to be replaced by this selective second-tier payment, it means this relationship between work and the payment is broken.  We think this is highly problematic because if one looks at all the statistics and all the reports, including the most recent one from the ESRI on jobless households, they tell one the best way to get and keep people out of poverty is to have them maintain employment.  Essentially, this is what the FIS does.  It helps people to maintain employment, even when it is not bringing in a huge financial gain and for the National Women's Council of Ireland, to break that relationship is highly problematic.  Many people might ask for what they were working if they would receive the same level of child benefit in any event, even if they were not working.  Consequently, the maintenance of the relationship between work and the in work payment is vital.</p><p>  With regard to Deputy Ryan's point on cut-off points, he is right.  It has emerged since the report was published that these figures were indicative and are only given as suggestions.  I am aware that Ita Mangan is working on different scenarios and we are glad to hear that because we fully agree that &euro;25,000 is a low level at which people would become eligible for the cut-off of payment.  In addition, the withdrawal of payment, once one goes above a certain threshold, is problematic for us because women, for example, on hourly rates from time to time, may be offered additional hours, which would mean additional income.  Consequently, they may lose child benefit as a result of taking up additional hours of work.  However, those additional hours may well be temporary and consequently, there are all kinds of reasons, in terms of our work on women and economic independence and of maintaining women in employment, when that is their choice or perhaps not even a choice.  In terms of our work in that area, it is vital that women are supported to work and that nothing disincentivises women from holding onto work.</p> <p>We also look forward to looking at the future scenarios that Ms Ita Mangan will produce.</p></speech>

It was the issue of investment in services.  To be clear, the National Women's Council supports a second year of preschool.  We think that is very important.  Our position, and what is being said so often by women over the past few years, is that it cannot be introduced at the expense of child benefit.  On the conversation that took place in the women's council, we were in a different place about eight years ago and people were looking at, if the Government made a reduction, what else might happen, particularly around medical cards for children and child care.  It has completely changed.  The members of the women's council are in a completely different position in terms of saying how much women need child benefit for basic household bills.  It cannot be a trade-off now.  We are not in that scenario.</p><p>  On the point about high earners getting child benefit, from our perspective child benefit is important as a payment for all children and we believe that it needs to be maintained in that way.  We completely accept the argument on redistribution of wealth in Ireland.  What we have been advocating in the National Women's Council is that we need to look at other ways of doing that.  Consistently, in pre-budget submissions, we have been advocating a third rate of tax as a way of doing it, which would bring in far more revenue than looking at, for example, what we were looking at previously which was the taxation of child benefit.  There are other ways of redistributing wealth, but once one starts cutting child benefit, one will cut back on families who need it.</p></speech>

There are a number of overlapping themes in the questions and I will try to address them it that way.</p><p>  There is a question about universality, both whether it is good or bad.  From the End Child Poverty Coalition's perspective, we are strongly in support of a universal child income support.  It is critically important for the State to deliver that kind of support in respect of all children.</p><p>  There are questions about distribution.  It is one of the reasons we have supported a second-tier payment, which is to maintain the bedrock of universality but to deliver a higher level of support to the families which would need it most.  That is the basic theory behind it.</p><p>  Specifically, in answer to Senator Marie Moloney's question, if there are concerns about very high earners receiving child benefit, the simple solution to that, without getting into overall complex mechanisms, is to apply higher tax rates to very high earners.  If I were a very high earner, in the absence of having any children whatsoever, I would not consider it at all unreasonable that I should pay more tax in order to contribute to the welfare of children who did not get raised in as good a circumstance as I did.  That is a fair social trade-off.</p><p>  On making work pay, I strongly endorse the comments by the women's council.  Child poverty is strongly related to joblessness in Ireland, and it was so even during the so-called boom years.  There are many who are concerned about that.</p><p>  Senator Healy Eames asked does more welfare support make work less attractive.  The point of the family income supplement is that it addresses that specific problem.  That is why FIS is such an important payment in the system.</p><p>  The second-tier payment, in and of itself, does not deliver additional support to those who are in work.  It treats all income the same.  FIS states, "If you are in work, we will deliver a higher level of support to you because it is critically important that work pays".</p><p>  I would broaden out this.  If we look at the changes that have happened in social protection over the past couple of years and look at changes to both jobseeker payments and lone parent payments, in each instance those changes have reduced the return from participating in employment for those who are unemployed.  They have made the transition from welfare to work less attractive than it was in the past.  The answer from the policy system always was that FIS is there to ensure that work always pays.  The alarming aspect about these proposals is that they propose to withdraw that very support.</p></speech>

A common mechanism that is used is to deliver a refundable tax credit.  I will not go into the details, but a refundable tax credit has a number of advantages over a social assistance payment.  It could be administered by the Revenue system.  It helps with take-up.  In the entire history of FIS, the upper estimates of take-up have been approximately 40%.</p></speech>

Some of them deliver higher levels of support at low-earning levels.  Some of them come up and then decline again.  There is a myriad of systems.  More broadly, the point here is in order to get FIS at present, one must complete a very long and complex form, one must take that to one's employer to sign-off on it and then one must send it to the Department.  With relatively small modifications to how employers file their returns, we could have this done almost automatically.  I point to the fact that a number of years ago the ESRI stated we could reduce child poverty by three percentage points if we had full take-up of FIS.  I do not believe that FIS is a generous enough payment but even if we left it within those limited parameters and had full take-up, we would immediately get a much better result.</p></speech>

It was the End Child Poverty Coalition which has argued for many years for second-tier supports.  This is exactly what we have done, but we have always said along the way there is a need for a residual FIS.  It simplifies the system.  It delivers a much more progressive system of child income support, but we always need to deliver those extra supports for low-paid families.  Much as I would like to see wages increase and much as I would like to see people have access to much more work than they do at present, there will always be households which are not capable of earning what they need to support their family's needs and, therefore, an in-work benefit is an important support.</p><p>  These were relatively new a number of years ago, although there are well-established systems in liberal welfare systems or Anglo-Saxon welfare systems, the United Kingdom and the United States being two of the primary examples in this regard.  As I stated, over the past number of years, with globalisation pressures and the kind of issues with which most welfare states are now engaging, they are an extremely common mechanism, but the tax system, rather than the social welfare system, is increasingly being used as the way to deliver.  We also have consistently made the argument that much better investment in services is required.</p><p>  The focus at present is on a second year of early childhood care and education.  There are real issues in terms of withdrawing money from families which will not benefit.  As Senator Healy Eames pointed out, some families would lose an income support and not benefit from the service.  Those are real issues.</p> <p>It is one of the reasons we have given the examples of free schoolbooks, better health care and after-school care, which are the kinds of things we need to look at to shift the balance of support for children to a services approach rather than to concentrate solely on child income support.</p></speech>

There are many other people who are on similar or marginally higher incomes who do not get it, which is part of the problem.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.61" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013052200007#L01000"><p>There was an issue about the National Women's Council.  We have perhaps the highest level of child benefit payments in the world and certainly within the European Union.  The argument is that we do not have the services that obtain in other member states such as free GP care or extensive child care.  One cannot increase the services and leave the payments at the same level given that there is not a great deal of money out there.  If we introduced free GP and after-school care, free books and other services, the logic would be to cut child benefit payments in tandem.</p><p>  One of the issues about universality is that somebody earning &euro;100,000 who has no children pays the same tax as someone on the same salary with four children.  Children's allowance was introduced to recognise the child as a unique individual with his or her own needs.  It was recognised initially in the tax system but is not now due to the issue of whether people are in the tax net and so on.  I am in favour of people who earn over &euro;100,000 receiving child benefit but I would like people on incomes of that level to pay more tax whether they have children or not.</p><p>  When Ms Rita Mangan was here, she made the opposite argument on FIS to the one Ms Camille Loftus is making.  She said reforms are to deal with the issues and to avoid disincentives to leave social welfare for work.  There are problems with FIS, which many people, including the self-employed and those who work more than 19 hours a week, do not receive.  Our FIS system is problematic as it stands.  Do the witnesses have any feedback on that?</p></speech>

The other key component is investment in services.  While we recognise that there is not much money available, &euro;450 million has already been saved on child income supports but children are not necessarily seeing the day-to-day benefit of that.  It is a question of political leadership and investment in our children and their futures.  That means provision of quality early years services, including a second free pre-school year while ensuring that high quality is maintained.  It also means the provision of quality after-school care.  While 6,000 after-school places were provided for in budget 2013, there are quality and quantity issues given that there are many thousands of children who would benefit from such a service, which would facilitate their parents to take up employment and, where such parents are in low-paid employment, maintain or become eligible for FIS payments.  End Child Poverty believes child poverty can only be eradicated through a combination of quality income supports and quality services and is a question of investing in those.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.63" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Caroline Fahey" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013052200007#L01200"><p>Regarding FIS, I think Ms Rita Mangan's point was that one must not be any worse off in a job than on social welfare.  We would say that one must be better off in a job than one is on social welfare.  There is a range of costs associated with going to work, not least of which is child care.  Costs also include food and transport.  It is not good enough to give people the same support whether they are in work or out of it as that fails to recognise the extra costs they face.  FIS rewards work and does not merely ensure that one is no worse off if one is working.  Working might not be a hugely enticing prospect to somebody who is considering leaving two children with a childminder to go and stack shelves in Tesco for the day.  People must be able to feel that their family will be better off as a result.</p><p>  It is becoming clear that with the changes to the one-parent family payment, FIS will help some of those lone parents who are in work to make the transition when their child turns seven.  It is a really important payment to keep in the system from that point of view to assist lone parents, who have the highest rate of poverty, to keep the jobs which make a huge difference to their families.</p></speech>

I give the example of a couple with two children and earnings of approximately &euro;300 per week, which is not uncommon for someone working close to full-time hours in the retail or service sectors.  The losses that couple faces under the Mangan proposals exceed &euro;100 per week.  While one might not be any worse off than when one was unemployed, to say it is fine that somebody on that low a wage should lose &euro;100 per week while someone earning &euro;1,000 loses about one tenth of that is a highly regressive proposal.</p></speech>

Huge cuts have already been made.  Child benefit has become a much larger part of families' incomes on foot of unemployment levels and reduced working hours.</p> <p>It is not possible to say that one can consider further cuts in services.  One point that resonates with me from telephone calls to the women&rsquo;s council is that there is no trust in the reforms that could emerge.  I concur with the Deputy that we need to find the revenue through the taxation system by looking at those earning over &euro;100,000 and we need to see services developed.  Then some years down the road we might be in a place to review the level of our universal payment.  We cannot do it now, however, because child benefit is much more significant than it ever was due to the wider economic circumstances.</p></speech>

What are the council&rsquo;s thoughts about the fact that child benefit is paid abroad to families with one parent working here?  It is a question I have brought up with many, including MEPs, but have never got a straight answer on it.  I believe that in such an arrangement the child benefit should be paid at the rate of the home country.  Much money is going out of the country through this arrangement.</p></speech>

However, how does one make that an attractive idea to the electorate?  From the Labour Party&rsquo;s experience in past elections when it proposed higher taxes for better services, it was targeted by opponents as the party of high taxation.  In short, they said do not vote for Labour because they will screw one on tax.  How does the council feel such a proposal would go down with the electorate?</p></speech>

It is the situation in so many other countries but there is not a sense here that reform will be delivered.  We are in a difficult place because of austerity and the cuts that have been introduced.  It is partly the politicians&rsquo; job, but ours too, to put out what these services would entail.  The National Women&rsquo;s Council of Ireland is working with Open and Start Strong in putting forward a Scandinavian model for child care and building public support for that.  We must make it possible to see that good quality child care services are possible.</p></speech>

In the 2002 general election, Labour proposed to take money out of the National Pensions Reserve Fund to put into the health service.  I remember when canvassing a woman on the doorsteps, she told me Labour was going to raid the pensions - little did she know what was going to come down the line.  I tried to explain to her that it would lead to more public health care and free general practitioner care but she told me she wanted the money in her pocket.  Possibly, after what has happened to the economy, people may be more open to the council&rsquo;s proposals but there is still an inbuilt belief in Irish society that we would rather the money in our pockets than the services.  It is a problem that we need to bear in mind.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.71" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Camille Loftus" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2013052200008#M00600"><p>Ms O&rsquo;Connor&rsquo;s point about trust is important in this regard.  The three previous Governments broke down people&rsquo;s trust in the system&rsquo;s ability to deliver services which were of use to them.  People prefer the money in their pocket because they know they can bank on it.  Accordingly, there is a real challenge to deliver the services that will make a real difference in people&rsquo;s lives.  It is not an easy challenge but an important one to step up to.</p><p>  Regarding Senator Moloney&rsquo;s question on the Mangan report, each of the member organisations of the coalition made separate submissions to the report.  The broad thrust of each of them, however, is that we are in favour of a restructured system of child income support that delivers more progressive outcomes, that family income support needs to be in place and more needs to be invested in-----</p></speech>

We already had done a lot of the running in developing this as a key alternative.  The maintenance of an element of universality would have been a key component of it.  There is much about what is in the Mangan report that we are in favour of in terms of structural reform with those caveats.</p><p>  On the point of the payment of child benefit to foreign nationals working here but whose children may not be residing here, that payment is part of our EU commitments.  Any Irish citizen working in another EU member state benefits from exactly the same measures.</p></speech>

I do not believe we would be very appreciative if Britain, France or Germany told an Irish citizen in such circumstances that he or she will get less than their citizens.  It must also be remembered that those parents are working here, suffering the absence of their children yet making a contribution to our tax coffers.</p></speech>

I know this issue is a popular item in the tabloid press, etc., but I do not believe the foundation of our problems is the payment of child benefit for children of non-Irish nationals working here and contributing to the tax system.  They get little enough out of our tax system as it is.</p></speech>

While I do not have evidence on this, there is a concern that some are taking advantage of this arrangement.  I agree with Ms Loftus that if an Irish citizen goes to Britain, then he or she has access to the National Health Service, NHS.  I can understand the concern being expressed, however.</p></speech>

Even what we have seen over the past several years in terms of the number of people who worked in Ireland who contributed into the tax system and what they have taken back out in social security support, the balance is very much in our favour.</p></speech>

It is not just the savings made in social protection but there have been cuts in other areas which have been more subtle in their effect.  For example, there has been the tightening up of the criteria for certain other payments.  These affect the bottom lines of families which are already struggling with what they have at the end of the month.</p> <p>Children have certain rights and the Government has voluntarily taken on human rights obligations for children from the UN Convention on the Rights of the Child.  The committee that oversees that convention would say that in times of recession or when countries are struggling, we must protect the most vulnerable.  We see that these groups have been disproportionately affected and it is time to say that enough is enough and put the argument about children's socio-economic rights on the table.  Children's rights have not been the focal point in discussions about reform.  </p></speech>

What we are saying is that right now, it is totally inappropriate.  People just cannot afford it.  We do not know where we will be in ten years' time in terms of the economic situation of the country.  What I would be clear on is that when we look back to when child benefit was at a much higher level eight or nine years' ago, we were having those conversations within the National Women's Council around the possibility of reform.  It is important to remember that child benefit has been reduced so we are in a very different place.  The question of whether the scope is there is part of the question.</p></speech>

I have been contacted by a number of people about the new rent strategy and how matters may play out for them in that regard.  For example, will a single person over-accommodated in a three-bedroom house or two bedroom flat which has been his or her home for a long time be permitted to remain in his or her home?  I hope it is not the intention to introduce an over-accommodation charge, such as was introduced in Britain under the differential rent plus scheme.  If the Minister can satisfy me that is not the intention, I am happy enough with the Bill.</p></speech>

It is purely a technical mechanism to allow local authorities to establish new rent schemes.</p><p>  On the point made by Deputy Ellis, the Bill will facilitate the transition to HAP.  We are progressing the outstanding issues with the Department of Social Protection.  For example, it is proposed to introduce a deduction at source system.  There are a number of issues in this regard that need to be addressed, including the economic and IT systems and so on.  We are on track to bring a memorandum to Government in July and to introduce the HAP legislation in the autumn, which will flesh out how the scheme will work.  We intend to introduce a small number of pilots under HAP in respect of the transition of rent supplement later this year.  The full roll-out of HAP and transfer of rent supplement will be brought in gradually over the course of next year.  </p></speech>

Will the introduction of this mechanism stabilise that situation, thus alleviating the problem in terms of the number of people being forced into homelessness?  Will the result of this be no further cuts to rent supplement?  The situation in this regard is chaotic, with many people having to leave their homes because landlords are insisting they pay &euro;950 per month rather than &euro;850 per month and so on.  This is happening across the board.  It is hoped the new system will stabilise this.</p></speech>

For example, a one-person household would pay a particular amount by way of contribution.  A model rent will be set for each category of household in respect of those transferring from rent supplement.  I believe this addresses the issue about which the Deputy is concerned, namely, people who cannot access housing because of the cap or cannot afford the amounts they are being asked to pay.  Essentially, it is a measure that will address the poverty trap in which people find themselves and the difficulty in some cases of their finding appropriate accommodation within the limits allowed.</p></speech>

However, housing is a dominant issue for all of us.  If there is one issue about which people consistently approach members, it is housing.</p><p>  Have the locations for the pilot schemes been selected yet?  I presume they will be in areas in respect of which there are lengthy waiting lists for houses.  Also, will additional money be made available to support this measure?  One of the reasons for the reduction in rent supplement is the cost in that regard to the Department of Social Protection.  I presume the rent supplement budget of that Department will transfer to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  If sufficient resources are not currently available to meet the cost of rent supplement, transferring responsibility for it from one Department to another will not change people's experience on the ground, which in some locations is that the rent supplement caps are way below those in the market which means the most vulnerable, people out of work and so on, find it difficult to secure accommodation.  </p><p>  In terms of the transfer, will budgetary issues arise?</p></speech>

We will have to have adequate funding for this.  The amount to be paid by the tenant will be decided on the basis of the model rent for HAP for each of the household categories.  The money will have to be made available.  The amounts payable will be similar to those payable under RAS.  All of these issues have yet to be addressed.  There will be a transfer of funding from the Department of Social Protection.</p></speech>

I know that many people in my area are topping up rent payments.  In terms of the business plan, is consideration being given to increasing the amount which the tenant will pay or is it proposed that under the new scheme they will pay similar amounts to those currently paid by RAS tenants?</p></speech>

We are seeking to ensure a fair affordable rate is set for each category of family.  All of the work is not yet complete.  As such, I cannot give the Deputy a definitive answer in terms of what each family will be expected to pay.  We will make that information available as soon as the next Bill, which will deal with the transition to HAP, is published, which probably will be in the autumn.</p></speech>

In other words, if the cap is &euro;100 people typically are paying &euro;110 to &euro;130.</p> <p>The most vulnerable people are also paying the minimum contribution of &euro;30 for a single person or &euro;45.  This is how it is being gotten around.  I know from filling out housing forms for people that one cannot set out what one is paying.  The councils are aware of this.  I use this information with council officials as a lever to get people housed because their contribution may be &euro;80 or &euro;100 out of a very small income.</p><p> There is a wide variation in the rents charged by local authorities under the differential rents scheme.  I found a significant variation between a town council and a county council located 60 miles apart.  The differential rent scheme is currently set out by the Minister.  Under the new regime, will an element of discretion be left to councils?  I am aware that councillors will have an input into setting rents under the Bill.</p></speech>

They left their dwelling in Cavan because they could not handle the situation and went to the Dublin City Council area.  However, they are counted as making themselves homeless and are not even on the homeless list.  It is a major problem because the only option open to them is the rent supplement scheme.  They received a note from the council stating they can avail of it.  They went to a place in Santry which, as a three bedroom house, was not ideal for accommodating 12 people.  The landlord wanted to charge a rent that was a little higher than normal but the council did not agree because it was a three bedroom house.  The family is costing the local authority a considerable amount of money because they are occupying hotel rooms.  We have to address a range of issues in respect of the rent supplement and its effects.  This is one of the reasons I referred to it.</p><p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy made a number of good points which reflect the problems I am encountering.  It is one matter to examine the tenant's contribution but if the Government keeps cutting it, these issues will continue to arise.</p></speech>

Perhaps the Deputies should direct their questions at the Minister for Social Protection.</p><p>  We are aware of the variations in differential rent around the country.  We plan to give local authorities a period of time to harmonise rents and a certain amount of local discretion will be permitted.  However, we will harmonise them as much as we can so that, for example, people living in neighbouring counties do not pay substantially different rent.  We will give those authorities which have the most significant differences a few years to come closer to the harmonised levels so that people's rents do not increase or decrease too significantly.</p></speech>

I will begin by making some general comments in respect of the outputs of my Department during 2012 and to date in 2013.</p><p>  The year 2012 was another demanding year for both this Department and for the economy.  We continue to operate in a very demanding and fast changing economic and financial environment and staff continue to respond unstintingly to the demands placed on them.  This was very evident in both the successful conclusion of the promissory note renegotiations and the special liquidation of IBRC.  The Deputies will have seen at first hand the dedication of and contribution made by staff in the Department where the very thorough pre-planning and delicate negotiation and diplomacy brought to these complicated issues resulted in very real value to the taxpayer. The successful sale of Irish Life, Bank of Ireland contingent capital notes and the efficient management of our EU Presidency programme were also key features of a particularly busy schedule for the Department.  Delivery on these issues does not happen without the continued support, often late into the night and indeed through the night, from the staff of the Department.  There are high stakes involved and we continue to make steady progress towards achieving our strategic goals.</p><p>  I am pleased to report that 2012 represented another significant stage on our road to economic recovery.  Following a return to growth in 2011, Ireland achieved a second successive year of growth in 2012, with GDP, in volume terms, having recorded growth of 0.9% in the year.  As would be expected from a small open economy such as Ireland's, the exporting sectors continue to drive our economic recovery.  While product-specific developments in the pharma-chem sector have impacted on goods exports, Ireland's services exports continue to perform strongly, having increased by 8.9% in 2012.  This continued success owes much to the significant competitiveness improvements that have taken place in recent years - a reflection of the flexibility of the Irish economy.</p><p>  While this in itself is encouraging, perhaps of more immediate relevance to the people of Ireland have been the signs of stabilisation in the domestic economy over the past year.  For the first time since the onset of the recession, households saw an increase in their disposable income during the year, while quarter 4 saw the first annual increase in employment since mid-2008.  On foot of this, personal consumption stabilised over the second half of 2012, recording modest growth over the last two quarters.  Last year also saw investment contribute positively to growth, recording the first year-on-year increase since 2007.  While Government consumption continues to decline - reflecting the necessary fiscal rebalancing - my Department now expects domestic demand to return to growth this year.  The importance of a vibrant domestic economy cannot be understated.  Domestic activity drives employment and its recovery is a vital precondition to tackling our high unemployment levels.</p><p>  Ireland's public finances have gone through an exceptionally difficult period in recent times.  After a sustained period of balanced budgets, the economic downturn caused the emergence of large deficits in each of the years since 2008.  In addition, the very significant level of support the State has been required to provide to our banking sector has contributed significantly to the deterioration in our public finances and is a large part of the reason for the extremely sharp, steep increase in our debt level.  As recently as 2007, our debt-to-GDP ratio was just 25%.  This year we expect it to peak at approximately 123%, a very substantial level of increase by any standards and in such a relatively short space of time.</p><p>  Notwithstanding this, the public finances are moving in the right direction.  Ireland has continued to demonstrate signs that the recovery is on track.  The latest figures show that our economy is growing, with GDP increasing by 0.9% in 2012.  Encouragingly, this was the second consecutive year of recorded economic growth and this positive trend is projected to continue throughout 2013.  This year's budget is based on real GDP growth of 1.3%.  Stabilising the debt ratio through a reduction in our annual deficit or borrowing requirement continues to be the backdrop that frames our fiscal policy.  The fiscal consolidation process has been under way since mid-2008 and all told, measures designed to yield or save approximately &euro;28 billion, or close to 17% of estimated 2013 GDP, have so far been implemented.</p><p>  However, we know that restoring our public finances to a sustainable path in the coming years cannot come from consolidation alone.  Economic growth is a key contributor and in designing economic and budgetary policy, we must be mindful of this.  Getting people back to work is at the top of this Government's agenda.  In light of this, one of the main focuses of budget 2013 was on small and medium-sized industries, SMEs.  We announced a ten point tax reform plan which included measures that will make a real difference to SMEs by assisting their cash position and supporting their creation of jobs.</p><p>  Turning to the labour market, 2012 saw the first real signs of stabilisation following the crisis.  Seasonally adjusted employment increased over each of the last two quarters, resulting in the first annual increase in the number of people in employment since mid-2008 in the fourth quarter.  On foot of this, it is encouraging to note that my Department is now forecasting a return to full-year employment growth for this year.  The unemployment rate meanwhile stood at 14% in April, having fallen from a peak of 15% in February 2012.  The Government remains committed to tackling the unacceptably high level of unemployment by creating an environment which supports enterprise and job creation.  Reflecting this, the Action Plan for Jobs 2013 set out over 333 actions to be undertaken in the coming year to support job creation and complement measures already undertaken in the jobs initiative and the pathways to work.  The scope of the plan reflects not just the ambition of this Government but a determination to get Ireland's unemployed back to work again.</p><p>  However, in assessing the economic outlook for Ireland, it is important to recognise that we are in a time of heightened uncertainty and considerable risk.  Given the export-orientated nature of our economy, our fortunes are indelibly intertwined with those of our trading partners.  Ireland cannot prosper in isolation and any re-ignition of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area would clearly pose a significant threat to our recovery.</p> <p>We successfully concluded the ninth review of the programme of financial support with the EU Commission, the ECB and the IMF in April.  The tenth review process began recently with the review mission running from 23 April to 2 May 2013.  During this and previous reviews we have emphasised that our focus now is on our exit strategy from the programme, our re-entry into the financial markets and improving our debt sustainability.  Our programme compliance is recognised as being uniquely strong, and as at the end of 2013 we have completed over 240 actions, and close to 85% of the available external funding has been drawn down as at the end of March 2013.</p><p> Importantly, the Government continues to meet each of the quantitative fiscal targets set out as part of the EU-IMF programme, the most recent being for the end of March.  In addition, we are on track to meet the annual deficit target for this year, as we did in 2012.  Compliance with these targets has helped a great deal in restoring Ireland's reputation as we seek to return our public finances to a more sustainable path.  However, we remain cognisant of the fact that a very challenging road lies ahead.  The gap between spending and revenues still remains too large.  We are determined to continue to reduce this gap in a phased manner over the coming years, to allow the economic recovery take hold.  The budgetary adjustments that are required present many challenges for policy makers but we remain steadfast in our commitment to reducing the deficit below 3% by 2015.</p><p> Ireland's Presidency of the European Union is now moving into its final stages.  The Irish Presidency has been focused on stability, jobs and growth and we have focused on working with our European partners to introduce measures to support this agenda.  We have pursued specific objectives and focused resources on the most significant dossiers.  This has been a successful strategy and we have made significant progress in a number of policy areas.</p><p> First and importantly, we achieved agreement on the extension of maturities of European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, loans for Ireland and Portugal.  In financial services, we have focused on the legislative dossiers necessary to help complete the banking union.  The banking union has been a high priority of the Irish Presidency because of its importance in breaking the link between the sovereign and the banks.</p><p> We have gained agreement on the capital requirements directive IV which is important for the stability of the banking sector.  We have also achieved agreement on the single supervisory mechanism and adapted the rules of the European Banking Authority to this new framework.  This is a fundamental element of the structure of banking union.  There was significant progress on the bank resolution and recovery directive at the May ECOFIN and we are working on progressing this with a view to reaching agreement on key political issues at the June ECOFIN.</p><p> In the consumer area we have achieved agreement on the mortgage credit directive.  Work is also advancing on other important financial services dossiers such as the markets in financial instruments directive and regulation, MiFID-MiFIR.  We achieved agreement on the two pack set of economic regulations aimed at improving economic governance in the euro area.  We have been moving the European semester economic governance process to its final conclusion at the June European Council.</p><p> In taxation, the Presidency achieved agreement to allow those member states who wished to introduce a financial transaction tax to commence work on the proposal.  More recently, agreement was achieved on a mandate to allow the Commission to enter into negotiations with third countries on amendments to savings taxation agreements.  Agreement was also achieved at the May ECOFIN on a set of Council conclusions on tax fraud and tax evasion.  This is part of wider work on combating tax fraud and tax evasion.</p><p> We have been engaged with the EU budget, including achieving political agreement on a draft amending budget to the 2013 budget to allow for discussions on the multi-annual financial framework, MFF, with the European Parliament.  We have contributed to advancing discussions in the development of European Council President Herman Von Rompuy's roadmap for economic and monetary union for the June European Council.</p><p> These are just some of the achievements during an EU Presidency calendar that included not only the very successful ECOFIN meeting, but more than 60 working parties, 50 trilogues and associated bilateral meetings.</p><p> I will touch briefly on initiatives in the banking sector.  In June 2011 the Central Bank of Ireland, together with my Department, was asked to take a lead role in preparing a national payments plan.  The overriding vision for the national payments plan is for Ireland to double the number of e-payments <i>per capita</i>by 2015, leading to a reduction in our cash and cheque usage to the EU average.  The national payment plan is the result of extensive consultation with relevant stakeholders and all stakeholders will play a role in implementing the recommendations of the plan.</p><p> Ireland is in the unique position of not only being able to catch up to others but even to become a leader in this area.  We have one of the youngest populations in Europe and have shown ourselves to be very fast adaptors of new technology.  The national payments plan is designed to ensure that the payments environment here facilitates increased adoption of more efficient payment methods.  In addition to targeting increased e-payments usage, the national payments plan will target improved consumer payments systems and modernised business payments.  In doing so we will ensure that Ireland meets its commitments under the single European payments area regulation but our primary driver is increased competitiveness and efficiency.</p><p> One of the key priorities of the programme for Government is to ensure that an adequate pool of credit is available to fund SMEs in the real economy during the bank restructuring and downsizing programme.  It is vital that the banks continue to make credit available to support economic recovery.  However, it is not in the interest of the banks, businesses or the economy for finance to be provided unless the business is viable and has the capacity to meet the interest payments and repay the sum borrowed.  The Government has imposed SME lending targets on the two domestic pillar banks - AIB and Bank of Ireland - for the three calendar years 2011 to 2013.  Each bank was required to sanction lending of at least &euro;3 billion in 2011, &euro;3.5 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013 for new or increased credit facilities to SMEs.  The credit reviewer said in his most recent quarterly report, &quot;Both banks have achieved their &euro;3.5 billion SME loan sanction targets.  Over &euro;8 billion was sanctioned in 2012.&quot;</p><p> The Action Plan for Jobs 2013 contains a section dedicated to access to finance for micro, small and medium enterprises.  There are 24 specific actions aimed at improving access to finance to be undertaken in 2013 by various organisations.  The State bodies group was established in 2012 to develop and oversee the implementation of key policy initiatives to support SME access to credit and other forms of finance.</p><p> With over 16% of mortgages in arrears and household debt stabilising but still high compared with European peers, the area of mortgage arrears and personal insolvency remains one of our key issues.  Following the publication of the 2011 inter-departmental working group report on mortgage arrears, a comprehensive strategy has been put in place across Government to address the problem of mortgage difficulty.  It encompasses personal insolvency reform, a mortgage information and advice service, and the development of the mortgage to rent scheme.  Much progress was made on this in 2012 which culminated in the enactment of the Personal Insolvency Act.  The Insolvency Service of Ireland, ISI, is putting in place the necessary arrangements to make the Act operational and it is hoped it will be in a position to accept applications this summer.</p><p> The Central Bank has had intensive engagement with regulated mortgage lenders and required them to develop and implement mortgage arrears resolution strategies.  Arising from this, the Central Bank, as regulator, published performance targets for the main mortgage lenders which will require banks to offer and conclude sustainable solutions for their customers in arrears.</p> <p>These targets will be backed by new and rigorous provisioning requirements and the possible imposition on the banks of higher capital requirements if these performance targets are not met.  The Department is also engaging with the main lenders on a regular basis regarding the lenders' mortgage arrears resolution strategies and their progress in meeting the targets set by the Central Bank.</p><p> In terms of the operations of the Department, we continue to pursue an ambitious reform agenda which includes a realignment of our Estimate across five programmes, providing greater focus on key deliverables including EU, financial services, fiscal and economic policy together with provision of certain shared services.  We are committed to increasing transparency and openness, including regular reporting against targets and outreach to strategic partners and expert groups to better inform our policy development.  We are publishing a greater amount of information for as wide an audience as possible.  For example, the recent Exchequer statement was published on our website with an accompanying explanatory video.  To this end, I have distributed today our recently published annual review and our most recent report card.  These publications provide an update on the wide range of issues addressed, and actions taken, by the Department over the past 18 months.</p><p> Turning to the business of the committee today, the funding allocation sought for the Department of Finance group of Votes for 2013 totals &euro;362 million and compares to a 2012 Vote group total of &euro;351 million.  Of this, some &euro;33 million relates to Vote 7, which provides for the administrative and non-administrative costs of the Department of Finance, an increase of &euro;1 million compared to 2012, arising largely because of the costs of the EU Presidency.  This is a temporary increase for the duration of the Presidency and costs in this area will cease in the latter part of this year.</p><p> We continue to pursue economies of scale and improved productivity through the expansion of the shared service function to other Departments, agencies and bodies.  We have also progressed a number of initiatives, such as the abolition of payable orders and the reorganisation of accommodation arrangements, which will secure long-term administrative budget savings.</p><p> The Estimate also contains a significant provision for banking-related consultancy and other costs, including the cost of financial inclusion projects which I referred to earlier.  The Department will continue to seek to minimise these costs but we must be equipped to address issues as they arise, in pursuit of the best return for the taxpayer and in the interest of securing a robust banking system and economic climate.  We are dealing in billion euro transactions and the results will impact for the long-term for everybody.  We must not seek to achieve short-term savings on costs at the expense of long-term failure on a macro level.</p><p> As for Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Estimate of &euro;322.705 million is up by &euro;14.579 million, or 5%, on the 2012 net outturn.  Of that, 73% is related to pay for an employment control framework ceiling of 5,874 staff.  The main reason for the increase is the implementation of the local property tax scheme.</p><p> In 2012, net tax and duty receipts increased by 7.3% to &euro;36.7 billion, the second successive year-on-year increase in returns to the Exchequer since 2007.  Continued investment in information and communications technology, as well as providing better services for the tax paying public, has been a major driver of productivity growth in Revenue.  It continues assisting the organisation to deliver services in these more difficult economic circumstances.</p><p> Encouraging voluntary compliance is a cornerstone of Revenue's business strategy.  Revenue does this by making it as easy as possible for taxpayers and businesses to be compliant on a voluntary basis.  In addition to providing quality customer service, Revenue supports compliance by simplifying its procedures and practices and reducing the costs associated with meeting tax and duty obligations.  Throughout 2012, despite the difficult economic circumstances and financial difficulties experienced by many taxpayers, high levels of compliance were maintained.</p><p> In 2012, Revenue deployed significant resources to the early detection of highest risk evasion, shadow economy and smuggling activities through the greater use of intelligence, data matching and analytics, and an intensified range of risk focused compliance and audit interventions.  Revenue continues to develop sophisticated systems to monitor and manage risk in its pursuit of those who fail to meet their tax and duty obligations.  Revenue's role extends beyond the administration of the tax system and they have continued to contribute to Ireland's economic development by providing high quality legislation and advice and promoting Ireland's agenda in various national and international fora.</p><p> This year Revenue will make an important contribution to national objectives of fiscal consolidation and economic recovery.  Revenue will administer the taxes and duties which are placed in its care and management as efficiently as possible, and will strive to maintain, and where possible grow, compliance levels.  In 2013, the introduction of local property tax is a significant part of that contribution.  Other key priorities include making a tangible impact on the level of shadow economy activities by devoting resources to target and intervene against shadow economy and smuggling activities.</p><p> With, regard to Vote 8, the budget of the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General is applied towards a single programme with the following outputs: auditing the financial statements of public bodies and issuing audit opinions; control of issues from the Central Fund; examining and reporting on financial management arrangements in public bodies; and the value for money of public services.  The Comptroller and Auditor General also assists the PAC in it scrutiny of the public finances.</p><p> I thank members for their attention and I commend the Estimates for the Department of Finance group of Votes to the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.129" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/993" speakername="Michael McGrath" time="16:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013052200005#D00200"><p>I will try to be brief to allow as much time to examine the Estimates as possible.  I join the Minister in acknowledging the commitment of his staff.  They have impressed me over the course of the year with the commitment they have shown to their duties.  Many of them have gone beyond the call of duty on many occasions and I readily acknowledge that and thank them for all of their work.</p><p>  The Minister pointed out in his opening statement what he regards as evidence of a recovery in the economy.  There is evidence of a recovery in some sectors and I believe we should make the next budget about SMEs.  We should build on the package of measures the Minister announced in December to give SMEs even more support.  When we talk to people who are in business, they refer to the same issues again and again: rent, rates, energy costs, waste disposal, red tape and compliance.  If we can free up the entrepreneurial spirit around the country, we will secure a recovery in the domestic economy far more quickly than will otherwise be the case.</p><p>  The approach to date has been to rely on an export-led recovery.  Exports have been doing well generally but as the Minister acknowledged in his own contribution, the exports of goods has declined, it is now the export of services that is leading the recovery.  There is a major threat for Ireland because we export 90% of everything we produce and we need demand from our trading partners.  We returned to modest growth in 2011 and 2012 because of exports.  When we look at the economic data that continue to come out of the eurozone, they are extremely weak.  It is still in recession and many countries that should not be continuing with fiscal consolidation and that have scope to invest further in their economies are continuing blindly down the road of austerity which is hampering demand across Europe.</p> <p>These are issues we discussed during the Private Member's debate last night.  It would be very helpful for Ireland and other peripheral countries if many of the triple A countries in Europe, for example, allowed their own economies to breathe and grow again.  That would certainly help our recovery very significantly.  </p><p> The issue of the banks is still looming very large.  The Minister said that the lending targets for the SME sector have been met but the evidence on the ground is quite different.  We have had representatives of the banks in here on a number of occasions.  We have drilled down into the detail of the data and found that the level of new lending is only a fraction of the &euro;7 billion that the banks claimed they had lent last year.  When one examines the detail, one finds that there was actually a reduction in the overall amount of credit for SMEs in circulation because many SMEs paid back debt in the last year.  The total pool of funding that has been lent is actually contracting.</p><p> There is no doubt but that a key element of our recovery will be dealing with the overhang of debt that people are dealing with, whether that is personal, mortgage or SME debt, as well as, of course, the national debt that the country is carrying.  My party has set out its own analysis and criticism of the steps that have been taken with regard to mortgage arrears and personal debt.  I genuinely hope that the measures that have been announced will work and that the mortgage arrears targets are met by the banks.  I have my doubts but I hope I am wrong.  I hope the measures work because the reality is that unless we confront that issue and engage in a genuine way with people who want a fresh start and who are facing up to their responsibilities, we will find it very difficult to get any recovery at all in the domestic economy.  </p><p> There is scope and a need for greater investment in the economy.  The Government announced in the autumn of 2011 that it would set up a strategic investment fund, which would require legislation, and that some of the remaining moneys in the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, would be invested in commercial projects in the economy.  We are still waiting for that legislation almost two years later.  We all acknowledge that unemployment is the single biggest crisis the country is facing.  In the context of the almost total collapse of the construction industry, in particular, the length of time it is taking to advance initiatives like that is unforgivable, given that they would definitely have a positive impact on the economy.  The reality is that, except for the safety valve of emigration, Ireland's unemployment rate, which is completely unacceptable as it is, would be far higher.  I urge the Minister and his colleagues in government to initiate the investment we want to see.  The capital spending programme has been butchered.  The money that is provided is not even being fully spent, as was evident last year and, indeed, so far this year.  We need to go far beyond that and do much better.</p><p> We acknowledge the absolute need to reduce our deficit.  The Minister indicated in his opening remarks that &euro;28 billion of fiscal consolidation has been put through already, equating to approximately 17% of GDP.  I know of no other country that has managed to achieve, or rather, implement fiscal consolidation on that scale.  It has come at a very high price for the people in our communities and we are seeing that on a daily basis.  We need to get to the end point of austerity budgets and, hopefully, we are nearly there.  The Minister is planning a further adjustment of &euro;5 billion but he might reduce that by up to &euro;1 billion, depending on how he uses the yield from the promissory note deal.  We must get to a point, as quickly as possible, where we are no longer implementing tax increases and spending cuts because they are hampering the recovery of the economy.  </p><p> There has been progress on the bank debt issue.  I acknowledge that the deal on the promissory note was certainly an improvement.  The extension of the loan maturities of the European Financial Stability Facility, EFSF, and European Financial Stabilisation Mechanism, EFSM, money is certainly helping our debt profile.  The next step in that area, of course, is to improve the overall stock of debt and to reduce that.  In that context, I ask the Minister to redouble his efforts during the Presidency and beyond, to get what I would regard as justice for Ireland, in terms of the European Stability Mechanism, ESM, dealing with the &euro;30 billion that was injected into the pillar banks and Permanent TSB.  In my view, it will become increasingly important for us to reduce our stock of debt, which will be 123% of GDP this year.  In reality, if the economy remains relatively static and we have growth levels of between 0% and 1% for the next few years, that debt level will be, unquestionably, unsustainable.  We need growth but in its absence we will run into serious difficulty in terms of debt levels.</p><p> Finally, I wish to refer to NAMA.  I am of the opinion that we do not pay enough attention to the work that is going on within NAMA.  It is an economic giant and has a footprint in Ireland, and beyond, which is second to none.  I genuinely believe that we need to strengthen the political oversight of the workings of NAMA.  Representatives of the agency appear before this committee and the Committee of Public Accounts occasionally but I am not sure that any politician fully understands the operations of NAMA and what it is doing on a day-to-day basis.  The Minister mentioned yesterday, in response to parliamentary questions in the House, that he has ongoing communication with NAMA.  He referred to a quarterly meeting with the agency but said that NAMA makes its decisions independently and on a commercial basis.  That is all very fine but it requires a big leap of faith to allow the agency to operate completely independently with, in my view, insufficient political oversight.  I would like to have representatives of the agency appear before this committee and the Committee of Public Accounts more often.  We should be examining NAMA's annual and interim reports in far more detail.  The oversight needs to be strengthened.  Personally, I would like to get a better handle on the decisions that NAMA is making, which have very serious consequences for the Irish economy.  </p><p> I look forward to getting into the detail of the Estimates.</p></speech>

While that is not a panacea in terms of all of the issues the Deputy raised, it will certainly provide an additional vehicle through which information can be obtained.  I now ask Deputy Boyd Barrett to make his opening remarks and then we will commence with the schedule of Votes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.132" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013052200006#E00300"><p>I thank the Minister for his opening remarks.  In terms of his assessment of the economy and where it is at, the Minister paints a relatively positive picture of the Government's success, as he would see it, in fixing the economy and preparing it for economic growth, improved employment rates and so forth.  However, I would put it to the Minister that when we look at the question of jobs, which is the priority, the balance sheet does not really look that positive.  The Government is claiming that it has delivered 92% of its commitments in the programme for Government related to the fostering employment.  With 92% of what the Government promised already delivered, in terms of various initiatives, schemes and legislation, the net impact on the chronic level of unemployment is 1%.  The unemployment rate has dropped from 15% to 14%.  That is not a success story.  Indeed, emigration probably accounts for most of that reduction.  Whatever about the arguments concerning what we have done to date, from now on we must have a much more focused plan for dealing with unemployment, to offer some hope to the hundreds of thousands of people who are without jobs.  I said in the D&aacute;il recently that I do not see why we would not have targets that are as specific for reducing unemployment as the ones the Minister and the troika have for deficit and debt reduction.  There are very specific targets set for the amount that will be taken out of the economy and how that will impact on our deficit.  Why can we not have targets which chart a course towards reducing unemployment to reasonable levels or, indeed, to as close to 0% as possible?  Should that not be a priority and a target for the Government?</p> <p>I do not see in anything that the Minister has presented the likelihood of that happening, especially because the European economy is in recession through the impact of austerity being imposed elsewhere, and that is to a considerable degree choking off our hopes of export-led growth.</p><p> The Minister says service is growing.  It has already been pointed out that the export of manufactured goods is declining and the Minister points to some improvement in the domestic economy but in reality it is very flat.  Demand is very depressed.  The Minister needs to be far more proactive in putting forward a plan to deal with mass unemployment.  I do not see anything in what he has said that gives us any hope for a substantial reduction in unemployment in the foreseeable future.  He needs to address that matter.  It comes down to investment rather than continuing to suck money out of the economy as he is committed to doing by making cuts worth a further &euro;5 billion to meet deficit targets.</p><p> Given that the Minister is committed to continuing with these cuts, where does he hope to get this &euro;5 billion?  He has just about, perhaps, managed to convince the trade union leadership to accept another &euro;250 million or &euro;300 million worth of cuts but it is pretty clear, regardless of whether he succeeds in getting that deal over the line, that he has reached the bottom of that particular barrel.  He cannot expect people to take any more.  He cannot expect people who are unemployed or those on low or middle incomes or public services to take any further cuts.  Where will that &euro;5 billion come from?  Is it not obvious that if he continues to take it from people who are already at the end of the their tether, it will do extreme damage to the economy and society?  Given the events of recent days and the revelations about Apple and other companies paying negligible levels of corporation tax, should the Minister not consider this as an alternative source of revenue for the State to pay off deficits and, more importantly, to make the investment the economy so desperately needs?  If the reports we hear are correct for just one company, albeit a very big one, making &euro;22 billion in profit in one year and paying only &euro;10 million in tax, 0.5%, one could say that if it paid only 10% tax on those profits, that would be &euro;2.2 billion of revenue.</p></speech>

I will not allow the Minister to respond to those questions because I will tie him to our programme for the afternoon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1003" speakername="Richard Boyd Barrett" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013052200007#F00300"><p>That is where the Minister should look if he is talking about raising extra taxes or wants to bridge deficit gaps or is trying to find revenue for the investment we so desperately need to create employment and kick-start economic growth.</p><p>  We should highlight the fact that we are now approaching the situation of having a primary budget surplus.  Our primary deficit is much smaller than the very large deficit which is regularly mentioned, most of which consists of interest payments on a massive debt the State has incurred as a result of the crash, and the unloading of the bank debt on the State to a point where if the Minister's growth projections and hopes do not materialise, it may be unsustainable.  This year we will pay out &euro;8 billion in interest on a debt most of which is not our citizens' debt.  Do we not have to deal with that because we are close to the point of taking in as much in tax revenue as we spend but we are still in this deficit position which requires further attacks on incomes and so on, with the likelihood of further damage to the economy because of a massive interest bill?</p><p>  I note, and the Minister noted in respect of the Estimates, that a significant sum is being paid out for consultancy advice to the Government on dealing with the banking crisis.  The sum for 2013 is estimated at &euro;6.5 million and the same for 2012.  Will the Minister name the consultants who receive that money to advise him on the banking sector?  It is a lot of money and some would say that they are not doing a very good job in dealing with some of the key concerns that citizens have about the banks.</p></speech>

I am not petty-minded about travel and subsistence but I have to ask why there is an increase of 18% pencilled into the Estimate for 2013.  I assume it is related to the EU Presidency.  Will the Minister confirm if that is the case?  He indicated in respect of salaries, wages and allowances, which account for a significant part of the outturn for last year coming in well below the Estimate, that there were savings from the Croke Park deal and that 40 administrative officers were recruited.  Will the Minister please explain what is going on behind those numbers?  Have senior people who were receiving higher salaries retired and are others coming in on lower salaries?  Is that why there is a reduction in the Estimate for remuneration in 2013?</p></speech>

Are there any more questions on these subheads?  I will take all the questions together.</p> <p>Obviously as the Department with ministerial responsibility for running the bailout programme and the budgets that underpin it, we are very prudent on expenditure.  We had significant savings in 2012 because of the very tight management of budgets.  This year we are looking for &euro;1 million more than the outturn in 2012, despite the fact that we have the Presidency.  The Deputy is right in saying that the travel and subsistence is due principally to the Presidency.  For example in subhead (ii) it was additional staff, outward focus on increasing numbers of EU meetings.  In subhead (iii) the increase is entirely due to a training budget as we increased the in-house skill base and in subhead (v) the additional provision for document management and PQ systems will lead to more efficiencies.  We had 237 parliamentary questions yesterday between oral and written.  We want to provide a very good service to Members of the House and resources are needed to do that.  Subhead (vi) covers an additional premises cost for EU and the provision of temporary staff.  In regard to the numbers involved, we brought in many people at AO level for the purpose of upskilling the Department particularly in economics and accountancy and people with tax expertise.  Many young staff have been recruited, most of whom are at graduate level with these skills.  That is in response to many requests over a number of years from Members of the House to upskill the Department in terms of professional qualification to deal with the very intricate work that is now being conducted in the Department.</p></speech>

The Estimate for 2012 overall for Vote 7 was &euro;32 million, give or take.  Some &euro;24.6 million was spent which the Minister said was due to tight management but the Estimate for 2013 is more than &euro;33 million, therefore the Estimate is going back up beyond the Estimate for 2012.  Is that Presidency related?  I do not need the minutiae of it.</p></speech>

A large amount of the overall programme expenditure which has increased is the area of financial services policy.  It is one of the biggest items for 2012 at &euro;10 million and it is to increase to &euro;14.6 million in 2013.  As that is a very large chunk of the overall Estimate, will the Minister tell the committee a little more about what this expenditure involves?</p></speech>

Will the Minister explain that, please?  It is &euro;350,000 under subhead A3 and there are four such figures of &euro;350,000.</p></speech>

This &euro;1.4 million has been distributed in four equal amounts of &euro;350,000 to each of the four strategic programmes.  We will investigate what reforms are needed across the economic sectors as well as policies relating to banking, taxation and broader financial services that may boost Ireland's economic capacity.  This work will assist in the Department's efforts to build on the Action Plan for Jobs as we seek to create the additional jobs that are required in the economy by 2016 and reduce the unemployment rate from the current unacceptably high levels.</p><p>  A project of this scale will require substantial resources.  Work to deliver this initiative will incur costs in the following areas: commissioning of high quality research and analysis from leading research institutes and consultancies; costs of seconding experts to work on specific issues under the general direction of the Department; costs associated with co-ordinating and organising a major consultancy effort to include workshops and seminars by regional and sectoral interests; and travel costs associated with visits to city regions in Europe and North America where innovative and successful economic planning initiatives are evident.  I think I spoke about this here before.</p><p>  We will exit the programme at the back-end of this year.  We have lived by the programme as have our civil servants before and since we entered Government.  Members will be aware of how the programme works where so many aspects of work have to be done against a firm timeline.  When we leave the programme we will not have that kind of discipline within our system any more.  I want to ensure that because of more loose arrangements we do not lose impetus.  We want to bring forward an economic plan to take us from 2014 to 2020 which will be quite specific in the early years where different tasks will have to be done, perhaps, against a looser deadline than the bailout programme involves.</p> <p>Anyway, in developing that economic plan there are some costs and we are building them in this year.  We have started the work on it already.</p></speech>

All the fiscal measures that require fiscal co-ordination are in place.  We will build in the fiscal targets but we will have a wider economic plan that will touch on the various sectors that will help to grow the economy.

A sum of &euro;165,000 is provided for the salary of someone who was seconded from PricewaterhouseCoopers in the financial securities risk area.

It is one of the projects.  There was another figure of &euro;1.36 million, &euro;1.190 million of which was for credit surveys on small and medium sized enterprises, which we reported on previously.  A sum of &euro;0.120 million was for work on mortgage arrears and &euro;0.050 million was for the Credit Review Office.  Index No. 207601 was in respect of outside legal services.  A further amount with index No. 207722 was for &euro;350,000 on the economic planning project, another with index No. 207608 is &euro;3.8 million for legal costs.  The total is &euro;6.875 million and that is the breakdown.</p><p>  I can give Deputy Boyd Barrett more information if he wishes.  SEPA is the singe euro payments area and the project is being implemented by Departments.  It is a contractual commitment to the Commission under the terms of the Bank of Ireland's recapitalisation programme.  This is a constituent part of the national payments plan which is the responsibility of the Department of Finance in the first instance.  We, therefore, need to budget as if we were rolling it out fully.  We will, of course, endeavour to get a good deal of help from the stakeholders on all aspects of the plan, including the budget.  That is as much as I have.</p></speech>

It is simply in line with the rate in the Department and with what the payee would have received from PwC.  One cannot get expert people in and not pay them.</p></speech>

I will see if I can get a figure for how far over the staff it would be.</p><p>  I have another note here.  EU Regulation No. 26/2012 established technical and business requirements for credit transfers and direct debits in euro and entered into force on the day following its publication in the<i> Official Journal of the European Union </i>on 30 March 2012.  The regulation specifies an update on 1 February 2014 for the migration of all credit transfers and direct debit payment to SEPA credit transfer, SCT, and SEPA direct debit, SDD, data formats.  However, as part of the approval by the European Commission in July 2010 of the restructuring plan for the Bank of Ireland a commitment was made that the State would migrate credit transfers and direct debit payments of Departments to SEPA standards by 31 March 2013.</p><p>  SEPA stands for the single euro payments area standards.  The commitment was conditional on banks and software vendors being in a position to provide the necessary solutions in time.  Neither the banks nor the software providers were in a position to fully meet the accelerated SEPA deadline.  However, we will endeavour that Departments will migrate to SEPA standards as soon as their suppliers can facilitate it.  In any event, it will be in advance of the required date of 1 February 2014.  Therefore, it does not relate to staffing costs, I am informed, but to the advertising and communications costs to ensure that people are aware of their responsibilities to move across to single euro payments area standards for payments.</p></speech>

I will refer briefly to the outputs in the meantime.  I note there is an objective in 2013 to devote at least 25% of compliance resources to target and intervene in cash and shadow economies and smuggling activities.  Has the Revenue identified the targeting of the black economy as a particular priority in the current year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.208" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="17:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI12013052200010#J01700"><p>There is the black economy but there is also the smuggling of diesel, cigarettes and other excisable items.  Obviously, Revenue is focusing on that.  The black economy always increases as the economy starts to grow, particularly in the early stages of the stabilisation of the home economy.  I suppose it is better to have people working.  We need them to work in the white economy, if I can describe it like that.  There is no great particular emphasis on it.  Revenue does this work all the time.</p><p>  I understand that Revenue reached 1 million local property tax files last night or early this morning.  The overall level must be close to 60%.  I have seen some interesting information.  I think they are doing pretty well.  As of today, 22 May 2013, over 1 million local property tax returns have been filed.  Some 70% of the returns received have been filed electronically and some 30% have involved paper returns.  Revenue is on target to reach the expected compliance level of 80% before it has to take any other measures.  When I was dealing with a question on this issue at 9.45 a.m. yesterday, it had reached a level of 57%.  Now that it has reached 1 million, one can do the maths oneself.  It is in or around 60% now.  I would think it is slightly below that level.  It is coming up to 60%.</p></speech>

Are more people coming in under the valuation guide or above it?  Is any information on the profile of the returns available yet?</p></speech>

I do not know whether any more recent information is available.  I think they are waiting until the 80% mark is reached before they run the numbers.  It was clear that most people were agreeing to pay.  The level of deferrals, which we had expected to be 15% or 16%, was coming in at less than 2%.  Files have to be returned in respect of exempt properties as well.  We will not know until we are near the end whether we will receive the return of &euro;250 million for this year and double that for next year.</p></speech>

The compliance date for electronic filing is the end of May.  Once we get into June, it will be up to Revenue to organise the next phase, which will involve looking at non-compliance.  Revenue will have to decide which of the powers available to it should be used to deal with non-compliance.  It has been very successful, in terms of compliance, so far.  I do not want to give the impression that Revenue is waving big sticks or anything like that.  It would not be fair to the people who pay if a group of people were to get away with not paying.  That is not going to happen.</p></speech>

Is it an area which the Revenue intends to target?  Is the Minister satisfied that Revenue has the resources and, perhaps more importantly, the expertise it needs to examine the complex tax avoidance structures that are already in place by these companies?  Does he have any comments in that regard?</p></speech>

A small number of companies pay large amounts of tax.  The current controversy is very unfair to the tax situation in Ireland.  Every company in Ireland which is liable to pay 12.5% on the profits they earn in Ireland is paying it.  It is a very tax compliant country.  Many of the profits made by multinational companies are not subject to Irish taxation, and if that is the case we cannot collect money from the parts of their profitability which are somebody else's responsibility.  That is from where the extraordinary figures arise. </p><p>  Apple is being talked about.  It paid 12.5% on all the profits it made in Ireland, and that is the only liability it has in Ireland.  It might pay less elsewhere.  Companies registered in the Deputy's constituency are not obliged to pay tax in Ireland because they are not registered for tax in Ireland.</p><p>  Today's<i> Financial Times</i> refers to a figure of $1.2 trillion overseas dollars from the United States which is not repatriated because the United States makes a distinction between profits generated domestically and profits generated abroad.  We are not in a position to remediate that.  Today the <i>Wall Street Journal </i>states:<blockquote>  The Apple units are registered in Ireland so US law does not consider them to be US corporations subject to US corporate tax.  But since they are managed and controlled by Apple in the US, Irish law does not consider them to be Irish companies and thus they are also not subject to the 12.5% Irish corporate tax.  This isn't alchemy, it's accountancy.</blockquote>  It supports the Irish position.  The <i>Financial Times</i> stated: <blockquote>  But the senators would do better to look closer to home.  An over complicated US tax code has allowed the principle of no double taxation to degenerate into one of double no taxation ... But to be fair, there is no evidence that Ireland struck preferential deals with Apple ... Much of the avoidance cited is routinely used by US multinationals thanks to a tax code which invites this through differing treatment of foreign and domestic earnings.  At the last count US companies held $1.7 trillion in remission profits.  Rather than bash companies in foreign countries, the Apple example should encourage Congress to move on corporate tax reform. </blockquote>Any of us who have jobs in our constituencies in companies like Apple, which employs about 4,000 people in Cork, should remember about 100,000 people are employed in US multinationals in Ireland.  We would want to be very careful that we do not join in this clack of criticism when the Irish taxation system is totally transparent. </p><p>  The rate of 12.5% applies to all profits from multinational companies in Ireland.  There are no arrangements made between Revenue and multinationals operating in Ireland.  Irish tax is not a matter of administrative arrangement, as are tax systems in some other European countries.  Irish tax is governed by law passed here and in the Seanad.  The Revenue Commissioners must abide by that law and must apply the law fairly and evenly, and does so.</p></speech>

I find the explanation on ASI extraordinary.  A company that made &euro;22 billion in profit in one year and which is registered in this country only paid &euro;10 million, or 0.5%, in tax.  The Minister claimed it can do that because it is nothing to do with him, and it is paying tax on its business in Ireland and everything is fine and dandy.  That is unacceptable and ludicrous.</p> <p>This is a company, which as a result of us facilitating it, is getting away with paying virtually no tax at all.  As the Minister rightly says, it has big operations here.  How, therefore, is it getting away with paying so little tax if it is registered here?  The Minister says this is just an accountancy procedure and not alchemy.  However, it is difficult to tell the difference between these two things because what the company is managing to do to avoid paying tax is bordering on magic.  The Minister seems to be advising that we should not look into this because it might endanger jobs.</p></speech>

I advise the Deputy to be careful.  He does not understand this and he is displaying the fact that he does not understand it.

The Minister has his position and it is slightly condescending to suggest that I do not understand.  The problem is that this issue lacks transparency and there is a deep reluctance to have a serious debate.  Instead we are warned by the Minister that jobs will be endangered if we dare to even look at this issue.  I refer to statements from people around the world who are not of the radical left persuasion such as in the United States and Britain.  For example, Chatham House is saying that Ireland is a tax haven and that we are facilitating a situation where multinational companies making extraordinary levels of profits are managing to avoid paying any serious amount of tax.</p></speech>

I do not wish us to have an argument about it but I will explain the 2% rate.  This is international tax planning which works on the basis of people looking at two different tax jurisdictions and finding a gap in which they can take an advantage.  It is not to do with the Irish tax code which is completely transparent.  On profits generated in Ireland and on profits liable to tax in Ireland, the 12.5% rate applies universally.  The central point established by the sub-committee is that the principal Apple companies concerned which are registered in Cork are neither tax-resident in the US nor tax-resident in Ireland.  Maybe there was a magician but the magician was not living down in Cork.</p><p>  Because they are not tax-resident in Ireland they are not liable to Irish tax.  They are not liable to Irish tax - neither under Irish law nor international law.  They are not resident in Ireland because they are not managed and controlled here.  They are not resident in the US because they were not incorporated or organised there.  Notwithstanding this, the central point is that the committee proceeded to speak of an Irish special tax rate of 2% or less, as if the companies concerned were, in fact, Irish tax-resident, which they are not.  The 2% and lower rates which were claimed are got by dividing the tax charged on branches in Ireland by the entire profit of the companies concerned.</p></speech>

They are not liable for Irish tax.  We did not control that.  Our law applies to tax-resident companies at a rate of 12.5%.  If one divides Apple's world-wide profits, the amounts of tax paid legitimately on its profits in Ireland is 2%, but we cannot tax its world-wide profits; we can only tax the profits which are in Ireland, which are tax-resident in Ireland.  That is where the 2% comes from.  That is why I say the Deputy does not understand it.</p></speech>

The Revenue did not do any deals.  We will work internationally through the OECD and with any other international body.  I actually sent a letter to Commissioner Semeta who is in charge of tax and we then wrote jointly to every colleague in the European Union.  We agreed there were six areas of tax avoidance that had to be addressed during the Irish Presidency.  We have achieved four of them over the line already.  We are a transparent tax-compliant country.  The OECD has stated this.  All international informed opinion knows this.  The<i> Financial Times</i> and <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> have said so in their respective editorials today.  I do not wish to be the whipping-boy for some misunderstanding in a hearing in the US Congress.  That is my only point.  The US Congress can do its business as best it may and they are very good at it but we do not want to be the whipping-boy for misunderstandings.

I will desist from using the term, "uninformed speculation".  People in employment in this country are very concerned about the current debate and speculation is not positive.  This committee has taken on the task of examining this issue.  I ask that members ask questions rather than making value judgments so that we have the information before determinations are made.</p><p>  I have one matter which I wish to bring to the attention of the Minister.  I wrote to the Minister last December and I received a response at the end of March.  One of the difficulties with the Estimates process is that we are operating on a projected and speculative basis.  This is certainly the case with regard to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  We must ensure that the projections and targets are available online on a quarterly basis so that we do not end up with balloon payments in quarter four and the type of savings that cause difficulties.  The Minister's Department operates on a different basis in that it makes predictions but if those predictions are out of kilter, expenditure difficulties arise.  In that regard I ask if the Minister could give the committee an overview of current taxation revenue.  Are the VAT returns and other returns on target?  Given that the budget will be announced in October and there has always been a distortion of the VAT returns in the December market because the budget has an impact on consumer sentiment over Christmas, is there a potential for better VAT returns in the final quarter of this year?</p></speech>

The revenues up to the end of April are up &euro;145 million, 1.3%, year on year.  They are broadly on profile.  They are &euro;7 million below the budget estimates on the basis of the monthly profiles.</p> <p>There are variations within those figures.  The year-on-year growth was anticipated because a number of once-off considerations arose in the early months of 2012.  The PRSI-income tax reclassification, which we dealt with previously, inflated income tax last year by more than &euro;200 million.  There was a delayed payment of &euro;251 million in corporation tax receipts from December 2011 into January 2012.  The once-off nature of some large capital gains tax payments received in February 2012 also inflated the figures for last year.  This explains the fairly small increase in 2013 over 2012.</p><p> On the expenditure side, net Voted expenditure for the end of April 2013 was &euro;13.969 million.  This represents a year-on-year decrease of &euro;1.42 million, or 7.6%, and was some &euro;262 million better than last year.  The four largest Departments recorded year-on-year decreases.</p><p> On taxation, the April returns show that VAT was slightly behind, but overall tax is in line with profile.  My officials have given me a note which shows there is some shortfall in excise, which seems to be a shortfall across the heads.</p></speech>

It is too early to tell.  In bringing in a budget, we do the Estimate for the full year and thereafter compile monthly profiles.  We are talking large numbers here.  Some months are VAT months while other months are not.  This means the figures are uneven across the months.  A slight error on profiling might explain some of it.</p></speech>

We will see what happens over the summer.  VAT is overall in line with profile, but there are different elements to that.  I do not want to speculate too much about it.  The difficulty in having an early budget is more to do with the income tax returns of the self-employed.  They come in during November and if we have to do the budget in October, we will be guesstimating those returns.  I will probably have to bring the filing date forward, but I cannot do so until the second October budget, not this one.  We will have to announce the bringing forward of the filing date in the budget this coming October.  As to whether we can bring forward the filing date and not also bring forward the payment date, I will have to get agreement with Revenue on that.</p><p>  Generally speaking, we will have a fairly good idea by mid-October where this is going.  It would be possible to put some type of adjustor in when we get the December figures, perhaps some tolerance on what we will do with excise or something like that.  That would be for one year only until we reschedule the filing.  I do not see it as a major problem.  It is something we can manage.</p></speech>

If the latter, I assume this might have a positive impact on revenue in 2013 from the State's point of view.</p></speech>

It states that our purpose is to help the Taoiseach and the Government to resolve the current economic crisis, implement the programme for Government and to build a fairer society and a better future for Ireland and all her citizens.  As civil servants, we are committed to providing an excellent service for the Government and the other institutions of State &ndash; which of course includes the Oireachtas &ndash; as well as for the public as citizens and users of public services.  We do that work based on the principles of integrity, impartiality, effectiveness, equity and accountability.</p><p>  The Department&rsquo;s strategy statement, with the Taoiseach&rsquo;s approval, sets out eight priorities for the period to 2014.  These are headed by the most important, namely, jobs and economic growth, and also include: Europe; the programme for Government; service, which is intended to capture the various services provided by the Department to the Taoiseach, the Government and the public in general; reform; trust; fairness; and peace, which would refer mainly to Northern Ireland matters.  It also sets out a number of horizontal themes, including developing our internal capacity and skills, a stronger focus on implementation, a greater emphasis on strategic thinking and forward planning, and changing the culture and rebuilding trust.</p><p>  The strategy statement also emphasises that the Department's role requires strong working relationships with other Departments and agencies, and with stakeholders outside the public service.  The annual report, which was approved by the Government yesterday and published, highlights the core activities of the Department during 2012.  It emphasises the work of the Cabinet committee system, which is central to our role, reflecting the Government's commitment that the Department act as a Cabinet office.  The annual report also gives an overview of developments in each of the eight strategic priority areas.  This includes the exceptional responsibilities associated with Ireland&rsquo;s current Presidency of the European Union, which continues to be a key area of work within the Department.  Whereas there is much important work to be completed, it is fair to say that Ireland is viewed as running a very effective Presidency so far.</p><p>  Of course, notwithstanding the wide range of work undertaken by the Department and across the Government, there are strategic priorities where we are not happy with the current position.  We should never be happy if there can be improvements, and creating jobs and economic growth is the most important issue and we remain most concerned about it.  Tackling the unemployment crisis is our first priority and it remains our biggest challenge.  Unfortunately, given the unprecedented scale of the economic crisis, there is much work to be done on this and on other fronts.</p><p>  I know one aspect of the Department&rsquo;s work that is of interest to the committee is the IFSC Clearing House Group.  I chair the Clearing House Group, which meets four of five times a year, and I have provided a briefing note on the work of the group and on the importance of the international financial services industry to Ireland.  As chair, I have sought to emphasise a number of issues, including: the protection and creation of jobs through the implementation of the Government&rsquo;s strategy for the industry published in 2011, if I remember correctly; transparency, notably through the publication of the minutes of the group for the first time since its establishment in 1987, as well as the publication of my diary; and the need for credible, responsible, proportionate and independent regulation, which is a very important part of how the industry must operate.  I can elaborate on any of these issues for the members of the committee.</p><p>  The strategy statement and annual report outline a significant amount of work undertaken across a very wide range of responsibilities by what is a relatively small organisation with fewer than 200 people by the end of the year.  I would like to take this opportunity to thank all of the staff of the Department for all of the work and I am happy to take questions from the committee.</p></speech>

My questions will be divided into two sections.  I have a few questions on the annual report and some on the strategy statement.  Page 5 of the annual report deals with core functions so will Mr. Fraser indicate how supporting the Government and secretariat has changed in the core functions since the new Government took office and how is it different from long-standing core functions?  What fundamental changes are there in the Department as listed by the core functions for 2012?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.283" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013052200003#D00700"><p>That is fine.  There are a number of Cabinet committees, including those dealing with economic management, economic recovery, economic infrastructure, European affairs, health, mortgage arrears, public sector reform, social policy, climate change, Irish and the Gaeltacht, and children's rights.  Does the Taoiseach attend all of those or who chairs such committees?  Will Mr. Fraser provide a flavour of how those committees work and how often they meet?  Does that occur on a quarterly basis?  Who attends the meetings and what officials are there in addition to Ministers?  Who chairs the meetings if the Taoiseach is absent?  Do they involve line Ministers?  I presume Ministers would chair meetings on those topics in their own line Departments in any event.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.284" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013052200003#D00800"><p>The Deputy mentioned core functions and changes since the new Government took office.  Most of the core functions are unaltered because our core function is to provide a private office and protocol service to Cabinet secretariat, as well as maintaining relations with &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  This is the work of institutions of State, taking in the Oireachtas and Whip's Office.  They are the same under all governments and they are effectively described as constitutional functions.  That may be the best approximation of what they are.</p><p>  Every time the Government or Taoiseach changes, there are different emphases and sometimes there are big changes.</p> <p>If the Deputy looks at the list on page 5, the first three are standing functions which we will always have.  The office of the T&aacute;naiste is a small office with two or three staff from within our existing resources.  It is in the Taoiseach's Department.  Previously it was an office of the T&aacute;naiste which was separate.  This is a very small office.  The T&aacute;naiste's special advisers are also physically located in Government Buildings, although they assign somebody to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The Government Press Office has always been part of our duties.</p><p> The next point is all the Taoiseach's duties, and we help him.  Those duties are as they always were, except that the European Council load is much bigger now because the Department of the Taoiseach has full responsibility for EU affairs.  The EU division of the Government is now in our Department rather than the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  That brings with it an enhanced capacity to support a Taoiseach of the day at the European Council and also a wider range of responsibilities at lower levels of administration and general co-ordination of EU matters.</p><p> Each Government sets up its own Cabinet committees and each Government chooses its own topics and way of doing business, but the secretariat's work or the toolkit  is the same.</p><p> The programme for Government office is a new initiative.  Again, that is a small group of two or three people who are charged with monitoring implementation of the programme for Government.  They brief the Taoiseach and talk to Departments to try to get things done and iron out any problems.  They also help to draft the annual reports.  The Government has published two such reports during this Administration.</p><p> The next point, briefing advice for the Taoiseach, is obviously part of our core functions.  The next point is the Constitutional Convention which was established by the Government under our Department.  We were very much involved in setting that up.  A couple of staff from our Department have been transferred to it.  It is an independent organisation chaired by Tom Arnold.  In fact, one of the staff from the Oireachtas is there as well.  There are three or four staff, which is a small number, but it is a quite effective body.</p><p> With regard to the reference to the abolition of the Seanad, during this Administration the Department has been responsible for the fiscal treaty referendum and it is now responsible for the Seanad referendum.  It comes under our overall responsibility as a Department, as opposed to the wider Government.</p><p> The EU function has changed as I outlined.  It is bigger and we are more centrally involved in all aspects of EU policy.</p><p> The last point is corporate affairs, which is a standard service that all Departments have.  There have been some additions and some subtractions.  The big change was that public service reform was transferred in its entirety to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  While we have some involvement in most aspects of Government, we are not as directly involved in the public service reform agenda or in the industrial relations agenda as we would have been in the past.  Obviously we work with our colleagues in the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, but they have the main responsibility there.  That has taken a great deal of work out of the Department and over 20 people left on foot of that change.  Social partnership, as it was known, is no longer done in the way it was previously.  That is also a big change.</p><p> That is a summary of the changes.</p></speech>

I cannot remember any occasion in this Administration when the Taoiseach did not chair them.  We have evolved to a situation where we try to hold them all consecutively on one or two days if possible, just to help manage his time.  As the names suggest, they deal with various areas which are cross-departmental where the Taoiseach has a particular interest.  It might be a standing issue such as European affairs, it might be something in which we are trying to carry out serious reforms, such as health, or it might be a topic that we wish to put a focus on, such as mortgage arrears.  The management council has the standing of a Cabinet committee as well.  This is all on the record of the House and the Taoiseach answers questions about them.  The Taoiseach chairs them and they are attended by relevant Ministers, who are appointed to the committees by the Government, and by officials.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.288" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1100" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013052200004#E00400"><p>My last question on the strategy statement for 2011 to 2014 relates to page 21, which refers to the programme for Government commitments for the Department of the Taoiseach.  If there is no time to answer the question today, the witness might send a note to the committee.  Page 21 refers to a plan to reduce the number of committees.  I presume that is a reference to Oireachtas committees.  Is the witness aware that the Houses of the Oireachtas (Inquiries, Privilege and Procedures) Bill, which will be debated on Second Stage this afternoon in the House, provides for at least four or five new Oireachtas committees?  How does that gel with reducing the number of committees?</p><p>  Second, there is a reference to the role of the Ceann Comhairle in deciding whether a Minister has failed to provide reasonable information in response to a question.  What is the current position on achieving that objective?  What is the position with legislation on Cabinet confidentiality?  The programme refers to having a committee week once in every four weeks in the D&aacute;il to deal with committee activity.  There is also reference to regulatory impact assessments for EU directives.  Is that happening in all cases?</p><p>  Finally, the programme refers to rationalising the regulators.  Only last week we were establishing a new regulator for the national lottery, which was not necessary until now.  How many new regulators have been established since the Government took office, notwithstanding the commitment to rationalise the number of regulators?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.289" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Fraser" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013052200004#E00500"><p>A number of the points the Deputy raises relate to the Chief Whip's office.  If I may be delicate about it, they are political matters and they will be dealt with in that way.  I have a briefing note but I can revert to the Deputy with the details.  The number of committees reduced from 25 to 16 when the new committees were established.  Members of the Oireachtas will know more about developments since then than I do.  The other Bill is before the House and there are often suggestions for new committees, but I can only set out the facts as I understand them.  That is mainly dealt with through the Chief Whip's office and the political system.</p><p>  I understand the Ceann Comhairle's role was dealt with under Standing Orders in July 2011.  Again, I am using a briefing note on this.  I do not have the same knowledge of the House that Members have.</p><p>  With regard to the rationalisation of the number of regulators, the Department has done some work on regulation.  We have been involved in a consultation for a report on regulation and how it might operate in the country.  I believe the report is out for consultation at present and might even be nearly complete.  It has been publicised.  The idea is that there would be a Government statement on regulation.  That is our contribution.  From time to time policy initiatives come about or changes are made which require more regulators.  These decisions are made by the Government in each case.  It is not that we have a type of <i>fatwa</i> or an ability to stop new regulators being created, it is just a policy matter for the Government.</p></speech>

The witness said European Affairs is under the Department of the Taoiseach now.  Perhaps he will be able to send the committee a progress report on the number of directives that have been issued in the last two years and how many RIAs were prepared in respect of those and how many were not.  The witness might not have that information with him but he can forward it to the committee.</p></speech>

While I mentioned some of the administrative work of the EU division, a great deal of that is liaising with EU scrutiny committees and ensuring material is given to the Oireachtas.  However, I will have to check the detail for the Deputy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.292" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/990" speakername="Ciar&aacute;n Lynch" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013052200004#E00800"><p>I concur with Deputy Fleming's comments on the committees.  It was an error at the start of the Administration to configure the committees in the way chosen.  Prior to chairing this committee I chaired the environment committee which, in its initial manifestation, had transport, arts, sport and tourism under its remit.  It was dealing with three Ministers and six Ministers of State at the same time.  That leads to a very congested situation, particularly with the type of very welcome reforms that are now taking place in committee procedure, such as pre-legislative scrutiny.  The workload of committees has increased as part of the reform agenda, but the over-compressing of multiple portfolios into single committees was an error.  The error was adjusted because transport was removed from the environment committee six or seven months later.  We need to be mindful that reform and reduction are not necessarily the same thing.  Sometimes we reduce things to a level that leads to slowing down the programme of reform.</p></speech>

Where does the setting up of the expert group to report to the Government on the X case legislation fall into it?  I do not see it in the strategy statement or the annual report, yet the Government decided to follow a certain course in late 2012 on the recommendation of the expert group.  I thought that came within the remit of the Department of the Taoiseach because the Taoiseach has a close interest in the deliberations.  However, it does not appear anywhere in the strategy statement or the annual report.</p></speech>

In the case of the Department of Social Protection or the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, there is another set of commitments.

It is useful to ask questions, particularly on economic matters.  I refer to how Ministers present figures.  Questions have been raised about this matter.  We have questions about the accuracy of the figures and whether they present the whole picture.  It is important that the Government does so.  </p><p>  With regard to the recent announcements on the targets for job creation and growth, there was an announcement of 12,800 net full-time jobs lost, but the good news was that they had been replaced with 14,000 jobs.  However, they were part-time jobs.  Many of the people concerned are on the live register as they are working fewer than three days a week.  Perhaps that issue might be addressed.  The officials working with the Taoiseach and other Ministers present the figures and it is important that they are presented accurately.  Some of the 14,000 people concerned will be working for a fraction of the pay of the workers who lost jobs are included in the figure of 12,800 net full-time lost.</p><p>  The second question concerns priority H and helping to maintain and build the peace process and build new relationships on this island and the island of England, Scotland and Wales in pursuit of implementation of all aspects of the St. Andrews Agreement.  As part of the agreement, a stimulus package was announced and Britain gave a commitment to implement it.  How many times has the Taoiseach raised the issue with British officials or Ministers?</p></speech>

The one I look at is the number on the live register, which is over 400,000 people.  This is way too high and there are people behind the statistics.  I would not argue with anyone saying there are major problems for people without jobs.  People can quote statistics in all sorts of ways, but that is the central fact.</p></speech>

However, we should not create an illusion.  There is a big difference between part-time and full-time jobs because a part-time job may involve working eight hours a week.  In the interests of accuracy, we should deal with the reality.  We cannot fool people into thinking these are like for like jobs when they are not.  We should present figures accurately and state the number of part-time jobs created.</p></speech>

There is nothing about the jobs data that is in any way encouraging.  There are some improvements, but it is a major problem.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about the stimulus package under the St. Andrews Agreement.  We talk to the British Government all the time about these matters.  Unfortunately, owing to our crisis, the contribution from the South has had to be scaled back, particularly for the road to the north west.  I hope the project will go ahead and that we still have some money on the table.  The latest development is that the British Government has been talking to the Northern Ireland Executive in Belfast which has primary responsibility for dealing with British Government.  The British Government has been talking to the Northern Ireland Executive about various incentives and economic packages it can use to help the Northern Ireland economy.  We encourage this and any help at British or European level.  The Government secured the next PEACE programme for Northern Ireland because we fought very hard in Brussels last year.  We talk to the British Government all the time and have a huge interest in ensuring Northern Ireland is prosperous and that the Northern Ireland Executive gets whatever help it can get.  It has its own responsibilities and must carry them out.  It is an ongoing conversation.  The British Government must make its own decisions on its economic circumstances.</p></speech>

It is important that we emphasise and press the point to ensure there is full implementation.</p><p>  With regard to the Clearing House Group, there is a target of 10,000 net new jobs in the financial services sector mentioned in the briefing document we received.  Paragraph 10 refers to Capita doubling its workforce by 800.  Will Mr. Fraser confirm that most, if not all, of the jobs will be replacement jobs for the IBRC workers?  Will former IBRC workers be employed?  There was major concern about the position of the workers when Anglo Irish Bank was wound down which occurred through no fault of their own.  Are most of them former Anglo Irish Bank workers?  If they are former Anglo Irish Bank workers moving to a new company, their conditions of employment will not be guaranteed.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I was not aware of the background to the Capita announcement which I read in the newspapers.  I saw reports that the jobs would go to former IBRC workers.  Staff in the banks are losing their jobs.  Therefore, to the extent that we can create employment in the financial services centre to enable the people concerned to find new work, it is good.  On the specific point made, it is not something I know anything about.</p></speech>

I would say it is probably pretty flat and that there have been some gains, which have been mentioned, and there have been some losses.  My sense is it is pretty flat.  I do not think that is actually a bad performance by the sector given the scale of the carnage internationally and the problems in our own economy but I would say it is flat and certainly much of the work we are doing is to try to get new jobs and find new ways to create jobs in this sector and in other sectors.  I do not have a precise number but I will try to get it for the Deputy.  My sense of it would be that it is flat.</p></speech>

That has added to the transparency.  I also called for a number of other measures, including provision of documentation, list of attendees and presentations at sub-groups, as that is where the real business occurs.  I will return to that later.</p><p>  I will concentrate on the Clearing House Group because it has been of interest to me since becoming a Member of the House.  We are all aware of the discussions taking place about multinationals and their tax strategies in Ireland.  It appears that the proposals which come forward from the industry through the clearing house group are largely adopted in the Finance Bill.  Mr. Harry McGee wrote last October that 21 measures were adopted in the Finance Bill 2012.  How many proposals were put forward by this group?  Was it just the 21 or were there more proposals which were rejected?  I know the 21 proposals which were accepted were not accepted in their totality and some were adapted but, by and large, the 21 proposals were accepted and included in the Finance Bill.  How many proposals did the Clearing House Group propose?</p></speech>

The Clearing House Group did not propose or adopt any measures <i>per se</i>.  The group I chair, for which the Deputy has the minutes, discusses these things.  They are mainly dealt with bilaterally with the Department of Finance, as are all other pre-budget submissions from all sectors.  The financial services members certainly would have been talking to the Department of Finance.  One can see from the minutes of the Clearing House Group that there was some conversation but it is not that we adopt or do not adopt proposals.  They go to the Department of Finance and they are dealt with by it.</p></speech>

I understand the point the Deputy raised.  If he looks at the minutes, he will see that after the Finance Bill is published, or enacted, the Department of Finance goes through the various measures that have been adopted.  The bulk of them are adopted, although not all of them.  The Department of Finance will oppose some of them and will adjust others.  The Minister for Finance, the Department of Finance and the Government have to decide what goes into the Finance Bill.</p><p>  This is a very competitive international industry and regulation is always changing.  Countries change their regulations all the time.  I do not have a number for the Deputy but it is not correct to imagine that proposals come to the clearing house group, we tick the boxes and give them to the Department of Finance which implements them.  That is not the process.  The Department of Finance deals with these things, as it does with all other proposals for tax changes.</p></speech>

Not every group would meet at such a high level of Government.  When one goes through the minutes, one sees, by and large, that what is discussed works its way into the Finance Bill.  That does not really happen anywhere else.  That is why I have a concern.  It seems there is a very high level access.</p><p>  This committee discussed the financial transaction tax at approximately three meetings.  If one looks at the minutes, there were approximately 13 meetings between October 2011 and May 2012 on the same subject with the group and the sub-groups.  By and large, the Department's position was that of the Clearing House Group.  I questioned the ESRI report which supports it.  If one goes back over the questions I asked on the ESRI, it does not stand up.  People were using the ESRI report as justification.  </p><p>  Was there more information at those 13 meetings which strengthened the case that there should not be a financial transaction tax?  I am open to persuasion on whether it is a good or a bad thing but when one sees there were 13 meetings between October 2011 and May 2012, one can see the concern I have as a Member of Parliament.</p></speech>

There is no denying that there is a very high level of access.  The group has been in place since 1987 and it has, by and large, been very successful.  Successive Governments have agreed with the group's existence and Governments, including this Government, have had strategies for developing this sector which includes this Clearing House Group which I chair <i>ex officio</i>.  I also chair the National Economic and Social Council which gets less coverage.</p></speech>

It members are drawn from the community and voluntary pillar, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other areas.  I probably spend more time at those meetings than at meetings of the Clearing House Group.  As civil servants, we do whatever work we are asked to do.</p><p>  In terms of the financial transaction tax, there is no doubt that the Irish financial services industry does not want one, nor do I think any financial services industry wants one.  The real issue for Ireland is that if there was not one, in particular in London or any other place with which we have to compete, then there is a very great likelihood we would lose many important jobs in Dublin and other areas to London.</p></speech>

The meetings are attended by, among others, representatives from the Department of Finance and the main engagement on these matters is with that Department.  It is quite possible that there are officials from the Taoiseach's office who write notes.  In fact, I am sure there are.  If they go to meetings, they should take notes.

In the context of my original concerns about minutes, documentation and presentations and taking on board the remarks of people like Mr. Michael Somers and Mr. John Bruton concerning heavy financial regulations and their effect, I ask Mr. Fraser to comment on item No. 4 on the agenda of the meeting of the Central Bank industry subgroup on 27 November 2012, where industry made a presentation on enforcement.  We got into trouble here because of a lack of regulation and for that reason, transparency is very important.  That is why I wanted to see such presentations being published, particularly if they have the potential to influence regulation.  We all know the problems that a lack of regulation caused.  While the need to publish the minutes has been accepted today, we really need a lot more than that.  We also need to see the associated documentation and presentations from those meetings.  Transparency is vital so that it is clear that regulatory or taxation policy is not being overly influenced by any particular sector.  I ask Mr. Fraser to ensure that this committee is provided with the presentations from the meeting that took place on 27 November, 2012.  The issue is out there in the ether, with Mr. Michael Somers and Mr. John Bruton addressing it, of late.  It appears that a number of industrial heavy weights attended the January meeting.  Can this information be supplied to the committee?</p></speech>

I did not chair it.  It is very important for the country, given what has happened to our economy, that everybody does his or her job properly and appropriately.  The last thing this country needs is the Department of the Taoiseach taking some sort of over-arching role in regard to taxation policy, regulation or other areas.  I wish to stress to the committee that it is entirely normal for any industry to liaise with line Departments.  The agrifood industry does it in the context of Food Harvest 2020, the financial services industry liaises with the Department of Finance and other industries do so with other Departments.  It is entirely normal.  I must be clear about the fact that the Department of Finance must be in charge of budgetary and taxation policy.  It is that Department which deals with the industry.  It is even more important to stress that the regulator must be independent, given what happened in the past.  The regulator must be independent.  I do not speak to the regulator about the IFSC.  I do not encourage the industry to pressurise the regulator at the Clearing House Group.  Item No. 4 on the set of minutes to which Deputy Humphreys refers is related to a meeting between the Central Bank and the industry.  The Department of the Taoiseach was not represented at that meeting and that is entirely appropriate.  Indeed, it is actually very important.</p><p>  The regulator has set out what he referred to as his prism or his approach to regulation and his strategy statement.  He engages with the industry, as all regulators do with all relevant industries.  We do not get involved in that process.  That is a bilateral engagement between the industry and the Central Bank.  Therefore, the reference in the minutes is precisely that.  I did not chair that meeting.  Indeed, I would not chair it.</p></speech>

The subgroup is part of the Clearing House Group.  That is what I am saying.  That is why we need to see the detail of the presentations and the documentation.  If we are to have some form of oversight, we need to see what the subgroup is submitting to the Central Bank.  It is a subgroup of the IFSC Clearing House Group.</p></speech>

In a similar way in this instance the Office of the Taoiseach is making an appointment without having in place a mechanism for the person to report back to the Office of the Taoiseach.

The Clearing House Group comprises representatives from the public sector and the private sector.  The private sector people are appointed by FSI, which is essentially the industry part of IBEC and a number of chairs of groups, such as the chief executive of the stock exchange, who by tradition have been on it.  The phrase "co-ordinator" is not an appointment but just that the secretariat to the Clearing House Group deals with who is on the group.  The private sector effectively come up with their own people and we come up with ours.</p></speech>

This is an unprecedented structured access by the biggest hitters in the financial markets system in the Europe to the highest levels of the Government, chaired by the Irish Prime Minister.  Deputy Boyd Barrett in particular and I have raised this directly with the Taoiseach on many occasions in the past two years - the people who have this unprecedented inner corridor to the very heart power in this State, include representatives from Allied Irish Banks, Bank of Ireland, Citigroup, Zurich, IBEC, PricewaterhouseCoopers and so on.  In the briefing material the Department has provided, the point is made that membership of the Clearing House Group includes senior public sector and industry representatives.  There are a number of specialised working groups in the areas of banking and treasury, insurance, pension funds, asset management.  These are chaired by industry representatives who also sit on the Clearing House Group for the duration of their tenure as Chairs of the particular groups.  </p><p>  Let me put it to Mr. Fraser that this is the kind of inside track that lobbyists in other industries could only hallucinate about.  This is corporate government as far as the financial service, the big banks and the major financial institutions.  The irony is that the very forces whose activities crashed the financial system five years ago as a result of their unbridled speculation and profiteering are now being given the responsibility for clearing up the mess, sitting in the lap of the Government or <i>vice versa .  </i>Mr. Fraser cannot say anything other than these private institutions have unprecedented influence on Government policy. </p><p>  I am asking Mr. Fraser making a note of one or two of these points because I have limited time and he can reply to them in sequence. </p><p>  The minutes provide no transparency in any sense.  It is slightly helpful to know what was discussed but it really does not tell the full story is in any sense, the issue is the access and the immediate availability at the very heart of Government by these massively powerful industry players in the financial market system, which I contend in reality is a dictatorship over the European Union.</p><p>  At the January meeting of the IFSC Clearing House Group, the issue of REITs, real estate investment trusts was raised, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and Public Expenditure went so far as to suggest that to parallel the IFSC, they might establish a real estate services group type of set up along the same lines.  What discussions are going on in regard to this?  The suggestion of a global centre of excellence for property - and a company was mentioned, Annaly Capital, a United States real estate speculator - coming in and being a major player in this country.  I have seen a suggestion elsewhere that this is an excellent time to come into the &quot;Irish market&quot;, and similar to NAMA, take over properties at a haircut price which was subsidised by the taxpayer and now there is a proposal that these people come in and buy up property at the lowest rate and make a massive killing when the property appreciates at the expense of the people.  Is it proposed that companies can buy mortgage portfolios in this country, which would be an issue of great concern to ordinary people?</p></speech>

As he rightly stated I am a public servant so I must do my work with integrity.  I have published the minutes in a bid to help.  I do my best in that regard.  I am very aware of the history of what has gone on which is the reason I am very strong on the point of  independent regulation.  </p><p>  On the specific issue of property raised by the Deputy, this suggestion was made and got a brief mention in the minutes under any other business.  I am not aware of any developments in that but the Departments of Finance and Public Expenditure and Reform considered it and I think there was something in the Finance Bill about REITs, however I must confess that I am not <i>au fait </i>with the detail.<i></i>The Clearing House Group has not done anything to advance that since it was mentioned at that meeting.</p></speech>

Does Mr. Fraser accept if there is to be real transparency, he would have to have the submissions and representations made by the financial industry players on this group in regard to critical issues like financial transaction tax and other issues that they would see as impacting on their profits?</p></speech>

Deputy Kevin Humphreys asked me about some sub-groups and I will certainly check that out.</p> <p>The vast bulk of the material about which the Deputy is talking goes to the Department of Finance because it is part of the budget and finance Bill process.  I will come back to the committee to see whether I can help on some of these matters.  The more transparency there is about them the better.  I have been transparent in what I can be transparent about.</p></speech>

There is a huge disequilibrium.  In his opening statement he cites the passing of the property tax legislation as one of the Department's achievements.  It is mentioned in one of the Department's documents on the implementation of the programme for Government.  Mr. Fraser has also said the Department is committed to building "a fairer society".  That is one of its key issues.  The property tax is causing huge grief for hundreds of thousands of households that have already been massively hit and simply cannot afford it.  If they pay it, it will impose a massive burden on them.  I will not, however, get into the ongoing battle against it.  It has been introduced as a direct result of the crash of financial services that led to the crash in the real economy.  The people are paying for this, but the players who were centrally involved in causing the crash have unprecedented access to the Government.  The taxpayer has no such access.  As a public servant, does Mr. Fraser agree that this is an unfair disequilibrium in a supposedly democratic society?</p></speech>

For many years the Clearing House Group has been very successful in creating jobs.  I now chair it and do my best to work on the issue of job creation, to have as much transparency as possible and to ensure the regulator is allowed to do his job appropriately.  </p><p>  The Deputy referred to the property tax.  We try to carry out Government policy as effectively as we can.  It is not the case that we regard something as an achievement, or do not regard it as such.  We carry out Government policy as faithfully as we can.  Obviously, a property tax is being pursued as a matter of policy.  Fairness is very important and is in our strategy statement.  We could have a strategy statement that did not contain it.  The country is in a very difficult position and it is important that we have fairness in our strategy statement.  We can look to it as something that is written down when we are doing our jobs.  We just have to implement the policy as best we can.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.386" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1095" speakername="Liam Twomey" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2013052200009#K00400"><p>For the sake of balance, Mr. Fraser might also discuss what the social policy group does.  As he said, the Clearing House Group is the subject of a great deal of public discussion.  Perhaps he might say a few words on the social policy group which is the other group he chairs.  It would be of interest to the committee.</p><p>  We have seen a significant attack on Ireland Inc. in the past couple of weeks.  I refer to what happened at a Westminster committee with reference to Google and what happened at a US Senate committee hearing with reference to Apple.  The impression is being created that Ireland is some sort of tax haven for large multinational corporations.  Some people in the United States and the United Kingdom are trying to say large corporations such as Google and Apple are working through Ireland to defraud the taxpayer in these countries of massive amounts of tax.  It is important that Mr. Fraser give the committee some response or make some points in that regard.  It seems that Google paid just &euro;3 million in corporation tax in Ireland.  It has been suggested that if it was paying corporation tax on what some regard as its profits, it would have to pay more than &euro;1 billion.</p><p>  I will explain what has actually happened.  This should be the course of the discussion at US Senate and Westminster committees.  Many countries have bilateral tax agreements with each other.  There are bilateral agreements between the United Kingdom, the United States, Ireland and a host of other countries across the world.  Those concerned about what is going on in Google or Apple do not mention these agreements which relate purely to what we do in Ireland.  There is a need for Mr. Fraser to make a statement in that regard.  We are being seen as the bad boys with regard to corporation tax, but that is not true.  Many of the issues involved relate to the bilateral tax agreements all countries have with each other.  If we had an opportunity to drill into this issue - I will not do so now - we would see that some of the historical approaches to taxes in the United States, for instance, have contributed to the situation where multinationals are seen as avoiding what is considered by some to be their fair share.  I would like Mr. Fraser to comment on this.  This is the place for such a comment to be made because this committee deals with these issues.</p><p>  The approach being taken by the Department of the Taoiseach and the Taoiseach in setting and implementing priorities is very important.  All too often, programmes for Government have been written year after year before taking on the same life as the policy documents written by the Department of Health that I used to see - they gather dust in the corner of someone's office.  When priorities are set, it is important that people are made to implement them.  One of the big problems I noted in the course of the Celtic tiger was that many did not realise that their good salaries meant they had responsibilities to the people who were paying those salaries.  One of these responsibilities was to implement priorities, which is what is being done now.  I commend the different approach to government now being adopted.  It is about being responsible and accountable.  There is far greater transparency, regardless of the impression given today that there is some kind of conspiracy.  I actually think there is much greater transparency in government at this time.</p></speech>

I chair it because it is my job to do so.  The council meets every month for two or three hours and Mr. Shaw is the deputy chair.  Between us, we go to every meeting.  There is a wide variety of people at every meeting and it has done a lot of work.  Its most recent report which relates to the people who have suffered most in our society as a result of the economic crash was published a week or two ago.  It is a very interesting report on the vulnerable people in society who have suffered the most.  The council makes a useful contribution.  Much of the work it did last year related to human services, disability, end-of-life care, home care for older people and residential care, etc.  It does a great deal of work and we are involved in all kinds of things.  As I said to Deputy Joe Higgins, we have tried to place an emphasis on fairness and social policy.  The country is about more than money - it is about people and services.  It is about looking after people.</p><p>  I cannot add to what the Taoiseach, the T&aacute;naiste and other members of the Government have said about the current controversy.  This is not a tax haven.  There is transparency.  We have a statute-based tax system and have international agreements with approximately 60 countries.  We do not accept the criticism made.  Members of the committee are wise enough to know that all kinds of things are going wrong internationally and many people are looking after themselves and we are caught in the crossfire.  As the Taoiseach said, this is not a tax haven.</p></speech>

I will ask the same question in a different context on foot of Mr. Fraser's reply.  What is his response to the suggestion that the current dynamic has no regard to the actual effective corporation tax rate in Ireland?  I refer to what is happening globally, what we are hearing from America and what we have heard in the House of Commons.  I watched the proceedings at the House of Commons.  What is happening globally would happen, regardless of whether this country's corporation tax rate was 2.5% or 52.5%.</p> <p>Notwithstanding how the Irish system operates, multinational companies behave as they do because they must operate in an international context.  Does Mr. Fraser agree with this or does he hold a contrary view?</p></speech>

This is a very large topic, but there is no doubt that there are major domestic interests at play in other countries.  There are also significant interests with multinational companies.</p></speech>

The United States has failed to keep abreast of international taxation law and has not addressed intellectual copyright taxes in its jurisdiction.  Some of those who have been complaining in the US Senate belong to a political party which is known to give massive tax breaks to international corporations.  As such, their actions call to mind the expression of the pot calling the kettle black.  As a politician, I have the luxury of being able to make such statements, but I do not expect Mr. Fraser, a civil servant, to comment.</p></speech>

According to agencies that deal with the poorest people on earth, whether in Africa, Asia or Latin America, multinational companies are active in poor countries but do not declare taxes in them, preferring to declare them elsewhere where they pay much less.  They are robbing the poorest of the poor.  Irrespective of what the Government tries to state, these companies are being facilitated by the laws and arrangements in place in the State.</p></speech>

I concur with Deputy Liam Twomey that Ireland is not a tax haven as we have clear laws and regulations in place.  As Members of the Oireachtas, our role is to challenge at every opportunity and ensure rigour and transparency are applied.  That is what the joint committee is doing today.  There is a certain perception about the way in which the Irish Financial Services Centre Clearing House Group operates and it is useful to examine it in the cold light of day.  Everybody welcomes the number of jobs being created in this area and we hope employment numbers in it will increase.  The announcement last week that an additional 800 jobs would be created in my constituency of Dublin South East was very welcome.  I thank Mr. Fraser for any role he may have played in securing these jobs. </p><p>   I view my role in this House as one of trying to fix the mistakes of the past and ensuring they are never repeated.  I am not questioning Mr. Fraser's integrity in saying the joint committee should question him at regular intervals.  Are the minutes of meetings of the subgroups or documentation from such meetings submitted to the committee chaired by Mr. Fraser or the relevant Departments?  It is important that a light is shone on this issue.  The Oireachtas, specifically the joint committee, should have a role to play in this regard. </p><p>  We heard in October that the Government intended to review the nature of the Irish Financial Services Centre Clearing House Group.  Did any such review take place?</p></speech>

I believe he suggested we publish the minutes and our decision to do so recognises that his concerns in this matter are entirely legitimate.  I do not see the minutes as they are not transmitted to the Clearing House Group at the top of a pyramid, as it were.  I do not know-----</p></speech>

I receive an agenda, but I do not often receive many papers or minutes of previous meetings.  The minutes have not been transmitted to the Clearing House Group recently, but I will check the position for the Deputy as the subgroups must have minutes of their meetings.  I will also revert to the committee on the issue of the papers from the subgroups and transparency around that issue.  I do not remember seeing the minutes routinely, although I see a great deal of paper in my job.  I will revert to the Deputy as I understand the point he is making.</p><p>  On the review reported in the newspapers, no formal decision was taken to carry out such a review and there was no such review.  The newspaper reports may have been generated as a result of the Department's decision to publish the minutes and a sense in the industry that things were slightly different.  We will try to do some work over the summer in focusing on the job creation aspect of the industry.  Given that the Clearing House Group has been around in its current form since 1987, it may be that slightly fresher approaches are available which would emphasise the job creation and economic development aspects of the sector.  The new Secretary General of the Department of Finance is keen to work with us on focusing on that end of things.  We aim to start work over the summer to refresh how this is done.  I understand the next meeting of the Clearing House Group will be held in September.  As I stated, the purpose of the group should be to emphasise job creation.</p></speech>

For this reason, we need to have before us Ministers and representatives of the large corporate players which are at the centre of the growing controversy around Ireland's purported status as a tax haven.  Many of us believe this country is a tax haven and this view is widely held outside the country.  I ask Mr. Fraser to respond to my questions in so far as he is able to do so, given the constraints within which he operates.  Has the Clearing House Group discussed the allegations being made about Ireland being a tax haven or honey pot for corporate tax dodgers and speculators who view this country as the ideal place to avoid paying tax, make a fortune and make little or no contribution to the tax revenues of the State?  Is it discussing the country's corporation tax regime, given that this issue is being widely discussed elsewhere in Europe and the United States?  The only reference to this issue that I see in the minutes is a number of reiterations on the part of the Government that it will not, under any circumstances, consider reviewing the country's 12.5% corporation tax rate.  Is that the extent of discussion of this matter?</p><p>  Hedge fund managers, bankers, corporate consultants and large accountancy firms are represented in the Clearing House Group<b>.</b></p> <p>Are they commenting on and making proposals and recommendations on corporate tax policy and policy on the financial transaction tax and other tax issues relating to or that would impact on their sector?  To what extent are these things being discussed either at the main group meeting or at the subgroup meetings?  Ordinary people looking at it could easily draw the conclusion &ndash; I certainly draw the conclusion &ndash; that the reason corporate tax and the financial transaction tax is a red line issue for this Government, when almost nothing else is, is because of the incredibly unprecedented unique relationship that these bankers, hedge fund managers and corporate interests have with the highest political office in the land.  That is the perception.  Can Mr. Fraser tell us whether these issues are being discussed at length at the Clearing House Group meetings or the subgroup meetings?</p></speech>

Generally speaking, the conversation in so far as the official side is concerned serves to say what Government policy is.  There is not much conversation back and forth about it.  I stated earlier that the private sector side of the financial services industry - it does not represent all of industry - has its views.  It is not generally discussed at any great length at the Clearing House Group.  The Deputy can see as much in the minutes.</p><p>  Deputy Boyd Barrett has made a number of remarks which I cannot really comment on.  They represent a view that the Deputy holds.  The Government policy is to stick to the 12.5% corporation tax rate and this has been the policy of successive Governments.  As I stated earlier, we try to run a transparent statute-based tax system in the country.  The Government decides the tax rates and that is the policy.</p></speech>

Is he saying that is all that is said, that there is no further discussion about corporate tax and there are no opinions given by the representatives of the private sector about these matters in the run-up to the drawing up of budgets, for example?</p></speech>

As I stated earlier, as with all budgets, all parts of society approach the Department of Finance and I imagine this part of society has a view in that regard.  In so far as the policy is not to change the 12.5% rate and not to introduce a financial transaction tax, there is not much conversation about it.</p></speech>

Is that what Mr. Fraser is saying to us?</p></speech>

Is there any discussion about the need to regulate more tightly a sector which has done considerable damage to the international economy; which could potentially do further damage; and which could specifically make the Irish economy vulnerable to further shocks to the international financial system?  If the Government strategy is to grow this sector, as Mr. Fraser maintains, is there any concern that putting so many eggs in the basket of expanding financial services could actually make the Irish economy rather vulnerable to further international financial shocks, or, for that matter, changes in corporate tax policy in places such as the United States?</p></speech>

The best answer to Deputy Boyd Barrett's question goes back to what I said earlier about the importance of appropriate regulation, the particular importance of the independence of the regulator and the fact that the regulator no longer has a duty - he used to have it under law - to promote the industry.  That no longer exists.  The regulator is independent.  As I stated earlier, I and people working with me do not attempt to influence the regulator.  We let him do his job and I believe that is our best defence against these things as well as ensuring that we have proper regulation.</p></speech>

The policy is made in a couple of Departments.  It is not as if the Clearing House Group is all-powerful.  It is important that people in the Department of Finance, the Department of the Taoiseach, the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator are mindful of these things, and I believe we are.</p></speech>

It would appear from what Mr. Fraser has said that all the real discussions are being moved off to the side to these subgroups.  Mr. Fraser does not seem to know as much about them and he is unsure whether there are written reports.  He said he believes there are written reports but he is unsure.</p></speech>

I will clarify that.  I cannot know something that I do not know, so I will have to find out.  The subgroups deal with individual sectors.  I am sure they are going through the stuff on those issues too but, as I said to Deputy Humphreys, I will come back to Deputy Boyd Barrett on what matters are discussed.</p><p>  The industry view on all these matters is clear and Deputy Boyd Barrett can see that in the minutes.  There are not long conversations about these things.  I will come back to Deputy Boyd Barrett on the subgroups but the Government policy is clear as well.  I appreciate that the Deputy does not agree with the Government's policy but my job is to implement the Government policy.</p></speech>

Mr. Fraser has accepted that the Clearing House Group represents high-level access for the financial services sector or the corporate sector to the Government.  The statement of strategy for the Department declares that some of the Department's priorities and the Government's stated priorities are fairness, transparency and so on.  Has there been any discussion within the Department about the fairness of giving this high level of access to the Department of the Taoiseach to the financial services industry but not a similar high level of access to, for example, the representatives of the disabled, the unemployed, low and middle-income workers or distressed mortgage holders?</p></speech>

We have a range of engagements with other groups as well.  I remarked that I chair the National Economic and Social Council, which has many representatives, including representatives from the Irish National Organisation of the Unemployed, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and the trade union movement.  We try to have as many contacts with as many people as we can.  I understand this particular group is controversial but, as I have said, it is long established.  It is Government policy that this group helps to promote an important industry and I do that to the best of my ability.  While cognisant of the concerns, I try to be as transparent as possible by publishing the minutes.  I have ensured that the regulator is independent.  As I have said, the Government's view is that this is an important industry and that this is how we would like to work to help it develop.</p></speech>

The purpose of today's meeting is to engage with members designate of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, IHREC.  On behalf of the committee I welcome all the witnesses to this meeting.  They are all bright-eyed and bushy-tailed and up early so I thank them for being here.  Could everybody please turn off their mobile phones?  It is not good enough to have them on silent because it interferes with the sound system in the House.  We have staff who are listening in and they hear static if the phones are not switched off completely, so I would appreciate that.</p><p>  Before we begin, I want to draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rules of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  This is a particularly important meeting.  It is useful because we are in public session and the public will hopefully be listening in and have an opportunity to hear what we have to say this morning.  It will probably be the first of a number of engagements between the committee and the IHREC members and I invite Professor Siobh&aacute;n Mullally to make an opening statement on behalf of the members designate.</p></speech>

We are delighted to be here this morning and we thank the committee for the invitation to appear.  My colleagues have asked me to give a brief opening statement on behalf of the members designate of the IHREC.  I understand the committee would like to discuss any suggestions and proposals we as members designate may have on our future role within the commission.</p><p>  This year, 2013, marks the 15th anniversary of the Good Friday or Belfast Agreement, which was the catalyst for deepening and strengthening the human rights and equality architecture in Ireland.  The challenges facing human rights and equality are many, but we also believe opportunities now arise and we are keen to see these realised during the terms of our mandates.  The financial crisis and austerity measures have created significant hardship for many people and raise very pressing questions of human rights, justice and equality.  As members designate of the IHREC, we are acutely aware of the need to ensure the new equality and human rights infrastructure that is being created must effectively promote and vindicate the rights of all persons.</p><p>  We have no doubt that this will be a challenging task.  Both the Equality Authority and the Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, have played important roles in the protection of the rights of some of the most vulnerable groups in Irish society.  We are determined to build on this work and to ensure the IHREC will meet its objective of enhancing the protection of human rights, dignity and equality.</p><p>  We are appearing today as members designate of the IHREC.  We were formerly appointed members of the IHRC.  Our status with regard to the Equality Authority has not yet been resolved, and the transitional arrangements on that are not yet complete.  There are many challenging tasks facing the Equality Authority, both in terms of its ongoing work and in the context of preparations for a successful and effective merger.  We are very hopeful that these transitional arrangements will be completed as soon as possible.</p><p>  As members will know, the UN Paris Principles emphasise the critical importance of the independence of the selection and appointment processes for both commissioners and senior staff of national human rights institutions, NHRIs.  To date, the selection committee appointed to oversee the nomination of commissioners designate has played a crucial role in establishing the credibility of the new body.</p> <p>Concerning the appointment process for the chief commissioner, a similarly independent and transparent approach should be progressed without delay to ensure a person of the requisite abilities and qualifications can fill this key leadership role at the earliest opportunity.</p><p> With regard to the future development of the commission, sufficient resources both in terms of finances and staffing will be required to discharge properly the wide range of functions afforded to the IHREC, which include the new functions of a duty on public bodies to promote human rights and equality and to promote social cohesion through the integration of migrants and other minorities and the fostering of intercultural relations.  The proposed new duties present important opportunities for us to transform how public bodies function and to address the pressing issues of integration, inequality and exclusion facing society.  It will be of the utmost importance that the new commission commences its work on a sound financial basis to enable us to fulfil these tasks and to undertake new tasks that may arise, including, for example, possible functions under the UN Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the optional protocol to the UN committee against torture.</p><p> We will work hard to ensure the new commission will be accredited as an "A" status national human rights institution under the UN Paris Principles and that it will remain a strong and active member of Equinet in Europe.  To this end, it will be essential to ensure the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission Bill will be regarded internationally as a model of best practice and as an exemplar of what is required by the Paris Principles.  We hope the Bill will be brought forward without delay to enable us to progress our work and the merger process effectively.  As a commission, we will engage fully with this legislative process to support its successful progression.</p><p> As members designate and as appointed members of the IHREC, we have held two meetings to date and members are actively engaged in sub-committees on merger planning to progress our work effectively.  It may be of interest to the committee to learn that the new commission has decided to respond formally to the interdepartmental committee report on the Magdalen laundries and, to this end, we recently wrote to Mr. Justice Quirke drawing his attention to the human rights and equality issues arising from the report.   As members designate of the commission, we have been impressed by the constructive and positive engagement by the executive and staff of both the Equality Authority and the IHRC in the preparations for the merger process and in supporting the work of the commission to date.  We believe that this commitment and professionalism bodes well for the success of the new commission&rsquo;s work and for a successful merger process that will enhance the protection of human rights and equality in our State.</p><p> I thank the committee for its attention.  We had a constructive and positive meeting yesterday evening with the Minister for Justice and Equality and his officials and we are hopeful we can progress our work effectively.  We are also optimistic that we will have the capacity to do so.

I welcome all the members designate and congratulate them.  It is fantastic to be this far down the road and to have people of such extraordinary standing in the fields of human rights and equality through their practical experience, theoretical developments and leadership involved.  It is great to have them here.</p><p>  I have a number of questions, which I will put individually, as is the custom for this committee, and they are for reply by any of the 14 members designate who wish to take them up.  The first is a bigger picture question and I ask it because I am interested in the commission's view on the heads of the Bill that is on the way.  This issue has not been clarified as much I would like in the legislation.  What is the purpose of the IHREC?  I am not convinced its role is clearly defined in the legislation.  I do not know whether it is a case handling body, a policy proposer, a legislative oversight mechanism, an education provider or all of the above.  Is there another way to define its role?</p></speech>

In the context of the current challenges facing society, enhancing the protection and promotion of human rights and equality will be essential to ensuring we have a successful economic recovery.</p></speech>

The IHRC and the Equality Authority in the past wanted more engagement with committees and more proactive engagement with them by such committees.  What are the commission's views on that as it begins it work?</p></speech>

We would like to engage constructively with the committee and to do more than simply report to it or present annual plans.  We would like to be actively engaged in the legislative process, to contribute and support the committee's work and to meet on a more regular basis than was the case in the past.  Engagement with parliamentary bodies has been critical to the functioning of national human rights institutions and we would welcome opportunities to work much more closely with committees and to engage effectively in the legislative process and engage with the committee beyond merely reporting processes.</p></speech>

Professor Mullally mentioned the selection process for the chief commissioner in her opening statement.  She hopes that a similar approach to that past will be used.</p> <p>I have two questions.  Does she mean that or does she have a comment on the selection panel that interviewed her and recommended her to the Government?  Is that what she means?  Would she like to see that panel come back or an independent panel <i>per se</i>?</p><p> I have an allied question about the chief commissioner.  From a communication from the Minister I understand he wanted all members designate to appoint someone from their group to chair in the interim.  Is that person Professor Mullally or has that not been done?</p></speech>

Our opening meeting was chaired by my colleague, Mr. Kieran Rose.  I chaired our second meeting and I am chairing in between.  That is the decision we have taken and we are keeping it under review.</p><p>  It is very much our concern that the recruitment and selection of the chief commissioner be progressed as soon as possible and without delay.  A recommendation of the working group established to advise on the new body was that this was a key leadership role which would require significant commitment and expertise to lead the merger process and enhance the functions of both bodies in that process.  We would like to see an independent and transparent process for the recruitment and selection of the commissioner that is fully compliant with powers and principles.  That will, of course, be essential to our accreditation as an A-status institution and appearing and, in fact, being fully transparent and independent.  We have full confidence in the processes completed to date.  Ideally, we would like to see this continuing and being restarted, if possible, without delay because it is essential to progressing all of our work and ensuring we have an effective process.</p></speech>

Is the recruitment process undertaken through the Commission for Public Service Appointments or will it be handled directly by the Department of Justice and Equality?  Professor Mullally in her opening statement referred to staffing and resources.  What staffing and resources are required to carry out the commission's functions?</p></speech>

As my colleagues, Mr. Mark Kelly and Mr. Frank Conaty, have been working specifically on questions of finances, staffing and resources in preparation for the presentation of a business plan, I will hand over to them on that issue.</p><p>  In the recruitment and selection of the chief commissioner we suggest a similar process to the one that took place, ideally with the same selection committee.  It could be with the support of the Commission for Public Service Appointments in terms of the administrative functions involved and back-up required.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.448" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mark Kelly" time="10:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013052200004#C00500"><p>Obviously, the question of staffing and resources is crucial because through having a professional and expert staff this new body will be able to discharge its task effectively.  Our starting point has been to look at the very steep reduction in resources which effectively has been imposed on the two existing bodies.  One of the statistics that has struck us particularly is that where the Equality Authority is concerned, from the start of 2012 to the end of this year we anticipate there will have been a 75% reduction in staff.  In fact, the current position is that only 11 or 12 staff are expected to transfer on a legacy basis to the new bodies.  By any standards, that is manifestly adequate to discharge the existing functions.  However, it is not just a question of discharging the existing functions because the heads of the Bill which the committee has previously considered clearly provide for some very interesting new functions.  There will be a specific social cohesion function, including promoting the integration of migrants and encouraging good practice in intercultural relations, which we very much welcome.  An exciting new public sector duty will be introduced and the new commission will have a role in supporting public bodies in breathing life into that public sector duty in order to more effectively mainstream human rights and equality considerations not just in law but also in the policy and practice of public sector bodies.</p><p>  In her introduction Professor Mullally referred to two further areas that are very much on our radar.  They are for the future, but they are also, in a sense, legacies of the past.  In 2007 the Government did not ratify the two conventions Professor Mullally mentioned - the optional protocol to the Convention against Torture and other Cruel, Inhuman or Degrading Treatment or Punishment and the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities.  Both foresee the establishment of monitoring mechanisms at national level to give further effect to international work under these two conventions.  Plainly there is potential for the new Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission to play a significant role in these national monitoring functions.  It is now nearly eight years since the signature of the two conventions.  As we look ahead, it is only prudent to predict that there will also be a staffing and capacity need for both.</p><p>  I will ask Mr. Conaty to go into more detail on our thinking about the staffing issue and the level of need involved.</p></speech>

I reassure all concerned that we are working with the senior staff of both agencies to identify and put more colour on the impact of these deficiencies and what is needed to address them.  That work will continue in the coming months.  We have had constructive interaction with the Department on the matter.  It is something that will be engaged with very robustly in coming weeks.  I emphasise that we are working constructively with all concerned to try to ensure these deficiencies are addressed as soon as possible.  It will be critical for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in coming through the merger process that these resource issues are addressed as soon as possible in order that we do not have further delays in that regard.  We are working towards that end.</p></speech>

I apologise in advance for my imminent departure, as I must attend the Order of Business in the Seanad at 10.30 a.m.</p><p>  I was very glad to hear what Professor Mullally had to say about regular engagement with the committee and on the issues in the appointment of the chief commissioner.  We share her view that the appointment needs to be made in an independent and transparent way.  I wish to ask about the transitional arrangements for the Equality Authority of Ireland.  Many have expressed concerns that equality will be - if not downgraded - of less significance than the other issues for the new commission.  What specifically is meant by transitional arrangements?  Is there a proposed timeframe for resolution of these issues?</p></speech>

We are very much aware of that background but do not believe it will be a difficulty in the Irish context.  We are very confident that equality and human rights issues will be fully addressed and that we will work effectively on both strands of the functions that will be allocated to us.</p><p>  With regard to the transitional arrangements, we have been formally appointed to the Irish Human Rights Commission as of 16 April.</p> <p>We have not been formally appointed to the board of the Equality Authority.  As there is no functioning board, there is a gap in its governance and oversight.  As an interim measure, pending the human rights and equality commission legislation coming into force and our appointment as members of the new commission, it is likely that we will be appointed to the board of the authority.  Under the relevant legislation, additional considerations arise with regard to membership of the board and these relate specifically to representatives of employers and employees, which is the social partnership model.  It has been specifically recognised that there should not be representation of any particular sector in the new human rights and equality commission and this was part of the recommendation of the working group.  In the interim, given that the commission has not yet formally been established and that it is imperative there be proper governance, oversight and a functioning board of the Equality Authority, we are likely to be appointed to the board of the authority.  We will have to consider how to resolve the issue that there are 14 of us and only 12 appointees to the board.  There would need to be nominations from employees' organisations and employers.  We think we can successfully resolve this issue and manage it in the interim, which will be important, particularly given concern that equality issues may lapse or fall into the background during planning for the merger.</p></speech>

I hope I am not jumping the gun, but subject to the legislation being put in place and the funding and resources which will be required, will they outline their priorities in the human rights arena and the most urgent needs which must be tackled?  It is probably a huge area, but are there issues which they will prioritise once the commission is up and running?  Are there issues which stick out like a sore thumb and which need to be addressed?  I ask the delegates to throw some light on what they will do once the commission is up and running with a legislative framework and the appropriate funding and resources to allow them do their job.</p></speech>

We will continue to work in the interim pending the adoption of the relevant legislation.  We hope the recruitment and selection of the chief commissioner can be progressed prior to completion of the legislation.  We hope to continue with the recruitment and selection process, although the legislation may not yet be fully enacted.</p><p>  With regard to strategic priorities on human rights and equality issues, as a body, we will work on these as part of our strategic planning process.  Two bodies are already up and running, the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission, and both have work plans in place for this year and are addressing a number of ongoing issues, on which they have been engaging with us.  I will defer to my colleagues from the Human Rights Commission and the Equality Authority to address the ongoing work of both bodies and their current work plans.</p></speech>

As Professor Mullally mentioned, we have undertaken work on the Magdalen laundries which we will see progress in the coming weeks.  Two big issues which have been flagged are the impact of austerity measures throughout Europe - this is seen as becoming a bigger issue in Greece, Portugal, Spain and Ireland - and the privatisation of water services.  Emerging human rights issues include cloning; while we do not yet have specific plans to work on this issue, no doubt the commission will want to consider them.  We are involved with the Prison Service in education and training in human rights.  We have been pushing for the recognition of Traveller ethnicity and expect this work to continue in coming months.</p></speech>

Under the legislation, we have a number of functions and a body of work continuously progresses under the radar.  Occasionally high priority issues are brought forward in policy statements or campaigns.  We are preparing for the merger and in the absence of a board since last summer, we have no immediate high priority campaigns.  Nevertheless, there is ongoing case work under the legislation - promotional functions involve a wide range of activities such as research, development work with public bodies and civil society and providing information - which includes a significant programme of work funded by the European Social Fund on education, training and workplace equality and a range of activities in the education sector.</p></speech>

It is of great importance from a human rights and an equality perspective and raises very complex questions about the interaction between constitutional law and international human rights standards.  We will consider how the commission might most effectively deal with it.  The issues for us are likely to be the availability of resources and the legislation and chief commissioner being put in place.  We would like to play an active and positive role in the consideration of this issue by the Oireachtas in the coming months and perhaps into next year.  It emphasises the urgency of resolving the resource and legislative issues at the earliest possible opportunity.</p></speech>

A number of publications by the Equality Authority and the Human Rights Commission over a long period have highlighted the difficulty with this legislation, particularly with regard to discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation and family or marital status.  A specific issue has been raised with regard to employment in schools which are religious institutions and exempt from the legislation.  The Ministers for Education and Skills and Justice and Equality have identified this as a serious issue and it is referred to in the programme for Government.  We understand Private Members' Bills have also been introduced on the issue.  We appreciate its the urgency and very much want to play a positive role.  It comes back to the capacity of the existing bodies which are very depleted.</p></speech>

The Equality Authority is based on Clonmel Street in an OPW building which will revert to it.  The Human Rights Commission has a lease on a premises on Jervis Street and the rent is significant.</p> <p>It is not the most appropriate premises for a new organisation that would like to have a strong footprint in the public consciousness.  For example, it does not have a storefront presence on the street.  We raised this matter with the Minister of State last night.  We would enjoy and seek the support of the committee in resolving the matter.  An ideal solution would be for the Office of Public Works, OPW, to take over the lease of the Jervis Street premises, allowing the new Irish human rights and equality commission, IHREC, to gain new premises more suitable to a merged organisation that wants a strong public profile.</p></speech>

As commissioners designate, we are conscious that one of the factors in enhancing the effectiveness and general welcome for equality and human rights bodies is engagement with civil society.  We hope to pay a great deal of attention to this factor.  At EU and international standard, it is one of the benchmarks for measuring our effectiveness.  We are persuaded of this.</p></speech>

It is a question of how the body will reprioritise.  On foot of Senator O'Donovan's question, a number of priorities were outlined, but I have in mind a number of more topical issues that we are currently addressing, for example, prostitution reform.  The Constitutional Convention has debated marriage equality.  Transgender rights present another issue.  Submissions and advice were received on these matters previously.  What mechanism does the new commission use or intend to use to contribute to the current debates?  A document was published on transgender rights.  Will it be updated?  Will the commission be reactive or proactive as regards these issues?  How will it decide what to prioritise?</p><p>  I welcome Ms O'Farrell's comment on engaging with civil society.  This is key, particularly in terms of education, where young people can be taught to understand issues and grow into adults with inclusive views of society, diversity and multiculturalism.  They will accept as the norm the fact that we are not all the same.  Education needs to be concentrated on, but it is dependent on resources.  We must also work on that front.</p></speech>

Although we will react to requests, we are keen to be proactive in engaging positively with policy and legislative processes, wider policy debates, civil society and parliamentary bodies, including on the types of issue to which the Deputy referred.  As both bodies have already done a great deal of work on these issues, we are ready and willing to engage proactively.</p><p>  In the longer term, we will develop a strategic plan for the new IHREC on the basis of public consultations with civil society and the wider public to identify long-term priorities.  Our immediate concerns are to be proactive, to engage in contributing as constructively as possible to ongoing public debates and new and emerging issues, to highlight Ireland's international human rights obligations and commitments and to determine how these can inform the work of public bodies and parliamentary processes.</p><p>  The Irish Human Rights Commission, IHRC, has been engaging on the matter of human rights education.  We are keen to support that approach.  We are also keen to support the Equality Authority in raising awareness, disseminating information and enhancing the knowledge base around how equality can meaningfully improve our society.  We hope that the communications committee that we have established can be used effectively to support education on human rights and equality.</p></speech>

Everyone is aware of the challenges to morale faced in both organisations thanks to the recent past.  The cultural meld will present a further challenge, particularly in a context of limited resources.  Professor Mullally mentioned the commission's strategic plan.  That process will present a key opportunity to meet some of the challenges.  Has the commission designate decided whether to complete that plan without the chief commissioner?</p><p>  Relative to the planning process and meeting the task is the independence of the new commission.  Speaking as a former member of the old commission, we often discussed the importance of being independent of the Government and, equally, civil society.  Has the new commission discussed any of these issues or challenges yet?  Its members play active roles in civil society, particularly in human rights and equality bodies.  This will be a key challenge, particularly in the context of the strategic plan.</p></speech>

As such, we will serve independently.  We all have other jobs, positions and work ongoing, but we are committed to being fully independent as commissioners.  We have discussed the matter.  While we will engage constructively with civil society, we view ourselves as a different body and a national human rights institution.</p><p>  We will progress the planning of our staffing and resourcing in the coming weeks.  We are required to present a business plan relatively soon.  We will continue with that planning.</p><p>  My colleague, Mr. Kelly, has a number of points to make.</p></speech>

We have discussed this issue.  Those of us who come from a civil society background are crystal clear about the fact that we serve on the commission in our independent capacities rather than as representatives of particular constituencies or organisations.  The complexion of the new commission is different from its predecessor bodies, in that the extent to which it includes people who have a civil society background is much greater.  This is a welcome development.</p><p>  From Ms O'Farrell's comments, it is clear that the new commission regards civil society as an important stakeholder in our future work.  We will be independent of the Government and prepared to engage with civil society while recognising it as a stakeholder.</p></speech>

On austerity and its effect on society, which as stated is a European-wide phenomenon, do the commissioners designate believe that through their work they will be able to impact on budgetary proposals in this country, and working with their colleagues in other international organisations, taking Germany as the major powerhouse in Europe, they can have a positive effect on it being resolved in Europe?  Austerity is an issue going forward not alone for Ireland but elsewhere, particularly Greece.  The UK and other eastern European countries are also affected.  In the view of the commissioners-designate, how could they through their work assist civil society in countries that are really suffering?  If left to five years time, it will be too late.  I am not trying to put the delegates on the spot and will understand if my question is too knife-edged to answer.  I was not aware the commission would have a remit in this area.</p></speech>

The impact of budgetary measures on equality and human rights is an issue on which both bodies have been actively engaged to date.  We would like to build on that work to ensure that budgetary measures do not disadvantage very vulnerable groups or impact upon them in a way that erodes their human rights and further perpetuates inequality.  We will seek to be proactive in terms of highlighting potential and increasing inequalities and human rights concerns arising from budgetary measures.  My colleagues, Ms Blake, Mr. Rose and Ms O'Farrell would also like to respond to the Senator's question.</p></speech>

Senator O'Donovan hit the nail on the head in that ultimately all human rights are indivisible in nature.  At the end of the day, the street cred and track record of human rights intervention in societies is all about economic and social rights, equality and delivery of them in a real way.  It is about how people enjoy their family rights, their rights to education and access to all that to which they have entitlement.  What must preoccupy all of the human rights organisations across Europe is how we are preserving these core human rights that have built our society to this level if we are not focusing forensically on the impact of our budgets and the decisions made in places like here and Europe on the actual lives of real people who look to us for street cred.  There are many magnificent documents in terms of legislative norms on human rights but the people are entitled to look to us for our track record.  We hope we will be able to bring something to bear at any and all processes, in this type of engagement and on any piece of legislation that might impact on the quality of living in an economic and social society like Ireland.  At the end of the day, it is economic, social and cultural rights that open the gateway for the enjoyment of greater fulfilment.</p><p>  I look forward to the idea of a roadshow, through which we will meet people on the ground.  Too often, human rights is hijacked in ivory towers.  There are numerous people in our society doing human rights work, many of whom do so voluntarily.  We want to be able to relate to them.  The independence of the organisation is a core value.  It is an honour to have been appointed.  We hope we will deliver.</p></speech>

There are a number of things which some of us are conscious we can do to lift human rights and equality from a level of rhetoric and into how policies are designed.  It is not a matter of legislation alone but of us seeking to promote to build this into the design stages of policy.  A good opportunity will arise soon in the context of the adoption of the EU Structural Funds.  A great deal of spending, in terms of education, training, employment possibilities and so on, will be governed by this funding.  The way has been shown in terms of previous work on gender equality and how one builds in to monitor impacts into the systems from the start.  I do not know if we will be up and running quickly enough to be able to do that.  However, a good use of the two bodies would be to ensure a mechanism is developed to build monitoring for human rights, equality and social inclusions into policies from the outset.  That would get us off to a good start.  We are not lacking ideas.  Hopefully, we will have the means of realising some of them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.476" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kieran Rose" time="10:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2013052200007#F00500"><p>As already stated, Senator O'Donovan has posed a very good question.  In countries in which human rights and equality are embedded in public policy, society and the economy tend to be much more economically successful.  We would suggest that embedding issues of human rights and equality in society and our public policy can be part of our economic recovery.  The Equality Authority previously funded a Dublin County Council-GLEN study on how respect for the nine grounds within the city could be an aspect of job creation and competitiveness.  This goes to very ordinary issues in that, for example, to attract tourists requires respect for different cultures and people of different ethnic backgrounds.  If one wants to attract people with disabilities and their families then the city, including its pubs and hotels, must be accessible to people.  On all of those grounds, it is part of our economic competitiveness.</p><p>  Ms Blake's suggestion in regard to having a roadshow is brilliant.  It is important we are not put in an ivory tower but are part of the mainstream of Irish society, visiting housing estates in Dublin or the villages of Ireland.  Part of our key role would be to ensure we are part of the mainstream debate.</p></speech>

The Irish Human Rights Commission has been recognised as an A status institution.  That accreditation is coming up for review as part of the ordinary process of review of accreditation statuses.  A sub-committee of the international co-ordinating committee looks specifically at accreditation.  Essential to our achieving the A status is ensuring we are fully independent and comply fully with the UN-Paris principles on national human rights institutions.  The selection and appointment of the commission and the processes followed in that regard, including our capacity to recruit and appoint senior staff, our engagement with civil society on all of the issues covered by the Paris principles, form part of the accreditation process.  We would be very keen to ensure we retain that status because it would give the commission standing, as it has previously had, with international human rights bodies that would not be available to institutions that do not have that A status.</p> <p>That would not be available to institutions that do not have that A status.  Given that Ireland is a member of the UN Human Rights Council at present it would be critical to retain that.  Crucially, it is about the question of our independence, resources and our capacity to function effectively and to achieve our mandates.</p></speech>

I am certainly enthused, encouraged and energised by the engagement we had.  I thank you for taking up the role and wish you well into the future.  As colleagues have said, it will be extremely challenging but it is also extraordinarily important.  I took a note of the word "engagement".  The idea of having a road show or engaging with citizens is very important to ensure the ordinary citizen is aware, first, that such a body exists and also, more importantly, its role and what it does.  That is a huge challenge and I wish you well with it.</p><p>  The committee was very pleased to be involved in engaging with the selection panel.  There is a change in politics in Ireland.  It is happening subtly.  This committee and others are engaging more and distancing ourselves from the Executive.  We are acting as a parliamentary body.  We are not afraid to challenge the Executive from time to time.  We see that as our role as a parliamentary committee.  You have that role as well, in another way, and that is very healthy and positive.  There is much debate in the Constitutional Convention at present about changing the electoral system and so forth, which is also positive.</p><p>  We were happy to engage with the selection panel and to give it a fair wind, as it were.  I am aware from discussions with colleagues in the committee that there is concern about the appointment of the chief commissioner.  We would concur that a similar process should apply and we would like the chief commissioner to be appointed as soon as possible.  A great deal of work has been done at departmental level to get us to this point today.  On behalf of the members I congratulate and thank the officials and the Minister, who have put so much work into getting us to the current position.  There is still a long way to go.</p><p>  It is crucial that the commission be independent and be seen to be independent.  Also, I ask you to reflect on what equality means.  We tend to throw words, phrases and concepts around without really getting down to the brass tacks of what equality means for people.  Obviously, human rights are involved as well, but the word "equality" is used a great deal and I do not know if we really know what it means at the end of the day.  Do we really think about it and have a working concept of what it means for people in their daily lives?</p><p>  On that note, I thank you for attending the meeting today.  That concludes our engagement with you.  Is it agreed that the committee will inform the Minister that it has concluded its engagement with the members designate and that it will forward a transcript of the meeting to the Minister for his information?  Agreed.  Finally, on behalf of the committee, I would welcome the further engagement you outlined.  There is a new system now for the heads of a Bill.  It is very exciting, although it means a great deal more work for us.  The heads of a Bill come to the committee and we have a very interesting format whereby we invite submissions.  In some cases, we have received hundreds of submissions.  We have a big input into the legislation before it is published, which is extremely useful and welcome.  We would welcome engagement with the members designate on an ongoing basis.  Do not wait for an invitation to get in contact.  Please submit material to us as you see fit.</p><p>  Thank you again for assisting us with our deliberations today and I wish you every success in your role.</p></speech>

It is  proposed that the proposal warrants further scrutiny.  Given that the committee may be referred the proposal for its consideration, prior to opt-in motions being considered by the Houses, it is proposed that (a) the committee will consider the proposal, if referred and thereafter decide if further scrutiny is required; (b) the committee will ask the Department of Justice and Equality and Department of Defence to provide additional briefing to the committee regarding how the proposal adds to or changes the functions of Europol, changes the functions currently carried out by the European Police College, CEPOL, that are being taken over by Europol, and implements elements of the Stockholm programme; (c) the views of the Data Protection Commissioner will be sought in relation to the data protection elements of the proposal; and (d) the Oireachtas representatives in Brussels will be asked to continue liaising with other parliamentary representatives and reflecting back the views of these parliaments in regard to the provisions in the proposal related to the implementation of Article 88 TFEU National Parliaments oversight of Europol.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  </p><p>  The second item is the joint proposal for a Council Decision on the arrangements for the implementation by the Union of the solidarity clause.  It is proposed that the proposal does not warrant further scrutiny.  However, it is proposed that the committee will ask the Department of Justice and Equality, the Department of Defence and any other appropriate Department, if responsibility for this proposal changes, to provide an update with respect to the proposal, should any significant changes be made to it.  Is that agreed?  Agreed. </p><p>  With regard to the Council Decisions 2013/157/EU and 2013/158/EU, fixing the date of application of decision 207/533/JHA on the establishment, operation and use of the second generation Schengen Information Systems, SIS II.  These two decisions are technical, setting the date when SIS II became operational.  Therefore, it is proposed to note these adopted measures.  The decisions do not warrant scrutiny but the Department has indicated that the Irish SIS II project is suspended pending the resolution of budgetary issues.  It is proposed that additional information will be sought from the Department on the SIS II system.  How can Ireland benefit from participating in SIS II?  What, if any, are the implications for UK-Ireland cross-border co-operation given that Ireland is not ready to take part in SIS II?  How much will it cost to complete the project and allow Ireland to partake in SIS II?  What is the proposed timetable for Ireland to take part in SIS II? </p><p>  Is all of that agreed?  Agreed.  </p></speech>

The amendment would oblige the borrower or holder of the mortgage to engage the services of a personal insolvency practitioner to develop a proposal to be put to the lender.  The section, as it stands, imposes a burden of financial responsibility on the borrower who will already be in financial distress.  The amendment provides that the lender must take responsibility for trying to solve the difficulty.</p><p> The concern that arises in this regard is that while the Minister has given leave to the courts to suggest an adjournment, the onus would be on the borrower who is in financial distress to produce a proposal within two months.  This timeframe would result in borrowers acting under duress and in a panicked manner and possibly agreeing to arrangements that are not in their interests.  For this reason, the timeframe should be extended to six months and the onus of responsibility placed on the lender rather than borrower. </p></speech>

I spoke about the issues address in the amendments in my contribution on Second Stage.  It would be great if the Minister were to accept amendment No. 3 and disappointing if he were to choose not to accept it as it is technical in nature.  As I outlined on Second Stage, the guidelines for putting in place a personal insolvency arrangement provide that the timeframe for doing so must be more than three months.  The issue, therefore, is that this legislation gives the borrower and personal insolvency practitioner two months to reach a personal insolvency arrangement.  To produce a personal insolvency arrangement, the personal insolvency practitioner must review the case, including the financial statement and submit an application for a protective certificate to the personal insolvency service.  The personal insolvency legislation stipulates that a personal insolvency practitioner has 70 days to develop a proposal, have it voted on by the creditors and submit it to the court for assessment.  The personal insolvency practitioner must also ensure that creditors representing 65% or more of the total debt agree to the proposal and record the creditors' meeting results, etc.  The amendments propose a technical change because the two month timeframe provided for in this legislation appears to be contrary to the current guidelines.  The purpose of the amendment is to ensure that if and when the court directs the borrower and lender to develop a personal insolvency arrangement, they will have sufficient time to do so.  Two months does not appear to be a sufficient period and for this reason I ask the Minister to accept the amendment.</p><p>  Amendment No. 7 relates to the costs and who pays for the personal insolvency arrangement.  When the judge orders the borrower and lender to draw up a personal insolvency arrangement, a question arises as to who pays the cost of engaging a personal insolvency practitioner.  This issue remains unresolved.  We will have to wait and see how it plays out in the normal course of a personal insolvency arrangement, for which a market price has not yet been set.  It may be the case that the fees for the personal insolvency practitioner will be paid from future payments made by the borrower and, as a result, the lender will de facto take the hit as this would manifest itself in lower debt repayments.</p><p>  My specific concern is that where a bank moves for repossession, it is reasonable to assume the borrower who is about to lose his or her home will be in a distressed position and have virtually no means.  The chances that he or she will have sufficient income in the subsequent few years are also slim.  As there is no requirement on a personal insolvency practitioner to take on the case, I am concerned that personal insolvency practitioners will refuse to engage because they will realise that the banks have a veto and do not have to agree to anything.  The banks will simply state they engaged in the process before returning to court to obtain possession of the borrower's house.  This is how I believe the scenario will play out in most cases.  There is a real fear that personal insolvency practitioners will decide that neither the bank nor borrowers will pay their costs and will refuse to draw up a personal insolvency arrangement.  As a result, borrowers will either be unable to engage a personal insolvency practitioner or they will only find one who is not very good and is taking on work that others may not want to do.  The proposed solution in this case is that the lender should pay the costs of the personal insolvency practitioner.  </p></speech>

I am afraid I am not willing to accept amendment No. 1 for a number of reasons.  It attempts to replace the carefully worded proposal contained in the Bill with a much broader proposal, which seeks to substantially rewrite the relevant provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act 2012.  The intention behind section 2 is to provide that a court may, of its own motion or on request, adjourn proceedings to allow a personal insolvency arrangement to be considered where, for example, none had previously been attempted, as with the requirement in bankruptcy petitions.  The purpose is to make an appropriate link with the insolvency provisions contained in the 2012 Act.  There is no provision, nor could there be such provision, as is suggested in the amendment, that a court should direct that a personal insolvency arrangement be considered.</p><p>  On a more specific point, the proposed amendment provides that a court shall &quot;instruct a personal insolvency practitioner to make a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement under the Act of 2012&quot;.  The court cannot have the role envisaged in the amendment as such a role would run counter to the voluntary nature of the debt resolution process in the personal insolvency legislation.  The court has no power of instruction in regard to a voluntary process.  A personal insolvency arrangement can only be proposed by a debtor through a personal insolvency practitioner where a debtor meets the eligibility requirements for such an arrangement and there are sufficient funds available to make some payments to ground a proposal.  The proposed amendment has no regard for either the context or appropriateness of such a proposal over the debtor's repayment capacity.  In any event, the proposed amendment could not have any lawful effect in binding a creditor.  </p><p>  The amendment seems to consider the personal insolvency practitioner is an officer of the court.  This is a fundamental misreading of the legislation.  The personal insolvency practitioner has no role or standing in an application for repossession.  There is no provision in the law to provide for the court to appoint the practitioner as an officer to essentially force a settlement on creditors.  I cannot accept the provisions outlined in paragraph (<i>d</i>) of amendment No. 1, which are replicated in amendment No. 7, as they seek to impose a duty on the court with regard to the costs of a personal insolvency arrangement.  There is no lawful provision to allow for such, nor could one be imposed.  Again, this runs counter to the provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act.  </p><p>  With regard to amendments Nos. 2 and 3 which propose an increase in the two month time limit for the adjournment, as I stated on Second Stage, the Bill includes a provision at section 2(4) which allows the court to consider granting a further adjournment if, by the end of the two month period, it sees real evidence of progress towards a personal insolvency arrangement.  I direct the attention of members specifically to the wording of subsection (4) which prescribes the following: &quot;On the expiry of any period of adjournment granted under <i>subsection (2)</i>, the court may grant a further adjournment of the proceedings concerned where it considers that significant progress has been made in the preparation of a proposal for a Personal Insolvency Arrangement.&quot;</p> <p>I urge the Deputy to think about that wording for a minute.  It refers to the preparation of a proposal.  In other words, the personal insolvency practitioner has been engaged with the debtor and would have the expertise to ascertain the eligibility of the debtor.  Does the debtor have any income out of which he or she can start making mortgage repayments?  The practitioner can look at the overall background financial circumstances and start preparing a proposal.  It is not that within two months the bank has to agree.  It is not that within two months whatever engagement is required needs to be concluded.  It is a two month period to engage with the personal insolvency practitioner who starts the process, effectively, of preparing a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement.  It is a further adjournment <i>simpliciter. </i>I just draw the Deputy's attention to that.</p><p> The debtor, if I can put it this way, would have, up to that point, largely ignored all of the available arrangements to try to enter into some form of resolution with a financial institution.  The debtor may have ignored the MARP process.  The debtor may have known that he or she was in financial difficulties.  Let us project ourselves forward to a point when this legislation has been working for some months.  The debtor may have ignored the possibility of engaging and just done nothing until proceedings were issued.  The court can still adjourn for two months if there is some practical possibility of an arrangement being put in place.  It is important to note, however, that if a debtor has not engaged, the court is entitled to exercise discretion and not adjourn.  Nonetheless, let us say a debtor comes into court who has not sought to go down the insolvency route and has not engaged with a personal insolvency practitioner.  That debtor has incurred substantial arrears and has not resorted to using the legislation.  The court can still adjourn and instruct the debtor to consult with a personal insolvency practitioner.  The practitioner must then make significant progress in the preparation of a proposal.  There is no bank veto on a second adjournment.  However, if it is clear at the end of the two months that there is no prospect of preparing a proposal because there is no reasonable proposal that could be presented that would facilitate the workings of a personal insolvency arrangement, clearly there will not be a second adjournment but the opportunity does exist for that to happen.  </p><p> Effectively, to put it simply, the purpose of the two-month period is to enable the debtor to engage a personal insolvency practitioner with a view to the consideration of an application for a personal insolvency arrangement and, within the personal insolvency arrangement process, to apply for a protective certificate under section 96 of the Personal Insolvency Act.  The effect of the protective certificate, which will operate for a period of 70 days, with a possible further extension of 40 days from the date of issue, will be to prevent the creditor, whose debts are covered by the certificate, from initiating proceedings or continuing with proceedings, even where such proceedings were initiated before the application for the protective certificate was made.  Again, that is an important issue.  What we are doing here is something that never existed in the law in this area in the past.  The law was as it was for about 200 years until 2009, when an issue arose out of one court judgment.  That judgment is now under appeal to the Supreme Court and none of us knows whether the Supreme Court will uphold the view of the High Court or take a different view.  The Supreme Court may hold that, in fact, the law never changed after 2009.  We simply do not know what will happen in that regard.  What we are doing here is enacting a provision that provides an additional protection for home owners to bring into play when there is an application for repossession of their principle, private residence.  We are introducing the possibility for the courts, rather than granting a repossession order, to adjourn the case and instruct the debtor to consult with a personal insolvency practitioner.  The personal insolvency practitioner can look at the debtor's overall financial circumstances and consider whether there is a reasonable possibility of making a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement and obtain a protective order in the courts, which gives the debtor additional protection.  If a proposal is prepared or in the process of being prepared, though not necessarily finalised, proceedings to repossess can be adjourned again.  This is a really important protection and a very important reform.  It is one that I undertook to introduce when we were dealing with this issue in the context of the Personal Insolvency Bill.  </p><p> In that context, some of the amendments that have been tabled are unnecessary because we have a format here that is workable.  When one factors in the protective certificate and the interaction with the insolvency legislation, this provides the protection necessary for anyone who has a reasonable prospect of entering into a personal insolvency arrangement.  For all of those reasons, I cannot accept these amendments.</p></speech>

The environment for families who find themselves in that position is extremely difficult.  On the issue of the two month period, the Minister said that under section 2, subsection (4) that period can be extended but people are working within a defined process.  From the get-go they are told there is a likelihood that the court will adjourn for two months if this Bill goes through as it is.  They are being told that they have two months to go to a personal insolvency practitioner to try to put together a proposition that the bank can accept.  Of course, the bank has a veto on these matters and that is a failing in the personal insolvency legislation.</p><p>  The framework, in my view and my party's view, favours the bank, that is, the lender.  The responsibility and onus is put almost entirely on the borrower to put together a proposal within a defined timeframe of two months.  I cannot understand why the Minister cannot extend that and indeed, Deputy Donnelly has explained better than I have why the timeframe should be extended.  The borrower will have to go back to court to get that timeframe extended.  Why is the Minister putting that additional stress on the borrower unnecessarily, when he could just agree to extend the period to six months?  The Minister should extend the period to six months and put the onus of responsibility onto the bank to secure the services of the personal insolvency practitioner.  Why?  The simple answer is the cost.  This is the difficulty with the personal insolvency legislation as it is framed and the environment at the moment.  The financial burden will be on the person who is already in financial distress and we have no definite clarification on whether,  when it comes to a final settlement - assuming there is an agreement - the lender will have to share the burden of the costs.  </p><p> The Minister is closing down a loophole.  None of us likes loopholes but the difficulty is that when the Minister closes down the loophole and opens up the potential for banks to seek repossessions, the environment for those who are in financial distress is not solid.  The onus of responsibility is more heavily placed on the person in financial distress than on the banks that are chasing him or her down.  The bigger issue, of course, is the banks themselves.  Where is the overall sharing of responsibility?  We know how this crisis came about.  It was caused by the recklessness of the banking sector and the failure of economists and politicians who facilitated an environment in which money was lent recklessly to people whose debts became unsustainable.  Where is the sharing of responsibility between the financial institutions, along with the so-called experts who allowed that to happen, and the regular five eighths who now find themselves in financial distress?  That is the fundamental difficulty and everything the Minister has said in response to our amendments points to the difficulties and the concerns we have more than anything else.  </p></speech>

I am pointing out that we have not addressed it yet.  The Minister has spoken to the timing issue and not to the cost issue.</p><p>  As I said on Second Stage, I greatly welcome this additional protection, which is a variation of the Bill I proposed approximately 18 months ago.  That Bill sought additional protections when the banks move for possession.  I am delighted to see it here.  I acknowledge again, as I did on Second Stage, that it is fantastic it is in here.  My amendments relate to ensuring it is correct.  The Minister has not spoken to amendment No. 7 relating to cost.  I will wait to hear what he has to say and then reply.</p><p>  Let me talk about amendment No. 3.  I take the Minister's point that the proposal takes less time than a court agreement and therefore may not need the four months envisaged through the PIP having to go through.  It is a fair point that all that is being done is putting together a proposal.  However, considerable work remains to be done.  One can imagine the complexity of these cases, many of which do not just focus on mortgage payments but relate to multiple lenders.  When the bank is going for possession, there will be equity in the house.  Typically the bank will not go after the house when it is in negative equity and will just continue to try to bleed the borrower until the house goes into equity and then it will repossess the house.</p><p>  This is likely to occur where a borrower or borrowers have multiple debts.  There is equity in the house and they may be able to service their mortgage.  I dealt with such a case in Wicklow last week.  However, with the credit card, business loan, car loan, student loan or whatever it is, they cannot go after them.  As a result, the bank moves in and declares it is not concerned about the borrowers' unsecured creditors, and because it has a secured loan it is taking the house from them.  The idea is that the personal insolvency practitioner is given sufficient time to come back with a sensible counter-proposal.  In that case, much careful negotiation probably needs to be done.  Inevitably, multiple lenders with very different incentives will be involved.  The secured creditor is going after its security, and the credit card company, credit union or whatever will not want to take a 50%, 60% or 70% write-down on the debt.</p><p>  There is no right answer to this.  Two months seems too little, based on the complexity involved.  Taking the Minister's point that no agreement needs to be reached, ideally we should leave enough time for the PIP not to have a theoretical proposal but to present to the judge a proposal that has been discussed and is likely to be agreed.</p></speech>

I take the point that the judge can adjourn it again, but why should we incur the cost, time, stress and complexity, and the cost on the State, etc.?  Perhaps the Minister would consider changing it to three months.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.508" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2013052200005#D00800"><p>I will start with the issue Deputy Donnelly raised.  Very careful consideration was given to what the period should be.  One could argue for two months, three months or four months.  There are a range of possibilities.  A number of issues were factored into the two month period.  It is important that people do not find themselves in a position where repossession proceedings are issued if there is a practical possibility of them entering into an arrangement.  When court proceedings to repossess are taken, I am conscious that it adds additional cost on to the debtor as well as on to the creditor.</p><p>  Once the legislation is in place, I hope the publicity surrounding it and the knowledge that exists will result in any individual who could find himself or herself at the receiving end of proceedings getting help from a personal insolvency practitioner considerably before proceedings are issued.  I am sure it has occurred to the Deputy that it is not a coincidence that it is reasonably likely that the personal insolvency legislation will be in operation before this legislation has completed its passage through the Houses.  There may be symmetry between them, and this Bill might complete its passage by the end of June and the legislation operational by the beginning of July.  This legislation will not reach the Statute Book many months ahead of the personal insolvency legislation coming into operation.</p><p>  Anyone who could be the subject of repossession proceedings brought under this legislation will have the facility to consult a personal insolvency practitioner before anyone may issue repossession proceedings.  If repossession proceedings are brought, somebody will not receive court papers on a Monday, be in court on Tuesday and then have two months.  It usually takes a number of weeks between being served with court papers and the matter coming before a court.  A person in this position receiving court papers does not need to wait for a judge to adjourn a case to go to see a personal insolvency practitioner.  Anybody who seeks legal advice on his or her position will immediately be told that if he or she has the funds and is not insolvent, it would be a good idea pay the mortgage and address the arrears.  If the person is not in a financial position to do so, he or she will be advised to consider consulting a personal insolvency practitioner.  A lawyer not giving that advice would not be giving proper advice.</p><p>  In advance of the matter first finding its way into court, there will be space for someone to consult the personal insolvency practitioner.  It is important that things are not unnecessarily protracted.  I would anticipate that the time between receiving court papers and the end of the two month adjournment is likely to be in practical terms not less than three months.  It may end up being 11 weeks rather than 12 weeks.  As the Deputy will know, there is always a time gap following receipt of court papers, and that was factored into the consideration.  We need to ensure people who have been not engaged or may have tried the mortgage arrears resolution process and found it did not work for them seek with some reasonable speed whatever help they can get and do not just ignore the fact there are court proceedings.  That is a factor.  It is not just that there are just two months - just over eight weeks.  There is also the run-in to that.</p><p>  If it appears possible that an arrangement can be put in place after someone sits down with a personal insolvency practitioner, the court only needs to be satisfied that significant progress has been made in the preparation of a proposal.  Then the court may want to know what length of adjournment is needed to deal with that.  Initially it is to ensure people do not ignore their circumstance and address it.</p><p>  Deputy Mac Lochlainn talked about closing a loophole and that we are facilitating repossessions.  We need to get real about all of this.  All the way up to 2009, the law was very simple and straightforward.  If someone was in mortgage arrears and failed to meet repayments, the relevant financial institution could initiate court proceedings and get a repossession order <i>simpliciter</i>.  That was the law throughout the 18th, 19th and 20th centuries because banks do not lend people money to purchase homes unless they have the security of knowing that if repayments are not made, they can repossess.  That is the very essence of what a mortgage is.</p><p>  Of course, the last thing we want for any individual or family in financial difficulty is that they should have their home repossessed.  Owing to the approach taken by the Government introducing procedures requiring banks to engage, there have been very few repossessions in this country since the property crisis hit.</p> <p>In fact, in normal times, one would have expected more repossessions where people simply overreached themselves financially.  Even before there were property bubbles, in normal times one might have expected more repossessions to take place, but there have been very few. </p><p> This Bill is not about encouraging repossessions, it is about ensuring that a lacuna that appeared in our law as a result of a single court decision is addressed.  It is not tenable to have financial institutions which have loaned money and find that it is more complex and expensive to repossess than it need be, if people simply do not make their mortgage repayments.  Most people who are not making their mortgage repayments or only paying part of them, are in that position because they are in genuine financial difficulties.  </p><p> In my constituency I deal with people in those circumstances.  We all know of families who, a number of years ago, were in a reasonably sound place financially, but who are not in difficulties through no fault of their own.  I do not think there is a Deputy on either side of the House who does not.  There are also some individuals who simply decide that they will spend money on things other than their mortgage and who do have funds.  There are some who may well be exploiting the current situation.</p><p> Currently, we are not in a position where banks who have lent money under the Dunne judgment are completely prevented from taking action.  There are other steps that they could have taken with regard to moneys due to them, other than the simple, summary summons route to seek to repossess a house.  Most of them have not done that, however, for a whole range of reasons.  If this lacuna in the law was not addressed, they may decide to take alternative actions.  It would be quite possible but I genuinely do not know.  As a Minister, I cannot interfere in any shape or form with anything the courts may do, nor can I influence the courts in the outcome of any case.  However, there is as much chance that the Supreme Court will reverse the Dunne decision as there is that it will uphold it, if I can phrase it in that neutral way, so nobody suggests that I am interfering in any way.</p><p> If we did nothing at all, we could find ourselves at some stage in the future with a court judgment where the Supreme Court states that the law is as everyone thought it was after the enactment of the 2009 Act.  That would mean simply continuing the law as it was throughout the 20th century where mortgage holders did not repay their banks or other financial institutions, so there could be a repossession order.  </p><p> In this legislation, we are removing any doubt or uncertainty about the security of mortgages held by financial institutions.  We are doing something really important by putting in place a mechanism to try to ensure that - regarding those who either have failed to engage with the institutions concerning their financial difficulties or, to take the opposite side of this, maybe the financial institution has not been reasonable in its engagement - before there is any repossession, if there is a practical possibility of a personal insolvency arrangement, a court can adjourn matters and allow that to be explored.  The initial adjournment is really about exploring whether or not substantial progress can be made in preparing a proposal.  </p><p> I now want to deal with Deputy Donnelly's issue on costs.  We also dealt with this matter when discussing the Personal Insolvency Bill.  When it comes to dealing with the personal insolvency practitioner's costs, the fees to be paid to the personal insolvency practitioner will ultimately come out of whatever pool of money is available in the context of entering into a personal insolvency arrangement.  Therefore, the fees will have to be agreed between both the debtor and the creditors.  If the debtor did a deal, for example, with a personal insolvency practitioner, which was to pay him or her X at the end of the process, and the creditors were not happy with the payment of X, then X could not be paid.  That is because it would be part of the arrangement as to what the fees would be.  In the context of dealing with the equivalent of a debt settlement arrangement in the UK - they do not have a PIA, but have a DSA which is a look-alike - it has been found that fees settle at a particular level on average because there is a control over what the fees will be.  Creditors will not agree to excessive fees because that would reduce the funds that may be available to them.  We will have to see how this works out in practical terms.</p><p> In the context of this Bill, however, I cannot agree to a proposal that states that in the case of any adjournment granted under subsection (2), the mortgager will pay any costs relating to the services provided by the personal insolvency practitioner in full.  One could not require the mortgager to do that.  Why should the mortgager do so?  </p><p> Deputy Mac Lochlainn's view is that all the financial institutions are bad, everything they have done is wrong and they should pay for everything.  There is a lot the financial institutions did in the years preceding the property collapse of which I have been, and am, enormously critical.  They were throwing money at people like confetti at a wedding.  They were not undertaking due diligence as to people's capacity to repay.  They were contributing to the explosion in property prices by being flaithi&uacute;ilach with money.  They were giving money not only for homes at levels that were clearly beyond the means of people to make repayments should there be any minor change in their own personal circumstances, but were also offering money for investment properties that was unrealistic to people who were not in a financial position, had due diligence been undertaken, to deal with the repayments. </p><p> I was not a Member of the D&aacute;il between 2002 and 2007 because the electorate of Dublin South decided to send me on vacation.  However, I had serious reservations from 2004 onwards as to what was happening in the property market, although there was nothing I could do about it.  In the current market, we should have non-recourse mortgages for people taking up home loans.  In the past, that would have ensured that the banks carried out appropriate due diligence.  I believe that should currently be part of the market offering for today's home buyers.</p></speech>

I do not think we should require that all loans are like that but I personally would like to see our financial institutions offering non-recourse mortgages as a product.  That would guarantee responsible lending right into the future.  Of course, the banks cannot be blamed for all of it.  There were many people who individually borrowed way beyond their means and made the decision to do so.  That is an unfortunate reality that, politically, people are somewhat sensitive to talk about because it is perceived as pillorying people who are in difficulties, which none of us wants to do.</p></speech>

In the context of amendment No. 7, it was something that was suggested during the debate on the Personal Insolvency Bill.  I cannot accept the amendment, however, because I do not think the courts could properly impose on mortgagers the costs of a personal insolvency practitioner.  For example, the personal insolvency practitioner may well, having consulted with the debtor, conclude that there is no possibility of putting in place an arrangement because there is no financial base on which it would be possible for creditors to agree to a personal insolvency arrangement.  One could not then require the financial institution to pay the personal insolvency practitioner's fees.</p><p>  It tends to get forgotten that the legislation is not only about mortgages when one is dealing with the 2012 Act, it is also about creditors generally.  I suspect that there would be serious constitutional difficulties in picking out one of the creditors simply because it was a financial institution, and saying it must pay the personal insolvency practitioner's fees, but all the other creditors have no obligation.  It could well be the case - I re-emphasise that this is an insolvency Bill - that someone may have greater debts with creditors other than the creditor concerning their family home.  They may be in difficulties with their family home, but they may have other creditors to whom they owe substantially greater sums of money, other than a financial institution. </p> <p>This particular proposal would, in those circumstances, be seen as inequitable.  I do not believe the courts could travel that route.</p></speech>

Perhaps he might assist me in respect of a particular problem.  If a bank moves to repossess someone's house, it will not be interested in a PIA.  If it was interested in the latter, it would have already gone down that route.  The judge will then direct it to see if it can get a PIP to put a PIA together.  The PIP will not be paid unless a PIA is agreed.  Deeply distressed borrowers are going to be walking up and down our main streets seeking PIPs to do work in respect of which they know there is a high probability of their not being paid.  That is the problem I am trying to solve.  If forcing the mortgager to pay for it does not work for the Minister, that is fair enough.  Does he acknowledge that this is a real problem and are there any other avenues he and his officials have considered in the context of trying to solve it?</p></speech>

What is terribly important is that debtors are not misled as to the practical possibility of entering into personal insolvency arrangements.  One of the ways of ensuring that PIPs will be experts and will put forward practical proposals - they will put forward only proposals which are practical - is that they will not be paid unless the proposal is agreed.  I am sure people will take up work in this area as personal insolvency practitioners on the understanding that if an agreement and a resolution are not brought about, they will not be paid.  There will be people willing to work on that basis.  Let us consider the issue raised by the Deputy in respect of inexperienced people who, perhaps, lack the capacity to resolve issues effectively as intermediaries between debtors and creditors and who simply make up proposals which have no chance of success and for which they are paid a fee.  The incentive to ensure that PIPs put forward proposals that are practical and reasonable is that if they do not properly guide debtors through the process, they will not be paid.</p></speech>

The only real option for them may well be bankruptcy.  That will go beyond the issue of simply repossessing the family home.  A well-trained PIP who is familiar with the workings of the legislation, who is doing his or her job responsibly and who is familiar with the relevant regulations should, once the debtor has furnished all the financial background information on assets, income and debts, fairly rapidly be in a position to conclude whether there is a practical possibility of putting together a proposal that has some possibility of success.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.521" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1107" speakername="Stephen Donnelly" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2013052200007#F00800"><p>It is very important that the PIP should be able to return to the judge and state that he or she has considered the situation, that he or she has put together a proposal which meets the guidelines relating to the insolvency service, that it is the same sort of proposal being accepted by lenders X, Y and Z and that the bank to which it has been put is refusing to play ball.  The latter might state that it is not interested, that the house has equity in it and that it is taking that equity and applying the veto.  This also goes to another amendment we will be discussing later.  It is extremely important that a PIP should be in a position to return to a judge in order to give to him or her the type of evidence to which I refer.  However, no PIP is going to do that.  The Minister said so himself.  If a PIP is of the view that the bank will not agree to a proposal, then he or she will not spend any more time working on it.  We have a problem because there will be borrowers who will be unable to gain access to a PIP.  As the Minister stated, PIPs are highly-trained business people and they will know that certain banks will not accept proposals of a particular type.  They will inform borrowers that they are not going to get anywhere because it will not be possible to reach agreement with the banks and then bid them goodbye.  Borrowers will be stuck on the side of the street with nowhere to go.  That is the problem we face and I do not see any solution to it.</p><p>  I hope the number of people who will be affected in this way will be tiny but there is no doubt that it will happen.  Perhaps it might be possible to establish a central fund which could be used in respect of a limited number of cases.  If a judge believes it might be possible to develop a proposal, if the borrower involved tries to come up with one and if the PIP he or she approaches states that it will not be possible to provide assistance because of the threat of non-payment, surely something should be done in such circumstances.  Perhaps moneys could be provided out of a central fund in order that the borrower in question might consult a PIP, have the situation explained to him or her by the latter and then go back before the judge.</p></speech>

If only I was not being obliged to run around the Houses to deal with so much legislation today.  This is the second Bill with which I have dealt today and there is a third with which I must deal later.</p><p>  First, there are no moneys available to create a central fund.  Second, we must wait to see how the insolvency legislation will work in practice.  I cannot reframe and redraft the latter under the guise of this Bill.  I have stated that if we discover that any aspect of it is not working as intended, we will amend it.  I have no difficulty in repeating that.  However, I cannot start redrafting legislation and making special financial arrangements in respect of one discrete part which applies to the repossession proceedings relating to family homes but which does not apply to the remainder of it.  There is no practical way of so dealing with matters.  Even in the absence of the personal insolvency legislation, the courts have - with great regularity - adjourned proceedings where someone who is about to have his or her home repossessed sets out to the relevant judge a practical proposition and states that he or she will have sufficient funds in two to three months in order to allow him or her to pay his or her arrears or that he or she needs time to discuss matters with his or her bank.  If banks are recalcitrant and obstruct the processing of reasonable proposals, does anyone seriously believe that members of the Judiciary will fail to exercise some degree of judicial discretion in the context of how they proceed?  I am of the view that the latter will exercise a sensible approach to this matter.  I cannot interfere with the individual decisions they may make. The courts have inherent powers to adjourn proceedings where they deem it appropriate to do so and none of us should forget that.</p></speech>

I have no idea whether what I have proposed would pass the Office of the Attorney General because we do not have access to such a resource.  However, I suggest the Minister would consider the issue I am raising.  It relates to a situation where a family home is possessed because of bad debt in a buy-to-let scenario.  We could have a situation whereby a family has decided that pension pots are not the way to go, for a variety of smart reasons, and has decided to invest in a buy-to-let.  For a variety of reasons the buy-to-let is not performing, partly because PRSI is paid on the income and they do not get to net off their costs against their revenue, as in any other business, and for several other Government-created reasons thanks to this Government and the last.  The family income is more than adequate to service the family home.  The bank can possess the buy-to let but it can also go after the family home because the equity will be in the family home.  It does not seem like a sensible social outcome for people to lose their family homes because of a distressed buy-to-let when they can pay the mortgage on the family home.  It is entirely possible that the only reason the buy-to-let is in financial difficulty is because of changes that came in to the buy-to-let market through Fianna F&aacute;il.</p><p>  That party took a business and did to it what has not been done to any other business in the country.  It provided that when it was taxing profits, these particular businesses were no longer able to net off full costs against revenue.  It was an outrageous thing to do.  If one did this to any other business it would collapse.  It was a preposterous thing to do but it was exacerbated greatly in the last budget when the Government decided to charge PRSI on rental income.  We have a unique business sector whose rules if they were applied to any other sector would ensure that large swathes of businesses would go out of business in the morning.  Landlords, for whatever reason, must deal with this nonsense.  We have a bizarre scenario whereby a family could lose the family home by having invested in a buy-to-let and the only reason the buy-to-let is in financial difficulty is because two consecutive governments simply decided that it was no longer a business but some other thing.</p><p>  I do not imagine that my amendment would necessarily pass muster with the Attorney General but it is an issue that I have called on the Minister to examine.  I imagine the amendment will not pass but I am keen to get the thoughts of the Minister.  Does the Minister agree in principle that it is a highly undesirable social outcome?  Can the Minister propose something that might work to alleviate that?</p></speech>

Basically, I want to try to put a little responsibility back on the lenders to act in a responsible way.  The Minister, his officials and several of us have gone to a great deal of effort to try to get some insolvency arrangements, a mortgage arrears resolution process, MARP, and a code of conduct in place with all types of statutory and voluntary guidelines and laws.  However, the arrangements give vast scope to the lender.  For example, a lender is allowed designate a borrower as non-co-operating for a variety of reasons.  For example, if the borrower does not reply to a request from the lender within a given time that the bank deems reasonable, then the bank can deem the borrower to be non-co-operating and it can do so for a variety of other ridiculous reasons as well.  If the borrower wants to appeal the decision of the bank, the only entity he can appeal to is the bank.  There is no independent appeal or no serious oversight.</p><p>  We have heard a great deal of talk about strategic defaulters and those who cannot pay versus those who will not pay as well as a complete misuse of the phrase "moral hazard", a term which many who use do not seem to understand, but remarkably little about the conduct of the banks.  The banks can apply vetoes, designate people as non-co-operating and all sorts of other things.  I am trying to do something simple with this amendment.  I am trying to add some elements to the Bill which provide that when the judge is considering a possession order he can consider whether the bank has adhered to such things as the code of conduct.</p><p>  As the Minister stated earlier, if a personal insolvency practitioner make the case that he and the client have put a proposal together and he believes it is a reasonable proposal and it is a standard proposal that is accepted by other banks, but the bank in question, for whatever reason, is unwilling to accept it, it is explicit in the legislation that the judge can take that into account.  That is the thinking behind amendment No. 5.</p></speech>

It is fair to say we are all trying to achieve a balance of fairness in the legislation.  A central core of contention between Government and Opposition has been in the area around the veto and who the balance of power would reside with.  Throughout his presentation and previously the Minister has referenced differentiating between the people who cannot pay and those who will not pay.  Deputy Donnelly has referred to them as strategic defaulters but I would rather refer to them as tactical defaulters.  I suppose it would help to inform our discussion if we knew how many tactical or strategic defaulters there are.</p><p>  I have tabled an amendment which effectively covers the power of the court to determine the rejection of a proposal for a personal insolvency arrangement as unreasonable.  We are seeking to try to re-balance the system in favour of homeowners.</p><p>  I wish to refer to several points covered by other amendments.  The fact that the code of conduct on mortgage arrears is the rule book lenders must follow should be given more emphasis in the legislation.  When a borrower is dealing with a financial institution, in many respects he will have less of a professional, financial or legal back-up and fewer resources available to him in negotiations.  In many respects the bank will have endless resources available.  We need to consider the area of limiting of costs which are potentially applicable as a result of these disputes.</p><p>  The Minister made an interesting comment on non-recourse mortgages.  Was that a personal view or is the Minister giving us an insight into potential Government policy?</p></speech>

Essentially, we are asking that before a judge would rule for repossession, he should be mindful of several points.  He should be clear that the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears has been followed and that supporting evidence of that is provided.</p> <p>Similarly, a judge should be mindful of whether the mortgagee has been reasonable in terms of the personal insolvency practitioner, that is, if proposals had been submitted, was it reasonable for the bank to reject those proposals.  The third element pertains to whether provision was made for an appeal to the bank's decision and whether there was further engagement.  The final issue concerns the impact of negative equity.  I am not convinced of the point made that a bank would only seek repossession where there was not negative equity and the fourth point tries to deal with that.</p></speech>

On proposed amendments Nos. 4, 5 and 10, I consider these requirements already to be adequately covered in section 2(3), which provides that the court &quot;shall have regard to such matters as it considers appropriate&quot;.  The Deputies might note this point in particular because the provision continues by stating &quot;and in particular shall have regard to the following&quot; and then lists them out in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) of section 2(3).  Basically, however, the court can consider any matter it determines to be appropriate.  It is not limited to those which have been provided for in particular.  This gives a court a broad discretion to determine to what it should have regard.  Furthermore, in respect of the conduct of mortgagees, section 2(3)(<i>d</i>) already provides that the court shall have regard to &quot;the conduct of the parties to the mortgage in any attempt to find a resolution to the issue of dealing with arrears of payments due on foot of the mortgage&quot;.  As I noted on Second Stage, it already is clear that courts are taking the behaviour of the parties, including mortgagees, into account when ruling on proceedings.  I made reference earlier this afternoon to the courts exercising discretion even without either this legislation or the insolvency legislation being in place, whereby judges simply adjourn cases for periods.  However, in the context of taking into account the behaviour of the parties, there is the example of the recent case of Irish Life and Permanent PLC <i>v</i>. Duff, in which the High Court refused to order repossession, at least partly on the grounds that the bank had not complied with the provisions of the Central Bank code of conduct on mortgage arrears.  Nothing in this Bill changes that approach if the courts regard that to be, in the context of an individual case, an appropriate matter to which have regard.  Consequently, this already is occurring without the enactment of the legislation or indeed without the insolvency legislation having come into operation.</p><p>  One further point I wish to make on amendment No. 10 relates to the proposal in paragraph (<i>c</i>) that the court should consider whether, when a personal insolvency arrangement, PIA, has been rejected by creditors, the mortgagor has been given adequate opportunity to appeal the substantive decision of the mortgagee to reject the proposal.  This amendment completely misunderstands the way in which the PIA process works.  As I have stated many times, it is a voluntary process and where the necessary approval of creditors cannot be obtained on the proposal, the process then ends.  There is no appeal to the court in this regard.  There exists a possibility that the mortgagor could, through his or her personal insolvency practitioner and where time permits under the protective certificate period, propose a new arrangement which could meet with the approval of creditors.</p><p>  I cannot accept amendment No. 9 for a number of reasons.  The amendment seeks to rewrite provisions of the Personal Insolvency Act, which is not the purpose of this Bill.  Overall, the amendment is poorly drafted, confused or somewhat disingenuous as to its intentions and is not acceptable.  The select committee should be aware that the protection to a mortgagor proposed by this Bill is to require that the court allow for a personal insolvency arrangement to be considered where, for example, none previously had been attempted, as with the requirement now in bankruptcy petitions, and not that the court should direct a first or a new PIA and effectively determine its outcome.  Once a PIA proposal has been rejected by the creditors' meeting and no subsequent proposal is made during the protective certificate period, the personal insolvency practitioner's role ends as a mediator or negotiator for the debtor.  However, members should remember that where a proposal is rejected at a creditors' meeting and where the protective certificate period still exists, this does not stop a personal insolvency practitioner making a different proposal that creditors may accept.  Therefore, once a proposal has been rejected and where there is no other proposal that can properly be made within the timeframe, the personal insolvency practitioner has no standing whatsoever in the repossession process and the law does not provide for the court to appoint him or her as an officer essentially to force a settlement on creditors as such a practitioner cannot do that.</p><p>  The amendment ignores the fact that the personal insolvency legislation is designed to allow agreed settlements to be reached as an alternative to court-ordered settlements.  It is my view this amendment would overturn this carefully calibrated approach.  I must add the Deputy's proposed provision that a PIA proposal should only offer to repay the current value of a property would represent a huge interference in contractual and property rights and would be likely to be subject to swift challenge in the courts.  The amendment makes no reference to the repayment capacity of the debtor, which it seems essentially would be determined by the current value of the property.  This would have obvious negative consequences for banks, other financial institutions and ultimately for the taxpayer.  I believe this amendment could encourage delinquent behaviour on the part of all debtors, nearly 90% of whom are repaying their mortgages, in order to get their mortgages reduced to present value.  This would seriously risk a complete collapse of the property market and would threaten the solvency of the financial institutions and the economy.  Finally, I consider that this amendment would run the risk of turning every proposal for a PIA into a costly preliminary to repossession.</p></speech>

Therefore, I presume the reason that paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>) have been included is for emphasis to back it up.  Consequently, this is all a question of legal emphasis.  I am not a lawyer but I presume that is the reason these provisions were included, even if everything is covered.  I appreciate the Minister will not accept amendment No. 4 but I ask him to think again about where he wishes to place the emphasis.  The Minister has chosen to place the emphasis in areas outlined in paragraphs (<i>a</i>) to (<i>e</i>).  The reason I specifically highlighted the issue outlined in amendment No. 4, as opposed to a wide variety of other matters one could emphasise, was because of the scale of the problem.  For example, one in three buy-to-let mortgages is now either in arrears or has been restructured, so-called, but actually has simply been put on the never-never.  This figure is growing exponentially and is a huge problem.  This is not a marginal issue as it now affects one in three such mortgages and at the current rate, it will affect one in two soon enough, probably by the end of the year.  I can forward details on this exponential growth to the Minister if he wishes, as it is absolutely terrifying.  Therefore, the reason I have emphasised this issue is that I believe it affects many people who, apart from this one thing they deeply regret, namely, buying a house, apartment or whatever it was, otherwise are solvent and are fine.  I believe the banks will take the house from such people because the banks will act rationally and it is rational for them to make good on their security.  I ask the Minister to consider this issue, as the reason I have included it is because it is a huge problem.  Were the banks to act entirely according to their own self-interest, which it is rational for them to do, one could see many people in a very tricky position.  Consequently, before Report Stage, I ask the Minister to consider including a provision that emphasised this point for the courts as well.  This is the reason it was put forward.</p><p>  On amendment No. 5, I am satisfied the points I raised in proposing paragraphs (<i>f</i>) and (<i>h</i>) on adherence to the code of conduct and on whether an appeal was initiated and the bank ran a reasonable appeal process, respectively, are provided for as per the Minister's answer.</p> <p>A lawyer could point those two aspects to a judge.  The one I would also like emphasis on is the proposed paragraph (<i>g</i>).  It refers to &quot;evidence that the mortgagee has refused to accept a reasonable proposal to restructure the debt, such that the family home would not be repossessed&quot;.  That is something everyone in the committee room has debated at length, which is the banks have veto on the PIA and therefore they are well within their legal rights to repossess homes where it is in neither the interest of the family nor the State but it is in the bank&rsquo;s short-term interest.  It is my belief rightly or wrongly &ndash; I hope wrongly &ndash; that some of the banks are going to take houses off people they should not, and they are going to turn down restructuring proposals from PIPs that they should not, that are not in the interest of the State nor families.  Therefore, while the proposed paragraphs (<i>f</i>) and (<i>h</i>) are fine, what is important is to have that emphasis for the lawyers to point out to the judge that before the bank sought repossession it went through a PIA and the PIP tried to put a reasonable proposal together but the bank is being unreasonable in not accepting it, while the bank&rsquo;s position is that it does not care because it has a veto and there is equity in the property and it is taking it.  I urge the Minister to consider that point very carefully.  I believe it should also receive emphasis in the subsections in section 3(2).</p></speech>

Section 2(3)(<i>d</i>) refers to &rdquo;the conduct of the parties to the mortgage in any attempt to find a solution to the issue of dealing with arrears of payments due on foot of the mortgage&rdquo;.  Is that not very broad or vague?  I presume from the Minister&rsquo;s first contribution that he will not consider or accept any of the amendments.  Why does he not accept amendments that add extra emphasis and specificity, to paraphrase Deputy Donnelly, to what the court should consider before reaching such a serious decision that would have a profound impact on a family?</p><p>  The Minister argued that we misinterpreted the intent of the personal insolvency in section 2(3)(<i>c</i>).  One could argue back and forth that the borrower under existing arrangements and legislation and working with a personal insolvency practitioner has to make a case to the bank and the bank has a veto.  The question is whether people had a chance and if when the bank rejected the proposal if they went back to the drawing board to try again.  That is the intent.  One could formalise it by referring to appeals in law but a logical point is being made as to whether every reasonable effort has been made to examine the proposal from the personal insolvency practitioner and the borrower before one would make such a major decision.  I would like to know why the Minister thinks 2(3)(<i>d</i>) is adequate and that there should not be more specific guidelines for a judge before he or she would make the decision.</p></speech>

The amendment Deputy Mac Lochlainn tabled is quite simple.  The proposed section 3(<i>a</i>) is covered effectively in 2(3)(<i>d</i>) in regard to the conduct of a party to the mortgage in any attempt to find a resolution to deal with the matter.  Regarding the proposed section 3(<i>c</i>), there is not an appeals system for a rejected personal insolvency arrangement proposal but, again, the conduct of the parties is covered in 2(3)(<i>d</i>).</p><p>  The proposed section 3(<i>b</i>) refers to &ldquo;whether a mortgagee has behaved in a manner deemed reasonable by the court.  In determining whether the mortgagee has behaved reasonably the court will consider any responses&rdquo;.  That also falls under 2(3)(<i>d</i>) and the general provision of having regard to such matters as the court considers appropriate.  The language in 2(3)(<i>d</i>) is more economical but it covers all the particular instances Deputy Mac Lochlainn wants added to it.  Therefore, the amendment does not actually add anything.  If anything was excluded it would fall into the general provision the court considers appropriate that is referenced.</p><p>  Deputy Donnelly said specifying particular scenarios added emphasis.  It is one way of putting it and I do not want us to get caught up in linguistics but what it does is say those are issues to which the court should have regard, but the court could also have regard to anything else it deems appropriate.  The court has very broad discretion in having regard to issues.</p><p>  Deputy Donnelly is correct; there are individuals who would be in no financial difficulty with their family homes if when they purchased an investment property they had not either borrowed money on their family home to provide initial capital for the investment property or if they had not added their family home as security for the investment.  There are individuals in that position.  However, in the context of protecting the family home, one must not lose sight of the connectivity between the legislation and personal insolvency legislation.  The personal insolvency legislation in section 99(2)(<i>h</i>)-----</p></speech>

If one takes the first principle, which involves a rental property, a family home and a proposal for a PIA, one will have to work out a proposal where it is a practical financial proposal to allow the debtor stay in his or her home, unless it is a mansion.  One starts off on that premise.  It cannot be the case that one forces someone to sell his or her home and the rental property and leaves them homeless.  The bias and the purpose of the PIA is to protect the person in the home.  That applies whether or not there is a rental investment.</p><p>  Section 104(3) outlines the circumstances in which the home can be sold under a PIA.  In section 104(3)(<i>a</i>) of the Personal Insolvency Act the debtor confirms in writing to the personal insolvency practitioner that the debtor does not wish to remain in occupation of his or her principal, private residence.  That is straightforward.  In the second case the personal insolvency practitioner has, having discussed the issue with the debtor, formed the opinion that taking account of the matters referred to in 104(2) &ndash; I can list them if members wish &ndash; the costs of continuing to reside in the debtor&rsquo;s principal private residence are disproportionately large.  That is what I describe as a very large home, someone living in a home that is not essential for them to have a roof over their head.  It is a very nice home, it is large but it is not practical in the current financial circumstances.  Those are effectively the factors.</p><p>  Section 104(4) outlines that personal insolvency arrangements should not contain terms providing for the disposal of the debtor&rsquo;s interest in the principal family residence &ndash; this is even where they agree to it -  unless the debtor has obtained independent legal advice on such disposal or having been advised by the personal insolvency practitioner to obtain legal advice and declined to do so.  One also has to have regard to the protections for family homes that apply under the Family Home Protection Act and the Civil Partnership Act 2010.</p><p>  I will conclude on this point.  In Deputy Donnelly&rsquo;s example, the particular provision he suggested be included is not needed because the protections are within the insolvency legislation.  Where there are difficulties with an investment property and there is a family home and where the background indicates there is a reasonable PIA that can be entered into, it may produce a sale of the investment property but it will not produce the sale of the family home unless it is extraordinarily large and then clearly the arrangement will envisage some funds being made available to the debtor for a smaller home.</p></speech>

I understand that they are linked but this is the repossession legislation.</p> <p>This is what will come into play when the personal insolvency arrangement has not worked.  One would hope that by the time a bank and a home owner are in court for repossession, they have already tried to look at a PIA.  It is great it is in that legislation for that eventuality, but it is not in this Bill for this circumstance.  All I am asking is that the emphasis the Minister has so eloquently read out is included here.  This legislation will only come into play when the bank exercises its veto on a PIA.  It would be a strange situation for a family to be in court on a repossession order if they had not already approached the bank to sort this out.  In many cases, the process the Minister outlined will already have happened and the personal insolvency practitioner will have considered all of those issues.  All that is a matter of emphasis.  As the Minister has already said in section 2(3), the court can consider anything it wants.  I am asking that two very important issues are given emphasis in the same way the Minister has given them to the five that are in there.</p></speech>

If there has been a process that has not worked, unless there is something about that process, people are unlikely to revisit it.  If there is something about that process that indicated there is now a different or alternative arrangement, a person can go ahead with it and the issue is still dealt with in the personal insolvency legislation.  It is not necessary.  We must agree to disagree.</p></speech>

This was an issue on which we had some exchanges on Second Stage.  I fully appreciate the intention behind the amendment.  All repossession cases relating to housing loan mortgages created after 1 December 2009 must, under section 101(4) of the Land and Conveyancing Law Reform Act 2009, be commenced in the Circuit Court.  There is a logic to the argument that the same limitation should apply to similar mortgages created before that date.  From my discussions with the Office of the Attorney General, however, it might not be sufficient to insert a definition of court meaning Circuit Court as suggested in the amendment.  Discussions with the Attorney General's office are continuing and I hope to be in a position to address this issue with an appropriate amendment on Report Stage, which will have the effect of ensuring repossession cases involving the family home or principal private residence are always commenced in the Circuit Court.  In these circumstances, perhaps Deputy Mac Lochlainn would agree to withdrawing the amendment.  He is obviously welcome to resubmit it on Report Stage, and in the intervening period, any issue that remains to be considered by the Attorney General's office will have been addressed.</p></speech>

Where the court grants an order of possession the court shall instruct the mortgagee to abide by the full terms of any tenancy agreement in place with respect to the property and for the mortgagee to assume the full responsibilities of the landlord as stipulated in that tenancy agreement.&rdquo;.</blockquote>The buy-to-let sector is the concern in amendment No. 11.  We are seeking that any tenancy agreement in place for the property would be honoured.  Whatever the outcome, the tenants' rights must be secured for the duration of the tenancy.  Amendment No. 12 would give people at least six months, where adults are involved, and at least nine months, if children are involved, to make new arrangements to find a new home.  Amendment No. 13 relates to the concern that a house in negative equity would be sold and the family in financial distress would be left to make up the shortfall.  That is a very serious issue.  Amendment No. 14 would seek the mortgagee to assume responsibility for that gap.</p></speech>

It is not intended to deal with the outcomes of repossession hearings, which is an entirely different issue.  Amendment No. 11 refers to situations where there are tenancy agreements in place and seeks to invest the court with the power to require mortgagees to abide by the terms of the tenancy agreement.  Where rents are being paid, the mortgagee may opt to appoint a receiver of rents rather than seek repossession.  This may be viable in certain cases.  Where, however, the mortgagee wishes to sell the property, the mortgagee is under an obligation to obtain the best price reasonably attainable, which would normally require vacant possession of the property.</p> <p>Amendment No. 11 would therefore work to the disadvantage of the borrower and impede operation of the terms of the mortgage contract between the borrower and the mortgagee.  For that reason I cannot accept amendment No. 11.</p><p> Amendment No. 12 seeks to instruct the court in relation to the orders it may make in reaching its judgement on a repossession action.  I think it is important to point out that the court has a general power to stay proceedings, and on a regular basis the courts stay orders for possession for a period of time to enable people to reorder their lives, obtain alternative accommodation or, as happens on occasion, allow children to sit examinations.  I do not think it necessary to legislate on this issue as proposed in the amendment and therefore I will not be accepting it.</p><p> With regard to amendment No. 13, I believe if we were to go this route, we would encourage strategic default and compound our current difficulties.  This would create even more serious difficulties for both financial institutions and the State.  I cannot accept the amendment for that reason.</p><p> Amendment No. 14 seems to indicate that the Oireachtas should legislate to provide that the cost of the repossession should be paid by the mortgagee.  Again I cannot agree that such a provision should be enshrined in primary legislation and cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

We have a fundamental difficulty with the decision of the Government to proceed with the legislation.  We are in agreement on the closing of loopholes, but when this loophole is closed, it facilitates repossessions by the banks in circumstances in which people are not protected and the balance of interest lies with the banks.</p><p>  The Minister made a point earlier on the reason that interest rates on mortgages are lower because they are secured debts and that is a reasonable principle of lending and financial transactions.  As it is a secured loan, interest rates will be lower and it will be easier for people to purchase their own homes.  We are after coming through an extraordinary mess that is ongoing, in which people have significant personal debt due to the recklessness of financial institutions, facilitated by the regulator and the Department of Finance.  There are many families in financial distress and are renting accommodation.  They need their rights protected.  The difficulty is that the Minister's refusal to accept our amendments can only be in the interests of the banks which have contributed and played a significant role in the crisis we face.  I intend to press my amendments.</p></speech>

I made the point that this could produce strategic default.  When people entered into the mortgages they were not non-recourse mortgages.  One cannot, through legislation, turn every mortgage in the State into a non-recourse mortgage.  That is the implication of what the Deputy is proposing in his amendment No. 13.  That would create considerable difficulties and would create additional difficulties within the banking system.  It is not a practical proposal.</p><p>  I made the point earlier that I believe that in the future, non-recourse mortgages should be one of the offerings of certain financial institutions.  I emphasise that this is a personal view but I think it ensures the financial institutions exercise due diligence.  At present, the financial institutions are exercising due diligence and some would complain that they are making it unnecessarily difficult for first-time borrowers to borrow money for a home.  There is always the risk that one goes from one extreme to the other, but let us project ourselves 15 to 20 years ahead and assume the world is completely settled and we have solved our difficulties and the historical memory of what occurred is forgotten.  I see advantages in a non-recourse mortgage being offered.  We cannot, by dint of this legislation, turn every mortgage in the country into a non-recourse mortgage.  That could, in effect, be the consequence of what the Deputy is proposing.</p></speech>

In relation to section 2, it has been brought to my attention in recent days that it may be necessary on Report Stage to amend section 2(1) to supplement the reference to the Family Home Protection Act 1976 with a reference to the Civil Partnership<b></b>and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010, especially since section 2(5) means that this section will apply to mortgages created both before and after 1 December 2009.  At present the provision is worded to allow for situations where the mortgage on the property is in the name of one person only but that person has, for whatever reason, ceased to live in the house to which the Family Home Protection Act 1976 applies.  The proposed amendment will make it clear that the provisions also apply to the Civil Partnership and Certain Rights and Obligations of Cohabitants Act 2010.  It is important that there is no unintended omission in the legislation.  The amendment is currently being drafted and I hope to table it on Report Stage.</p></speech>

The purpose of the meeting is to discuss the procedures put in place at RTE in light of the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland findings and the Horgan report following the recent controversies.

If witnesses are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I also advise them that any submissions or opening statements submitted to the committee will be published on the committee's website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.

The Chairman has already introduced the people with me - Mr. Brian Dalton, Ms Breda O'Keeffe and Mr. Kevin Bakhurst.  I hope that between us, we can answer any questions that members may have.</p><p>  In the past year, RTE has overcome considerable challenges, some of which have, understandably, been explored in detail at this committee.  Recovering from and implementing important changes in response to the very significant editorial mistakes made in the "Mission to Prey" and "Frontline" presidential debate programmes in 2011 was a key priority for RTE throughout last year.  Informed by the findings and recommendations from external investigations and reports, we completely restructured RTE television current affairs. The changes were made to ensure greater clarity in the editorial management chain and to allow for an increased focus on journalism and editorial decision making at the programme level.</p><p>  As part of the restructuring, we announced we were changing our approach to investigative journalism through the establishment of a new RTE investigations unit. The new unit will now be responsible for managing and producing RTE's key investigative journalism output for television, radio and online.  RTE also made key appointments to the most senior positions within the restructured RTE news and current affairs division at the levels of managing director, managing editor, programme editor and head of the new RTE investigations unit.</p><p>  At a group wide level, we created a new role of head of editorial standards and set up an editorial standards board to support and challenge programme makers, particularly those involved in high-risk programming.  In addition, we completely updated RTE's journalism guidelines during early 2012.  We have also included new guidelines for social media and rolled out training for all editorial staff across the year.  Many of the changes we have made have become apparent to our audience with a refreshed multi-format "Prime Time" running three nights a week and a new morning news programme, "Morning Edition", both beginning earlier this year.</p> <p>The first long-form documentaries, "Riches from Rags" and "Bethany: the Home the State Forgot", produced by the new investigations unit, were broadcast in just the last few weeks.  There are more investigative reports from the unit coming shortly.</p><p> There will always be risks and, as I have always said to this committee, we will, of course, make mistakes; such is the nature of journalism.  Having learned difficult lessons, all of the actions we have taken were designed to minimise the risk of serious editorial mistakes happening again while at the same time supporting and nurturing challenging and important current affairs journalism in RTE.  Over the course of time our audience will ultimately be the best judge of how we are doing.  Mr. Kevin Bakhurst will be able to give more detail on the specific changes and initiatives.  Of course we have more work to do.  Nobody is getting complacent here.  However, given where we were, I am pleased to say where we have now got to.</p><p> Over the past five years, like many organisations and businesses in Ireland, particularly in the media sector, RTE has had to adjust to a new financial reality.  RTE&rsquo;s commercial revenues first began to decline in 2008 as a direct result of the economic slowdown.  Over the next four years our commercial revenues fell by &euro;84 million, that is, 35%.  In addition, public funding allocated to RTE from the licence fee was reduced by &euro;20 million during that period.  In total, RTE has experienced a decline of &euro;104 million in revenues between 2008 and 2012.</p><p> RTE has responded decisively to this severe contraction in revenues.  We implemented substantial cost reductions across all areas of our activities between 2008 and 2011.  We reduced our operating cost base by &euro;86 million.  The cost reduction initiatives included a voluntary pay cut taken by staff, suspension of increments, cancellation of bonuses or performance pay, reductions in headcount levels, reductions in programme costs, renegotiation of supplier and service contracts and reduction in all overhead and discretionary costs.</p><p> In 2012, in response to further declines in both commercial income and licence fee revenues and a very difficult commercial market for all media companies, RTE undertook a major organisational restructuring.  A key element of the restructuring programme was the voluntary exit schemes under which 350 people left RTE during 2011 and 2012.  At the end of 2012, RTE's headcount had reduced by almost 500, a reduction of 21% compared with 2008 levels.  The benefit of this restructuring began to take effect in 2012.  RTE&rsquo;s 2012 operating cost base was some &euro;104 million less than 2008 levels.  This helped generate a small but positive operating profit last year despite further declines in revenues.</p><p> As I have already publicly indicated, RTE will report a net deficit for 2012 in excess of &euro;60 million, after a large once-off restructuring charge.  The cost of restructuring is considerable but will deliver annual ongoing savings, which reduces RTE's 2013 operating cost base to almost 30% lower than 2008 levels.  As reported in a recently published report from PricewaterhouseCoopers, PwC, the scale of the operating cost reduction that RTE has achieved is almost unique across the Irish semi-State sector and it underlines our strong commitment to our stated aim of returning to financial stability this year.</p><p> By the end of this year, staff costs in RTE will have reduced by more than &euro;42 million since 2008.  In July 2009, RTE was the first public body to agree and implement reductions in basic salary for all staff.  The pay reductions were fair, ranging from 2.35% to 12.5%, with those staff members on higher incomes taking the largest reductions.  Salary increments in RTE were suspended for a period of time by agreement.  They have been reintroduced but on condition that their reintroduction was offset by other personnel related cuts.  In respect of management and all other grades, no bonuses have been paid and managers are no longer placed on incremental salary scales.</p><p> Average basic pay for RTE staff serving at December 2012 was &euro;55,500.  This places RTE&rsquo;s salaries, compared with both public and private sector organisations, in the median or mid-range for comparable organisations and companies.  Alongside our staff, RTE has always contracted a wide range of personnel and companies to deliver services, including on-air presenting talent.  For many years, the earnings of RTE&rsquo;s top presenting talent has been a subject of considerable public debate and criticism.  It is the issue more than any other that I am asked about, not just by the media and politicians but also by the public, for whom it is an area of concern.</p><p> RTE, like the public, values enormously the work of all our on-air talent and those working behind the scenes.  However during the boom, the remuneration of RTE's top presenters became over-inflated and we paid our presenters too much.  In 2011, I publicly committed to reducing substantially the amounts we pay to our top presenters by a minimum of 30% on average, both to make very necessary savings but also to correct levels of remuneration that were clearly out of step with the economic times in which we live.  Our latest figures show that substantial reductions have been achieved as contracts have been renewed.  These range from 21% to 68%.  The average across the top ten is well in excess of the 30% reduction we committed to achieving.  When we have concluded the negotiations, I am confident we will have achieved an average aggregate reduction of closer to 40%.</p><p> This process is not over.  As contracts expire, we will, of course, review the fee levels and make the best assessment we can at the time.  I do not pretend to say that we make perfect judgments on every occasion.  However, it is fair to say we realise this is, and has been, an area of concern, we have made very important strides in the right direction in the last 18 months, and the process is ongoing.</p><p> Notwithstanding these difficult issues and the very tough market that still continues for Irish media companies and which we have faced particularly over recent years, as director general I am very proud of the service RTE continues to deliver for our audience every day.  Last year, RTE television broadcast close to 5,000 hours of high quality, home produced programming, and 19 of the top 20 programmes broadcast on any channel available to Irish viewers in 2012 were on RTE television.  RTE television drama has registered its highest ratings and critical success in years, with the third series of "Love/Hate" proving to be the television talking point of last year.  From Katie Taylor&rsquo;s extraordinary gold medal fight in London, to Kilkenny and Donegal in the Gaelic football and hurling championships, to Ireland&rsquo;s difficult European football championships and to the most recent rugby Six Nations, RTE continues to deliver comprehensive coverage of all the key Irish sporting moments across all our services.</p><p> RTE radio continues to be recognised as providing an exceptional service winning awards both at home and abroad, competing against the best resourced public service and commercial broadcasters in the world.  These are an important recognition of the breadth and variety of programming produced every day for multiple audiences, big and small, across RTE&rsquo;s radio services.  RTE&rsquo;s digital services have also continued to grow.  RTE digital has been restructured and is very focused on keeping the national broadcaster relevant to and in touch with all its audiences.</p><p> Analogue switch off last October was an important moment in the evolution of Irish television.  In addition to RTENL building the necessary infrastructure, RTE successfully launched the Saorview service and led and funded a comprehensive public information campaign informing people about the new service and how to access it.  The two year campaign ensured that Ireland experienced one of the smoothest digital switchover transitions of any European country.</p> <p>The success of digital has yielded more than &euro;874 million to the Exchequer while, at the same time, for now, ensuring open and free access to Ireland&rsquo;s public service and commercial television channels.  By the end of 2012, 36% of Irish households were accessing the Saorview service.</p><p> As I have said previously, RTE is far from perfect but it is an organisation that makes a unique contribution to Irish life in a period of profound change.  At a time when so much is changing, public service broadcasting ensures we have somewhere to go that reflects those changes, explains them, discusses them and gives us a platform on which to find the collective way forward.  Like all organisations during this recession, RTE has had to adapt to a new commercial reality.  Like all organisations, we face the challenge of new technologies, changing audience consumption patterns and market shifts.  We have downsized and reinvented ourselves to meet these challenges.</p><p> This year is an important one for public service broadcasting as a whole.  The Broadcasting Authority of Ireland will shortly conclude its review of the adequacy or otherwise of public funding to enable RTE and TG4 meet their public service obligations.  The authority will present its conclusions and recommendations to the Minister and the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources.  Clearly, this review is happening at a time of extraordinary change and challenge for the media sector in Ireland.  The temptation during such a difficult and complex set of challenges is to try to solve today&rsquo;s problems while ignoring tomorrow.  RTE is looking to the future.  We have set out a clear plan as to what we would like to achieve in the next five years, how we would like to improve our services and invest to best meet the changing needs of our audience.</p></speech>

That is why we do not take an average figure for all contractors, given the wide range of numbers.  When the current round of negotiations is completed, we will be happy to provide the average for the top presenters.  Those discussions are ongoing.  We do not do average figures for contractors.  In comparing staff, one is comparing like with like but if one is comparing contractors, one is comparing hundreds of people who may come for a few hours with people who are much higher earners.</p></speech>

I have no intention of getting into people's salaries.  That issue is often thrown at politicians and we rail against it.  I am more interested in examining the overall financial position of RTE.  I thank Mr. Curran for his comprehensive presentation, which set out many of the issues we discussed the last time he appeared before the committee.  He stated the deficit this year would run to approximately &euro;60 million.  Does that put the company under significant pressure?  Is it funded to the end of the year without making additional cuts to wages or staff reductions over and above what has been identified?  Does RTE have to make further payroll savings next year by way of wage or staff reductions?</p><p>  With regard to the modernisation of the organisation, Mr. Curran has identified a state of flux on the news and current affairs side.  Has a strategic review been conducted of its structure, recognising the development in technology, etc.?  We regularly meet representatives of independent broadcasters and RTE's competitors in television and they have much leaner operations in place.  I do not take from the work RTE does as a public service provider.  That programming requires additional staff and so on.  Has the authority examined the overall tapestry of the organisation from a modernisation perspective to consider right sizing it from a cost saving point of view?</p><p>  The position of chief financial officer is still vacant after ten or 11 months.  What action is being taken to fill that position?  What kind of recruitment process will be put in place?  Will the position be publicly advertised and dealt with in the normal way?</p><p>  With regard to news and current affairs, when Mr. Bakhurst last appeared before the committee, he was new in the position.  Mr. Curran clearly outlined the background to the issues that had arisen.  I recall terms like "groupthink" and references to a haphazard approach to the delineation of responsibility, particularly in the context of Tweetgate.  There was a conflict at the time between who was in charge.  What structures has Mr. Bakhurst put in place to ensure such issues do not arise again?  Mr. Curran referred to the editorial board, which will be helpful.  What ongoing monitoring will be in place to ensure this does not happen again?</p></speech>

Anyone who has seen recent statements from UTV and our other commercial competitors regarding the first quarter will know the market remains difficult.  We are still targeting break-even this year.  It all depends on where the market goes in the second half of the year.  This was referred to in UTV's announcement.  The indications are that the second half of the year may be better than the first, but like every other media company, we found the first half of the year unpredictable and difficult.  We are hoping the signs for the second half are more encouraging, but we have looked at remedial cost reduction action.</p> <p>It is not possible to wait until the third or fourth quarter in some sense of hope and then find the market has not come back.  I assure members that we are very much aware of the market situation and are taking remedial action in terms of a suite of further cost reductions this year.  We are also looking ahead.  As I believe the chief executive of any media company or any other private company would say, the most difficult thing is forecasting because people make late decisions.  They are waiting to see what head office thinks, what their sales are, etc. because there is uncertainty in many areas.  Long-term forecasting is difficult, but we will factor in whatever adjustments we need to make in whatever forecasts we have for commercial income.  It is possible to talk oneself down in some of these situations.  The indications from much of the market is that for a particular set of factors in the first half of the year it was difficult for media companies.  As the chief executive of UTV indicated in recent days, there are indications that the second half will be better, but we cannot guarantee it.  RTE has always reduced costs in terms of commercial decline.  We forecast, project and run scenarios.</p><p> In terms of the modernisation of the structure, we have completely restructured RTE.  We have completely restructured digital.  We have 500 people fewer and have made 30% reductions in costs.  This is an ongoing process.  We have not sat back and said: "We've done all that.  That's great.  Let's take a break."  Even by the end of this year our costs will be &euro;39 million less than two years ago, which shows prudent financial management on behalf of RTE.  I am not looking for a pat on the back for it.  It is what companies have to do in these unpredictable days.  We have restructured and reduced workforce.  On the point that we need to look at today and forget the future, part of our problem is that we are spending more money on some areas because we are trying to think ahead as to where we will be in two or three years, while at the same time cutting back substantially in others.  Those are the choices we have to make.  This is a technologically driven industry and it is not standing still.</p><p> In terms of the CFO position, the acting CFO is here today.  She has run television, our biggest revenue generator and cost area for the past eight years.  We will be making an announcement about that shortly.  It has not been 11 months or anything like that.</p></speech>

We made an absolute judgment.  It should be remembered that we have more external people on the RTE executive board than ever in the history of the organisation.  We made a decision that the talent was within RTE to carry this forward.  We must also remember that the previous person left under a retirement scheme which has another influence in terms of that.  We made that decision, with which we are very happy and which we will complete very shortly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.636" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Dalton" time="09:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013052200006#E00800"><p>I am working in the area of restructuring and had spent all my life in private industry until I joined RTE.  One needs to consider RTE as a not-for-profit organisation.  Clearly we all have to exploit commercial opportunity from our public services.  However, we need to consider the range and depth of the output, including Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta and the performing groups.  Clearly we need to achieve very high standards in efficiency and value for money.  I have been involved in very significant restructuring of a very large scale in the private sector.  To achieve 30% over the period the director general mentioned through partnership with the trade union group is very significant.  That change has been achieved because of the not-for-profit ethos and the full range and quality of the services to which our staff are absolutely committed.</p><p>  When it comes to modernisation of the structure, we look at the very best practice across Europe.  We are living in a converged media world and we are adopting best work practices in terms of multimedia, multi-skills and flexibility to ensure we provide the best possible services to our audience.  It is important that a symphony orchestra or a concert orchestra has a particular size.  An Irish language radio station must have a core to ensure it produces quality services.  Many of the activities in which we are engaged are not commercial.  We are highly regulated.  On average we are limited to six minutes advertising per hour on television.  It is important that we look at the totality of what we do and the breadth of our services.  At the same time, the scale of adjustment, with more than 500 people leaving the organisation, the adjustment to payroll and the productivity agreements that have been negotiated, are very significant.</p></speech>

Mr. Dalton rightly spoke about best practice.  However, a very senior position became available in the organisation.  I am not in any way questioning the talent that is within.  I am sure anybody within is more than capable of taking on any position within the company.  Just to give the public the reassurance that it is not just an accession within an organisation, it is important that there is open competition for positions particularly a senior level.  I am sure the witnesses will accept, particularly when RTE is going through a period of financial restructuring, that the position should be advertised publicly.  I am not questioning anybody within but it would be naive to suggest there would not be talent out there that could possibly surpass what is already there, and if it does not then RTE should appoint from within.  From the point of view of transparency and showing the taxpayer and the television licence holder that RTE is serious about ensuring transparency, positions like that at a certain management level should be advertised publicly.</p></speech>

We have four people on the RTE executive board who are new to the RTE executive board and came from the outside.  We have two other people who have joined RTE in the past four years.  We have never had the range of both in-house and external experience that we currently have across all senior positions.  Some positions have particular circumstances around them.  On a general point, that absolutely is the approach we take and we would not enter into any position if we were not confident that we had the range of people available to fulfil that position.</p></speech>

Obviously we all welcome the editorial standards in the aftermath of "The Frontline" presidential debate and the Fr. Kevin Reynolds programme.</p> <p>It is linked to the budgetary issue.  How many legal claims is RTE facing and what has been the cost to RTE of legal claims in 2011, 2012 and 2013?</p><p> I will not go into any great detail on salaries, but the arguments in the past for paying high salaries to top presenters were that they brought in advertising and RTE did not want to lose them to other Irish broadcasters.  There are not as many places for them to go as there were in the past and advertising revenue has been decreasing.  I presume the salaries of the top presenters will continue to fall.  When Ireland's top presenter over many decades, Gay Byrne, retired it was widely reported he had been paid &pound;200,000 a year not to go anywhere else.  I presume such payments are no longer made by RTE.</p><p> I have a particular interest in sport, and it is a cornerstone of RTE.  Is the budgetary situation impacting on broadcasting main sporting events on terrestrial television in Ireland, including GAA coverage?  The cost of broadcasting soccer, rugby and GAA includes the cost of pundits and I note some of the top earners in RTE are pundits.  The only time soccer pundits appear is with regard to the Champions League.  How does the rate of pay for pundits on RTE compare between soccer, rugby and GAA?</p><p> The chairman of the Independent Broadcasters of Ireland, IBI, recently suggested collaboration between independent broadcasters and RTE.  Some time ago RTE announced it would close regional studios.  Could there be collaboration between local radio stations on overlapping the use of facilities in the regions?  It is a different market and rather than being rivals they could combine resources.  I am interested to hear the comments of the witnesses on this suggestion.  Several years ago RTE announced it would close regional studios and go into institutes of technology.  How is this progressing?  It did not seem to make sense when I heard it.</p></speech>

The partnership with the institutes of technology is progressing very well.  It is complicated and we are considering five particular regional offices with regard to partnership.  They are progressing at different speeds because we must consider each location individually with regard to lease arrangements and how quickly we can move out of premises and into the institutes of technology.  The first we hope to deliver will be Dundalk IT and we hope this will happen in the coming months.  The partnership there is progressing extremely well.  An aspect of the partnership in Dundalk in which we are particularly interested is its unique set of premises with regard to conferences.  In recent days we have managed to deliver a major European conference to Dundalk in 2015 which will bring 300 delegates from 37 broadcasters throughout Europe.  This is what we will deliver as part of the arrangement.  The plans to move in are progressing quickly.  The next two after Dundalk will be Waterford and Athlone.  We must sort out the details and we hope to be in all three by the end of the year.  For different reasons Sligo and Galway are trickier in terms of physically moving but we are still pursuing other elements of partnership because all of the institutes of technology are interested in working with us on various projects.  They are keen to be involved with RTE in various partnership arrangements.  It is moving ahead.  Overall restructuring in the regions is saving us a substantial amount of money each year in running costs.  The partnership has enabled us to maintain our presence in the regions.  Before I came into this job one of the options on the table was to pull out of the regions and we have managed to ensure we can keep our correspondents and teams there which I felt was crucial for our credibility as an organisation.</p></speech>

I met John Purcell for an initial meeting on the matter.  We both articulated that we are open to the idea.  Previously the relationship between RTE and the commercial stations was not that communicative and open.  We are trying to open the lines of communication.  We will continue to differ and have disagreements, particularly on issues of public funding, but I spoke at its most recent conference and we all realise there may be opportunities.  We are all in a very difficult market and looking at resources.  I hope that while differences of opinion on funding and other issues remain there are areas in which we can co-operate more.</p></speech>

There were such competition that RTE lost some sporting rights and the GAA packages have been split between two broadcasters.  Deputy O'Mahony asked whether financial pressures cause a change in strategy.  We have stated our strategy is to reduce the cost of sports rights by 25% between now and 2015.  This is a challenge and there may be further losses in sports rights, which will be very unfortunate but we will just have to bear with it.</p><p>  As with all talent fees, a number of criteria are considered when the fees paid to pundits in soccer and rugby are set.  These include the number of events covered and the pundits' experience.  Only one sports pundit was in the top talent list and the latest salaries and fees negotiated show significant reductions.  It depends on the level of services and the importance of the sport itself.  No one shoe fits all.</p></speech>

We need to get those rights down, but the sports market is difficult.  In the UK, BT Vision has entered the sports rights market and is effectively offering sport as a free add-on to a paid broadband package.  This is an entirely different business model.  For the past decade, Sky has told customers that they must buy the premium package because it does not unbundle by match online.  Three or four months ago there was a complete reversal, and Sky is now unbundling individual matches, for which customers pay.</p><p> Relevant to the public funding argument, the danger for us is that not only are sports rights being driven by large companies, but other large companies view it as a free add-on to their core business.  This has implications for RTE.  Anything that happens in the UK market almost inevitably comes to Ireland.</p></speech>

In case no one else says it, RTE does a good job and it is right to be proud of it.  This democracy needs a well-functioning public service in television and radio.  RTE has learned from the well-publicised hiccups and is working on them.</p><p>  First, the main issue is the challenging financial situation for RTE and all media and broadcasters.  Did I pick the witnesses up correctly about a net deficit in 2012 of &euro;60 million, largely due to restructuring?  That restructuring has been impressive and, in respect of the highest earners in particular, necessary.  People use the term "low-hanging fruit".  As I suspect that fruit is gone, any future reduction in financial support will have a proportionately greater impact on RTE's ability to produce programmes.  Assuming that advertising revenue will not increase in the next two to three years, does RTE anticipate an increase in public funding when the proposed broadcasting charge is introduced?  Is RTE in the same position as hospitals, local government and so on, in that there will be reductions in the public service element of its budget in the next three to five years?  As opposed to the sustainability plan, what is the survivability plan?</p><p>  Second, RTE possesses detailed guidelines on impartiality and fairness in the coverage of news, politics and current affairs, but I am unsure how adherence to them is monitored or implemented.  I have in mind the coverage of politicians' statements and the Joint Committee on Health and Children's current hearings.  Every time certain politicians appear on a news or current affairs programme, the ensuing discussion is not on their policies, but on their backgrounds.  Some politicians in senior Government positions have equally interesting backgrounds, yet these are never mentioned.  How are the guidelines on impartiality and fairness in news and current affairs monitored and implemented?</p><p>  Much of my third question on regional studios has already been answered.  Dundalk has been discussed in detail.  To be parochial, what is the situation in Sligo?</p><p>  Fourth, it has been mentioned that RTE has proposed projects to support the 20-year strategy for the Irish language.  Will our guests provide further detail on those projects?</p></speech>

It is welcome to have that recognised.</p><p>  In terms of low-hanging fruit, the orchard is definitely bare.  We will report a deficit in excess of &euro;60 million for 2012, the majority of which has to do with a one-off, large restructuring charge.  That charge was necessary to downsize RTE yet again.  In 2013, our cost base will be in the order of &euro;314 million, almost 30% lower than it was in 2008.  This is significant.  We have tried to make cuts strategically so that they do not affect the audience.  Obviously, the audience sees the effect, but it is a question of minimising that effect.</p><p>  It is important to note that, in making the cuts, one of the metrics we used related to the first-run hours of transmission of indigenous-made programmes.  We have worked on maintaining those hours.  Although there has been a reduction, it has amounted only to approximately 6% on RTE 1 and RTE 2.  We have focused the cuts on other areas where, as far as is possible, programme output is not affected.  However, making cuts of this level eats into the programmes and the types of programme we make.</p><p>  RTE's restructuring in 2011 and 2012 has reduced our headcount by 20%, lowering our operating cost base to a sustainable level for 2013 and beyond.  As to whether we need to do more, we must watch the income landscape and how we perform in that respect.  The restructuring has assisted us in our target of breaking even in 2013.</p></speech>

The question of public funding is critical.  In the next number of days, the Broadcasting Authority of Ireland, BAI, will make recommendations as a result of its review.  Subsequently, it will become a political decision for the Minister and the Department.  I am not party to that decision, but I gather it is imminent.</p><p>  It is important that we lay out some of the issues.  The Minister has stated there will be a new media charge because people are accessing programmes, radio and other content in a range of ways other than through television.  Other countries are moving to reflect this fact.  There is a danger that the media charge will be seen as a panacea for every ill in the broadcasting industry, something that can solve the commercial sector's problems and whatever problems RTE has.  It will not be a panacea.  The Department has estimated that it will generate an increase of &euro;20 million in public funding.  This estimate is based on reducing evasion by half to 8% and reducing collection costs from 7.5% to 5%.  One could claim that if evasion rates fell further, the collection costs arrived at through a tendering process could decrease.  There will not be an extra &euro;50 million, &euro;60 million or &euro;70 million in public funding, but there will be more overall.</p> <p> The case I have been trying to make is that for all the flaws and criticism received by RTE, it is a unique organisation.  I understand that competitors see RTE as the biggest problem in the market.  RTE has 25% of the radio advertising and there are over 30 channels in Ireland selling advertising to Irish advertisers on Sky.  That number is growing.  We have reached a critical point, particularly in debating public funding, and we are competing against Sky, which has an income of &euro;7.6 billion; the BBC with an income of &euro;5.6 billion; and the likes of Google.  That is the competitive landscape and they all operate in Ireland.  Good luck to them as they are very good companies and are very good at what they do.</p><p> Where does the Irish media stand in this respect?  I came across an interesting and important statistic recently indicating that in the UK, the top three television channels are British-owned and concentrate largely on British content.  They are BBC, ITV and Channel 4 and they have 70% of the audience.  In Ireland, only the top two companies concentrate and invest in Irish content, and we are 53%.  We are reaching a point where because of the prevalence of satellite programming in this country, in particular, we will lose the position of broadcaster of scale that can invest in Irish drama, news and current affairs, and which will make those kinds of decisions.  I make the case strongly that RTE should be that type of broadcaster, competing against companies of the scale that we are currently competing against internationally and which operate in this market.  We need that scale.</p><p> I have stated recently that we are not looking for a free lunch and we all realise how difficult times are, so we have outlined a range of actions and new commitments.  We have also talked about commercial footprints.  We have tried to respond to the issue but the market is changing so fundamentally that in five or ten years, if we do not have a strong national broadcaster of scale that is required to invest heavily in Irish content, the independent production sector and areas like drama, young people's programming - we have no problem with that - culturally, as a society and politically we will be at a significant loss.  That is the context in which I put the debate on RTE's position with regard to the public funding review.</p></speech>

RTE owns the building from which it operates in that location so to make it financially viable to move from the premises, we would need to find another tenant to move to the building.  I am not sure that is imminent; if we can deliver that, it would be great and we could move to the institute of technology but in the mean time we will pursue - as we are doing in Galway - the other elements of the partnership with the institute of technology.  I am going to Sligo in a couple of weeks to try to put a bit more flesh on the bones in that respect.</p></speech>

There are reviews within the programme teams and weekly reviews of output.  We have a new political assignments editor, Ms Deirdre McCarthy, who is doing a very good job of taking a view across RTE's political output and whether various party and individual views are getting a fair airing.  I have frequent discussions with her about that.  For example, on "Prime Time" there is a very detailed log of who is interviewed and about what they have been interviewed, and I review this every couple of months to ensure the parties are getting a fair and proportionate amount of air time.</p><p>  There was a comment about backgrounds and policy.  It is important that across the piece people and parties get a fair crack of the whip in terms of air time to put policies across and discuss them.  There are areas of background and historical issues that are unresolved and we should look into them.  That may concern what happened to banks, the outcome of the Moriarty tribunal or the Troubles in the North from the perspective of both sides.  There are many questions still to be answered by individuals and it is part of our job to keep examining matters and asking questions.</p></speech>

Is there fairness in the media in that respect?  I believe there is not fairness in the way views are expressed for specific issues.  I could use coverage of the septic tank charge as an example as there was bias on one side.  Reporters went to constituencies like my own and picked people on one side to interview but they did not go to the other side.  What is the way of managing such a process as RTE should be more balanced with it.  The process can be very questionable.  That is one example but I have no doubt there are many more.</p></speech>

The abortion issue is a current example, as it is highly sensitive.</p> <p>We will closely monitor it to ensure we have a fair range of voices that is as representative as possible.  Sometimes there are individuals who we might not have considered.  Sometimes they will say, "Have you considered this viewpoint or that viewpoint?" and we have to admit we have not, so we have to include that somewhere along the way.  Obviously, there is a huge output at RTE news and current affairs ranging from "Prime Time", the Six One News and the nine o'clock news through to the "Late Debate" and the "Morning Edition".  There are many different outlets and we must try to take a view across the piece that there is a fair representation of views and of individuals.  I am always happy to consider an issue, or Deirdre is if people go to her about it.</p></speech>

I hope the other semi-State companies under the remit of this committee are watching, because they should be subject to the same level of scrutiny.  I will be proposing that in the near future, particularly in view of the fact that one semi-State company recently made a &euro;40 million loss but it pays its chief executive officer &euro;400,000 per annum.</p><p>  It would be remiss of us not to talk about the celebrity salaries.  That is what interests people.  Certainly that is what preoccupies the people in my constituency with regard to RTE, and I do not think I am representing a constituency that is completely different from all the others.  I looked at the BBC's annual report recently.  I am open to correction but that report states that the BBC has 19 staff who are paid more than &pound;500,000.  Britain's population is roughly 15 times greater than Ireland's and based on what I have read in the media recently about some of the celebrity salaries being paid here I would have thought that well over 100 people in the BBC would be paid more than &pound;500,000.  Mr. Curran said that RTE had paid its presenters too much.  That is refreshing honesty, but does he think they are still being paid too much?  The baseline is definitely too high.  When one reduces something by 20% or 30%, it sounds like a huge percentage but the baseline was far too high.  Deputy O'Mahony is correct that there was a fear they would leave if their salaries were cut.  Realistically, however, where would they go and who would have them?  To be honest, who could afford them?  Certainly nobody in Ireland could.</p><p>  With regard to editorial changes, particularly after the "Twittergate" incident, there was a move to re-brand and refresh "The Frontline" and call it "Prime Time" with an audience.  However, when I watch it, it is still the same.  RTE essentially just changed the logo.  Somebody mentioned balance earlier.  As I have often said previously, including to this committee, when one looks at the audience on "The Frontline" or "Prime Time", there are so many plants in it, it looks like a garden centre.  Contrast the audience for "Prime Time" with the audience for BBC's "Question Time".  There is a really impartial audience on the BBC programme, but it is not an impartial audience on "Prime Time".  It is a hand-picked bunch of repeat performers.  If one watches every week, one sees the same people appearing time and again.  They are planted with loaded questions, invariably to try to land a punch on the unfortunate Government representative.  That is anything but fair.  Some people think that just because RTE re-brands and relaunches it, it will be better in some way but, to be honest, it is the very same.  It is "The Frontline" with two presenters rather than one, as far as I am concerned.</p><p>  This follows through in the radio programmes.  If one is unfortunate enough to be in a car as often as politicians are and one is listening to talk radio, one might hear Anne from Kilkenny, for example, ring in and lacerate her local representative or the Government representative.  There does not appear to be any clearance or checking to ensure that Anne from Kilkenny is a real person and not Mary from the press office of the main Opposition party, who is sitting in an office in Dublin texting, tweeting and ringing with loaded comments that are then broadcast and taken as fact. </p></speech>

We saw what this has the potential to do in the presidential election, when a planted, loaded grenade went off in the middle of a "Prime Time" programme and did huge damage.  I was never going to vote for the man, but I believe it did huge damage to him.  There should be some type of clearance, whether the programmes are hosted by Marian Finucane, Pat Kenny, Joe Duffy or whoever, because obviously commentary is being planted to do damage to a person politically.  People tend to say, "There is no smoke without fire.  I heard it on the radio so it must true".  Perhaps Mr. Curran will comment on that as well.</p><p>  Ms O'Keeffe referred to contractors.  To be fair to the committee, we are not talking about people who are painting and decorating or rewiring the place.  The contractors we are referring to are the contractors whose names appear in the newspapers every year.  In view of their salaries, one would be better off getting one of those positions than winning the lotto.  If one wins the lottery, one will win it only once whereas if one gets one of those positions, one will be paid every year.  The low hanging fruit was mentioned.  People from RTE have contacted me, as a member of the committee, in a private capacity.  I have been surprised by how many.  They feel aggrieved because they believe it is the workers in the organisation, particularly the low paid workers, who have taken the hits.  The witnesses have said that staff numbers have been reduced, but they have been reduced primarily where salaries are at the lower end of the scale.  The witnesses can correct me on that if I am mistaken.  Certainly, as Deputy Colreavy said, the public perception is that the low hanging fruit is the employees, while the rich pickings are in a different orchard.  Mr Curran said negotiations will be concluded.  How long are the negotiations with these celebrities under way?  With whom is RTE negotiating?  Is it negotiating with them as individuals or as a group or do they have a trade union?  When does RTE expect the negotiations to conclude and will it publish the conclusion?</p></speech>

Is RTE happy with current reforms to ensure that there is no repeat?  Will a vetting system be put in place?  It was a humiliating, terrible and extraordinary ordeal for the person concerned, his family and community.  The programme was diabolical in the first place.</p><p>  Noel Curran is the director general, chief executive and editor in chief but the news editor got the bullet.  Was the wrong person sacked?  Did Mr. Curran consider tendering his resignation?  What action did the board and its chairman take?  How did the news editor lose his job?  I presume he no longer has a job.  His firing will be detrimental to his chance of progressing in life and securing jobs that carry responsibilities.  I believe that the buck stops at the manager's desk.  Somebody is responsible for the gross negligence and total lack of protocol and safety measures.  Normally it is the person in charge, the executive who is in control, who is fired.</p><p>  The licensing fees of &euro;176 million, and I can be corrected about the figure, allows RTE to fund a public broadcasting service.  It is my firm belief that RTE does not give that amount of service to the community and the general public.  </p><p>  I am amazed that the Minister for Communications, Energy and Natural Resources, proposes to increase the &euro;160 television licence fee.  I have made my views on the matter known through the committee and at D&aacute;il level.  It is unacceptable to maintain the current fee, it should be reduced.  People can no longer afford such exorbitant fees being paid to one broadcasting station.  RTE should fund itself by operating in the commercial sector.</p><p>  I wish to follow-up on comments made by other speakers.  Deputy Patrick O'Donovan made relevant points and I commend him on stating comparative figures from the BBC.  The RTE presenters and managers do not live in the real world when it comes to finance.  They live on a different planet.  The salaries have been allowed to continue.  Ireland would be the laughing stock of Europe if the salaries were known.  We are a small island nation and that is why the matter is not being broadcast publicly.  The salaries are excessive when compared with the size of the population.</p><p>  We have reduced wages.  Let us compare salaries with the salary paid to the President of the United States, the person who wields the most power in the world.  A television and radio presenter here earns three times his salary, another television and radio broadcaster earns over three times and one radio person earns twice the amount.  That gives us food for thought.</p><p>  I wish to extend a belated welcome to the delegation.  I should have said it at the start of my presentation.  I wish them the best.</p></speech>

Please remember that England has 17 times our population.  Historically, only one or two of our people earned that amount.  When the process is done no one will earn that amount.</p><p>  A balanced approach is necessary when comparing RTE with the UK.  When I have talked about salaries I have been upfront in stating that the fees being paid were too high and that it was RTE's fault.  Without justifying the fees in any way, one does need to recognise the value of RTE presenters.  RTE is dual-funded and relies on commercial income.  The public respond incredibly positively to the presenters.  Let us make UK comparisons.  The weekend reach by the "Marian Finucane Show" is two and half times the comparative reach on BBC's Radio Four.  BBC's "Newsnight" gets about 9% share in the UK, "Channel 4 News" gets about 3% but "Prime Time" gets over 30% and RTE news bulletins get about 40%.  Since Marian Finucane moved to her Saturday show her audience has increased by 51% and her Sunday audience has increased by 47%.  Even given the latest reductions, Joe Duffy's audience has increased by 53% since he moved to his new time slot.  Miriam O'Callaghan presents a current affairs show, a top ten radio show and one of our largest home produced television shows in the summer.  I needed to say all that otherwise one ends up in a confrontational situation, particularly when driving down salaries.  It would be easy for me to grandstand, to say how much we have reduced the salaries and say that we are great.  That is not what I mean.  We realised that the public had a concern and took action which is ongoing.  We will review salaries when contracts end.  Value exists, particularly with comparisons.  The value is determined by the person out front and his or her team.  Many people who are not in the top ten list deliver an equal amount of value.  There must be some recognition of public value.</p><p>  In answer to the Deputy's question, we realised that the public were concerned and took action.  I am not seeking a pat on the back.  I do not know of any other area of the economy where salaries or fees have been reduced to this level and we are not finished the process.</p><p>  One could get into all sorts of questions on who can afford the salaries.  We consider a range of factors when deciding fees such as audience share, whether the presenter is replaceable, the schedule, the position on the schedule, the commercial revenue and all of that.  RTE's competitors do not publish fees.  Interestingly, several newspapers recently published estimations of fees.</p> <p>According to our market intelligence, our fees are at a level where, if we amalgamated RTE and the commercial sector, four of the top ten would be from commercial radio.  This is due to the reductions we have made.  This is certainly not a criticism and they deserve whatever money they are going to get from their employers.  I cannot confirm that completely because we do not have the figures, but these are indications.  We have made inroads and we are pulling these figures down while valuing the contribution people make.</p><p> I ask Mr. Kevin Bakhurst to respond to questions on the "The Frontline" and "Prime Time".</p></speech>

We try to maintain the very best of "The Frontline", which includes elements of audience interaction.  Much of the audience consists of people who phone in and join the audience.  We deliberately mix it up from week to week.  Some weeks it is primarily members of the public and other weeks we make sure there is a range of views.  It is more interesting for the viewers of the general discussion if people in the audience have first-hand experience of what they are talking about.  We are aware that there should be a range of views.  People are not given loaded questions.  They are entitled to ask the questions they want to ask.  We bring in people who have an informed insight into the topic.</p><p>  The "Prime Time" revamp has been very successful in terms of audience appreciation and has allowed us flexibility in terms of using the three programmes across the week.  It gives us a vehicle if we have an investigative film ready to run.  We can put it into one of those slots.  We use the audience in different ways.  Sometimes there will be a big studio audience and sometimes a smaller panel.  We are trying to provide a range of experience with the audience, using the "Prime Time" slots in different ways.</p></speech>

Was anything learned from the experience of the presidential election, when the format spectacularly blew up in the face of RTE?  There was unfairness to the people expecting to go on to represent a particular view, whether political, spiritual, religious or economic.  A certain degree of fairness is lost in the fact that RTE selects the audience.</p></speech>

We learned many lessons from the presidential debate.  We have had one or two subsequent debates, including on the children's referendum, where we implemented the new guidelines and clear criteria for selecting the studio audience.  The weekly "Prime Time" is on individual topics and is a little bit different.  No party feels it gets a fair crack of the whip, whether in opposition or in government.  There should be a range of voices to provide a range of perspectives on the debate.</p></speech>

I apologise if it seemed I was oblique about contractors, because that was certainly not the intention.  To clarify, Deputy O'Donovan mentioned the BBC figures, in which 19 stars were paid over &pound;22 million.  Deputy O'Donovan cited a figure of &pound;500,000, but in some cases the salaries are well in excess of &pound;2 million.  I accept there is more competition in the UK and the audiences are bigger, but we can put that to one side.  Before RTE adopted the strategy of reducing its top talent, the average of the top ten in 2008 was under &euro;500,000.  It was &euro;444,000.  Before any reductions were taken, that was the figure.  That clarifies the point about contractors.  It refers to a combination of contractors and a couple of employees.  We are not yet finished because negotiations are continuing but, projecting the figure forward, the average in 2013 will be under &euro;300,000, closer to &euro;280,000.  That is a significant reduction in our top talent.  No one is saying that is not a large figure, but it is a substantial reduction.  The reductions were disclosed in March and range from 21% to 68%.  They have been significant, although they pale to insignificance next to the BBC figures.</p><p>  Deputy O'Donovan mentioned that the pay cuts at RTE involved the lower-paid staff.  The pay cut was taken in 2009.  It was taken very quickly by our staff in response to the economic downturn in 2008.  It was a graduated pay cut from 2.35% for lower earners up to 12.5% for higher earners.  We implemented what was a fair pay scale reduction so people who earned more took more of a cut and those who earned less did not take as much of a cut.</p><p>  With regard to exits, we mentioned a figure of 20% of staff leaving between 2008 and 2011.  Over 16% of those were managers, so the exits were not all from the staff element.  They have also been from the higher-paid managerial grades, so we hope balance applied to the cuts in pay and the staff numbers leaving the organisation.</p></speech>

We undertook consultation in terms of best practice.  Sometimes, as we saw at the BBC, other companies get into difficulties with regard to editorial issues.  We should not necessary look at everyone as ideal.  We should try to get a range of views and inputs so that it is not narrow.</p><p>  It is important to clarify the issue concerning resignation.  I assume the Deputy meant the previous managing director of news, who was not sacked and has had that clarified in newspapers; he took early retirement.  He is one of the people I respect most out of all of the people I have ever worked with.  He will not be in some wilderness where he will find it hard to find employment.  He is incredibly busy, as one would expect of someone with his range of talents.  With regard to the specific question about me, I have answered it on the previous two occasions I was here.  It is common knowledge that I was prepared to take accountability.  In a leadership position, one must take accountability and show responsibility and leadership.  It is not an issue in terms of how we handle this; it is more a question of how the organisation has come through it.  Has the organisation come through the most difficult editorial crisis in its history?  It is a credit to the organisation that it has.  That is not to say we will not make mistakes again; we will.  We cannot get into the territory of investigative journalism and not make mistakes.  We are trying to minimise the mistakes.</p><p>  The Minister has made it clear that he does not see the licence fee increasing and, ultimately, it is his call.  We have been arguing that a whole range of money is lost to the licence fee through evasion, the sound and vision fund, collection fees, the funding of RTE, the funding of TG4, the programming we provide for TG4 and a range of other items.  What we have said is that there is an opportunity to look at overall funding levels if there will be an increase in public funding through some mechanism.</p><p>  I disagree with the point that RTE needs to operate more as a commercial concern.  If we are receiving public funding, people must see what is different about us.  That does not mean we do not need to maximise commercial revenues.</p> <p>Moving RTE more into the sphere of being a commercial broadcaster separates its identity from the other commercial broadcasters.  It undermines the case for public funding and means that RTE will no longer be able to afford the range of programmes.  RTE invests in drama and young people's programming and does 60 hours of live news and current affairs every week.  We invest in a whole range of programmes in which our competitors do not, including Irish language, performing groups, etc.  If we abandon that and chase a commercial revenue, then why do we have RTE?  Why do we have public funding of a broadcaster?  We are still dual funded and we need, particularly now, to maximise the commercial revenues but RTE needs to have a separate public service identity.</p><p> The Deputy's final point is always a difficult one.  President Obama earns $400,000 per year, or $500,000 when other allowances are included.  I do not know that any of our people are earning three times that.  This question surfaces all the time.  Many people in the Irish semi-State sector earn more than that.  In the UK, 9,000 people in the public sector earn more than the British Prime Minister - 320 work in local councils and hundreds of them work in the NHS.  These comparisons are difficult and they are not necessarily comparing apples with apples but I understand that people have looked at the fees we were paying and have had a concern.  I say again that we have tried to address that.  I believe we have addressed it a more wide-ranging way than other areas where people have concerns.  The process is not complete yet.  </p></speech>

We are stewards on behalf of our audience.  We receive &euro;181 million and, in turn, we generate approximately 50% more in terms of commercial income.  That is what we are mandated to do.  Our contribution to the Irish economy in 2011 was &euro;384 million overall.  RTE supports 3,550 people in the Irish economy.  In terms of indigenous programming, what we spend and the wider creative economy, it is &euro;249 million.  What Sky takes out of the Irish economy - it runs to several hundred million euro - compared to what is ploughed back into it in terms of employment and the spend on indigenous programming is very marked.</p><p>  Independently, a survey of the Irish adult population found that 75% said they were proud of RTE and of its content.  There are important considerations.  Of course, we have to demonstrate clear value and what we do with that &euro;181 million.  Allowing for our broad remit and what we are as a public service provider, we work hard to serve our audience.</p></speech>

With the imminent change from the television licence to whatever broadcasting charge will be implemented, the nature of the relationship of the public will change with that.  There was some cover for those who chose not to pay the &euro;160.  They could kick the television out the window and say they would not watch it anymore.  That is fine but that will not happen anymore.  It becomes a kind of consumer base to a taxpayer.  That is a different relationship and requires different scrutiny.</p><p>  With that in mind, there is much focus on salaries and so on.  I would prefer to look at value for money, where the money goes and how it is spent.  Does the consumer-taxpayer, or something similar to a taxpayer, get value for money and what they require from RTE?</p><p>  We have listened to the testimony about many of the reductions which have taken place and they are quite severe.  That is accepted.  In terms of the reduction in staff numbers, how many staff were full-time, part-time and on contract?  Were there any compulsory redundancies?  If there was not, are compulsory redundancies an option for management?  On the payroll costs, relative to total costs, the presentation mentioned &euro;153 million out of &euro;353 million.  How does that compare with similar broadcasters in terms of the ratio of payroll to other costs?  </p><p>  The witnesses said they were working in a very challenging commercial environment in regard to advertising.  Has RTE reduced advertising rates?  I am not sure how it charges for advertising, whether it is per minute or per second.</p><p>  I have some concerns about the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  When people come up with a report and say it is broadly positive, people say: "Well they would say that".  RTE has spent quite a lot of time advertising RTE in respect of the PricewaterhouseCoopers report.  Has there been a cost evaluation of that element of advertising?  I do not want to get into a debate on whether that is good or bad.  If it was a corporate decision taken by RTE, what is the value of that?  </p><p>  The witnesses said there were 5,000 hours of home produced broadcasting, which is a huge amount and which is what we are talking about here in terms of what RTE does.  Has there been any assessment carried out on the price per hour that cost?  If there has been, how do we compare internationally, if there are comparisons?  I accept the point made about figures from other commercial stations but do we have figures for international comparisons?</p><p>  To touch on the top ten salaries, I note there have been significant reductions in many of the contracts of some of the employees who are in this top ten.  Have there been variations in their responsibilities?  Are they doing more for less, less for less or significantly more for less?  As public representatives, we spend a lot of time in our cars and we listen to RTE radio, in particular current affairs programmes.  Some of the presenters or personalities who do not appear in the top ten are extremely capable and are very entertaining and competent.  I would suggest that, in many cases, they are better ambassadors for RTE.  It would not be the worst thing in the world to take a greater punt on those personalities who do not feature in the top ten.  They are quite effective when it comes to incisive broadcasting or entertaining broadcasting, in particular.</p><p>  I get exasperated when I see chat show hosts interviewing chat show hosts.  It is a bit of a merry-go-round between organisations.  One of the best interviews was done with a young man from Blennerville, Mr. Donal Walsh, who sadly passed away.  That was a particularly challenging piece of work and I thought it was public service at its best.  I would like to see more of that type of work, the launch of RTE junior and the work with the RTE archives rather than who is in Dublin with the next book deal or the next film, although I know that needs to be done.  Challenging the audience is broadcasting at its very best and it is what RTE does best.</p> <p>If I was asked, I would like to see much more of this rather than Michael Parkinson or Graham Norton again on RTE.  Perhaps I am cynical about it, but what RTE does best is the type of interview Mr. O'Connor did with Mr. Donal Walsh.  Work like that is what it does best and that should be the focus.</p></speech>

I have always given great praise to RTE, but I have never been able to understand the obscene wage structure for those at the top.  In the past we were told advertising paid for many of the top earners, but their earnings should have been related to the size of population or audience as much as anything else.  Ireland is a small country of 4.5 million people, compared to a population of 60 million in Britain and it is beyond belief there is a mindset that we can have broadcasters with the same wage structures as those in Britain.  How many of the top earners have different wages for working on radio and television?  Is this right?  Ms O'Keeffe has said the average salary was &euro;300,000, but if people are double jobbing, is this taken into account in the calculation?  Are their taxes paid directly by RTE or do they use companies to avail of tax breaks?  I do not know whether that is true, but I keep hearing it is the case.  I am not even sure whether I should ask the question, but it has been said many times that they do not pay the same taxes as everyone else while taking home massive earnings.</p><p>  RTE's revenue is down by more than &euro;100 million.  Is there a critical mass of staff?  Is there a cut-off point for staff reductions?  I acknowledge the organisation has reduced staff numbers substantially during the years, but is the point approaching at which no more can be cut?</p><p>  With regard to advertising, there is an ongoing debate about whether alcohol advertisements should be permitted.  Does Mr. Curran have a view on this?  Does he believe that in an ideal world such advertisements should not be broadcast?  Would this cost the station substantially?</p><p>  I enjoy many of the home produced programmes.  Are they much cheaper to make than buying programmes on the open market or do they cost a great deal more?</p><p>  How many legal actions are lodged against RTE annually?  How much do they cost every year?</p><p>  Mr. Curran has stated the average staff salary is &euro;55,000, which excludes contractors.  Is that correct?  I hear the average salary at TV3 is in excess of &euro;30,000, but I do not know whether that is correct.  Can RTE learn lessons from the way that station manages its budget without a subvention of any description?</p><p>  Mr. Curran has stated that, as the staff and wage reductions kick in, RTE will begin to generate a profit and that the deficit of &euro;60 million will reduce.  How long will it take to return to profitability?</p></speech>

He is correct that it is not a question of cuts alone.  One should assess value for money in terms of how effective they are and one way to do this is to look at the transmitted hour cost or the cost of programming.  While it is difficult to compare programmes, as one programme is not the same as another, we have shown significant reductions in our per transmitted hour cost.  For example, the average cost per transmitted hour for RTE One decreased by 29% between 2008 and 2012, while the figure for RTE Two decreased by 21%.  The number of transmitted hours has not decreased hugely.  Similarly, in the case of radio, the average cost per transmitted hour across all services has decreased significantly - for Raidi&oacute; na Gaeltachta by18%; Lyric FM, 20%; 2FM, 24%; and Radio 1, 24%.  As well as maintaining output, we have tried to consistently reduce year on year the transmitted hour cost.</p><p>  Deputies Noel Harrington and Dessie Ellis referred to the cost of indigenous programming which is significantly higher than that of acquired programming because of the level of production involved.  When we buy something in, we acquire a licence, but when one makes a programme, whether in RTE or the independent sector, significant research, production, etc, is required, which means that the cost of an indigenous programme is significantly higher than that of an acquired programme.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2013-05-22a.713" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Breda O'Keeffe" time="11:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2013052200014#N00700"><p>It is difficult to compare the type of programme unless it is exactly the same.  We have tried to do this.  We have engaged with European broadcasters in benchmarking costs per hour.  We have had a number of those and always get into difficulties in terms of how somebody accounts for something, the different methods of costing, etc.  It can, therefore, be difficult to compare with our European counterparts.  Drama is one area in which costs are similar.  One might argue about the quality of drama and which is better or worse, but we have compared ourselves with the BBC.  For example, "Eastenders" costs more than double what it costs to produce "Fair City", while "Casualty", another well known drama in the United Kingdom, costs between four and five times more.  While they have different audiences, they are similar soap dramas.  That is not necessarily a consistent factor across the board, but it is one comparison at which we have looked.</p><p>  We  have also benchmarked the resources we put into our programmes against those put in by our European counterparts, including the number of hours of research involved, editing and so on.  Both RTE and the independent sector compare favourably with them.  We show levels of efficiency that compare well.  Another comparison in the context of value for money and efficiency involves head count.  Is a 21% reduction enough?  For example, the head count in Danmarks Radio and YLE in Finland is considerably higher than that for RTE.  YLE had more than 3,000 staff at the end of 2011 and provides a similar level of service.</p> <p>NRK, the Norwegian state broadcaster, had a headcount of over 3,500.  When we look at our European broadcaster counterparts and the level of services they produce, as a public service broadcaster we compare favourably.</p><p> We were asked whether the 500 people who have left were mostly part- or full-time.  While I do not have the figures to hand, the majority were full-time staff.  Contractors are outside of that number, so the 500 were RTE staff.  I do not have the numbers for the reduction in contractors but we reduced the cost of contract resources and supplementary resources by more than 25% in that period.  Through rate cuts, in the same way that staff took pay cuts, our contractors took a similar level of cut and the use of our contract resources has been reduced.</p></speech>

When we contract with individuals for services, we contract with them on the basis on which they operate.  If they have a limited company or are a sole trader, that is the basis upon which we contract with them.  The obligation to return taxes appropriately to the Revenue Commissioners is their responsibility, not the responsibility of RTE.  Their tax affairs are their own affair and they often engage agents and accountants to organise such matters on their behalf.  It is their responsibility but we insist contractors have tax clearance certificates.  Ultimately, it is a contractor's responsibility to deal with the Revenue Commissioners appropriately.</p></speech>

That is copper-fastened when it comes to security but also with regard to pensions.  If we look at the cost of providing a 40-year pension, it is significant, and actuarially, we should look at what it would cost to have 50% of income at a point in time that is indexed and compare it to contracts of three years' duration with companies or sole traders.  We take on no liability at all for these other benefits that last for a long time, particularly defined benefit pensions.  We must take into account a number of factors.</p><p>  If we have regard to the requirement for us to exploit commercial opportunity, it is important that we take into account how a particular programme performs and the audience it attracts.  At a point in time, if something is not working out, we maintain the right to terminate the contract.</p></speech>

We had to drop output.  If we did an audit of the 20 or 30 people who appeared regularly on RTE in 2007 compared to now, we would see a lot of movement, as is always the case in these areas.</p></speech>

If a presenter or top talent is providing both radio and television services, we encompass them in one contract.

This is unfortunately becoming a bigger issue in the market, as happens in a recession.  We must constantly look at where we are placed with our competitors.  We publish our prices, which can put us at a disadvantage, but that is part of our transparency.  Price is something we constantly look at in commercial terms.</p><p>  The PwC report was the first time we have done such a report.

Other organisations have done this sort of report, but we had not done it before.</p><p>  Deputy Ellis asked if home-produced programmes are cheaper than those we acquire.  The average price of a home production is &euro;40,000, while the average price of an acquired programme is &euro;2,700.  Home productions costs are one of the reasons a public service broadcaster, with a higher commitment to home production, must be properly funded.</p><p>  Deputy O'Mahony asked about legal costs and we will get that information for him.  He also asked about profit.  We are still targeting financial stability this year.  It is a difficult market and I cannot say where it will go in the second half.

We do monitor promotion time.  Every broadcaster allocates promotion time and it is hugely effective.  We also allocate time to supporting the arts and a whole range of different things.  We monitor how that increases, where it is spent and how it is allocated.  In terms of contracts, some of our contractors work for others.  That is part of the reason they have a contract and that is reflected.  One will see broadcasters on television who work for other rival radio stations.  Deputy John O'Mahony asked about the sound and vision pool of money.  The figure is 36%.</p></speech>

What was the purpose of the PricewaterhouseCoppers involvement because at this stage it crops up virtually every time we switch on the radio or television.  There was reference to how it benefits the economy.  I presume that means that the money people gave to RTE benefited the economy and that it includes the licence fee.  It is rather like a Deputy commissioning a report on what amount of money he or she contributes to the local economy from his or her wages and expenses and putting it up as a plus as to why people should vote for him or her.  That would be ridiculous.  It is actually the people's money that is being used to tell to us how great is RTE.  Would it not have made more sense to leave the slots free for health promotion or getting people into sport?  What is so important about this that RTE has to tell us all it is contributing to the economy with our money?</p><p>  In regard to the pay of some of its presenters, a Deputy said that people are very good at having a go at us in regard to our pay.  By God, they are right because we get paid far too much.  That does not exclude us from asking why, say, Marian Finucane, according to the latest figures available to me for 2011, receives &euro;492,000 per year for bringing her friends around on a Saturday and Sunday morning on national radio.  The witnesses mentioned how important these people are from an advertising point of view and where would RTE be without them.  Where would Marian Finucane and Pat Kenny be without RTE?  It is a kind of symbiotic relationship.  Nobody would know who they are were it not for RTE.  When RTE decides their value, how does it come to conclusions?  Does it look at what people are paid in Radio Manchester?  I doubt if anybody is paid &euro;0.5 million for four hours work in Radio Manchester and, if so, I do not know how it could remain open for business.  How is the pay calculated for these people?</p><p>  An excellent point was made by the Deputy on my left about the fact that RTE has new presenters who do not appear in the top ten.  It is refreshing to hear new people on RTE Radio because it is like groundhog day at this stage.  For how many decades do we need to hear these people who bring their own personal opinions to the airwaves?  It is time they were moved on and that RTE used some of its talent that does not seem to cost a fortune.  If it did, they would appear in the top ten.</p><p>  RTE does a good job in certain ways.  It would want to as it gets enough money.  It would want to do something good.  It is inevitable that it does something good.  I admit RTE has improved from the days when it started in the evening with "Upstairs Downstairs" and closed at 11 p.m.  That is an improvement but many more improvements could be made.  From the point of view of value for money for presenters, if in the morning RTE was to say to Marianne Finucane that it would give her &euro;100,000-----  </p></speech>

Has RTE offered any of these wonderful people who present radio and televisions shows &euro;100,000 per year?  Has it asked if they would work for that amount and, if not, that it would look for somebody else?  Where would they go?  Who would take them on board?  I cannot see anybody taking them on board and if somebody did, so be it.</p><p>  With regard to how RTE employs these people  through companies, is that its way of getting them at a cheaper rate as it does not have to pay them pensions and so on?  Is it a case that the tax system, while it is outside the control of RTE, actually facilitates RTE in getting them?  Is that how RTE views it?</p></speech>

There are times where we would not have the resources to look at comparisons and where one is tapping into expertise one asks a consultancy that has a reputation or an expertise in certain areas to look at how we are performing, either in terms of costs or how we compare against other international television stations.  That expertise is drawn into the organisation to help with planning and around our performance.  As I said, a modest amount was allocated to that report, both in terms of the air space we have given to it and also what we spent on it.</p></speech>

In terms of the new presenters, we fully agree with what has been said.  Any broadcaster needs refreshing.  I said it earlier and I will say it again.  When we are asked about this aspect, much of the discussion is around the highest paid earners but we have a host of people who are not in the top ten who offer amazing value and to whom the public respond incredibly positively.  They do an amazing job.  I accept the point the Deputy made and I am glad he made it, namely, it is noticeable that we are bringing more of those people through.  It is noticeable in radio and in news, in terms of initiatives Mr. Bakhurst has undertaken, and in television.  Any broadcaster needs that balance between experience and others.</p><p>  That answer would have been included in terms of what Ms O'Keeffe and Mr. Dalton said.  There is a range of issues around pension, flexibility, ability to replace, and also the earlier question in terms of people working for others, that has led all broadcasters to have a proportion of on-air talent who are paid through companies.</p></speech>

However, the only reason they are big cuts is because they were on huge money in the first place.  If they were on &euro;100,000 then a 30% cut would be a large cut.  Although 30% of &euro;400,000, &euro;500,000, &euro;600,000 or &euro;700,000 is, in percentage terms, a big cut, it still leaves them on ridiculous salaries.  It cannot be justified in a country with this population.  The idea that they are geniuses that cannot be replaced does not hold.  That is simply not the case.  Why does RTE have them on short-term contracts when they have been there for decades?  We are sick of looking at them at this stage.  Can RTE change them?</p></speech>

This was ongoing when I came to the job and the decision had been taken.  I spoke to the director general and my predecessor about it.  I have no doubt that at the time it was the right decision.  We had an expensive premises and we were operating in a decidedly expensive part of London, and unnecessarily so.  We were operating in a particular way there as well.  We had to save substantial amounts of money across the news department.  Had we not shut the London bureau we would probably have been unable to maintain a presence in the region.  These are the types of trade-off we have had to make.</p><p>  Deputy Phelan remarked that there was an offer from the BBC.  To my knowledge, that is not correct.  In fact, the director general and I are keeping the London bureau and the coverage from London and the United Kingdom under review to see how we are doing, in particular with the events coming up in the UK, including the general election and, potentially, a referendum on the UK's future in Europe and a referendum on Scottish independence.  Among other things that story is not going away.  We are keeping it under review.  As part of the process we have spoken to the BBC and other broadcasters about the potential of sharing premises.  Even with my background, the response from the BBC has not been very positive whereas other broadcasters have been more positive.  We are still exploring options and if at some point we have the resources we may do something.  The London operation is high on the list of areas we might revisit, but if we did something we would do it in a very different way.</p></speech>
