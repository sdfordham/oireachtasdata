Before I expand on this, and in response to queries from members, I want to make a point regarding motions in general.  It relates to Standing Orders.  Standing Order 84(2) of the D&aacute;il provides:</p><blockquote>It shall be an instruction to each Select Committee that-----(a) it may be only consider such matters, engage in such activities, exercise such powers and discharge such functions as are specifically authorised under its order of reference and under Standing Orders;<br /><br />(b) such matters, activities, powers and functions shall be relevant to, and shall arise only in the context of, the preparation of a report to the D&aacute;il.</blockquote> <p>Standing Order 70(2) of the Seanad Standing Orders provides for the same in respect of the preparation of a report to the Seanad.</p><p>A strict interpretation of this Standing Order means that motions are not allowed in committee.  However, a more liberal and, certainly, a more pragmatic interpretation allows a motion in committee as long as it refers to matters within the remit of the committee and, when agreed, it is reported to both Houses.  In my view, the liberal interpretation of Standing Orders should be applied.  However, I do not think submitting motions and the inevitable amendments to the motions will enhance the work and the productive output of the committee.  I believe this committee will be more effective if, as much as possible, we take a collegiate approach and make collective decisions on important policy issues that fundamentally affect the education system, students, parents and teachers.</p><p>In that context, it is open to the committee to agree the wording of resolutions that can be sent to the Minister for Education and Skills and-or other relevant Ministers for an urgent response.  Such resolutions can also, where appropriate, include a number of succinct but clear recommendations.  A resolution can take the form of a report by including a cover page and can be laid before both Houses, thus making it a public document.  This way of working proved successful in a number of former Oireachtas committees, including previous committees on education.  I propose that members raise issues that they wish to have discussed, with a view to agreeing a resolution under "Any Other Business".  Alternatively, when a significant issue arises at a meeting, we can go into private session at the end of it to agree the wording of a resolution and resume in public session when it has been agreed to.  Members may indicate if they wish to proceed in this way before a meeting concludes and I can initiate this if I believe the issue warrants it.  It would be helpful if a member, either prior to the commencement of a meeting or possibly on the day before, were to indicate to me if he or she would like to raise a matter.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

Members will be aware that the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, has a statutory function under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act 2004 to provide the Minister for Education and Skills with policy advice on the education of children and others with disabilities or special educational needs.  The council provided policy advice in 2013 which concluded that elements of the current model for allocating special needs resource teaching supports were flawed.  In particular, it reported that the existing allocation system was inequitable, as children in less well off areas could experience delays in accessing support because of delays in accessing assessments which were required for the allocation of resource teaching hours; that the general allocation model used to allocate learning support teachers was inequitable as it took little account of the differing needs of different schools, as allocations were made on the basis of the number of mainstream teachers in each school; that there was a real risk that children were being diagnosed as having a special educational need for resource allocation purposes rather than such a diagnosis being required for health reasons; and that there was a spectrum of ability and disability within every category of special educational need and that the existing system allocated the same level of support for students within certain categories of special educational needs, even though one student might have a greater need for support than another with the same disability. </p> <p>  Following the publication of this policy advice, the NCSE established a working group which was chaired by Mr. Eamon Stack to develop proposals for a new model based on the policy advice.  In 2014 the working group recommended that the existing special needs teacher allocation model be replaced by a new model to allocate supports on the basis of the profiled educational needs of schools.  It proposed that the allocation of additional teaching supports to schools in the future be based on two components.  The first is a baseline component provided for every mainstream school to support inclusion, prevention of learning difficulties and early intervention.  The second is a school educational profile component, which takes into account the number of pupils with complex needs enrolled in the school, the learning support needs of pupils, as evidenced by standardised test results and the social context of the school, including disadvantage and gender.  The combination of a baseline allocation based on school size and profiled allocation would give a fairer allocation to each school, which recognises that all schools need an allocation to provide special needs support, but which would also provide a graduated allocation to take into account the actual level of need and pupil mixture in each school.  It is intended that the new model would replace the existing system of the general allocation model or learning support allocations, combined with NCSE allocations, with a single profiled allocation model for schools.</p> <p>  In February 2015 the then Minister for Education and Skills announced that she was not proposing to change the way in which teachers were allocated to schools for children with special educational needs for the 2015-16 school year.  In taking this decision she was guided by the advice given in the NCSE working group's report, which recommended that sufficient time be allowed for consultation before the new model was implemented.  A number of the education partners had also suggested a pilot scheme of the model be implemented.  To maintain momentum behind the NCSE's proposal, the Minister established a pilot scheme of the new allocation model, which took place during the 2015-16 school year.  Following a selection and invitation process, 47 mainstream schools, including 28 primary and 19 post-primary schools, participated in the pilot scheme.  Schools in various parts of the country and of different type and size participated in it to provide for the broadest possible representation.  The pilot scheme was developed to test the new model in a number of schools and allow for the practical effect of its application in pilot scheme schools to be gauged.</p><p>It also allowed us to take into account the learning experiences of schools, principals, pupils and the views of parents over the course of the pilot prior to the full implementation of the new allocation model.  Throughout the pilot the Department gathered information from the participating schools.  This information was gathered using surveys, information and training days, self-reflective questionnaires and a formal review undertaken by the Department's inspectorate.  A review of this pilot has now been finalised by the inspectorate.  In summary, the review found that the new model has been positively received by schools and parents; schools indicated that they welcomed the increased flexibility and autonomy provided by the model to allocate resources based on need; most schools believe the model allows more scope for team-teaching, targeted interventions, mix of in-class and group work, with less focus on withdrawal and one-to-one teaching; schools welcome the move away from the unnecessary labelling of children in order to secure resources and welcomed that they no longer need to wait for diagnosis; and that this facilitates intervention at an earlier stage based on the schools identification of need.  In addition, schools indicated a belief that they were broadly well supported in meeting the needs of children with special educational needs.  Most schools acknowledged that over the course of the pilot their whole-school approaches had improved and that they were targeting students more effectively.  Schools reported improvements in their planning for students, better collaboration between classroom and support teachers and better tracking of student progress.</p><p> As part of the recent budget announcements for 2017, the Minister for Education and Skills announced that following development and piloting over the past number of years a new model for the allocation of teaching resources for children with special educational needs will be implemented from September 2017.  An additional &euro;18 million will be provided in 2017 to provide for approximately 900 resource teacher posts.  The additional provision, which is being made for 2017 to support this model, will ensure that it can be introduced successfully; that it can provide additional resources to meet the needs of children and schools; that these resources will be placed in the schools where the needs are greatest; and that it can ensure a successful transition from the existing model to the new model without too much disruption for schools.  Allocations will be made to schools which provide a baseline allocation for each school, while also taking into account each school profile, including the number of pupils with complex needs in the school, the extent of learning needs in the school as evidenced by standardised test scores and an allocation which takes account of disadvantage and gender for each school.  While schools will have greater discretion as to how they can distribute resources under the new model based on the individual needs of pupils, it is intended that there will be no reduction in allocations made to schools in respect of pupils previously in receipt of a low-incidence special needs allocation.</p><p> Engagement with education partners, parents and disability representative bodies has been ongoing regarding the development of this new model and will continue until its introduction.  Further details regarding implementation of the new model will be announced in the coming months.  I will now ask Ms Teresa Griffin, chief executive officer of the National Council for Special Education, NCSE, to make her opening statement on the council's policy advice on supporting children with autism spectrum disorder in schools.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Teresa Griffin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016102700002#D00200"><p>I, too, thank the Chairman and members of the joint committee for the invitation to attend this meeting.  The National Council for Special Education, NCSE, takes seriously its role of providing the Minister for Education and Skills with independent, expert evidence-informed policy advice on the education of children with special educational needs.  It is one of our key roles.  In preparing this particular piece of policy advice on supporting students with autism spectrum disorder we reviewed an extensive range of relevant national and international research.  We commissioned two specific studies to establish the most up-to-date position in terms of research to evaluate practice in our schools and to identify good practice in other countries.  We attended national and international conferences and we consulted widely, with over 30 meetings held with students, parents, education partners and stakeholders, including the HSE.</p> <p>  We visited ten schools and we had 16 presentations made directly to council members from parents, teachers and academics.  In terms of findings, we established that 14,000 students or one in every 65 students enrolled in Irish schools has a diagnosis of autism spectrum disorder, ASD.  This school prevalence rate of 1.55% is substantially higher than previously reported in Ireland but it is in line with more recent rates reported in the UK and the US.  We found that 86% of students with autism were enrolled in mainstream schools, with 63% in mainstream classes, 23% in special classes and 14% in special schools.  We found that in schools students with autism are generally well supported.  There has been considerable improvement in provision since the 2001 position set out in the report of the task force on autism.  For example, we now have over &euro;300 million specifically being invested in supports for children with autism, including, teachers, SNAs, grants and so on.  There are 2,500 teachers specifically allocated for children with autism.  There are 950 special classes for children with autism and 69% of students with autism need and have access to SNA support.  There are 20 special schools specifically for students with autism, although many more special schools enrol children with autism.</p> <p>  We found that students with ASD have access to an appropriate curriculum.  There is generally a good and improving range of placement options available.  Obviously, there are some things about which we remain concerned, particularly the continuing soft barriers to enrolment and our inability to require schools to open special classes as needed by the children in the community.  This can lead to a delay in delivery of sufficient specialist provision where a special class is needed.  We found that support for students with ASD is generally good at primary school level but that provision at post-primary level requires further development.  In terms of what was established by the research, there is an awful lot of research in this area but its quality is variable.  Some interventions are recommended without a clear evidential basis, which is very worrying for parents and teachers.  The research supports an education system that is flexible and responsive to students, who can have very different needs and respond very differently to interventions.  Our policy advice identifies some 34 evidence-informed interventions that may have some affect on some aspects of autism for some students.  While that statement seems very weak, children with autism are very different.  Two children with an identical diagnosis can respond very differently to interventions.  That is as strong as we can make it.</p> <p>  We have made 11 recommendations which were sent to the committee.  I will take this opportunity to highlight a few of them.  We identified a need for further investment in teacher professional development so that they have the expertise to identify students' needs and to be able to select and use evidence-informed interventions appropriately.  We recommend that teachers should have a minimum of three years' experience post-probation before being appointed a special class teacher because these classes have children with the most complex needs.  We found significant difficulties with the lack of consistent and sufficient access to therapeutic supports.  Investment in both health and education supports services is needed.  We have raised concerns about two educational support schemes.  We were unable to establish a robust evidential basis which justifies the Department's early intervention scheme being limited to certain categories of disability nor could we establish a robust basis for the Department of Education and Skills extended school year, also known as the July provision scheme, being limited to students with ASD.  We have advised the Department that it should seek legal advice in respect of the potential and equitable nature of these schemes.  We are also concerned that the current extended school-year scheme - July provision scheme - might result in potentially unsafe environments for students and staff.  We recommended that the current scheme be replaced with a safe, social summer day activity programme that is available for all students with complex educational needs.  I will now hand back to Mr. Tattan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.14" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dalton Tattan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ESJ2016102700002#D00300"><p>I again thank the chairperson and members of the joint committee for the invitation to brief them on the National Council for Special Education policy advice on supporting children with autism spectrum disorder in schools.</p> <p>  In the latter part of 2013, the Minister for Education and Skills formally requested the NCSE to prepare policy advice on the educational provision for children with autism spectrum disorders, in line with the NCSE&rsquo;s role under the Education for Persons with Special Educational Needs Act.  Following consultation, terms of reference for the review were confirmed in October 2013 and the Minister requested that the NCSE would review the timeframe for the completion of this work to see whether there was scope for a completion date before the end of Spring 2015.  The review was substantially concluded within the timeframe specified and following consultation with the Department of Education and Skills further consultations were arranged with a number of other Departments and offices, which further informed the review.  The NCSE submitted the draft report to the Department in September 2015 and the report was published in June 2016. </p> <p>  The Department has been long aware of the significant increases in ASD prevalence in recent years.  International studies have placed prevalence rates in the past at about 1% per cent of the population.</p><p>However, evidence gathered to support the development of the current policy advice indicates that prevalence rates are significantly higher than that and the NCSE has advised that for planning purposes, the Department should now consider a prevalence rate of 1.55% or one child in every 65.  The NCSE acknowledges that some of this increase may be linked to changes in diagnostic practices, service availability or just greater awareness of autism spectrum disorders.  In any event, it was considered timely and appropriate that the Department would review its approach to the education of children with ASD in Irish schools.</p><p> Educational provision for children with autism in Irish schools is currently informed by a range of published research including the report of the task force on autism of 2001 and An Evaluation of Educational Provision for Children with Autistic Spectrum Disorders of 2006.  These reports, while still relevant and important, cannot be considered current.  It was timely and necessary to take account of national and international developments and best practice which has arisen in the intervening period.  Also, it is necessary to take account of what is presently working well in our system and what needs to be improved.  As the NCSE has outlined, the new policy advice includes a number of conclusions and findings.  In particular, the NCSE has found that students are generally well supported in schools with an appropriate curriculum, extensive teacher and SNA supports, an improving range of educational placements supported by improved accommodation and equipment, improved teacher knowledge and understanding and a generally good standard of provision at primary and post-primary levels.  These findings are largely based on evidence the NCSE gathered in consultation with a wide range of stakeholders, including schools, parents and students themselves.  The Department acknowledges the findings and conclusions of the NCSE and, despite the recognition that students are largely well supported, sees no reason for complacency.  As such, the Department will continue to strive to ensure that all children with special educational needs, including children with autism, will continue to receive the supports they need in order to access and participate in their education.</p><p> We take seriously the NCSE's concerns as outlined in the report.  In particular, the Department acknowledges the concern that its early intervention scheme remains limited to certain categories of disability.  Both the Department and the NCSE were centrally engaged with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs in the development of that Department's AIM programme for the inclusion of children with disabilities in the mainstream preschool provision, which is the ECCE scheme.  While this scheme now provides for supported access for children with disabilities, the Department will review its policies in respect of early intervention classes.  The NCSE has also expressed concerns regarding the Department's extended school year scheme known as July provision.  These concerns are that the scheme is inequitable as it is not more generally available to other children with complex needs.  The NCSE has also identified some concerns that the current extended school year scheme can result in potentially unsafe environments for both students and staff.  The Department acknowledges these concerns and has raised the issue with colleagues across a range of Departments with a view to exploring more equitable and secure options for the future.  However, the Department is acutely aware that parents place a very high value on July provision and I assure parents that there will be full consultation on any proposals regarding the scheme.</p><p> The NCSE's report includes 11 key recommendations which focus on improvements which might be considered to the range of provisions which are currently available for children with autism in schools.  The report's key recommendations focus on the development of teacher knowledge, skills and understanding of autism, the use of evidence-informed interventions according to student need, the need for better-resourced multidisciplinary health teams for children with disabilities, including children with autism, and the July provision scheme.  The NCSE estimates that implementing the school-based recommendations in the report would cost some &euro;20 million per annum.  Since the report was received, the Department has convened an implementation group with representatives of the NCSE, NEPS, the Inspectorate and external representatives to develop an implementation plan to ensure that the NCSE's recommendations are fully and appropriately considered and that a timetable for implementation is prepared.  Some of the recommended actions are not straightforward and their successful implementation will require considerable planning.  Many will require additional investment.  The Department will fully engage with its partners in other Departments and agencies and will consult with relevant stakeholders as appropriate throughout the implementation process.</p><p> The programme for a partnership Government recognises that education is the key to giving every child an equal opportunity in life.  It contains a commitment to examine the adequacy of current special education access and funding provision.  The NCSE's policy advice is a significant step towards fulfilling this commitment.  However, further work is needed if we are to be sure that we are fully meeting the needs of children with special educational needs, including those with autism, in our schools.</p></speech>

I requested the list of schools from the Department and took the liberty of phoning a few of the principals yesterday.  In general, they were pleased with the new approach, which they feel is more proactive and equitable.  It allows them to make decisions themselves based on the best possible opportunities for the children in their schools and that is very welcome.  I will invite questions from the members but first I will kick off with a few of my own.  I will take three speakers at a time and then responses.</p><p>I have had an opportunity to look at some of the recommendations over the last few days.  I noticed that one of them related to the provision of early childhood development specialists to support children and families from preschool to the transition to primary school, which is hugely important.  I would like to hear the Department's views on the recommendation and about who would employ and pay these specialists.  Preschool education is often seen as the Cinderella of the education system in terms of supports and resources.  I would like to know what the thinking is in this regard.</p><p>I support the NCSE recommendation on the provision of multidisciplinary health supports to assist children with complex special needs but the reality is that very often children are on long waiting lists for speech and language and occupational therapy etc.  Has the Department been in contact with the Department of Health or the HSE to come up with a multi-agency approach, which is vital, and a strategic plan to address this issue which continues to be a very serious problem for children with special needs?</p><p>Teacher education is hugely important.  Speaking to teachers on the ground, I often find they are overwhelmed and do not feel they have adequate support or resources themselves in terms of their own education.  I am very conscious of that.  There is a centre in Middletown, County Armagh, which the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement visited and where the members saw absolute best practice and were very impressed.  The then committee wrote to the Ministers for Education in Northern Ireland and in the Republic to ask that the pilot teacher training scheme be implemented generally.  Has there been any contact in that regard?  The possibility of visiting the Middletown centre is something this committee might consider.  I wonder if the Department has plans to look at utilising the resources they have there?</p><p>I was taken aback to see in the policy advice document that resource teaching hours were sometimes given to teachers in post-primary schools purely because of spare capacity as distinct from there being any expertise in the area.  I am concerned about how widespread the practice might be.  Is there a system in place to monitor resource teachers' relevant training?  I note the recommendation that there is a need to develop mandatory programmes for all special needs assistants.  Is it the case that a significant number of special needs assistants working with children with autism do not have specialised training?  Again, that is an issue of importance.</p><p>On a more general note, the Minister announced in June that 860 new special needs assistants would be appointed by the end of 2016, which is very welcome.  However, there was an article in <i>The Irish Times</i>on 9 October stating that almost 400 special needs assistants were waiting to be vetted by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  If the Department is to implement these recommendations, which I welcome, how does it propose to rectify this situation?  It will clearly delay the introduction of new staffing.</p><p>The NCSE has referred to the need within the existing model for a diagnosis to be made before resources can be provided and the inherent danger of unnecessarily labelling a child.  Does the Department have any indicative figures of possible wrong diagnoses?  I support the new model, in that it will stop that practice.</p><p>I have a fear that sometimes children are labelled incorrectly, perhaps to secure funding and resources.  Are there any steps in place to deal with identifying children and reassessing a diagnosis?</p><p> There seems to be little joined-up thinking regarding the provision of post-school education and training or adult services for young adults with autism.  These young adults will still need support, suitable training and work placements as a prerequisite to securing a decent future for themselves with viable options.  I fully agree that this requires a multiagency approach.  Do the Department and NCSE have any insights to determine how it could be progressed effectively?</p><p> I note the comment on the fact the NCSE is sometimes waiting for schools to develop special classes.  I am very conscious of schools that have been in contact with the Department.  They have the required number of students, that is, six, but their applications have been turned down by the Department on the basis that neighbouring schools have adequate provision.  Having contacted these schools, I know they do not and instead have waiting lists.  I am concerned about that issue, because my understanding is that the reality is different in my constituency.  I visited a school last Monday in Coill Dubh in Kildare which has consistently looked for special classes over the past two or three years but has been refused.</p><p> I will now call on members.  Deputy Daly was the first to indicate.</p></speech>

As witnesses alluded to, the journey began in 2013 with the former Minister, Ruair&iacute; Quinn, and I was in the clock tower when we heard one of the first presentations on the new model.  I commend the former Minister for his ambition to grasp this nettle.  It is a very difficult issue.</p> <p>  The previous committee reviewed the model and invited delegations from the Department and other bodies to appear before it.  There was a universal welcome from members, the unions and parents' councils, and other organisations were all very supportive.  It is a very good news story and a positive development in the education field.  The Department and the NCSE, in particular, can be enormously proud of the work they have done on behalf of children with special learning needs.  They have progressed very far with very little anxiety having been created among parents and teachers so far.</p> <p>  That said, there has been some anxiety, of which the witnesses are well aware.  Teachers in particular have expressed anxiety.  As politicians, we had to face many groups through the INTO.  Different schools were called in to express their fears.  Change is always difficult.  What were the negative aspects of the pilot scheme?  Witnesses alluded to the positive aspects, of which there are many.  What aspects of the programme are the Department and NCSE considering changing based on the pilot scheme?</p> <p>  In the clock tower all those years ago, I referred to standardised testing.  It is funny how teachers regarded it as a punishment.  If children attain a STEN of eight, nine or whatever, teachers saw that as leading to a punishment and that resources would be taken away.  There is no accounting for how people will react.  There is no standardised testing for junior or senior infant classes - I understand it only begins in first class.  How does the scheme adapt to junior and senior infant pupils and prepare for their needs?  Standardised testing, which they are not covered by, is one of the fundamental models of the allocation system.</p> <p>  The backbone of this is teacher training.  From my time as a principal and teacher, I always had a policy that sometimes less can be more.  By their very nature, parents want more and more resources.  The reality is that in some schools teachers who find it difficult to teach can end up teaching resource classes.  Children in mainstream classes may have a very good classroom teacher.  Attending too many outside classes is not always the best for children.  I was delighted to see that 63% of children with autism are in mainstream classes, which is very positive and encouraging.</p> <p>  The heartbeat of this programme will be teacher training.  How far have the training colleges come, since my day, in addressing special needs learning?  How confident are the witnesses that the professional development for teachers is adequate?</p></speech>

A number of issues have arisen and it is important that they are teased out.  Under the new model, will it be the case that no school will lose out in the allocation of resource and learning support?  Does the increase referenced in the budget go beyond demographics and is it connected to this scheme?</p> <p>  The issue of unnecessary labelling has been mentioned.  Clearly, that labelling is professionally carried out - "labelling" is not a great word to use but it is what was said.  Is it the case that professionals are unnecessarily labelling children or is it simply not desirable that we use labels in the allocation of resources? </p> <p>  Post-primary provision was very carefully described by Ms Griffin using very judicious language.  She said it requires further development.  In terms of approving provision in primary schools, special classes and autism schools have been established.  Many autism schools were established by parents who put in a significant amount of work.  Some of the parents are now trying, as the Chairman mentioned, to get provision for their children following their 18th birthdays and into adulthood.  We are falling off a cliff in terms of post-primary provision.  What is actually being done about that?  What post-primary education is in place?</p> <p>  In terms of preschools, I do not think there has been any mention of the Department of Health.  Special needs assistants are part of the issue.  The Department of Health and HSE are in charge of the system.  I find it totally bizarre and disjointed that they decide what SNA resources children will get in preschool.  I ask that the responsibility be removed from those bodies and dealt with properly by the Departments of Education and Skills or Children and Youth Affairs, which administers the ECCE scheme.  The ECCE scheme is very disjointed.  I could not believe the situation pertaining to SNAs when I first came across it.  In my county the HSE is involved in their allocation.</p> <p>  It was mentioned that the there is an increase in the prevalence of autism.  It is also noted that this may be due to increased diagnosis.  Is that actually the case?  Is the Department aware of any other issues?  Parents and neighbours are aware that there seems to be an increase, and the figures show that.  People wonder about causes and reasons.  The witnesses have not been definitive in attributing the increase to better diagnosis.</p> <p>  The Department referred to the July provision.  The Department also said it was unable to establish a robust evidential basis which justifies the Department's early intervention scheme being limited to certain categories of disability.  I would like the witnesses to expand on that, and also the view that legal advice should be sought.  Does that mean some children are losing out and if they took a court case to seek early intervention they would succeed?</p></speech>

I will deal with the questions that are appropriate for the Department starting with the Chairman's questions.</p> <p>  In terms of multidisciplinary supports, members will be aware that the Programme for a Partnership Government includes a commitment to make provision for speech and language therapy through schools.  We have commenced that work.  We have raised the matter at a cross-sectoral meeting, which is a high level group comprised of ourselves, the Department of Health, the Department of Children and Youth Affairs and the HSE.  We raised the matter at the last meeting of this group and another meeting is due to take place shortly.  We have appointed Mr. Terry Reynolds in the Department of Education and Skills, who is seated behind me here, to take the lead on that and a lot of progress has been made.  The HSE is currently doing a mapping exercise to provide us with details of where all of the resources are and the costs, etc.  We expect to be able to progress the matter in the coming weeks.  I am not saying we will have it finalised but at least we will make some progress having identified where the resources are to be found.  The Chairman can be assured that progress has been made.</p> <p>  The Chairman mentioned teacher education, specifically the Middletown Centre for Autism.  As she will know, the centre is a significant project for the Department and is jointly funded by ourselves along with the Department of Education in Northern Ireland.  Until reasonably recently the investment by the Department of Education and Skills focused on teacher training and training for other professionals engaging with families and children with autism.  We have recently extended the initiative to provide second tier services for a small number of children who simply have not responded to the first tier services.</p> <p>  The Middletown Centre for Autism has been reviewed a number of times with the most recent review concluded in the past few months.  The reports are excellent and the joint inspectorate review highly commended the project.  We continue to fully support it.  We are fully aware of its benefits and the strategies deployed.  In particular, we are fully aware of the confidence that the project has given parents.  We have had a number of difficult cases where families had a number of children with autism.  The parents found it difficult to manage and cope but once the Middletown intervention was provided anxiety levels were significantly reduced and we have been very enthused by the outcomes.  We shall continue to provide support to the project.   </p> <p>  In terms of resource teachers and monitoring relevant training, the Department is conscious that under the current model, when we allocate resource teachers, it is not down to the Department who gets the job and whether it is the right person in the school, and whether it is the person with the appropriate skill set and training.  The NCSE has made recommendations in its autism advice.  It has made a number of recommendations in previous advices on the skill set and qualifications that resource teachers should have.  </p> <p>  In the context of the development of the new model and particularly in the context of the pilot, the Department developed a whole set of guidance on the matter.  We did so because we are conscious that not just the resource teacher but the classroom teacher and the principal should have access to the appropriate levels of training.  We have comprehensive guidance that we trialled through the pilot.  The Chairman may have heard from some of the principals that she spoke to in recent days that they found the resource to be very positive.  We have fed in the feedback generated by the pilot into our deliberations and we are tweaking the guidance that will be provided to all schools.</p> <p>  We are also in the process of developing the inclusion support service within the NCSE.  The service will include the special education support service.  We are hopeful the service will have a clearer and more focused approach to the development of the appropriate skill sets for teachers who deal with children with special educational needs, including children with autism.</p> <p>  We are conscious of the deficits in training for SNAs that have been identified.  It is a complex issue that has been raised on a number of occasions, specifically in the report on SNAs compiled by the committee's predecessor.  Currently, provision is made in the funding provided to boards of management to provide tailored training for their SNAs.  We have had a number of discussions with the management body for special schools which is called the National Association of Boards of Management in Special Education, NABMSE, and others on this particular issue.  We are conscious of the matter.  It does not form part of our current model because the model is about resource teachers in mainstream schools.  There are recommendations in the autism policy advice on training for SNAs so we are conscious of the matter.  In the event that boards of management are not suitably equipped for this then we will consider it in the context of the implementation of those policy advices.</p> <p>  We are aware of the dangers of labelling children.  The possibility that children have been wrongly diagnosed crops up on my desk quite often.  Parents and schools have let us know that they believe a diagnosis given to a child might not be accurate.  This risk is exacerbated because there is a requirement in the current model that a diagnosis will be available in order that a school will attract resources.  On introduction of the new model that requirement will be gone but the assessment will still be necessary.  An assessment will be necessary for a number of other schemes, including the SNA scheme.  It is also necessary to inform schools and the people who work with children what the difficulties are and how best to address them.  We believe that the removal of the requirement for a diagnosis in order that a school is provided with the resource to support the child will somewhat diminish the incidence of inappropriate diagnosis.  We have discussed this matter on numerous occasions with our colleagues in the Department of Health.  They take the same view as us that there are always risks associated with schemes that are diagnosis driven.  By and large, misdiagnosis is not a huge problem.  Often times, a misdiagnosis can happen because of a confluence of evidence provided to the diagnosing professional that might have been accurate at the time but leads to a conclusion that ultimately will not play out.  One of the areas in which we witnessed this in the past was when children were diagnosed with emotional behaviour disturbance in advance of them joining school.  In the past we had a diagnosis requirement that suggested the child constituted a danger to himself or herself and possibly to others as well.  We were anxious, in the case of a four or five-year old child that it is impossible for a diagnostician to say how a condition will play out in the classroom because the child simply has not been in the classroom.  We were anxious, as we included in our SNA circular, to see how a child might be impacted in the classroom before we made specific decisions about the resourcing requirements for that child.  In particular, we were anxious that children would be given an opportunity to demonstrate it and that teachers would be given an opportunity to deploy the continuum of need programme by the National Educational Psychological Service for those children.  We found that the initiative was quite successful.  A lot of children just settled in irrespective of the fact that they had a diagnosis.  It is the case that some children will have a diagnosis.  That diagnosis may be correct but it may not necessarily generate a need for additional support and over a period some diagnosed conditions will simply disappear.  That is true of some children but, unfortunately, not all children with autism.  </p> <p>  We are also conscious that there may be a gap in adult services and particularly for children with autism.  There is a high level of support throughout the schools system.  We are aware of the fear, and other members have raised this matter as well, that when children approach the end of their school period there will be nothing for them or insufficient cover for them.  We have discussed the matter with our colleagues in the HSE, particularly in terms of children who will move into residential care.  It is an ongoing discussion.  It is an area that the Department does not have full control over but, with that said, we are conscious of the need for additionality in terms of providing after school care, that may not necessary come from us, but also in terms of suitable transition programmes, work programmes and that kind of thing.  Our colleagues in the further education section have some programmes for children with a disability.  There is also the disability access route into further and higher education.  I agree with the Chairman that a bit of planning must take place.  We are conscious that time is moving on.  It is something that we can now consider in terms of the roll-out of the new model, how children will be assessed and moved through the system, and a planned move into work and further education.</p><p>I think I have covered all of the Chairman's questions.  </p><p> To respond to Deputy Jim Daly, I am glad that there is a perception that the new model has been universally welcomed.  Teachers have expressed some anxiety about the model and the Department is in regular contact - at least weekly - with the trade unions on the matter.  In particular, we have held a number of discussions with the Irish National Teachers Organisation in recent days and the response has, by and large, been positive. </p><p> The Deputy asked about negative aspects of the pilot scheme.  While there were very few negatives surrounding the pilot scheme and the model itself, there are ongoing concerns about the quantum of supports and resources provided.  It is axiomatic that the more supports the Department provides, the better it will be for all children, whether they have special educational needs or are developing typically.  However, there is a limit to the pot of resources available.  While concerns were expressed about the capacity of schools to do co-ordination work and so forth, these issues apply to the current and new models.  The latter is essentially a new and better way of deploying the resources available to the Department for allocation to the National Council for Special Education to be provided in schools.  By and large, few concerns were expressed in that regard. </p><p> Some of the concerns expressed were interesting.  Principals and teachers recognised that the new model would bring about a new relationship with parents who would no longer look to the National Council for Special Education for the provision of a quantum of resources for their child and would look instead to the school for this.  This will necessitate a new level of engagement.  The pilot schools were up for this, which is very positive and speaks very well of management and personnel in schools.  In point of fact, our guidance provides a significant degree of support for schools in terms of that level of engagement.  I do not regard this as a negative; rather, I would characterise it, in a positive way, as a concern. </p><p> An issue was raised about our use of standardised tests in calculating the new resources to be provided for schools.  The argument made is that if one uses standardised tests, the schools that have improved standardised test outcomes may believe they are being punished for performing well.  There are two sides to this argument.  The Department must take the view that every school that receives additional resources does its best with these resources and that if all schools are doing their best and one school is not performing as well as another, it will need additional help.  That said, there is a legitimate concern in this regard.  Our aim is to try to introduce the new model in such a way that no school will lose additional resources.  If that is the case and a school has a concern that it is being punished for achieving improved standards, the reality is that it is not being punished because it will not lose out as a consequence of the improved standards.  It may well be that the school's profile indicates that it needs a certain quantum of resources and that if its current allocation is higher than this quantum, it will, in the vast majority of cases, continue to receive it.</p><p> We have a piece of work to do on outliers.  With the additional 900 posts provided for us in the most recent budget, a very substantial resource, we will, by and large, be able to protect current resources for all schools which would otherwise lose resources.  I hope this will allay concerns.  There is, however, a concern that there may be some significant outliers.  For this reason, I will not give a commitment that this will be true in every case.  Once we have studied the outliers and engaged in a re-profiling exercise, we will have a better indication of the position.  We will need to complete the exercise a number of times to get the number right.</p><p> Deputy Jim Daly referred to teacher training and the provision of comprehensive guidance.  The guidance we have provided will provide teachers with significant additional skills to understand the needs of children they are identifying for the provision of support.  Much of what we are doing in the new model is giving legitimacy to a number of good practices that were already in place in schools under the old model.  We are providing resources for named children under the old model.  For good reasons, many schools were using these resources to deal with other children who were falling through the cracks because they had not received a diagnosis and everyone knew they were falling behind.  Under the new model, this can be done legitimately.  It is intended that schools will take the appropriate decisions on how to support children. </p><p> I have indicated that the National Council for Special Education has provided us with autism policy advice recommending enhanced training for teachers.  We are examining this advice and also conscious that the Teaching Council of Ireland has a number of provisions on this matter.  </p><p> Deputy Thomas Byrne asked whether schools would lose out.  I believe I have answered that question.  While we cannot yet state for certain that no school will lose out, other than those with very significant additional resources, we cannot state with certainty that this will be the case.  We will examine the matter in the coming months.</p><p> The resources provided for us are substantial.  As to whether they match demographic changes, they far exceed them.  Demographic changes would probably require approximately 200 or 220 additional posts, whereas we have been allocated an additional 900 posts, substantially more than what would be required.  This is a measure of the Government's commitment to the new model. </p><p> An issue arises with labelling.  Deputy Thomas Byrne asked whether professionals were mislabelling or if it was simply the case that the recommendation was that labelling was not necessary.  The latter rather than former scenario applies.  It has never been the case that labelling should have been a requirement to generate additional resources.  Schools are well placed to determine the learning needs of pupils and do not necessarily need to be told that a child has an emotional or behavioural disturbance or similar issue.  They see this in play and generally know well how to cater for it.  The labelling was essentially an administrative requirement for the Department.  The first step in the new model is to dispense with this unnecessary requirement. </p><p> Parents have expressed a concern about what has been described as the post-primary cliff.  We are conscious of this issue and working to support children through the transition into further and higher education and work.  There has been a substantial improvement in the number of special classes at post-primary level.  We are following up on the level of growth in primary schools in the past ten years and this is translating into special classes in post-primary schools.  There are issues about support levels in post-primary schools and the quantum of resources available to them will be enhanced under the new model.</p><p> While the relativity between primary and post-primary level will remain, there is a requirement for post-primary schoolchildren to develop independence, where possible.  Children tell us this themselves.  While there are anxieties in schools and parents may also be anxious about this, many post-primary schoolchildren would like to lose their special needs assistant, if possible.  We provided for this in the 2014 circular on special needs assistants in which we made provision for children having plans which between fourth and fifth class should include how their dependence on a special needs assistance would be reduced as they transitioned into post-primary education.  This is a difficult and contentious issue, but we are mindful of the needs of children and young adults as they develop.  We received a strong message from them that they did not necessarily like to be tied in these circumstances. </p><p> I will briefly address the resources available from the Department of Health for preschool education services.  The National Council for Special Education and the Department worked hand in hand with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs to develop the latter's enhanced early childhood care and education, ECCE, programme and the access route - the AIM programme - which ensures children with disabilities and special educational needs can be included in ECCE schools.  Significant additional resources have been provided for this purpose.  While the Health Service Executive continues to operate a number of preschool classes, we expect this to reduce over-----</p></speech>

The HSE is not allocated special needs assistants from the National Council for Special Education.  The Department also operates a number of special classes.  We have 127 early intervention classes for children with autism in mainstream schools.  As the AIM programme progresses, we will be able to ascertain over time whether it has been sufficiently successful to enable us to lower our dependence on that type of structure, as well as the HSE structure, and try to move the children in these classes into the AIM programme, like all other children with disabilities.  This is a work in progress and I expect it will take four or five years to mature to allow us to identify how it has been working.</p> <p>  Ms Griffin will answer the question on the increasing prevalence of autism.  We were asked a question about equity in July provision.  We are conscious that we are making such provision for children with autism but not for every child with special educational needs or disabilities.  The autism policy advice includes a recommendation, which we expected, based on the approach being inequitable.</p><p>It is argued that it is potentially inequitable and that, whatever the provision might be in the future, it should be opened up to children not just with autism but also to those with complex needs.  We have commenced discussions in this regard with our colleagues in the cross-sectoral team that I described earlier.  It is unclear where we will go with it.  We are conscious that parents, while not necessarily wedded to the idea of a July provision, recognise that it is a high level of support and would not like to lose it without it being replaced by something of equal value and significantly better merit.  One of the arguments about July provision is that it is not really what parents want, and I have had a number of discussions with parents' representative groups on it, but because it is available, it is all that is available.  If we were to change it to something that parents wanted, that might be more suitable and result in better outcomes for children with autism.  In doing that, we will examine whether and how it might be extended to cater for children with complex needs.  We have had a number of discussions with some autism representative groups as well and they have suggested that providing activities like summer camps might fit the bill.  We are still at the exploration stage though.</p></speech>

There is questionable benefit in early intervention for children generally, that is, those who are typically developing, other than the ECCE-type provision.  There is questionable benefit, therefore, in extending what the Department is currently doing in its preschool classes.  The point is addressed properly through the new access and inclusion model, AIM, where early intervention will be available to all children with special educational needs and disabilities through the ECCE provisions, supported by additional investment in that area.</p></speech>

The Chairman asked about who employs the early childhood specialists and pays for those schemes.  Under the access and inclusion model, AIM, that Mr. Mulkerrins has just spoken about, which the Department of Children and Youth Affairs runs, for the ECCE preschool year, the Better Start agency has been sanctioned to employ 50 preschool specialists.  They go into preschools and examine the applications, for example, where children are looking for additional supports.  They also provide advice to preschool leaders in respect of children with disabilities and how to support them.  That is the employment model the Department of Children and Youth Affairs has adopted.  We were quite neutral on it.  We just thought they were needed and did not mind who employed them.</p> <p>  There were a couple of issues that we had identified in terms of adult services.  Parents were telling us that when their children were going to school, they knew what provision was in place, but that there was a dearth of information when the children reached 18 and 19 years of age and they felt like their children were falling off a cliff or through so many cracks and that what was available was not quite appropriate.  That is why we recommended that there needed to be a multiagency approach.  An awful lot of money has been invested in developing potential and giving children hopes and options, but we now need to ensure that the appropriate options are available to them once they leave school.  That was a particular issue that we had identified.</p> <p>  On the Coill Dubh situation, it would be quite unusual that we would turn down a special class.  We turn them down where there are plenty of options in the area, but I will have to examine that particular case.</p></speech>

The situation is improving, but we need the power to require it of schools.  Schools are there for all children and should not be able to opt out of providing for certain categories of children.</p> <p>  Deputy Jim Daly asked if there was anything better being done now in teacher training colleges to prepare teachers for inclusion.  This year we commissioned a review of what is provided in initial teacher training to see what exactly is being covered in the courses.  It is not until we have evidence of what is happening that we will appreciate if there are still gaps.  Special education is now a compulsory module in teacher training, but we do not know what is being covered in the module.  It varies from college to college.</p> <p>  We have also spoken to the Teaching Council, particularly about the right of children to an education that is appropriate to their needs.  When it is examining and sanctioning training courses, it must be cognisant of the rights of children with educational needs to a differentiated education that is appropriate to their needs and it needs to ensure that teachers coming out of initial teacher education are prepared better.</p> <p>  On unnecessary labelling, we are aware, because they have told us, that professionals, where they can make children fit a certain category of disability in order for them to get a resource, even if those children do not theoretically meet the requirements of the actual label, will make them fit into that category of disability.  It is really bad that a child would be labelled simply to get an educational resource.</p></speech>

It is quite international.  In America it is known as "diagnosis for dollars" or "diagnosis for services".  Many of the diagnoses are subjective.  If a child is not a normal, typical, developing child and the only way of getting a resource is to label the child, people will do that.  We have concerns about it and say that it is unnecessary labelling for resource purposes.  As there can be confusion about it, it needs to be stated categorically that under the new model we are still referring to the need for assessment, but it is assessment to inform teaching and learning or assessment to inform parents about how to better support their children.  It is not necessarily to have a child labelled as having an autism spectrum disorder, ASD, or as having an emotional behaviour disturbance.  Labels are for life.  I have stated it at this forum before.  When we apply for a visa to go to America, we are asked if we have ever been diagnosed as having an emotional or behavioural disturbance.  I do not know what happens if the answer is yes, but I would not like to lie to the US authorities.</p></speech>

It is completely inappropriate for a label to be attached to a child for the allocation of educational resources.  Equally, we are very strong in our position that children must be assessed in order to help inform their teaching and learning and to help parents.  That is why I say it is unnecessary labelling.  There is a better way of allocating resources that is without the need to label children, unless it is clinically needed for the treatment of their health.</p> <p>  A question was posed about post-primary provision.  We have concerns about this.  For example, the special class model was the model used in primary school situations and it was transplanted to a post-primary situation.  Post-primary schools are more complex than primary schools because there are multiple courses and teachers, etc.  We have been told that, for example, some of the professional development courses were still aimed at primary teachers.  Post-primary teachers would attend them and find that what was being taught was not age appropriate.  We feel that professional development needs to be focused on the needs of post-primary students, because their needs are quite complex.  Once they hit puberty, there can be a whole load of things going on in their lives as well as the fact that they have additional needs.</p> <p>  Given the additional complexity associated with post-primary schools, we also feel that the Department could consider allocating an additional number of hours to them to allow for greater co-ordination across subjects and year groups.  That is a particular difficulty, especially given that post-primary schools are so much bigger than primary schools.  We also think there needs to be a more effective use of resources.  The Department needs to put an end to the practice of filling teacher timetables.  If additional hours are allocated to a post-primary school, it is completely inappropriate for those hours to be given to, for instance, a French teacher where French is not being taught.  The teachers who are allocated resource teaching hours should be able to understand how these children learn, identify what they need and know how best to support them.  These hours should not be used simply as a timetable filler.</p><p>Those were the issues we had about post-primary and that it does need to be developed a little bit more.</p><p> With regard to increasing prevalence of ASD, Deputy Thomas Byrne made reference to the underlying reasons.  We asked this question when we were doing the consultation around our autism paper.  While it is a worldwide phenomenon that the prevalence is increasing and we are now in line with the UK and the US, the reasons for that are broad.  First of all, there is greater awareness on the part of teachers and parents of the triggers that would identify a child as being different.  Parents and teachers are much more willing to identify children for assessment.  Professionals are also much more aware of the fact of autism.  Broadly speaking, one cannot say that the human genome has changed but there is certainly something happening out there in schools posing a very significant problem, not just for the education system but also for the post-school system.  I was in a school yesterday and in which children's behaviour was being discussed.  The teachers were saying these children were not autistic but there was something completely different about the behaviour of some children now than was the case ten years ago.  They do not know what it is but children can certainly react aggressively within a split second.  This is being said by teachers who are very well skilled and well qualified in dealing with behaviour.  They say that there is something about the behaviour.  What it is I cannot say as I am not a professional and I do not know.</p><p> Reference was made to categories of disability and legal advice.  I am not going to give the committee a legal opinion one way or the other.  We would say to the Department that it has restricted access to certain schemes on the basis of the category of disability.  We believe there is evidence out there that children can benefit.  In other jurisdictions, for example, access to an extended school year is done on the basis of need as opposed to categories of disability.  It is much broader than being simply just autism or severe profound general learning disability.</p></speech>

I was going to discuss the July provision but we are equally concerned about access to early intervention when early intervention has been clearly recognised as having a beneficial impact on children who have special educational needs.  The Department should look at it and take legal advice on whether it is equitable and whether it meets the legal standards to have early intervention schemes that are only open for children with autism and more latterly for children who are deaf.  The Department must look at that and legally proof these schemes.</p></speech>

I have been crossing off questions as they have been asked, she will be glad to hear, as there were a good few.  I welcome and acknowledge the substantial work that has gone into this new model and indeed into the report on ASD.  When it comes to children with special educational needs there is, unfortunately, the element of schools cherry-picking students and I believe we need to do something to end that discrimination.  The league tables are becoming the top priority.  I am aware of cases where siblings who attend a certain school are told, when the younger sibling has a special educational need, that he or she would be better off going to the other school.  I am also curious about the whole school evaluation and the management, leadership and learning review - and I do not know if this has arisen as an issue - in a school which may have a lot of children who have special educational needs.  As part of the review or at the end of the evaluation the school is often asked if they have questioned why they are not achieving great grades as a whole school.  I wonder if the schools that do not take in children who have special educational needs are asked why they do not have a lot of children who have special educational needs.  I believe that question needs to start appearing on inspection reviews to guarantee equality of access for all students and to end that cherry-picking.</p> <p>  Is assessment wholly dependent upon the standardised tests or will the learning support departments - or the support teachers as they are now called - have a whole suite of tests to help identify the needs?  I definitely welcome the 900 new resource teachers in 2017, but is there a contingency plan if the new model reveals that demand outweighs the supply?</p> <p>  I understand that the schools would be required to provide annual reports on how the new model is working.  Is this something new and how does it fit in?  I am very aware that school managements are under severe pressure.  I completely acknowledge that the reports would be needed, but is there an amount of liaison needed to help with management and middle management etc.?</p> <p>  With regard to the ASD report, which is a great report, I have looked at similar policies in Northern Ireland and in the UK and I have noticed that the one thing that is not in this ASD report, which is in those other reports, is a definition for what ASD is.  Why is that definition not there?  It would be very helpful.  I may not have seen it in this report but when it comes to supporting children who have autism, around break time for example, does the Department see a need to recognise the sensory overloads that can happen at that time and the need for quiet spaces, as may exist in other countries' schools, and how would that be resourced in a school?  I very much welcome the whole school community approach and that it is not just about the teacher; it is the caretaker, the driver and the man or woman who works in the canteen.  I welcome that there will be training in that area also.  When the appropriate curriculum is being considered for the 63% of children who are in mainstream and doing the traditional junior cycle or leaving certificate, is it still not the case that the child fits the curriculum rather than the curriculum fitting the child?  I am aware of a child who is on the spectrum and who was doing music as a subject for the traditional leaving certificate.  Three months into the course the teacher discovered that the child had a severe reaction to classical music.  The curriculum obviously does not suit the child and yet that child wants to do music as a subject.  There are elements there with the curriculum.  Part of the curriculum at leaving certificate applied, LCA, and transition year, TY, is gaining of work experience.  Sometimes children who are on the spectrum find it very hard to fit in there or to find relevant and suitable work experience.  Are there support mechanisms when it comes to TY and LCA?</p></speech>

I acknowledge they have done substantial work on the report, which I appreciate.  I do, however, have some concerns and I speak as somebody who taught as a learning support teacher and as a school principal.  I feel there are gaps that need to be addressed first.  I wonder are we jumping on too soon to something instead of fixing the little gaps and closing the little chinks in the system.  My first observation is on resource teachers.  The 900 resource teacher allocation is welcome but I submitted a parliamentary question to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the information I received was that to restore the 15% cut to resource teachers, 1,118 resource teachers are needed.  I want to make the point that while there is a lot of work being done here and we are moving in the right direction, there are gaps and there are things I will question.</p> <p>  There is an appeal process for the schools around their educational profile and for parents who may wish to appeal.  That process needs to be very robust and needs to be fair to both schools and parents.  With the educational profile, weighting is given to the standardised testing scores.  This is the second issue with regard to weighting and the school's profile.  On looking at the research done on inclusion and the index for inclusion, which was a great piece of work, I question whether we are moving towards a polarised system in which we have schools that will be like special schools because they will have a huge cohort of children who are achieving low standardised scores.</p><p>Those are the schools that inevitably will secure more resources.  Other schools, which are victims of their own success to a certain degree and do not have children scoring so low, will have fewer resources.  Therefore there will be a tendency for parents to push towards the schools that have the resources.  Are we moving away from the whole notion of meaningful inclusion?  We have to embrace diversity, including diversity of ability.  I am questioning that element of the model as well.</p><p> As a principal and learning support teacher, I was very frustrated at times over the procedures one had to go through to get resources for a child.  On the inclusion-support service the document specifies that two stages of the continuum of support must be engaged with before the support could be accessed.  At first I thought it was positive, but then I read the document outlining the requirement for the two stages.  That will cause terrible frustration for teachers.  They put problem-solving strategies in place and have meetings with their support teachers.  That is an unnecessary layer.  If a school needs to access that service due to exceptional circumstances, it should not be put through the whole rigmarole of going through two steps of the continuum of support.  I am speaking from personal experience, as well as having spoken to teachers and principals on the issue.</p><p> I would be concerned if there is a move away from assessment by NEPS.  There is a need for assessment and a need to produce an individual education plan for children.  While planning is mentioned in the document, I saw no specific mention of IEPs.  Is there a change in thinking on that?  Is this a gap-filler until the EPSEN Act is implemented?  In terms of cost, would we not be better off if we were to try to implement the IEP dimension of the EPSEN Act?  Schools already have classroom planning and subject planning.  Why not put planning in place for children with special needs?  Many teachers are doing that already and it is recommended.  Would it not be better to focus on that element of the EPSEN Act and put that in place?</p><p> Does the NCSE intend to provide more up-to-date costing for the implementation of the EPSEN Act in full?  Does the NCSE intend to provide a breakdown of costs associated in terms of implementing various aspects of the EPSEN Act, such as if we were just to focus on the IEP aspect?  Has the Department requested this?  How much would it cost to implement specific provisions such as the individual education plan?  We need to focus on that area.</p><p> I read the document in detail.  It mentioned the involvement of the SENO in preschools and in data collection for children with complex needs.  While I welcome that approach, there are serious problems at preschool level.  I have received complaints that the waiting time in my constituency for children to get assessment of needs is between 12 months and 18 months.  Should the SENO not be involved in a more constructive role at that level rather than data collection?  We might be skating round the edges and not dealing with the problem at the centre of that.</p><p> Those are the concerns that struck me immediately on reading the document; obviously there are many more.  Did the Irish-medium schools involved in the pilot express concerns over the resources as Gaeilge for SNAs?</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank them for the informative and helpful presentations.  It is very encouraging to hear that there has been such positive feedback from the pilot to date.</p> <p>  School principals raise the issue of class size as an impediment to identifying children with special educational needs.  Is that the elephant in the room when it comes to identifying children with difficulties?  Some rural schools are concerned that they might lose out under this new scheme.  Is that fear well founded?  School principals, especially those who are also teaching, believe this may increase their workload.  Is that fear warranted?</p> <p>  The final sentence of the second presentation stated: "However, further work is needed if we are to be sure that we are fully meeting the needs of children with special educational needs, including those with autism, in our schools."  What exactly is meant by that?  What further improvement is needed?</p></speech>

What links has the Department of Education and Skills made with that health service reorganisation?  It would probably not be wise to split the education therapies from the health-related therapies because it is being done on a geographical basis.</p> <p>  How soon will we have a policy, a model and funding for post-18 education for children with autism?  I have personal experience of this.  I was the chief executive of Cope Foundation, which was patron of what was the CABAS school.  Suddenly we had two children and then ten children moving from the secondary school during the dark days of the recession.  As an organisation we just decided we would find a way to do it because we could not allow those young people, in whom there had been considerable investment, suddenly to have nothing in terms of their education.  This policy is urgently required.  I know the Department is catching up with the secondary schools, but the post-secondary school situation should not just be down to local activism and people taking responsibility locally.</p></speech>

We have been aware all along that some schools put up soft barriers to the admission of children with special educational needs.</p><p>We have also been aware that, as indicated in the ESRI's report and various others, there are various special educational needs or various categories of disabilities that are more commonly found in some areas than others, particularly disadvantaged areas, which is the reason we have included the disadvantage element in the criteria used in profiling schools.  Part of the reason for the high concentration of children with special educational needs in particular schools is often location or the soft barriers put in place by schools where parents have suggested their child might be better off in a school in which there are more resources or smaller class sizes.  We are conscious of this.  In particular, we are conscious that there are children who cannot get into certain schools because they have a special educational need and that barriers are being put in front of them.  This is an issue we are considering in the context of the forthcoming school admission policies legislation.  We have been in discussions with the NCSE and other departmental colleagues on the issue and there may be an opportunity for us to address it in that way.  There are a small number of schools that might be reluctant to open special classes, again for similar reasons, and we are looking at opportunities to provide the NCSE with greater authority to encourage schools to be forthcoming in opening special classes.</p><p> I note Deputy Catherine Martin's point about siblings.  A number of cases in which that has been happening have been brought to our attention.  The Deputy also made a point about whole-school and other evaluations and whether in that regard we should question schools about the reasons they do not have children with special educational needs.  The Deputy's point is well made and it is one we will raise with the inspectorate.  There is a working group overseeing the introduction of the new model and we have received representations at a high level from the inspectorate.  We will put the issue raised by the Deputy on the agenda for the next discussion.  I cannot guarantee that it will be discussed, but it seems to be a sensible suggestion.</p><p> On whether teachers will have tests available to them to identify needs, the National Educational Psychological Service, NEPS, has been working hard in the development of the model and the pilot scheme on the development of the guidelines about which I spoke to ensure schools will be provided with the skills the need to identify needs.  There are assessment tools provided for teachers, in respect of which, as part of the pilot scheme, we held a number of workshops with principals and various other teachers.  We worked through a number of examples and the schools involved appeared to be very happy with that approach.  Again, some tweaking will be required, but once all of the guidelines have been agreed to, we will forward them to the committee and the Deputy can then judge for herself whether teachers will be appropriately equipped to do what is required.  </p><p> Ms Griffin will respond to the recommendation that schools be required to produce annual reports and on the definition within the report of ASD, the need for quiet spaces and so on.  On the need for quiet spaces, we have had ongoing discussions with various parties in which various names such as "time out rooms" have been suggested, to which rooms children might go in the event of a meltdown.  However, we need to be careful about the language we use to ensure we are seen to be supportive such that they are spaces in which children's senses will not be overloaded.  We are strongly of the view in the Department that excluding a child and placing him or her in isolation, particularly unsupervised, is not an appropriate answer to a child in a meltdown.</p></speech>

I have been a teacher and know of students who would opt to avail of such a space because, perhaps, a canteen environment might not suit them.  I was not suggesting quiet spaces be used for time-out or as punishment but rather that they be available where a child has identified a need for them.</p></speech>

There is huge movement of teachers such that teachers with particular skill sets are moving away from the children who need them the most.  The whole-school approach is preferable.  In taking it everybody in the school understands the context for a child with autism.</p> <p>  It is acknowledged that it can be hard for children with autism to gain work experience during transition year.  We will be happy to raise the matter with our colleagues in the curriculum section of the Department.  </p> <p>  There are a number of recommendations in the autism policy advice provided that will be considered in the coming months.  It will take time to have many of them implemented as there are some cross-departmental issues.  We have appointed an implementation group which is the responsibility of my colleague, Mr. Colm McGarvey.  It has met a number of times and is taking a thematic approach to the implementation of the recommendations.  The issue raised by the Deputy will be considered in that context.</p></speech>

It is vital that children on the autism spectrum have support available one day every week.</p></speech>

To respond to her question to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on the need for an additional 1,118 posts to reverse the 15% cut, the model is intended as a better way of distributing and deploying the resources available to us, be they increased or, in the event that we experience another economic crash, depleted again.  This is simply about having a better, fairer and more equitable way of managing resources.  There is concern which we acknowledge about the effects of the 15% cut applied across the system in 2011, 2012 and 2013.   The provision of 900 posts is substantial.  I am not suggesting it is intended to reverse the 15% cut, but it is greater than the provision that would have been made based on demographics alone.  It has been acknowledged in our consultations that schools, at least, feel that they are well supported by the Department.  There will be further discussions on the reversal of the 15% cut.  We will deal with that issue when it arises.</p> <p>  On the need for the appeal process to be fair to schools and parents, we are anxious to have a robust and tight appeal process in place.  Two issues arise in this regard.  Schools may be concerned that they are receiving allocations based on a profile that is not an accurate reflection of a school enrolment.  For this reason, we will have an appeal process to review the data provided to ensure the calculations made are correct.  Where they are not, we will remedy the situation.  We also recognise that there will be a number of schools which, even though they have been profiled correctly, may still struggle under the weight of difficulties they are experiencing.  It is intended that the inclusion support service will be robust and have the capacity to provide support for these schools.  It has been mentioned that there will be a requirement for schools to complete a number of stages of the continuum process before they receive additional support.  The intention is that the inclusion support service will have the capacity to understand what the difficulty and build a response to it, whether by providing additional support or providing additional in-house training for those working with the children involved.  It could involve either option, but until such time as the stages of the continuum process are completed, it will be difficult for the inclusion support service or those working with a school to understand what the difficulty is.  It is not always about the provision of additional resources.  Sometimes it is about utilisation of the resources available in a better way.  Either way, the inclusion support service will have some capacity to act, including in the national behaviour support service which is well resourced and highly regarded in the post-primary sector and provides significant additional support for schools experiencing severe problems, notwithstanding the other resources put in place.</p><p> With regard to the standardised tests, we acknowledge that there is a concern being expressed.  There are two answers to this.  It is likely that schools in more disadvantaged areas are going to have a higher concentration of children who are underperforming in standardised tests.  Those schools are also likely to have access to other supports such as enhanced pupil-teacher ratios in the event that they are in band 1 or access to school completion, home school liaison and all of the other supports provided under DEIS.  In addition, they are more likely to have a larger pot of resource teaching under the current model and that will continue under the new model.  Our intention is that such schools will not end up being ghettoising.  Our intention is that through an open admissions structure, all schools will be encouraged to enrol children within their own communities and that there will be no bypassing of the nearest school.  Of course, that is something we will have to keep a very close eye on over the roll-out of the model.</p></speech>

The intention is that NEPS will continue and, as it develops over the course of the coming years in line with the commitments made in the programme for partnership Government, retain a significant assessment role.  What it will be moving away from is assessment simply to inform the allocation of resources.  That is clearly better and fully in line with the recommendations of the NCSE and its 2013 policy advice and the Stack report in 2014.  This will be true for the HSE also.  The HSE has indicated to us in the past that it uses approximately 125 whole-time equivalent psychologists just to carry out assessments for educational purposes.  Clearly, those resources will now be freed up to carry out clinical assessments in order to understand better the clinical needs of children and to provide the necessary therapeutic interventions.  We regard this as a very significant positive.</p> <p>  I was asked about the need for IEPs.  We have had ongoing conversations with stakeholders, including school management bodies, and have moved significantly in the direction of IEPs.  We included that in our 2014 special needs assistance circular.  There is robust provision in the new model for planning for the needs of individual children and for that planning to feed into the annual reporting to be provided to the NCSE.  We have not hung our hat on any language around IEPs.  While we have referred to it as "personalised pupil planning", the Department is kind of indifferent at the moment about what it is called.  Many schools do it already, as has been acknowledged by the questioner, and the chief inspector has said that the Inspectorate has noted in a number of whole-school evaluations that schools which carry out individual planning for children tend to be those which have the best outcomes for children.  As such, we know that a lot of good work is already going on and that planning templates are available.  Our colleagues in NEPS have planning templates that they provide for schools.  We are not, at this point in time at least, being directive in terms of what a plan should look like.  What we are concerned about is whether it is the right plan for the child and has been developed in consultation with the relevant people within the school and the parents of the child so that everybody knows the efforts that are going to be made on his or her behalf.  As to whether we need to do anything in terms of EPSN for this, we have taken significant strides in terms of getting it into schools.  Having it underpinned legislatively would not necessarily improve that situation.</p> <p>  I was asked whether the NCSE would provide up-to-date costs on the introduction of EPSN.  It is our view, based on the advice we have received, that we cannot implement EPSN piecemeal.  We cannot take the IEP section of it and implement that without implementing all of the rest of it.  Implementing all of the rest of it is problematic as it is expensive.  The costs are not just for the Department.  In 2006, when the estimate was made, the projected cost was approximately &euro;235 million for the Department and approximately &euro;500 million for the Department of Health.</p></speech>

As we move forward and look at the significant increase in the numbers of children who have been diagnosed with special educational needs and the growth in population generally, the cost of implementation will significantly increase.  We are trying to bring about the best elements of EPSN on a non-statutory basis at the moment and that approach seems to be working well with schools.  Schools are happy to implement IEPs.  The pilot schools were very positive about how they were introduced in the context of the new model.  We have had a positive experience on that.  In terms of the role of the SENO, Ms Griffin might address matters.</p> <p>  We have had an ongoing engagement with Irish-medium schools.  We recognise that there are difficulties in Irish-medium schools.  We did not get any significant feedback and certainly none of a negative nature from Irish-medium schools in the context of the pilot.  We are aware that some Irish-medium schools tend to have difficulties, in particular those which are not in Gaeltacht areas, in recruiting SNAs with an appropriate level of Irish.  I am not quite sure what we can do about that given the rapid growth in SNA numbers.  It is something we could consider in the context of training.  There is funding available to boards of management for training SNAs, but that does not immediately address the issue.  It is something we will take into account.</p></speech>

When one looks at a teacher who has to plan for yearly, monthly and fortnightly schemes, that is mandatory.  Such planning is not mandatory for children with special educational needs.  That fosters the wrong perception.  That is where I am coming from.  I do not doubt for a second that teachers are doing their best.  However, it is about perception and respect for children across the board.</p></speech>

I am not too sure that making it mandatory would improve things but I take the point that if it is mandatory for other areas, it seems to ignore somewhat the needs of children where it is otherwise.  However, a mandatory element is included in the circular for special needs assistants.  Again, we are trying not to be too directive towards schools.  It is in the circular and, over a period of time, we will be stronger in terms of our enforcement of it.  In terms of introducing the new model, it will be there and it will be a requirement.  It is something that will be looked at in the context of annual reports from schools, which is a new development.  We do not want, however, to introduce the new model in a way that makes it difficult or controversial for schools.  We want schools to welcome this.  We believe in the context of the pilot that they have been welcoming of it.  However, I take the Deputy's point fully and we will look towards strengthening those provisions over the period.</p></speech>

For example, the ones that were implemented already were the ones that included statutory provision for the NCSE and a number of other relatively minor provisions.  We then sought advice and that was that the rest of it needed to be done in one lump or none.  As such, we are caught on the horns of a dilemma with that.  It is something on which we are engaged in consultation because EPSN does not stand alone.  The Disability Act is a sister Act and there are issues about the roll-out of that also.  Therefore, we need to know what our colleagues in the Department of Health are thinking.  We have had a number of conversations with them and it is an ongoing dialogue.</p> <p>  Senator Gallagher mentioned a couple of issues which I would like to address.  He asked if class sizes were an impediment to identifying children with special educational needs.  I do not think so.  Of course, we would all like class sizes to be smaller and that would be easier.  As to whether it acts as an impediment, we think we are providing schools with the tools to be able to identify children who are falling behind.  Of course, it has always been the case that children may not be faring well in a large class, which might be missed by the classroom teacher.  However, providing these additional resources and requiring proper planning will encourage teachers to assess the whole class and to identify at an earlier stage those children who are beginning to struggle.  The earlier one identifies this, the greater the chance the child has to catch up and perform at a higher level without necessarily having a label or diagnosis.  Some children will fall back into line with the class while others will need ongoing support.  Class size is not the significant thing.  The capacity of the teacher is a far more important factor here and it is the focus of the Department to ensure that teachers are equipped with the skills to identify those children.</p><p> In terms of rural schools, there was a concern that rural schools might lose out.  We considered rural schools because we are conscious that there are a significant number of small rural schools with small class sizes.  In addition, they might have multiple classes in a room and there are all sorts of difficulties and context with that.  We have been conscious in the development of the model to ensure that rural schools are protected by and large.  Our ambition is that no school will lose out and that includes rural schools.  We believe that when we have the final work done on the model, the concerns that have been expressed to the Senator will have diminished somewhat.  </p><p> In terms of teaching principals and an increased workload, during the last consultation that we had with the principals participating in the pilot scheme I was prompted by the director of operations in the NCSE to ask a question that had not occurred to me.  I asked all of the principals what they welcomed from the model.  Their universal answer was the significant reduction in the current administrative burden on principals because of the application process and the uncertainty that the current model gives them in terms of what their allocations will be in the coming year.  In the way the current model was configured, schools might only have learned in May the first round of allocations.  Now, schools will know from the beginning of the calendar year in January what they will get next September.  They will not have to go through a tortuous process with no certainty at the end of it that they will get the resources, notwithstanding the fact that they have procured assessments and signed all of the documentation.  That uncertainty was a burden, as was all of the work around it.  When the principals said that, I asked them how would they rate that in terms of its importance.  They replied it was of paramount importance and was the most significant issue in terms of the introduction of the new model.</p><p> A number of people did say to us that there were additional burdens.  For example, the new engagement paradigm in terms of how principals engage with parents and the new language to be used is a bit of a worry, and maybe also the requirement for an annual report.  The principals felt all of that was in the ha'penny place compared with the savings made in terms of the administrative burden.  We are conscious that there will be burdens for teaching principals in particular.  </p><p> In respect of autism, we said that further work is needed.  Having the autism policy advice is step one.  We have a number of years to implement all of the recommendations, or those that can be implemented.  Some recommendations can be introduced fairly quickly in teacher training for example.  Some of the stuff is already in place.  A lot of progress has been made already with early intervention stuff under the access and inclusion model, AIM.  </p><p> In terms of the July provision, clearly we are not going to pull the scheme and introduce something in its place immediately.  We must carry out a lot of consultations with parents and schools on whatever change happens.  The work is going to be in implementation.  There will be ongoing engagement with stakeholders, both the education partners and in particular parents, to ensure that gets carried out.</p></speech>

What dialogue has taken place with the teacher training colleges to ensure these posts can be filled?  In other areas of Government policy there have been great announcements that funds are available but the reality of filling those posts is a different issue.  What forward planning is being done to ensure a sufficient number of people are trained sufficiently to fill the posts?</p> <p>  I wish to mention standardised testing for children whose first language is not English.  Perhaps this question has already been asked.  I am not just speaking about Irish speakers but refer to children who do not speak English as their mother tongue.

In fact, we have substantially increased teacher numbers on the special needs side over recent years.  There has not been a difficulty in terms of recruitment.  Many of these teachers will be newly trained teachers and they may not necessarily be the teachers who end up in this particular role.  Schools will be encouraged to ensure that the roles are filled by people with the most experience.  Indeed, the NCSE has included the recommendation in its autism policy advice.  As we talk to schools we will further encourage them to ensure that the teachers who are assigned to work with children with special educational needs have the highest levels of training.  We recognise that under the current model there has been a deficit in this area.  We will try to remedy the situation in the context of the new model.</p></speech>

I know of a person who was a principal of an Irish-medium school who is now an inspector.  He very much took into account the needs of Irish speakers and people who were native Irish speakers, as opposed to Gaelscoileanna.  He differentiated right across.  A lot of thought has been given to how we can measure people for whom English is not their first language, in terms of Irish at least.</p> <p>  We have made a number of recommendations on standardised testing, including the need to future-proof it and making sure it is appropriate for use in the model.  The Education Research Centre is starting work on analysing the current standardised tests and seeing how they can be modified to make sure that they can be improved and brought up to date.  Ireland is now a multicultural society and the needs of all children will have to be taken into account in the Department's work when preparing the next round of standardised tests. </p></speech>

Mr. Mulkerrins mentioned the difficulty of finding people outside of the Gaeltacht areas with a proficiency in Irish who are also SNAs.  I refer to the resources available to an SNA who works through the medium of Irish, particularly when compared with a SNA who works through the medium of English.  We may say there are limited resources available in English but they are much less as Gaeilge.  Will steps be taken to increase the level of resources available to those who work through the medium of Irish?</p></speech>

Sometimes a translation can be very literal and does not work for the child concerned.  Sometimes it is good to generate it through the medium of the language.  I know that An Chomhairle um Oideachas Gaeltachta agus Gaelscola&iacute;ochta, COGG does fantastic work.  It would be great if it was given specific resources in the area.  I suggest the Department uses someone who is a native speaker or a teacher who can work from the base language and translate back to English.  The measure could act as a double-whammy because the Department would get extra English resources as well.</p></speech>

If one took a French textbook and translated it into English as an English-speaking teacher one would say it does not hit the spot.  It is the same for Irish speakers who have Irish as their first language.  Something that is generated initially as Gaeilge from the cultural background of the Irish language is quite different from a translation.</p></speech>

We referenced the US diagnostic and standardisation manual and stated the main criteria included.  We did consider it, but we were aiming for a much thinner volume.  Initially we thought we would have 20 pages but we are up to more than 100.  Things fell out and this was one issue.</p> <p>  With regard to the reporting requirement, we really did not want to add to the administrative burden for schools.  We wanted to reduce the administrative burden and we were delighted with the feedback Mr. Mulkerrins got from the principals that we succeeded in this.  We have suggested to the Department that the reporting requirement should be built on what is available at present.  All schools issue reports to parents and perhaps we can develop an IT package whereby all this would be brought together and then reported on a whole school basis.</p> <p>  Quiet spaces were hugely controversial.  We absolutely believe there needs to be quiet spaces and we emphasise in our report the need for them.  As there are 4,000 schools we cannot state there is one way of doing it, but we know there are very successful models in schools, from having beanbags at the back of classrooms to ear protectors.  Certainly it was a point very well made to us by one student.  When we asked what she would like her school to do for her she said she really wanted a small cupboard to sit in.  We must be very conscious of the fact we do not have quiet spaces just as a reward.  There is a balance but we are very conscious of the need for this.</p> <p>  Senator Kelleher asked about progressing disability services and whether there are links between health and education.  There very much are links between health and education on the ground, but it varies from place to place as to how successful they are.  With regard to how soon a post-school model can be put in place, this is something for consideration by the multiagency working group we have suggested should be put in place.</p></speech>

It certainly has been a very informative and productive session for members on an issue of huge fundamental importance to all of us, not only to children with special needs and their families and teachers, but to communities and society as a whole.  The new model the witnesses have outlined to us is a very positive step forward towards ensuring children with special needs have equity in their education and that they can access the resources they need in a very fair way.  It also gives schools a fair degree of flexibility and independence in how they use their resources, which is very much to be welcomed.  I thank the witnesses and we look forward to being in contact with them again at a future date.</p></speech>

Just before the meeting started I received an e-mail from Deputy Byrne on the ongoing situation with the ASTI and the Department of Education and Skills.  It is incumbent on us as the Joint Committee on Education and Skills to acknowledge that today is the first of eight days of strikes in ASTI schools, which is very regrettable.  There are many victims in this, including teachers, parents, students and the community at large.  Deputy Byrne has requested that we have a special meeting with the ASTI and the Department.  Senator &Oacute; Clochartaigh mentioned this earlier this morning.  I thank the secretariat for checking the availability of committee rooms.  Next Thursday morning there is availability and I suggest we meet at 10 a.m. and that we invite the ASTI to appear before the committee for the first hour and the Department to appear before us for the second hour.

I have been informed the Taoiseach will go to Connemara tomorrow, and the Minister for Education and Skills and the Minister of State with responsibility for the Gaeltacht will also be there, to launch the new education policy for the Gaeltacht.  I am quite surprised the committee has not been informed this is being done.  I am disappointed nobody from the committee was invited, and none of the local Oireachtas representatives seem to have been invited either.  This is very disappointing because we have been calling for this to be launched and we have welcomed its development.  We were hoping it would happen sooner.  It has been delayed for more than year.  It is very disappointing.  I have been given confirmation that other people were invited over a week ago to the launch.  It is a very bad show by the Department if it is looking for buy-in from the various stakeholders that it did not inform us in advance that this was happening and invited us to the launch.  I propose that as a committee we write to the Minister on this issue expressing our disappointment and concern and requesting that in future any development such as this is indicated to the committee and that we are invited to such events.</p></speech>

The Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland (amendment) Bill 2014 is a Private Members' Bill in the name of Deputy Pearse Doherty.  The committee agreed this joint approach to the scrutiny of both proposals for legislation in view of the subject matter and synergies between Bills.  In our first session, we will hear from the Minister for Finance on the general scheme of his proposed legislation and from Deputy Pearse Doherty on his Bill.  In our second session, the committee will hear from representatives of the Financial Services Ombudsman's Bureau and representatives of the Free Legal Advice Centres, or FLAC.</p> <p>  It was agreed that the remaining EU proposals considered today do not warrant further scrutiny.

The purpose of these heads of Bill is to provide for the amalgamation of the Financial Services Ombudsman and Pensions Ombudsman and to update the legislation generally on their roles and responsibilities.  The Government decision to amalgamate both offices follows the recommendation of a critical review under the public service reform plan.  In the drafting of these heads, a full analysis was undertaken by my Department, including a public consultation process and consultation with relevant stakeholders, both public and industry representatives.</p> <p>  The Financial Services Ombudsman is an independent statutory officer who deals with unresolved complaints from consumers about their dealings with regulated financial service providers.  The statutory role of the Pensions Ombudsman is to investigate complaints of financial loss due to maladministration and disputes of fact or law in relation to occupational pension schemes, trust retirement annuity contracts and personal retirement savings accounts.  The Pensions Ombudsman performs these functions independently and acts as an impartial adjudicator.  The heads of Bill propose to harmonise the rules under which the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman can investigate a complaint and extend their strongest powers to the new financial services and pensions ombudsman.  While the ombudsman will, of course, continue to be an independent officer, the draft legislation now provides that he or she shall resolve complaints in a manner that is appropriate and proportionate to the complaint.  It gives the ombudsman a new role in improving the public understanding of the role and functions of the office, which compliments the current role of improving the public understanding of issues related to complaints.</p> <p>  With the amalgamation of the two bodies, the council and its oversight role of the Financial Services Ombudsman has been maintained but with some changes.  I propose to remove the regulation making power of the council with respect to how the ombudsman operates.  The Minister for Finance rather than the council will now have the power to make regulations relating to the operation of the ombudsman on the advice of the ombudsman and the council.  The council will continue to keep the efficiency and effectiveness of the office under review but will no longer be responsible for the appointment of the ombudsman or deputy ombudsman.  The council will have a new role in approving the draft statement of accounts prepared by the ombudsman before they are submitted to me.</p> <p>  To reflect the unique funding arrangements of the new body, which involve both industry and the Exchequer, the council will continue to prescribe by regulation levies or fees to be paid to the ombudsman by financial services providers.  To reflect the changing workload of the council, I propose to reduce its membership from a maximum of ten to a maximum of seven people.  One member should have pensions experience, one financial services knowledge and now at least two members must have knowledge of consumer protection or consumer issues.  The proposed legislation provides that I will now hold the responsibility for the appointment of the ombudsman and deputy ombudsman following an open competition run by the Public Appointments Service.  I am also extending the role of the deputy ombudsman to the new financial services and pensions ombudsman, which is an improvement over the current situation whereby the legislation for the Pensions Ombudsman does not provide for a deputy.</p> <p>  With regard to the functions and powers of the ombudsman, the heads of Bill include significant amendments.  The heads of Bill identify the number of options available to the ombudsman for dealing with complaints, ensure the ombudsman maintains and establishes systems and procedures and require the ombudsman to adopt and publish rules of procedure for dealing with complaints.  These changes are suggested with the intention of providing clarity and certainty for the consumer as to the process for dealing with complaints and on what to expect when the ombudsman is dealing with a complaint.  To further enhance the current reporting arrangements in respect of the ombudsman, annual reports will be required to include the breakdown of the manner in which all complaints submitted to the office were dealt with and the outcome of all investigations concluded or terminated, including those that were settled.</p><p>The ombudsman will continue to report a summary of all complaints and a review of trends and patterns of complaints.  I am also continuing with the name-and-shame reporting powers of the ombudsman with regards to complaints against financial services providers which was introduced in 2013.  In addition to this, the ombudsman shall publish determinations made by him.  The intention of these amendments is to improve transparency and better reporting of complaints. </p><p> The most significant change in the draft legislation is the amendment of the time limit in which complaints can be made to the ombudsman.  Providing the necessary protection to the consumer over the longer term is of paramount importance but needs to be achieved within the law and be able to operate practically.  After significant consideration and consultation with stakeholders, I propose to extend the time limits for complaints about certain long-term financial services to the same time limit which currently applies to pension products, namely six years from date of the conduct complained of or three years from the date the complainant knew, or ought to have known, about the conduct.  This greatly improves access to the ombudsman for consumers of long-term products who may not become aware of an issue until well after the original six years had passed.  The rationale for this expansion is that those who have long-term financial services may not become aware of an event to be complained of until their service or product matures and they should have some access to the ombudsman at that stage.</p><p> For short-term financial services, the time limit for complaints to the ombudsman is unchanged at six years from the date of the conduct complained of.  This approach was taken as it was considered to be a balance between the concerns of the consumer representatives to give consumers greater protection, as well as those concerns of industry about record-keeping and availability of documentation. </p><p> I am retaining the requirement for consumers to first try to resolve the matter with a provider's internal dispute process.  However, I am now allowing the ombudsman to waive the internal dispute process in certain cases, such as when the ombudsman determines a complaint is of such importance as to warrant waiving the process.  This means that in cases where the provider may be seen to frustrate the process, the ombudsman can intervene.</p><p> The heads of Bill strengthens the role of the ombudsman in promoting engagement in the mediation process, as well as continuing to provide for mediation as a tool for the ombudsman in cases where he sees fit.  I am informed by the ombudsman that he is already taking a proactive role in mediation pending the introduction of this legislation.  Following a significant strategic and organisational change programme with the objective of putting mediation at the centre of the ombudsman procedures, a minimum of 60% of cases will be resolved in the future by dispute resolution using mediation techniques.  This is up from 1%.</p><p> Once the ombudsman has considered the complaint, he may now issue a preliminary determination which will indicate the potential decision to be made and the evidence considered in arriving at this.  This ensures all parties to the complaint are aware of developments in a complaint and have to opportunity to ensure the ombudsman has all evidence necessary for making a final decision.</p><p> Other examples of improved measures include the broader powers of the Pensions Ombudsman to compel witnesses and documents will now be extended to financial services complaints; the ability of the ombudsman to continue with a case on the death of a beneficiary; the ombudsman to issue preliminary determinations on cases to provide some level of expectation or guidance to both the provider and the complainant before completing the investigation; and the requirement for the ombudsman to publish guidelines for all procedures, the publication of cases for the Financial Services Ombudsman, and sample cases for the Pensions Ombudsman.  If, following a complaint or investigation, the ombudsman considers there is a persistent pattern of complaints, he can now inform the relevant authority of such a concern.</p><p> The measures I have outlined should strengthen the functions of the new ombudsman, as well as improving the experience for consumers of both pensions and financial services.  We look forward to debating these issues and any differences that may arise.  My team and I are happy to take questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.139" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102700002#E00200"><p>I am delighted the committee is dealing with my legislation.  I am also delighted my Bill, and the important issues it covers, has passed Second Stage and will now proceed to Committee Stage.  Today, we are dealing with pre-legislative scrutiny and I welcome the opportunity to do that.  I thank Members across the political divide who have unanimously supported the passage of this legislation.</p> <p>  Since then, the Minister for Finance wrote to me asking for priority to be given to his Bill which he just discussed.  I only received the letter after the committee had agreed in private session to examine the Bills in tandem at the pre-legislative scrutiny Stage.  I believe this is the best approach today.</p> <p>  The Bill is based on the excellent work of FLAC in its report, Redressing the Imbalance.  I am glad we will hear from FLAC later this morning, as well as from the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The day my Bill was debated on Second Stage, the Government published its own legislation.  I am glad that after much delay, it did so.  We can see a crossover, with the issues raised in my Bill now included in the Government's Bill.  However, there are differences, some subtle and some not so.  In particular, I am glad there was support across the spectrum for what I considered the most important element of my legislation, namely the amendment to the blanket ban on complaints after six years.  I note the Government's Bill, as well as Deputy Michael McGrath's, supports this principle but has gone for a three-year rule instead.  I am happy to work with that.  Although, as I will tease out later with the Minister, I believe the approach in the Government's legislation may have too many get-out clauses which may work against consumer.  The term, which the Minister mentioned, "ought to have known" is also of concern to me.</p> <p>  The other critical issue for me, one on which I have not heard any sense of compromise from the Government, is the right of consumers, as well as of financial institutions, to have their day in court.  That means having the right to appeal to the Circuit Court which provides greater ease of access to individuals.  As we know, an appeal to the High Court is not only more costly but the appeals are legally tighter.  I wish to work with the Government on this issue.</p> <p>  As I have said before, the appropriate course would be to consider merging both Bills.  The Government's is far more comprehensive, as it deals with the merging of two existing offices and takes on board some of the issues I have raised.  In that light, it would be open to me to withdraw my Bill if the important issues, including the right to appeal to the Circuit Court, were addressed or assurances could be given that these would be considered as part of the Government's legislation.</p> <p>  Regarding the definition of "consumer", my proposal is for a two-tier system for personal and commercial consumers.  This has been suggested as a possible way forward in future to ensure the processes in place will genuinely cater for the ordinary person on the street.  It would also ensure the Financial Services Ombudsman's office would not be overrun with complaints.  In reality, complaints might be more appropriately dealt with by the Commercial Court, for example.</p> <p>  A question was raised about sole traders and charities.  It is not my intention to exclude those from the definition of "consumer".  That can be dealt with on Committee Stage.</p> <p>  Important points have been raised by our court system and, indeed, in the FLAC report, Redressing the Imbalance.  The latter gave an example of where the courts have suggested that cases which have gone before the Financial Services Ombudsman would be better addressed in the Commercial Court.  Its report questioned whether the ombudsman's expanded definition of "consumer" would stand the test of a constitutional challenge.  That is the intention behind the relevant section in my legislation.  Again, I am willing to hear from others as to the appropriateness, or not, of this section.</p><p> A seemingly small, but important, issue in this section of the Bill is to allow for a greater range of findings to be made by the ombudsman.  The current options have failed to represent the actual results.  FLAC research shows they have caused greater anger when a consumer who feels the system has not helped him or her in any way is told that the case was partially upheld.  This is because, on a technical issue, the Financial Services Ombudsman has found in his or her favour, but the substance of the claim was rejected.  The complaint has been partially upheld which seems a very positive finding, but the reality is that the claim was substantially rejected.  Therefore, I propose four options in regard to findings, namely, upheld, substantially upheld, substantially rejected or rejected.  They should mirror the legislation that allows for the name-and-shame principle, which was introduced a number of years ago.</p><p> As I indicated on Second Stage, I am open to discussion on all of these points.  If I receive adequate reassurances on the issue regarding the Statute of Limitations and the right to access to the courts in particular, I would look forward to allowing priority for the Minister's Bill. </p><p> My Bill has already passed Second Stage and will proceed to Committee Stage, while the Government Bill is at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  It is important that the more comprehensive Bill is allowed to pass through the Houses of the Oireachtas as speedily as possible.  Following the debate on my Bill on Second Stage, the Government published its Bill which included many of the key issues, but there are quite important differences.  It is to be hoped we can tease them out in the meantime and make sure that the time we have in the committee, D&aacute;il and Seanad is best used to deal with one Bill that deals with all of the issues comprehensively.</p></speech>

There is a great similarity between the intent of both Bills and the actual working out of the heads.  I assume the committee will invite a number of witnesses to contribute to the discussion on both Bills today and will generate a report.  When we receive it, the best way forward might be for my officials to discuss the further development of the heads with Deputy Doherty.  If there is general agreement on the heads, we can proceed to drafting with a view to having a normal process whereby amendments are considered on their merits on Committee and Report Stages.  If Deputy Doherty would agree to such a proposal, we can align our work with that.</p></speech>

I want to take the opportunity to ask a number of questions which will inform the committee's report on the Government's proposal.  I will focus on a major difference between the two Bills.</p> <p>  While the timeframe for both Bills and the current rules on appealing to the Financial Services Ombudsman is within six years, the Government's Bill allows for three years after a person became aware or ought to have become aware of a difficulty.  It is that definition of "ought to have become aware" about which I am concerned.  When does the clock start ticking on when a person ought to have become aware of a problem?  How do we define when somebody ought to have become aware of the fact there was an issue with the product he or she was sold?</p></speech>

In the case of something like a tracker mortgage, an incorrect interest rate may not have come to the notice of the complainant and he or she may not know there were valid grounds for complaint within a six-year period.  The three-year period is to allow a further period of time after it became apparent to the complainant that there was an issue about which he or she could lodge a complaint.</p> <p>  I presume the phrase "ought to be aware" means when something generally became public knowledge but it depends on each case.  It would be a matter for the ombudsman to adjudicate on what "ought to be aware" means to admit a valid complaint at that point.  In dealing with the heads of the Bill, we are dealing with the principles of issues and I am prepared to tease them out if the Deputy needs further refinement on that.</p></speech>

There is an issue in that we have to find a space between allowing a three-year period at any stage in the process or tying it back in to when a person looking after his or her affairs would be expected to know that a wrong was perpetrated on that person that could be the subject of a complaint.  It cannot be totally open.  That concept has to be developed further in the draft Bill, which has to provide more detail on that.  I am subject to the draft.</p></speech>

The new three-year provision will apply to long-term products, yet there is no definition of "long-term product" in the heads of the Bill.  There is a definition of a "long-term financial service", which is defined as one that "exceeds 6 years and is not subject to annual renewal".  I take it that the product will be the service.  Can the Minister clarify whether products will have the same definition as long-term financial services?</p> <p>  Products that exceed six years but are subject to annual renewals would have to be complained about to the Financial Services Ombudsman within six years of being sold.  Therefore, is it the case that once they are renewed, the clock starts to tick again in year one?  Can the Minister give us examples of products that would not be renewed annually but would exceed six years and for which people therefore would not have the right to appeal to the ombudsman?</p></speech>

There is already a time limit in the pensions legislation, which has generally operated well since 1996.  There is experience of the operation of the provision in respect of the Pensions Ombudsman.</p> <p>  On the Deputy's question on the definition of a long-term financial service, I understand it means a financial service within the meaning of the Central Bank Act 1942, as amended, the term of which exceeds six years, is not subject to annual renewal and is sold to a consumer by a regulated financial service provider.  We will carry that definition from the 1942 Act forward into this Bill.</p></speech>

Six years would be the limit and that should be sufficient.  There is a range of things.  The insurance company writes stating that a person needs to renew for the following year.  All those kinds of products are annual renewal ones.</p></speech>

Let us stick with house insurance because it is renewed annually.  Many consumers, for right or wrong, will take out house insurance with a company when they buy the house and usually it will be renewed.  They will have set up a direct debit.  It is like car insurance.  If the letter is ignored, the disc will arrive in the post and the direct debits will be taken from the bank account.  The problem is that, after six years of automatic renewal of the home insurance, the person finds out in year seven that there has been an issue in terms of the conditions and that the insurance was mis-sold.  The person would not have a right to bring a claim to the Financial Services Ombudsman because it would be deemed a long-term product that is not subject to annual renewal.  That is my concern.</p></speech>

There are issues in our legislation but we teased them out with the Minister on Second Stage and will tease them out with the different witnesses who will appear before us.  There is no need to rehash those differences at this point in time.</p> <p>  The last thing I wish to raise concerns the current legislation.  The chairperson of the council must be chosen from the members and have experience of consumer issues in the field.  The new draft seems to drop the stipulation that the chairperson would have experience of consumer issues in the field.  This is probably an issue in terms of the council itself.  There is no minimum requirement for the overall numbers on the council to have consumer experience.  There was a requirement for the chairperson to have consumer experience, but that now seems to have been dropped.  Was that intentional or is it something we can work on?</p></speech>

The person with exclusively consumer issues experience at their fingertips might not necessarily be the person best positioned to adjudicate on a different type of complaint which involved the complications of a particular service.  Again, it is a drafting issue and we are quite open to discussing it on the merits.</p></speech>

Is that something that could be addressed in the legislation as it is progressed?  Does the Minister have a view at this stage on whether there should be a minimum number of individuals with that type of experience serving on the council?</p></speech>

At least two members must have knowledge or experience of consumer protection and other consumer issues relating to the provision of financial services; at least one member must have knowledge or experience of the financial services industry; and at least one member must have knowledge or experience in relation to the pensions industry.</blockquote> <p>One relates to financial services, one to pensions and two to consumer issues.  Then the other three are open.  However, that does not mean that one need only have two people with consumer related experience.  There can be more than two, but there must be a minimum of two.</p></speech>

However, from the point of view of a body that, in my view, is concerned with consumer protection, although financial institutions can also take a case to it as well, the requirement seems very light, particularly in light of the fact that the chairperson will no longer be required to have a consumer interests background.  It is something we can examine as the legislation progresses, but I think it needs to be rebalanced.</p></speech>

However, head 43 refers to the conduct of investigations.  However, subsection (4) provides, "The Ombudsman may, in the course of investigating a complaint, periodically report to the complainant on the progress of the investigation and, in so doing, may make such comments to the complainant on the investigation and its consequences and implications as that Ombudsman thinks fit."  What is meant by "thinks fit" or deems appropriate perhaps needs to be examined.  Will the Minister give us a sense of the guiding principles?</p> <p>  We can compare this with head 44.  If the ombudsman embarks on a process of mediation and the complainant or the ombudsman feels that the organisation, intermediary or institution against whom the complaint is being made is merely going through a box-ticking exercise to be seen to be going along with a process, what kind of recourse does the ombudsman have?  What level of discretion does the ombudsman have in determining that the financial institution is not playing ball and, therefore, that a sanction will be issued?  If the document is prepared for the purposes of the mediation, some of it may not be deemed to be admissible if it has gone through a mediation process.  The question then is how much power in real terms does the ombudsman have to ensure the financial institution goes along with the process or, at least, is an honest party to the process.</p></speech>

Here, the process is more quasi-judicial but there is also mediation.  We would envisage that there could be a dialogue between the complainant and the institution about which the complaint was made to see if a satisfactory resolution could be arrived at.  The power, referred to in section 4 of head 43, is already in the current legislation.</p></speech>

The briefing is by way of question and answer.  The question is:  will the Minister allow for an appeal and a full rehearing to be made to the Circuit Court?  The complainants can decide at the outset whether to bring their dispute to the appropriate court, depending on the quantum of their claim or alternatively to complain to the ombudsman free of charge.  There is an initial decision to go to the ombudsman when a complainant could go to the courts directly.  The ombudsman is designed to be a low cost alternative to the courts system.  The ombudsman has significant powers to investigate and examine witnesses similar to a High Court or a judge.  However, there is the option of a High Court review of the ombudsman's decision as set out in head 48 but it is not a <i>de novo</i>appeal.  It is a review of the actions of the ombudsman to see if there was an error in law.</p><p>Allowing for an appeal instead to a Circuit Court of a decision of the ombudsman brings challenges.  For instance, the provider could appeal every decision made by the ombudsman in favour of the complainant in the hope that the court will provide a different outcome in their favour.  The consumer would then have to defend the appeal to the Circuit Court with all the attendant expense.</p><p>The provider is in a considerably stronger position both to the go to the Circuit Court and to succeed at the Circuit Court.  The real effect is not only that the provider is in a stronger position on a case-by-case basis, but the existence of the threat of an appeal by the provider operates as a deterrent to consumers to complain generally.  The complainant would be exposed to the risk of liability for costs of a successful Circuit Court appeal by the provider.</p><p>In the existing statutory appeal to the High Court the complainant is shielded by the high threshold, which is applied to the statutory appeal, and by the fact that the Financial Services Ombudsman can be a party to the complaint and thus take the role of defending its own decision.  Neither of these factors operate in a Circuit Court <i>de novo</i>appeal so the real effect is not only that the provider is in a stronger position on a case-by-case basis, but that the existence of the threat of an appeal by the provider operates as a deterrent to consumers generally.  The more subtle and long-term risk here is that it becomes a deterrent to the complainants bringing their case, even at first instance, as they could be exposed to the cost of the provider working their way up through the appeals system of the courts.  In addition, allowing for a full rehearing could allow for a situation where people use the ombudsman as the first step in litigation before inevitably going before the courts.  This would result in a floodgate scenario for the office which would have implications for staffing and the effectiveness of the office to process and determine complaints.</p><p>The ombudsman is a statutory officer with the powers of a High Court judge in carrying out investigations and examining witnesses.  The ombudsman holds an important public role and to have appeals go to a lower court would undermine the work of the ombudsman.  A review by the High Court is more appropriate.</p><p>Finally, where a Circuit Court appeals process may appear to benefit the consumer as it is cheaper it should be borne in mind that the Circuit Court can only award in cases up to &euro;75,000 where the ombudsman can award compensation up to &euro;250,000.  In addition, the Circuit Court will not hold an investigation as the ombudsman can.  Instead the consumer will be obliged to prove his or her case <i>de novo</i>to the civil standard without the benefit of the ombudsman who can look into all of the codes of practice and regulatory standards in addition to the facts of the case.  On balance, therefore, I do not believe that an appeal to the Circuit Court would provide greater consumer protection.</p><p>To answer the Senator's question, it is not a constitutional issue.  There is an appeal intended but it is confined to a point of law.  It is a point of law appeal to the High Court.  That is the first position.  To have an appeal to the Circuit Court one would have to be equal in the rights given to the complainant and to the provider.  The argument in the briefing note I have given the committee is that an appeal to the Circuit Court would tip the balance in favour of the provider rather than the complainant as the provider would be in a better position to carry the costs and could appeal <i>de novo</i>every new complaint and make it very expensive for a complainant.  As a consequence, obviate the inexpensive access that a complainant would have to the ombudsman by putting a Circuit Court appeal on as a tail.  As a consequence, this might operate as a deterrent to complainants and undermine what our intention is in going the ombudsman's route.</p></speech>

One might get a flood of complaints where the intention of the complainant was never to conclude them within the ambit of the ombudsman's powers but to use them as a kind of introductory procedure on the way to court.  Again, that would act as an obstacle to the operation of the powers, as we intend them, vested in the ombudsman.  There are a couple of sub-routes there as well.  It is the kind of thing that we will need to tease out to see where the balance of advantage lies.  I want it to operate in the interest of consumers that they have low cost or no cost access to a complaints procedure to the Financial Services Ombudsman or the Pensions Ombudsman, and that there are not other heads the consequences of which might be to obstruct that access in one way or another.</p></speech>

I acknowledge what has been said by the Minister and the potential consequences that could flow from an appeal to the Circuit Court.</p><p>I am not dismissing that.  I am not fully sure that we can get around this.  For example, if an appeal was made based on a point of law could the ombudsman represent the consumer in the Circuit Court and so on?  </p><p> Representatives of FLAC will appear before the committee later today.  I would like to take this opportunity to point out for the benefit of the Minister what FLAC has to say in its written submission.  It states that in 2012, 37 appeals were recorded by the High Court, in respect of which in 31 cases the consumer was the appellant.  In other words it was the consumers who took the financial institutions to the High Court.  Many people would not have the means to do that.  The Financial Services Ombudsman is the notice party in this area.  If Mary has been mis-sold a financial product by one of the main financial institutions in this country and the Financial Service Ombudsman finds that Mary does not have a case that he or she can uphold and Mary then takes an appeal to the High Court, that case is defended by the Financial Services Ombudsman, involving the use of our money, rather than the financial institution, be that Allied Irish Bank, Bank of Ireland, Permanent TSB and so on.  They are shielded, not the consumer.  </p><p> While I do not agree totally with the arguments made by the Minister I do not dismiss them.  I have been watching this area closely for the last number of years and I have noted a marked increase in terms of mediation, as mentioned by the Minister.  Progress is being made in that regard and that is to be welcomed but regardless of who we are or in what sphere we operate there will always be mistakes made or errors in terms of judgment.  That will be the case with the Financial Services Ombudsman such that consumers will have the wrong decisions handed down to them.  At this point in time the only option open to consumers that believe they have been wronged by the decision of the Financial Services Ombudsman is an appeal to the High Court, which is simply beyond the means of many individuals.  The issue is how we ensure there is full recourse to the courts available to an individual.  As I said, the record shows that in 2012 the rate of appeal on a decision of the Financial Services Ombudsman by consumers versus the regulated financial services was 6:1.</p></speech>

As such, a new perspective on the evidence would not apply.  The adjudication would be whether the ombudsman erred in law or not.  That would be the net point.  Whether the appeal is to the Circuit Court or the High Court the procedure is the same.  In addition, the Circuit Court jurisdiction value is lower than that of the High Court, which as I said, is set at &euro;75,000 rather than &euro;250,000 in the ombudsman's case.  An appeal may need to be to the High Court or the Circuit Court, depending on the financial jurisdiction of the court.  I do not think it is possible to have an appeals system to two separate courts for different complaint values.  That could be confusing to consumers.</p> <p>  I do not want to be categoric about this at this stage of the process.  We are only at the pre-legislative scrutiny stage.  What we will take on board from this stage of the process is possible amendments to the heads or new heads of the Bill, which will form part of the examination of the process as a whole.  There is merit in what the Deputy said.  There is also merit in what I said in the speaking note which I read out.  We need further consideration of the issue.  I presume FLAC will offer its view to the committee later today and that the ombudsman will also have a strong view on this matter.  I am prepared to wait for further advice and further discussion.</p></speech>

The introduction by the Minister of the 20% tax closed off the loophole in this area, and rightly so.  However, we now find that debt investors-vulture funds are running amok in terms of the penal interest rates, charges and penalties they are applying to loans which they have acquired.  We may need to bring the credit service providers before this committee to discuss this issue or to consider the establishment of a credit service ombudsman.  Will the penal interest rates, charges and penalties being charged by these debt investors-vulture funds be covered by this legislation?</p></speech>

I have already responded to the effect that they would fall within the remit of the legislation if the institutions involved are regulated financial services entities.  As I understand it, they are.  In regard to the other points made by the Senator, I would need evidence from him that what he is saying is happening.  My information is that this is not happening because when a so-called vulture fund acquires a loan book it has to honour the original provisions of the mortgage.  As such it cannot under law do what the Senator is saying.  We legislated to prevent that almost two years ago.</p></speech>

I am pleased to have the opportunity, together with the deputy Financial Services Ombudsman, Ms Elaine Cassidy, to engage with the committee as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the financial services and pensions ombudsman Bill and Deputy Doherty's Private Members' Bill.  The Government has decided to amalgamate the offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman and the legislation the committee is considering here today, if enacted, will enable this.  We have undertaken considerable work in preparation for the amalgamation, including administrative integration and co-location.  I was appointed as Financial Services Ombudsman in April 2015 and appointed Pensions Ombudsman in May 2016.  Currently, I hold both of these offices in separate capacities under the relevant legislation.  My colleague, Ms Cassidy, was appointed deputy Financial Services Ombudsman in January this year.  She is deputy ombudsman designate for pensions as the current legislation does not provide for a deputy Pensions Ombudsman.  She will assume that element of the role when the legislation under consideration here today is enacted.  We look forward to fully amalgamating both offices on enactment of the legislation.  We also look forward to the enactment of the other provisions in the Bill which will provide greater protection for consumers.  I will comment further on this later but first I wish to provide some background to our work and its current legislative basis.  In particular, I wish to provide details of a major transformation that we are implementing in our office.</p> <p>  The long and well-established role of an ombudsman is to seek to redress the difference in power and resources between the individual and large institutions.  My job, therefore, is to address the very significant imbalance of resources that exists between the consumers and providers of financial services.  The Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, was established in 2005 to deal independently with complaints from consumers about their dealings with regulated financial service providers.  The operation of the office is funded by a levy on the industry.  Complaints can be taken by individuals as well as limited companies and unincorporated bodies such as partnerships, charities, clubs, trusts and sole traders with an annual turnover of no more than &euro;3 million.  A time limit of six years for making complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman is set out in the Act.  The Office of the Pensions Ombudsman was set up under the Pensions Act 1990.  The Pensions Ombudsman investigates and rules on complaints from members and beneficiaries of pension schemes regarding complaints about occupational pension schemes, personal retirement savings accounts and trust retirement annuity contracts in both private sector and public sector schemes.  Generally, the Pensions Ombudsman operates under a six-year time limit but there is also a three-year awareness provision.  The Pensions Ombudsman has some discretion to consider a complaint or dispute outside these timeframes.  Subject only to an appeal to the High Court, the decisions of both offices are binding on all parties.</p> <p>  The 2004 Act establishing the Financial Services Ombudsman is very strong in its intent to establish a true alternative to the adversarial court system.  It clearly sets out that the principal function of the Financial Services Ombudsman is to deal with complaints made by way of mediation and, where necessary, by investigation and adjudication.  It also sets out that the Financial Services Ombudsman is required to act in an informal manner and according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the complaint without regard to technicality or legal form.  These very important provisions have been supported by the High Court in a number of challenges to findings of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It is clear from the legislation as endorsed by the courts that the intention of the Oireachtas was to establish a system for resolving complaints against financial service providers that is informal and in which the preferred method of resolution is mediation.  Only where necessary is it intended to resolve complaints by investigation and adjudication.  However, I must acknowledge that this is not how the service has developed over the years.  Until February of this year, fewer than 1% of complaints were resolved through mediation.  This meant that a significant number of complaints required full investigation and adjudication.  In the main, this was because financial service providers refused to engage in the mediation process.</p> <p>  While the 2004 Act clearly promotes mediation as the preferred method of resolving complaints, it also provides strong powers for the ombudsman to adjudicate.  A complaint may be upheld on a very broad range of grounds including that the conduct complained of was contrary to law, unreasonable, unjust or improperly discriminatory in its application to the complainant, or that the conduct complained of was otherwise improper.  This showed great foresight on the part of the legislators in 2004.  It allows me to go beyond simply looking at contractual terms and, instead, to take a much broader view of the fairness and equity of an issue.  Where a complaint is upheld, the 2004 Act contains a wide range of powers which are available to the ombudsman.  I can direct a financial service provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;250,000 and I can also direct rectification.  Such rectification can be very significant as it can involve putting a person back to the position in which they previously were before the complaint arose.  In some instances, such as where a home or life insurance policy has been voided or an income continuance or life insurance claim denied, this is potentially more important for the complainant than compensation.  In addition, I can require a financial service provider to change a practice relating to that conduct.  I can publish the names of financial service providers who have three or more complaints against them substantiated or partly substantiated in a year.</p><p>Furthermore, I can make a report to the Central Bank where I have concerns that the conduct of a provider could have negative repercussions for other consumers.</p><p> While it is clear that significant powers are available to the ombudsman, a view had emerged that the Financial Services Ombudsman was not making maximum use of these powers in the interest of consumers.  To tackle this, I commissioned a strategic and operational review jointly with the then Pensions Ombudsman, Paul Kenny.  This independent review consulted widely with our stakeholders, including a large cohort of complainants who had used our service.  It examined current operations and business processes in both organisations.  It also took into account the findings and recommendations of the FLAC report, Redressing the Imbalance.</p><p> The review report, which is available on our website, recommended that we should adopt a more proportionate, informal and preventative approach to dispute resolution.  We have responded to our service users' feedback and the review recommendations by putting in place a three-year programme of change, which commenced in February 2016.  This is already delivering significantly improved outcomes for users of our services.</p><p> All our stakeholders told us that they wanted a faster, less formal, simpler dispute resolution service.  For this reason we introduced a new dispute resolution service through which we seek to achieve a fair resolution at the earliest possible stage through the use of mediation techniques which are flexible and informal.  The new service involves considerably more interaction with the parties, particularly in terms of listening to them at an early stage of the process and giving everyone a chance to be fully heard.  We use a combination of face-to-face meetings, phone calls and e-mails, and this approach is delivering a faster, more efficient and effective service that puts the needs of service users at its core and gives both parties the opportunity to develop a shared understanding of the complaint and work towards reaching a swift and fair resolution that both parties can accept.</p><p> Although it has to be acknowledged that it is very early days, I am pleased to report positive levels of engagement in the new process and very positive feedback from complainants who have used the new service.  A total of 1,881 complaints were resolved through the new dispute resolution service between 1 February 2016 and 30 September 2016, compared to 70 complaints resolved by mediation in 2015, in itself a significant increase, and 822 cases settled directly between the parties in 2015.  To evaluate its effectiveness and to enable continuous improvement we have now begun to undertake ongoing user surveys.  The results of the first survey undertaken since the changes were introduced are very encouraging and demonstrate a more positive experience for service users, indicating that we have laid a strong foundation on which to build.  The key findings include increased satisfaction among those who responded across all of the indicators.  We have set these out in the document we have submitted and I do not propose to go through them in detail.  While we are naturally pleased with these encouraging responses, we are also conscious that it is early days and that these responses do not include complainants who had their complaint adjudicated.  All cohorts will be included over time.</p><p> Despite the success of the dispute resolution service there will inevitably be complaints that will not be resolved through these early interventions and there will be complainants who may not want to use this process.  In such cases, the parties continue to have the option of having their complaint independently adjudicated by the ombudsman and a legally binding finding issuing.  We are also making changes to our adjudication process and in 2017 we will commence issuing a preliminary finding to both parties.  This will allow parties to make submissions relating to possible errors of law or significant additional points of fact prior to a legally binding finding issuing.</p><p> I again thank the committee for the opportunity to engage with it as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny for both Bills.  I also thank the officials from the Department of Finance, with whom we have had considerable engagement.  We welcome the financial services and pensions ombudsman Bill as published.  We welcome the general consensus that appears to exist on the need for its provisions.  The Bill as published retains the many excellent and important provisions of the 2004 Act, which gives the Financial Services Ombudsman significant powers to redress the imbalance between consumers and financial service providers and empowered us to implement our new processes.  I believe the new Bill provides additional and very important powers.  I particularly welcome the extension of the six year rule, the provisions relating to a complainant who is or becomes unable to act for herself or himself, the suspension of the limitation period during internal dispute resolution procedures, the specific provision to issue a preliminary decision, the provision to publish decisions while maintaining the confidentiality of the complainant and the provision to publish reports on any investigation as the ombudsman sees fit.  The Bill as presented continues to strike the right balance between our ability to resolve disputes informally and, where this is not possible, to provide redress through investigation and adjudication.</p><p> Our promotion of, and emphasis on, informal dispute resolution and mediation should not be mistaken for some form of light touch approach.  This approach is designed to provide complainants who use our service with a simple, effective and speedy resolution of complaints against financial service providers.  However, I have very significant powers in terms of providing redress for complainants and I have not been, and will not be, found wanting in using these powers without fear or favour as they were intended.  I assure the committee that, together with the deputy ombudsman and our entire team, I am fully committed to using any powers afforded to the financial services and pensions ombudsman by the Oireachtas to the fullest extent possible.  I thank the Chairman and committee members for their time and I look forward to the discussion.</p></speech>

We would like to put on the record our appreciation and thanks for the interest Deputy Doherty has shown in our 2014 report, Redressing the Imbalance, which forms some of the proposals in the Private Member's Bill before the committee.</p> <p>  We have put together a short submission, which I must say has been hastily assembled.  We have been looking at the heads of the Bill, which are quite detailed and contain quite a lot of slightly altered proposals, and we hope to make a full submission on the heads of the Bill in due course.</p> <p>  I will now speak about our 2014 report and the reasons for it.  As committee members probably know, we have been involved in many law reform campaigns, including on personal insolvency.  When the personal insolvency legislation was finally put in place in 2013 we felt it was opportune to look at what went wrong and what protection was in place for consumers of financial services, in particular people availing of credit and associated products.  We looked at a range of consumer credit legislation and consumer protection codes, and how these codes and legislation are enforced, particularly regarding reckless lending which is now acknowledged to have occurred very frequently during the years at the end of the boom in particular.  We were looking at what legislative protection is in place for consumers of financial services, thus the name of the report, Redressing the Imbalance, because our ultimate conclusion is the consumer is nowhere near as protected as the provider.</p> <p>  Part of the research was to speak to people who had made complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman and to people who had assisted complainants, particularly those attached to the Money Advice &amp;amp; Budgeting Service, MABS.  These interviews were conducted by our colleague, Dr. Stuart Stamp, a research associate at NUI Maynooth and an independent social policy researcher.  The research indicated a fair degree of dissatisfaction from a number of complainants about the processes they faced when they made a complaint, particularly regarding an over-reliance on the exchange of paperwork.  Many of the complainants felt this disadvantaged them and gave a natural advantage to the financial service provider.  A big problem is the lack of access for complainants to specific assistance to frame complaints, understand submissions and look at issues such as the adequacy of settlements that might be proposed.</p> <p>  From a philosophical point of view, our report departs from the principle that a consumer of financial services takes an economic risk but instead is a person who contributes hugely to economic growth in the society in which he or she lives and therefore is entitled to substantial protection in law which, in our view, has not always been there.  We feel this is part of a wider broader right of access to justice, that the consumer should be adequately protected by the State, entitled to fair redress and must be provided with timely and adequate advice and information.</p> <p>  With regard to the legislation establishing the Financial Services Ombudsman, the points we examined in the report which are reflected in the Private Member's Bill are the six-year time limit on complaints, what we feel is the ambiguous and difficult language concerning the ombudsman's mandate, the problematic definition of consumer, how findings are classified and the very difficult and, in our view, prohibitive avenue of appeal to the High Court.</p><p>As we stated, we are also concerned by the view expressed by a number of complainants that the processes had essentially disadvantaged them.  This is also reflected in the fact that the consumer must first make a complaint under the terms of the consumer protection code to the financial service provider's internal complaints mechanism before he or she can make a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  While the provider is supposed to meet a 40-day time limit, it appears from anecdotal evidence that this time limit is often exceeded and by the time complainants get to the ombudsman, they may already believe they are up against it, as it were.<br/><br/>We also looked at the Financial Services Ombudsman reports for the period from 2006 until 2012.  We found the information trends disturbing.  For example, many complaints were disappearing from the radar under the heading &quot;No further contact from the consumer&quot;.  In addition, issues such as settlements were being recorded as being resolved in the complainant's favour, whereas a settlement is not necessarily always in the complainant's favour.  We also looked at the low and declining rates of success for complaints that proceed to adjudication.  In 2012, 10% of complaints were upheld, 17% were partially upheld and 73% were declined.  Low levels of compensation are also a factor.  <br/><br/>To be fair, since the publication of our report, the current Financial Services Ombudsman has been much more proactive about looking at and trying to capture information trends, as he has set out.  Nonetheless, in 2015, for example, more than 1,700 complaints or 35% of the total were closed due to no further contact.  The ombudsman and his staff are examining the reasons this is occurring.  In our view, the reason may be the perception among complainants that the odds and processes are stacked against them and substantially advantage the provider.<br/><br/>In terms of pre-legislative scrutiny, we focus on five specific issues covered in the Private Members' Bill.  As I indicated, the free legal aid centres examined the heads yesterday.  Many detailed issues arise which will require further elaboration.<br/><br/>On the issue of the statute of limitations, on which there is fairly broad agreement, albeit not on the nuances of what should be the amendment, we note that the three-year limitation period from the time the consumer becomes aware of, or ought to have been aware of, the conduct of the provider that gives rise to the complaint, is only available for long-term financial products.  A long-term financial product means a financial service, the term of which exceeds six years.  We are a little concerned about the wording used here.  Does it include payment protection policies, for example, which do not have a term, as such, but are paid on a monthly basis?  This issue should be clarified. <br/><br/>The issue of how a court will assess when a person ought to have known of the conduct that gave rise to the complaint and what criteria would be used is also critical.  We have had difficulty for some time with the informal aspect, without regard to technicality or legal form, of the ombudsman's mandate.  As a legal rights organisation, we have difficulty with a requirement to make decisions without regard to technicality or legal form.  The High Court, on a number of occasions, has overturned decisions of the ombudsman where the ombudsman has acted incorrectly in law in the High Court's opinion.  This mandate is unnecessary and should be clarified. <br/><br/>The problematic definition of the term &quot;consumer&quot; is raised in our submission and the FLAC report and it has been pointed out by the courts in one or two decisions.  The definition is extremely wide.  The Bill reflects the view that a distinction should be drawn between a personal or ordinary consumer and a commercial consumer.  Well-known complaints have been brought by credit unions and investors with large property portfolios, which are very different consumers from an ordinary person who has an insurance policy that does not pay out.  This issue needs to be addressed, perhaps in a two-tiered process. <br/><br/>Some of our respondents were very unhappy with how findings were classified.  One or two were shocked and a little annoyed to find that their complaint had been classified as being partly substantiated when they believed it had been substantially rejected.  We proposed in our report a reclassification of how findings are recorded.<br/><br/>The final issue addressed in the submission is the very important matter of the avenue of appeal to the High Court, as provided for in the current legislation.  The proposed legislation maintains this avenue to the High Court.  This is a limited appeal which is akin to an appeal on a point of law.  The High Court is a prohibitive venue for consumers to go to, especially without access to legal advice and representation, which are, by and large, not available from the State.  In the debate on 6 October last, the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, addressed this issue and made some interesting points.  He stated, for example, that in the existing statutory appeal to the High Court, the complainant is shielded by the high threshold that is applied to the statutory appeal.  A practice has developed over the years whereby the ombudsman acts as the respondent in all appeals.  This is a little unusual for an alternative dispute resolution process.  Our report records that 31 of the 37 appeals to the High Court in 2012 were brought by consumers.  As such, if anybody is being shielded as a notice party, perhaps it is the financial services provider.  We propose a full <i>de novo</i>appeal to the Circuit Court for both parties.  Obviously, there are dangers inherent in this proposal, particularly if financial service providers decide to routinely appeal decisions of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  However, the right to a full appeal is a fundamental issue of access to justice and should be buttressed by the availability of civil legal aid from the State for consumers to either appeal or defend an appeal. <br/><br/>There are still many people who wish to make complaints who do not have access to assistance to properly frame their complaint, which is a major difficulty.  I thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

Under the Government's legislation, the timeframe is three years from the point at which the consumer becomes aware of or ought to have become aware of the conduct.  The provisions of the legislation governing the Pensions Ombudsman are close to those set out in the heads of the Bill, with one major omission, namely, the right of the ombudsman under section 131(4)(<i>b</i>) to extend the period.  The relevant paragraph states a complaint may be made &quot;<font color="#5F5F5F">within such longer period as the Pensions Ombudsman may allow if it appears to him that there are reasonable grounds for requiring a longer period and that it would be just and reasonable so to extend the period&quot;.</font>This power is being removed from the office of the ombudsman in the new legislation.  The power could be regarded as a safety net in respect of cases where a financial institution or pensions provider argues on a technicality that the complainant ought to have become aware of the conduct.  In such cases, the ombudsman should have the power to extend the period.  Should this option continue to be available to the Pensions Ombudsman and the new office of the ombudsman?</p></speech>

Everybody is in agreement on that.</p> <p>  On the specific provision, I understand it has not been used, which does not mean it is not beneficial.</p><p>I am not aware that it has been required.  One of the risks with discretionary legislation is that it can become a focus as to how the Financial Services Ombudsman would exercise his jurisdiction.  We should look to get the six-year rule more generally extended in both instances.</p><p> Pensions are generally long-term products, which means they are covered by the extension in general.  To have that same discretionary provision for short-term products that are renewed regularly may not be necessary.  However, it is a provision that exists and we would be happy to see it remain.  Getting the six years extended for the long-term products is the key thing.  The people who are disadvantaged at the moment are those who, for example, bought a life insurance policy and do not realise they have a difficulty until they come to claim.</p></speech>

Obviously, the focus is on the six-year rule, but we also need to deal with the detail of it.  I asked the Minister how we would determine that a person ought to have known there was inappropriate conduct by the provider.  It will fall to the Financial Services Ombudsman to make that determination.  I ask Mr. Deering to give me some examples of where his office would adjudicate that somebody who was sold an insurance product or a mortgage ought to have known.</p></speech>

At that stage, the person certainly knows there is a problem.  As currently proposed, the clock starts then and the person has three years from the date that the claim was rejected.  I have to be careful here because each case needs to be considered in its own right.  I am giving a fairly general example.</p></speech>

In that case that is when the consumer actually knew there was an issue, as opposed to "ought to have known".  When is the point that they ought to have known?  That is a really grey area where the provider could argue that the buyer signed the document and saw the terms.  They may have been grey and not very understandable to a consumer, but the person signed the document and technically ought to have known what he or she was signing.  In some cases people probably signed to confirm they understood what was being stated.</p> <p>  I know I am putting Mr. Deering on the spot here.  I ask him to give an example and perhaps better still follow up later with the committee outlining hypothetical cases where "ought to have known" would have arisen.</p></speech>

I have not come across those cases where that provision has been used yet.  I would be happy to provide anonymised case studies to the committee where it has been used.</p> <p>  In the case the Deputy has outlined, I accept that a provider might make that argument.  However, if a person became aware today that they were being refused a policy that they believed covered what they purchased at the time, for me the trigger is the day on which they find out they cannot access that policy.</p></speech>

If that is the way these are to be adjudicated, there is no reason to have "ought to have known" in the legislation.  If it is the case that it is when they have found out that in their view they have been mis-sold a product, then it should be left to when they "have known".</p></speech>

It is also important to consider how we define when somebody has known.  There is the argument that "ought to have known" leaves discretion there.  Simply because somebody got a letter or something happened does not rule the person out from having the complaint.  Our aim would certainly be to have as many claims as possible included.  I appreciate that work remains to be done on this and we will be part of that discussion.  Our aim would be to ensure that nobody is disadvantaged by any of the wording.</p></speech>

For example, there has been considerable recent publicity about people having been unfairly taken off tracker mortgages with a look-back and complaints mechanism put in place.  Hypothetically, I could envisage a lender claiming that that was in the public domain, that there was redress available for having been wrongfully taken off a tracker mortgage and that those who did not make a complaint at the time it was in the public domain certainly should have known they had time to make a complaint.</p> <p>  I absolutely take the Deputy's point that the time at which the person knew or ought to have known may be simultaneous but it is conceivable that in an instance like that, it would not be.  It raises a very important issue of consumer knowledge.  By and large the provider has the expertise and the financial knowledge, but many consumers, who simply have to avail of financial services as part of everyday life, do not necessarily have the financial expertise to understand products, and to understand when they ought to have made a complaint and when the clock starts to run.  It is a very important discussion.  During the debate on 6 October there was a suggestion that the Office of the Attorney General would have to look at this in some detail.  Thankfully, we are only at the stage of the heads of the Bill, but it certainly requires considerable clarification and discussion.</p></speech>

House or car insurance, for example, with automatic renewal would not be deemed a long-term product.  However, if I was sold it seven years ago, did not do anything and the premium continued to be deducted from my bank account, I would be excluded from making a complaint.  I refer to making a claim seven years later only to find out the original policy I bought, which was renewed every year, was something completely different from what I thought I was sold.  Does Mr. Deering think there is a requirement to reconsider the definition of long-term products?</p></speech>

As has been said already, the Office of the Attorney General will obviously look at all of this in detail.  There is a crossover with the Statute of Limitations.  There is a distinction between a policy that is renewed every year and one that is purchased with a view to a pension in 15, 20 or 30 years time or a life insurance policy that becomes more critical as the person gets older.  There will always be a distinction between those types of products.  We need to look carefully at the interaction between the Statute of Limitations and the six-year rule for the one that is renewed every year.  There is a distinction between them and they would be treated differently in terms of consumer-----</p></speech>

However, in some people's minds these short-term products are long-term products.  We are having this pre-legislative scrutiny of the heads of the Bill to ensure it covers as many cases as possible.  I completely agree with Mr. Deering's view and, as I said earlier, from my point of view there is a marked improvement in the operation of his office.  Would it be helpful for the legislation to allow additional scope to adjudicate on products that were automatically renewed and to allow assessments of them to continue?</p><p>It is not a case where a person takes an insurance product and three years later they go with another company and then back to another company.  If it was a case where the person said that he or she did not contact the company but the company kept sending out the renewal slips and it just automatically happened - then there would be flexibility for the ombudsman to actually extend the period in cases like that.  It is linked to the original question around the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman's discretion with regard to the timeframes.  Would there be a requirement to do that in relation to this part of the heads of the Bill?</p></speech>

Again, I would take the view that anything that extends our powers, and anything that brings complaints within our remit safely is welcome.  By safely I mean that we must be conscious that there is a Constitution and the Statute of Limitations.  There are other areas in which we do not want to end up in conflict.  Certainly anything that will benefit the consumer - by looking at self renewing policies, where people do not necessarily pay as much attention as they would if they were to make a conscious effort to renew - would be helpful yes.</p></speech>

Perhaps the problem lies with the current definition of long-term financial service, because it says that the financial service must have a term which exceeds six years.  Is this the term that is stated in the financial product when a person takes it out first, that it has a duration of over six years, or is it the sum total of duration of the service when the person goes to make a complaint?  There are also forms of credit that have no fixed term, for example a credit card.  A person can draw down a credit card in the year 2000 and still be using it in 2016.  Is that a financial service the term of which exceeds six years?  Clarification of the definition would be helpful.  If it is the sum total of the time that a person has availed of the service then that would appear to allow complaints in.  If it is the total of the term such as a 25 or 30 year mortgage, then it may unwittingly exclude legitimate complaints.  That is the point we would like to make about the current definition of long-term financial service.</p></speech>

I am conscious that there are other members who wish to speak but the ombudsman has not addressed some of the issues with regard to my own piece of legislation.  With regard to the definition of the consumer, we have heard about individuals who are accessing the free services the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The courts have suggested that these individuals should not be accessing the services and they should be going to the Commercial Court.  The courts have also questioned the council in expanding the definition of consumer and questioned whether it would stand-up to a constitutional challenge.  I do not want to go into the constitutional part of it now as I want to go in to the principle behind it since we are only dealing with principles at the moment.  In Mr. Deering's view should the likes of credit Unions and property developers, who have quite large loans but who have a turnover of less than &euro;3 million, be able to access the free services of the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman or is it supposed to be very much for the personal consumer?</p></speech>

We are happy to come up with the definition that excludes major operators.  In fact we currently do, on occasion, say that we believe a case is more suitable for the courts, and we have that provision in the current legislation.  Obviously, if it was defined as a consumer we would be happy with that.  We do not see our services as being available to major investments, we believe they should be consumers.  As we have just said, how we arrive at that definition needs to be considered carefully so as not to exclude anybody unintentionally.</p></speech>

Section 4 of my proposed legislation considers the timeframe.  Section 5 covers mediation and the requirement of financial providers - in this case it would be pension providers - to give the reason why they would not involve mediation.  I do not want to repeat myself, but again, we recognise there is a marked and substantial increase in mediation and that is to be welcomed.  While the Office of the Financial Services Ombudsman's efforts are to be acknowledged in that area there is no guarantee that the increased engagement in mediation will continue into the future.  As Mr. Deering has acknowledged, the previously low rates of mediation were down to particular institutions not engaging and they may go back to that scenario.  What is Mr. Deering's view of the proposal that while it is not forcing them to mediation it is actually asking them to justify why they are refusing to go into mediation?</p></speech>

We have recently had a mediation awareness week.  Ms Cassidy and I were in the Courts Service where three eminent judges spoke about mediation and the promotion of mediation.  The whole thrust is on promoting mediation.  I note also that the courts are moving into the space of requiring a reason why people do not mediate or why mediation was not a success in their case.  We would be happy to welcome mediation and it fits with the suite of work we are doing in increasing and encouraging people to engage in mediation.</p></speech>

I will now turn to the next section.  In the current heads of Bill we have the existing categorisation of decisions being continued with.  The suggestion in this legislation stems from the work the FLAC has done and the suggestions that is has put forward.  The argument is, as we have heard from Mr. Joyce, that the definition of long-term financial service should be changed to give a clearer view as to what the real decision was.  The legislation would allow for different findings of sustained, not sustained and partially sustained.  What is Mr. Deering's view on that?</p></speech>

We accept that when they are all combined together it can be difficult to get an understanding.  I know the perception is, for example, that a partly upheld or partly sustained finding can be very minor, and it can be.  Equally, on the other side, I issued a finding recently where it was not fully upheld but the substantive part of it was upheld.  Without getting into the detail of which they are, anything that brings transparency is welcome.  We are quite open to the change that is proposed or to any of that type of change.  We have suggested, and have urged caution, that it needs to be carefully tied in to the publication so we do not lose the benefits of that.  The ultimate transparency is the proposal in the Bill that provides for publication as well.  We believe that would help.  We are open to the changes that are proposed and anything that would make our findings more transparent and understandable individually and collectively.</p></speech>

The Financial Services Ombudsman had to issue a finding saying that it was partially substantiated which would be the same as somebody who had a very technical minor issue but where the actual core argument was rejected.

The legislation sets out that the Financial Services Ombudsman provides 21 days.  The argument put forward is that after going into a quasi-judicial system where many people may not have legal representation and to then make a decision to go to the High Court along with the costs incurred to secure a solicitor, a barrister and to furnish them with the documents and so forth, 21 days is a very short period of time.  Does Mr Deering have a view if this can be extended to 60 days or 40 days or a different duration? From his experience does Mr. Deering have any information on the difficulties the limited time, currently provided under statute, may cause individuals?</p></speech>

The other thing is that the court has discretion to extend the time allowed, but not everyone would realise it.  We would accept that 21 days is very short, particularly at certain times of the year when courts are not sitting or people are away on leave, etc.  My understanding is that the legislation could provide for, say, 60 days and that the court rules would be amended to reflect that.  In particular, I would accept that 21 days is especially short for a consumer.  The provider knows, when it gets the finding, what it has to do, how the system works and that there is a time period of 21 days to appeal.  The consumer, generally, is getting a finding or a decision for the first time.  As Deputy Doherty rightly stated, by the time he or she has consulted someone, 21 days would be very short.  We would therefore be happy to see the time allowed extended.</p></speech>

I also would like to hear from the representatives of FLAC on this issue as it is one of the big core issues.  I welcome what the Minister stated in terms of the High Court.  The example FLAC gave of the number of consumers who appeal a decision in a particular year puts the ratio of appeals brought by consumers to appeals brought by financial providers at six to one.  What are Mr. Deering's views, if any, on how the appeals issue could be addressed?  Where decisions are taken by his office and consumers feel they were not right, they are basically being denied access to the judicial system because of the costs involved.  This legislation attempts to make it more accessible by providing for access to the Circuit Court, subject to there being no unforeseen consequences.  Does Mr. Deering have a view on how the circle could be squared?  Will Mr. Deering provide us with details on appeals that have taken place over the past five or six years?  Were they brought by the consumer or the financial institution and were they upheld or rejected by the court?  Will he give us a sense of that for our report to the Minister?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.232" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102700002#S00300"><p>I will come back to the committee with those details.  On the general point, I welcome what the Minister said about an engagement on this issue because it is a very big decision.  There could be unintended consequences of having appeals to both the High Court or the Circuit Court.  The risk associated with a <i>de novo</i>appeal in the Circuit Court for the consumer would be costs.  We do not have a set view on whether it should remain with the High Court or the Circuit Court but it is important to examine and research this carefully.  For example, in employment law, it was decided to move complaints from the Circuit Court because it was felt that the employer had deeper pockets in those cases.  It certainly is true that financial services providers have deeper pockets.  Before forming a final view on the matter, I would like to have some assurance that we would not find ourselves in a situation where people are afraid to take complaints to the ombudsman for fear of opening themselves to an appeal to the Circuit Court and that providers would see that as an avenue, in some way, to scare people.  Is there a way that it can be done without consumers running the risk of costs?  Mr. Joyce has mentioned the involvement of the ombudsman in the High Court.  We can discuss whether it is a good or a bad idea, but, if the ombudsman did not involve himself in the Circuit Court appeals, I think that would run the risk of costs to the consumer.  That is certainly a concern we would have.<br/><br/>Separately, it is worth noting that as part of our changes we are introducing a preliminary finding.  Currently, the first one knows of how a decision will go is when the finding is received from the ombudsman.  The point was made earlier that no one is infallible.  Currently, if someone gets a finding and something comes to light subsequent to it, be it a point of law or fact, the only way to deal with it would be for the ombudsman to go to the High Court to have the decision quashed.  We will now issue a preliminary finding.  This will be all but a finding.  It will not be legally binding but it will be a finding in every other respect.  We will invite, at that stage, submissions from both parties on points of law or fact that they believe have been decided wrongly.  It is not an appeal but it is our way of trying to give people an opportunity within the existing system to say they have an issue or a problem with the preliminary finding.  Regardless of where an appeal might lie, we think that will reduce the requirement on people to appeal.  We will introduce that within the existing system.  A lot more thought and consideration is needed before a final decision is arrived at as to where the appropriate place for an appeal lies.<br/><br/>The jurisdictional issue has also been mentioned.  The Financial Services Ombudsman can make an award of up to &euro;250,000 but I would say that is almost the least important remedy available.  The rectification powers that the Financial Services Ombudsman can apply is far more important.  For instance, a person's house is burned down and a financial service provider or insurance company has denied a claim simply because the person has said that he or she thought 30% of the roof was a flat roof but it turns out that 40% was a flat roof.  I am talking about real cases here where I have overturned such a decision.  In those cases, two things can happen.  The first is that the claimant loses the insurance claim.  In other words, the claim is not paid.  However, sometimes, and every bit as significant, the company cancels the person's insurance.  Now the claimant cannot get insurance anywhere else.  In certain instances, I have directed that the insurance company reinstate the insurance and pay the claim.  That can be much more important.  From a jurisdictional point of view, the value of that is way beyond the current jurisdiction of the Circuit Court.  Do we have a twin-track approach?  A lot needs to be considered when changing the appeals process.  I am not against the concept of an easier route to appeal.  I just think we need to consider what are the possible consequences that might arise.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Joyce" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016102700002#S00500"><p>We agree that it is a difficult question.  The first point to make is that the current situation is not satisfactory for a consumer wishing to appeal to the High Court.  This is a limited appeal - something that the legislation does not make clear.  An ordinary consumer reading the legislation would think an appeal is a full appeal on the merits of the decision.  It is not.  The High Court, in a series of decisions, has stated that the Financial Services Ombudsman is a specialist tribunal, that it will defer to his expertise and will only overturn his decision if there is an error in law or a serious error of fact.  There are a number of decisions to that effect.  It is a limited appeal and consumers do not necessarily understand that fact.  Many consumers appeal on their own.  They are lay litigants who are going down to the High Court and risking an adverse costs order being made against them.  I think it is still the practice of the Financial Services Ombudsman to inform an appellant that costs will be pursued.  The ombudsman may not necessarily do so in practice but that is the format.  It is not satisfactory for consumers to find themselves in that position.<br/><br/>It is not easy to set out what would replace it.  If there is a full Circuit Court appeal and financial service providers start to routinely appeal decisions, then there is a potential danger from the consumer's point of view that he or she will be fixed with a costs order in the Circuit Court.  The point is that there needs to be an appeal mechanism.  Mr. Deering sets out that, for example, in employment law now there is no longer an appeal to the Circuit Court.  Under the new system, there are appeals on a point of law to the High Court.  However, there is an appeal process in that a full <i>de novo</i>appeal can be made to the Labour Court.  In the existing system, there is only one appeal from a decision of the Financial Services Ombudsman and it is a limited one to the High Court.  That clearly is unsatisfactory.</p></speech>

At present, can a small business launch a complaint with the Financial Services Ombudsman?  Does he ask it anything about its business in terms of turnover?  Does it have to be small or less than a certain amount?  How is it defined?</p></speech>

This is a concern for small businesses.  What Mr. Deering has stated is that if they push the claim, which they believe they are entitled to do and are entitled to payment, they will lose insurance cover, but he can insist this cover continues should they process the claim.</p></speech>

One is compensation and the other is rectification.  I can award compensation but, as I mentioned, the rectification can be to put the policy back in place or to admit the claim.  The best way to put it is that rectification tries to put the customers back to where they were before the event happened.  This is one of the possibilities of rectification.</p></speech>

To go back to what we have just been discussing, there are times when claims are denied where, in fact, the insurance company has not offered in its policy a great degree of transparency in terms of why a person might be refused.  People make a claim under a section under which they believe they are covered and suddenly the insurance company comes with a questionable reason for denying the claim.  The reading of the policy suggests a person is covered, but the company's interpretation thereafter denies the person the claim.  There are instances where the ombudsman has received such complaints.  I was at a small business forum recently and this was a particular issue.  Some of the small businesses there had been denied continual insurance with the same company simply because they challenged it and the insurance company felt it had the financial and other clout to tell the businesses it would not continue their insurance if they persisted with it.  Essentially this is the message and the ombudsman can deal with this.</p> <p>  Likewise, with regard to transparency, a financial adviser can give advice to a client about a particular product, which the client takes and proceeds to purchase the particular product, unaware of the fact the financial adviser is on both sides of the product.  Does the ombudsman handle this type of complaint?</p></speech>

There are some exceptions to it, but generally speaking if it is outside the six-year rule when the product was sold we are unable to deal with it.  This is why the conversation that happened earlier, and the proposal to extend the six-year rule, is so important.  As the Chairman rightly outlined, it is often too late and beyond six years before people realise what they thought they bought was not what they bought.  We must differentiate sometimes between non-performing and mis-selling.  They are quite complex sometimes.</p></speech>

I use this regularly.  Mr. Joyce has mentioned High Court cases, but there are High Court cases where this has been very usefully upheld in terms of appeals by providers against decisions we have made.  The best thing I can do is give an example.  The ombudsman found in favour of a complainant and made an award that compensation was to go to the complainant, but it should technically have gone to the estate and not the named complainant.  We were able to rely on this and the judge was able to state the beneficiaries and the complainant are the same people.  The judge in the case specifically used this and there are other examples.</p> <p>  I cannot stress enough this is an extremely important provision to us.  It has been very beneficial.  I cannot see any advantage, frankly, of taking it out.  It allows us to operate unlike a court.  It is hugely beneficial to complainants who come to us who are not legalled up.  I can understand how legal people would want this, but I cannot understand how consumers would benefit from taking it out.  It is of huge benefit to us in terms of the processes we have changed.  When we conducted our strategic and operational review everybody, without exception, responded there is too much paper, it is too legalistic and it takes to long.  They said they wanted a fast informal means of resolving complaints.</p> <p>  The survey we carried out showed that of the people who had complained to their bank and came to us, 80% of them never got to speak to anybody in the financial institution.  They had to deal with them by paper.  I should clarify this is with regard to organisations which employ more than 50 people, but this is all the banks and insurance companies.  Interestingly, the reverse was the case of the smaller brokers and those who employ fewer than 50 people, whereby 80% of people had an opportunity to speak to somebody.  In cases involving the larger providers, 80% never had an opportunity to speak to somebody.  We believe that if they had they might have resolved the complaint.  They then came into a system where they were expected to deal with a complaint in writing again and they were already frustrated.</p> <p>  This is an extremely important provision.  It is worth repeating that the Financial Services Ombudsman is entitled to perform the functions imposed and exercise the power conferred by the Act free from interference from any other person and when dealing with a particular complaint is required to act in an informal manner and according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merit of the complaint without regard to technicality or legal form.  It allows us to adapt our procedures.  It does not absolve us from fair procedures.  Under no circumstances can any organisation ignore fair procedures and the law.

The difficulty with the wording is the requirement to act in an informal manner.  I do not believe the Financial Services Ombudsman is prevented from acting in an informal manner, even if it is not stated in the legislation.  The second part of the mandate - "according to equity, good conscience and the substantial merits of the complaint" - gives the ombudsman plenty of scope to act informally.  As a legal rights organisation, our big difficulty is with the requirement to act "without regard to technicality and legal form".  We have had experience of this.  We conducted some High Court appeals against decisions of the ombudsman that were, thankfully, successful where there had been errors and flaws.  It is important that any alternative dispute resolution service take the law into account and be required to do so, whereas this mandate seems to suggest otherwise.  We do not have a huge problem with informality; it is perfectly understandable that an alternative dispute resolution body such as the Financial Services Ombudsman would want to act informally, but, no more than the name and shame issue - we did not think the ombudsman had to have legislative power to name and shame - we do not think he has to have legislative power to act informally.</p></speech>

Again, it comes back to operating in an informal way.  One of the things we do, even if there is an issue about whether we have jurisdiction, is say to providers and complainants where they are in dispute: "Engage in the dispute resolution process, get into mediation to see if they can solve this, or we will investigate whether we have jurisdiction."  If we reach a certain stage where we do not have jurisdiction and the parties are not willing to agree, we will not progress the case to adjudication.  </p> <p>  I will address the second part of the Chairman's question.  We have a memorandum of understanding with the Central Bank.  Not infrequently I make reports to it when I find something.  It might concern one individual case, as the Chairman outlined, but I take the view that it could have a broader reach and could have happened to other consumers.  It could happen two reasons; I would consider the conduct to be either particularly egregious or possibly systemic.  In these cases we would certainly report to the Central Bank.  Generally, those involved are regulated financial services providers and their regulatory body is the Central Bank.  That is where we would certainly report the behaviour about which the committee is talking.</p></speech>

There is a view that it has been interpreted narrowly.  A consumer is not entitled to make a complaint where the conduct complained of occurred more than six years before.  This has been interpreted to mean more than six years from the date the product or service was purchased or received by the consumer.  There is an argument that in an instance such as the one being described, where there is collusion and a financial adviser is being paid from both sides, that the conduct is ongoing and that the consumer has a right to complain about it.</p></speech>

Although I have received threats of injunctions and actions, I have continued to take the broadest possible interpretation of jurisdiction.  There is a provision in the legislation dealing with conduct of a continuing nature.  I absolutely accept that if the conduct is of a continuing nature, it is relevant.  As the Chairman described, what is relevant is that it is continuing.</p></speech>

We were dealing with a complaint in the office for far too long and the argument was about jurisdiction.  I wrote to the two parties to ask if they would engage in mediation.  The provider stated it would engage on the basis that it would not concede jurisdiction.  Actually, when engaging in mediation one is not conceding anything, other than agreeing to listen to the other side.  The provider agreed to engage and the complaint was resolved.  My point is we have taken a very broad view.  I know that Deputy Pearse Doherty and Mr. Joyce have accepted this.  It is important to note that the report was produced in 2014 and that we have changed the process significantly.  We are pushing out the boundaries, particularly with regard to jurisdiction, and asking people to suspend judgment on jurisdiction to try to have the issue sorted and resolved.</p></speech>

People were sold a product without realising that for the individual adviser, bank or institution there would be ongoing benefits.  There was a benefit for financial advisers, whether inside or outside banks, in walking a person down the road towards accepting such financial cover.  Allowing this to go unchallenged is simply wrong.  In the case of those who were and still are involved in the institutions in the practice of benefiting from borrowers, those who took out endowment mortgages and the people I have described who took out other financial packages to deal with their affairs, it would be wrong to let this go.  It would be wrong not to, at least, bring together the information that proves that not only were the banks out of control at the time but that they were also abusing their position in benefiting from individuals and businesses that went to them for advice.</p><p>Senator O'Donnell made a valid point about a case being outside of the six years but it is worth commenting on, I think.  </p></speech>

I remember them as a product of the late 1980s to the early or mid-1990s.  Endowment mortgages were sold to people on the basis that they could have it both ways.  They could pay their mortgage but also receive a kickback when the endowment mortgage matured and at the end have a fund to educate their children.  The initiative was high risk and most of the endowment mortgages have ended up pear shaped.  I have found that this issue continually crops up and I have no doubt my colleagues have experienced the same.  My main reason for raising the matter this morning is because I have tried to help individuals deal with such mortgages.  Equally, people have contacted me because they ran the numbers and looked at their mortgages only to discover they have paid excessive amounts of money because they were caught for the premium and the endowment.  The product was also sold on the basis that it would be tax free.  It had a tiny element of a life policy that effectively made it tax free at the end.</p> <p>  A positive move would be to reform legislation but it would defeat that purpose if the elephant in the room that is endowment mortgages went unchecked.  Mr. Deering has stated that his office liberally interprets the legislation.  I have no doubt that multiple people have lodged complaints about endowment mortgages.  Why was the matter never dealt with under the existing framework?  </p></speech>

I would imagine it was because the product was sold outside of the six-year rule.  I can only stress that is why it is important the time limit that currently exists is extended.  As the Senator knows, the product was sold mainly in the 1990s.</p></speech>

We provided a dossier that contained a significant amount of information to the Central Bank that has informed its current examination.  Our co-operation with the Central Bank is extremely important and comes back to the Chairman's query about whether the matter is widespread or endemic.  We have 300 tracker complaints on hold in my office.  We have asked the consumers whether they want to progress or wait and the vast majority have decided voluntarily to put their complaints on hold.  Irrespective of what comes out of the examination conducted by the Central Bank into those banks, those people will have an opportunity to progress their complaint in our office.  Indeed, people will have an opportunity complain about the redress scheme if they are not satisfied that it is reasonable and meets their needs.  Within the existing confines we try to take the broadest possible view.  As Deputy Doherty has said, that the most significant aspect of his Bill, and we would say the same about the  Government's Bill, is the extension of the time limit, as it will be most beneficial to consumers.</p></speech>

Page 77 contains a short piece on endowment mortgages.  On 18 January 2006, one of Mr. Deering's predecessors explained endowments to the Joint Committee on Finance and the Public Service.  He said: "if the complaint is that the product was mis-sold at a date which is more than six years before the complaint was made" then it falls outside the FSO's statutory remit.  He continued by stating "if the complaint is that on the maturity of the policy the financial service provider failed ... to pay out moneys in accordance with the contractual" agreement, then "provided the complaint is made within six years of maturity of the policy", the FSO "will investigate" and make a ruling.</p> <p>  The essence of endowment mortgages, as the Senator will have seen from his accountancy practice, is that a lot of them were mis-sold at the point of sale.  In fact, the seller will have known that there would be insufficient proceeds to meet the principle that became due at the end of the endowment mortgage.  That appears to have been what rules out the complaints.  That brings us back to the question.  Is the conduct only at the point the endowment mortgage was drawn down or is there ongoing misconduct associated with such mortgages that should allow one to lodge a complaint?  I take Mr. Deering's point that a more liberal interpretation of the matter would be challenged in the courts.  It also raises an issue about the "ought to have known" issue.  Are people supposed to be following their endowment mortgage and how it is going so that they know they have a complaint?  Is it acknowledged when they find out there is a shortfall?</p></speech>

It could be alleged that a couple or single person who sought a mortgage from a financial institution but were on the edge of being approved and were told by an institution that it would be a good option to take the endowment mortgage route.  I would dare to call that instructive encouragement because that is what happened in reality.</p></speech>

The Lyons and Murray case is a good example, as the complaint was about whether &euro;17 million worth of loans were on an interest-only basis.  To us, it takes a lot of resources of the Financial Services Ombudsman to deal with those complaints and this led to the proposal to redefine "consumer" to accord with what is in the consumer protection code where, on the one hand, there is a personal consumer and, on the other hand, the consumer.</p><p>It may be possible, through some mechanism, to prioritise complaints from who we would regard as ordinary consumers who are frustrated about credit, insurance and investment issues.  </p></speech>

Equally, we agree that we are not there for the 17 million generally.  In fact, we have the discretion to say we think a complaint is more suitable for other areas.

Depending on the complexity of the complaint, it could be resolved within a few days.  Some cases are more complex, in particular those involving insurance, and may take a few months to resolve.  Ideally, we would look to close complaints within the dispute resolution system within eight weeks.  That is our informal target.  At the moment, because this is a new area, we are not quite making that target.  It would take longer on the adjudication side.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome Ms Valerin O'Shea, group chairperson, Dr. Jimmy Sheehan, orthopaedic surgeon and hospital developer, Dr. Finn Breathnach, children's cancer specialist, retired; Dr. Eamonn Faller, ex child patient and non-consultant hospital doctor; Ms Aisling McNiffe, parent representative and Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Healy, retired children's emergency medicine specialist of the Connolly for Kids Hospital Group.</p><p>While the committee has no function in choosing the location of the hospital which has already been decided, we welcome the opportunity to engage with the Connolly for Kids Hospital group and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to hear their views on the Cabinet decision to locate the hospital on the site of St. James's Hospital.  In 2012 the then Cabinet agreed to build the hospital on the site of St James's Hospital and planning permission was granted in May this year.  Site clearance has commenced and final construction contracts will be signed in the near future.<br/><br/>There has always been agreement that a purpose-built and dedicated hospital for children is a necessary component of a fully functioning health service.  The debate, however, has centred on its location.  The national paediatric hospital will be the largest infrastructural development in the health service.  It will provide essential specialist services for all children in Ireland at a single location and co-located with an adult teaching hospital and a future maternity hospital when the Coombe Women &amp;amp; Infants University Hospital is relocated to the site.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of thier evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any submission or opening statement submitted to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting.  <br/><br/>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>I ask Ms O'Shea to make the opening statement on behalf of Connolly for Kids Hospital.</p></speech>

We are a group of parents, grandparents, doctors and ordinary citizens who have no vested interest in the location of the children's hospital.  I am an ordinary member of the public, not a doctor.  I represent over 60,000 people who have signed a petition requesting that the site of the children's hospital be changed to Connolly Hospital instead of St. James's Hospital in the inner city.  </p> <p>  We are here to alert the committee to the consequences of the gravely mistaken decision to locate the new children's hospital on the site of St. James's Hospital and want to expose the ongoing political sham of trying to defend the indefensible.  It seems that only members of a medical and academic inner circle and some politicians are refusing to recognise the scale of the disaster to come if this decision is allowed to proceed.  A RED C poll has found that 73% of the public think the site of St. James's Hospital is the wrong one.  Nineteen city and county councils agree, as do almost all health care professionals.  A staff survey at Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, in November 2015 showed that 84% thought that the site of St. James's Hospital was not the best one for the children's hospital.  Well over 60,000 people signed a petition which was given to the Taoiseach last July requesting that the children's hospital be built on the site of Connolly Hospital in Blanchardstown beside the M50 and that the children's satellite urgent care centre, planned for Connolly Hospital, be built instead on the site of St. James's Hospital, in other words, that the sites be flipped.   We state categorically that flipping the sites would save time, money and, crucially, lives.  If there was the political will to do it, the hospital could be constructed on the site of Connolly Hospital within three years of the date of the decision at a saving of approximately &euro;200 million.  If the sites were to be flipped, work already undertaken on the site of St. James's Hospital would not be wasted.  Crucially, the Connolly Hospital site also offers space in which to grow, space which is not available on the site of St. James's Hospital.</p> <p>  We recognise that the job of the hospital development board is to get the hospital built on the site chosen by the Government.  It had no part to play in site selection, but, unfortunately, it has been put in a position where it appears to feel it has to make false and misleading statements to counter valid criticisms and major shortcomings of the site chosen.  A national advertising campaign in local area newspapers last month was riddled with incorrect statements.  Why does the board believe there is a need to deceive the public?  How are people like Liam McEntee's parents from Galway to feel about their needs being dismissed by the board in its cavalier attitude in stating only 1.45% of inpatients come from Galway?  How dare the board spend taxpayers' money to try to make patients from outside Dublin feel they are not important?</p> <p>  It was a flawed decision from the start.  It is most important for the committee to know that An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision cannot be used to justify the choice of site.  It was based solely on planning considerations.  It avoided considering how the children's hospital would function; it was not the board's role to determine whether the building would be fit for purpose as a hospital now or into the future.  That responsibility lies with the Department of Health. </p> <p>  We wish to point out that no report, either national or international, ever recommended the St. James's Hospital site.  The reason given for choosing that site was "the overriding priority of best clinical outcomes for our children".  This reason had no basis in fact and no evidence could be found to support it.</p> <p>  In reference to co-location with an adult hospital, the person who recommended the St. James's Hospital site to the Cabinet, Senator James Reilly, recently said the primary clinical driver of the decision was that children with very rare diseases could be treated by St. James's adult hospital consultants and would not have to travel abroad.  This is false and nonsensical.  There is no evidence of any advantage for child patients if a children's hospital was to be built beside an adult hospital.</p> <p>  We wish to highlight a few of the important issues in addressing the location of a children&rsquo;s hospital which is to last well into the 22nd century.  What is critical is co-location of a children's hospital with a maternity hospital, not an adult hospital.  As advised by the most senior paediatric intensive care specialists in the country, to proceed with the children's hospital without a co-located maternity hospital will result in avoidable deaths and disability of many newborn babies.  It is simply not possible to construct a full service maternity hospital on the site of St. James's Hospital without impacting negatively on the functioning of the other hospitals on the site.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la specifically excluded an assessment of whether a maternity hospital would fit on the site.  The committee will be interested to hear that the area identified for the notional maternity hospital has already been built on; it is the location of the existing excellent outpatient department and half the size of the existing Coombe hospital site.  Furthermore, this small site would have to be shared with an emergency department, an intensive care unit and a new facilities-management hub, all in the adult hospital.  The obvious optimum location for the children's hospital would be beside the new Rotunda Hospital to be built on the site of Connolly Hospital.</p> <p>  Space for expansion is a fundamental consideration in all hospital developments worldwide.  The children's hospital in Toronto has doubled in size every ten years since the 1950s.  Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, has increased in size by 75% in 15 years.  However, it turns out that even before a brick is laid the new children's hospital is too small.  The severe lack of space on the site means that many important elements have had to be scaled down.  The children's research building and the family accommodation unit are already smaller than requested, with no space for expansion.  Senior scientists at Temple Street Children's University Hospital have described the paediatric laboratory as too small and akin to placing an engine for a Mercedes in a Mini - impossible.  It appears as if it has been designed to fail.  Only 41 additional beds will be provided.  Based on projected growth rates in patient numbers, we know that by the time the hospital opens it will already have proportionately fewer beds than in 2012.  Because of the lack of space, the cut-off age for admission will be the eve of the 16th, not the 18th, birthday.</p> <p>  We know that it is 25% cheaper to build on a greenfield site than in an urban location.  Building on the St. James's Hospital site is particularly costly owing to the amount of preparatory work required, so much so that it will take at least one year to complete.  Despite what we are being told, construction work has not started and cannot start for at least one year until all of the preparatory works are completed.</p><p>These preparatory works include the demolition of 13 functioning adult hospital departments to make room for the children's hospital and the re-routing of a multiplicity of underground cabling once it is accurately located.  The relocation of the Drimnagh sewer alone will cost approximately &euro;18 million.  What is most shocking is that, due to the extensive excavation required, the cost of each additional parking space being provided at St. James's is over &euro;130,000.  In contrast, the cost of each surface parking space at Connolly would be &euro;2,000.  How could such extraordinary spending on parking spaces be justified when the money could be used for medical equipment or other much needed projects?  The &euro;200 million saved if the sites are flipped is more than enough to build the new Rotunda maternity hospital.  It is impossible to envisage a fully functioning children's hospital opening in 2020 as promised.  It is not going to happen.  There is evidence of delay already.  Delays cost money, and in this case they cost lives. </p><p> Access to the St. James's site is a major problem.  We know that 90% of child patients arrive by car.  The narrow roads around St. James's are so congested that ambulances are regularly blocked and cannot get past other vehicles.  The air and sea rescue helicopter cannot land at St. James's because the site is too small.  There is not even space for a taxi rank.  Parking at St. James's will pose enormous problems for parents of sick children.  Despite the hospital development board claiming that parking spaces will be trebled, the parking provision at St. James's turns out to be worse than what was on offer at Crumlin in 2010.  The adult hospital will lose over 600 spaces.  There will not be one single additional parking space for the notional maternity hospital.</p><p> We agree with the CEO of the hospital group board on one point alone.  She has, at last, admitted that there will be serious staffing problems.  Clinical excellence requires excellent staff, but staff are already leaving the adult hospital in droves.  What lies ahead for the children&rsquo;s hospital?</p><p> The decision to locate the new Rotunda at Connolly was a game changer and makes Connolly not just suitable but ideal.  There are none so blind as those who will not see.  It offers 145 acres for tri-location of the children's, maternity and adult hospitals and future expansion of all three, with 50 acres to be retained as parkland.  The M50 has a hard shoulder which ambulances and emergency vehicles may use.  Connolly is on a slip road off the M50/N3 interchange.  The fact that it would be faster and cheaper to build the hospital at Connolly makes this a no-brainer.  </p><p> Following the economic crash we were told that we are where we are because no one shouted "Stop".  Actually, many did, but no one wanted to hear it.  We are shouting "Stop" and will continue to shout until reason prevails.  We know this hospital will be an unmitigated disaster with terrible consequences.  There are also huge concerns about the viability of the adult hospital.  If the committee allows it to happen, it will share responsibility for the consequences.  We ask the committee to urge the Minister for Health to make the right choice for the children of Ireland and immediately set in motion the process of flipping the sites, with the children's hospital to be re-sited at Connolly and the smaller urgent care centre to be located at St. James's.  If the Minister fails to do so he should know with certainty that he will be responsible for the deaths of many children and the avoidable anguish of countless parents - constituents - who will not forget that the blame for this decision cannot be parked at the door of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This committee's constituents will remember that their politicians had the power to change it, but did not.</p><p> This statement is endorsed by Professor Conor Ward, Emeritus Professor of Paediatrics, University College Dublin, Professor Barry O'Donnell, Emeritus Professor of Paediatric Surgery, Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, and Professor Niall O'Donohoe, Emeritus Professor of Paediatrics, Trinity College Dublin.</p></speech>

I now call on Deputies and Senators to indicate if they wish to speak.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#G00300"><p>I welcome Ms O'Shea and thank her for her statement.  The statement is a troubling one to me because she and those she represents are clearly of great eminence.  Ms O'Shea used very forthright language about her concerns, which she stated are shared by eminent professionals in the field.  As noted by the Chairman, it is fair to say that there is a lot of concern about the fact that this committee does not have the legal power, if one likes, to reverse a Government decision.  I want to confirm if Ms O'Shea is aware of that fact.  Am I right in thinking that what she is asking this committee is to form a view, either individually or collectively, on whether the Government has made the right decision?  Is she then asking us to use whatever moral force we might have as a committee, if we are convinced by her argument, to call on the Government to change its decision at this stage?  Does Ms O'Shea understand that we do not have the power to change a Government decision and is it her view that we ought to use our collective voice as a health committee to call on the Government to change the decision?  Whatever decision we might choose to make is a separate matter.</p> <p>  Ms O'Shea stated that the group has no vested interest.  I have no reason to disbelieve her, but is that true of each of the members of the group individually as well as collectively?  For example, Dr. Sheehan, who I have heard speak very impressively, is a man of considerable accomplishment in the provision of health care in the private sector.  Is it the case that none of them has, if one likes, skin in the game in terms of their professional or financial interests?  I do not mean to be offensive in asking that question, but it is important because this group is making serious claims about a decision it believes to be seriously wrong financially in terms of children's health care and so on.  We have to ask if those in the group have any skin in the game that we ought to know about when considering what it has to say.</p> <p>  If the decision is so wrong on so many fronts, why does Ms O'Shea think it was taken?  Does she believe it was some kind of a political decision.  I think it was noted in a submission by Dr. Sheehan that the Government decision was announced very quickly after the receipt of the Dolphin report.  I think it was overnight, as it were.  Does Ms O'Shea believe there was anything improper in that?</p> <p>  What is Ms O'Shea's view on the question of whether the St. James's site is future-proofed for expansion?  She claims it cannot happen and that there are limitations around parking and the size of certain important facilities etc.  What is her view of the case being made by the proponents of the St. James's site about future expansion?</p> <p>  Can Ms O'Shea stand over her claim about the net cost.  It is important to note that steps have already been taken.  We can all recall the electronic voting scenario.  Steps were taken and machines were purchased but then it never happened.  There was quite a lot of scandal that tens of millions of taxpayers' money was wasted.  Surely that argument can be made were the diggers in St. James's to be stalled now.  Is it seriously Ms O'Shea's view that the net cost of continuing is far greater than the net cost of changing at this stage.  That is obviously a financial costs question rather than one concerning children's welfare.</p></speech>

The first one related to the powers of the committee.  I will ask Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Healy to address the question about the powers of this committee and whether we are aware that the committee does not have the power to make changes and what it is we are requesting it to do.</p></speech>

I was a sole practitioner, permanent, in the department for 14 years before I received any help.  This is my first time in a committee room.  I read up on the function of Oireachtas committees on the Oireachtas website.  The function of the committee is to monitor the Department of Health and it was for this reason and on the basis of the absence of any other forum or means to make our concerns known to members of the public and to make the public's concerns known to the Government that we are here today.  I thank members for inviting us.</p> <p>  As Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen noted, there is a disconnect here.  The first issue is whether the new children's hospital building will fit in its environment.  That matter is the function of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  No committee can address what we refer to as the service function or model of care.  Perhaps the Committee on the Future of Healthcare chaired by Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall could be a forum for debating this issue but until now there has been no place to discuss the issue.  </p> <p>  Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin stayed out of the development board for two and a half years because it objected when the Mater Hospital site was chosen.  The archbishop chairman of the board stated the core value of Our Lady's Hospital Crumlin was a co-located, co-built hospital with a short corridor between the maternity hospital and children's hospital.  After some years, everybody was exhausted and decided to concentrate on his or her work.  More than 60 eminent doctors, including the 15 top ICU specialists, have said this is a red line they will not cross.  The Government has ignored any question that has been asked about this matter.  I do not believe it has any intention of locating a maternity hospital on the Crumlin hospital site.  If it had, why has it not done anything for the past ten years?  This is a serious concern and the delay speaks for itself.</p> <p>  We would like the Government to change the decision.  The Dolphin report was published at the beginning of June 2012 and the decision was made on 2 November 2012.  The then Minister for Health and Children and Deputy, Senator James Reilly, did not explain the clinical considerations we were told about, nor did we ever find out who advised him.  We know, however, that there was a major row in the Cabinet on the day the decision was made.  The then T&aacute;naiste, Deputy Joan Burton, and the current Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, stated the hospital should be located in Blanchardstown.  If we were discussing demographics, we could argue the toss on that issue.  We want the Government to change the decision and we want the joint committee to recommend that it does so.</p> <p>  We have been told by senior politicians that the only people who have power in this dysfunctional Government are the Taoiseach and his Ministers.  Given the new politics, will the joint committee please contact the Taoiseach and Minister for Health on this issue?  The Minister has not done us the simple courtesy of acknowledging receipt of or responding to the 60,000 signatures which were sent to him from the Department of the Taoiseach.  For the sake of the children of Ireland whom we are meant to look after, let us change this decision before it is too late. </p></speech>

It was clearly a political decision.  On the question on vested interests and costs, I will refer to Dr. Sheehan who is best placed to answer it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.343" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jimmy Sheehan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#H00300"><p>I have a vested interest in this issue, namely, the future of our children.  What strikes me when dealing with the other people seated by my side is the extraordinary commitment they have made to the future of our children.  I have been involved in health care for all my life and this is my 60th year in health care.  Having been involved in developing, commissioning and operating in the Blackrock Clinic, Galway Clinic and Hermitage Clinic, I have seen the importance of health care development over my lifetime.  The reason I became involved in this issue is that I was disturbed by many of aspects of what was happening and concerned for the future of our children.  As a result, I invested considerable time and effort in making an application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la about the difficulties arising from the decision.</p> <p>  One of the major difficulties is future proofing.  I have seen what happens with hospitals over a period of 30, 40 or 50 years.  It is 34 years since we developed the Blackrock Clinic and I have seen its expansion.  In the Galway Clinic, we have had seven separate building projects in the 12 years since the hospital opened.  Every hospital evolves and I became involved in this issue for these reasons.  I assure the members that I have no interest in the matter from a commercial point of view.  I can also state with absolute certainty that the same applies  in respect of every member of the Connolly for Kids Hospital Group.  We are all here for the same reason, namely, that we have a binding interest in the future of our children.  </p> <p> I have examined the costs involved in this issue.  Developing on a greenfield site in Connolly Hospital as opposed to St. James's Hospital would save taxpayers approximately &euro;200 million.  This figure can be broken down very simply.  There is no site available at St. James's Hospital.  The only part of the chosen site that was not built on was a car park.  I can provide the joint committee with a list of the 21 separate departments, including a number of non-clinical departments, located on the site.  I estimate it will cost a minimum of &euro;100 million to decant and replace these departments.</p> <p>  The diversion of the sewer will cost approximately &euro;18 million.  The building housing the car park has three floors, consisting of a two-floor car park and an underground energy centre.  This will add approximately &euro;30 million to the cost.  Building on an inner city site will, as our application noted, cost approximately 25% more than the alternatives.  This includes the &euro;30 million cost of excavation to which I referred.  There is an additional premium of 10% or &euro;40 million.  Considerable work must be done to fire-proof buildings when a helipad is located on them.  The establishment of a helipad on the roof of a building is not recommended for medical use, other than in a last resort.  This proposal to do so will add another few million euro to the cost.  A large number of costs have not been quantified, for example, the protection of existing patients in St. James's Hospital from contamination with organisms such as aspergillosis by installing air conditioning and locking up the building.  When one adds these costs together, one arrives at a minimum additional cost of &euro;200 million for locating the hospital on the St. James's Hospital site. </p></speech>

Mr. Sheehan and Dr. Breathnach have some information on that.  Perhaps Dr. Breathnach will respond.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.345" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Finn Breathnach" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#H00500"><p>I set up the children's cancer haemotology-oncology unit in Crumlin hospital when I returned to Dublin from Great Ormond Street in London in 1981.  I worked single-handed for 15 years, during which time I was on call for 365 days of the year.  The unit, which I built through fund-raising money, was completely redeveloped 23 years after it was built because it was not fit for purpose.</p> <p>  Doctors take clinical decisions on the basis of evidence.  Each of us will get sick at some stage in our lives and we will be offered treatment.  It would be very sensible to ask whomever is offering the treatment what the evidence is for the success of the treatment or plan of action.  The decision on the location of the national children's hospital was also supposed to be based on clinical matters and we are right to ask what is the evidence for the decision.  The claim has been made that the clinical outcomes for children will be improved if the children's hospital is built next to St. James's adult hospital.  This has been repeated by the former Minister for Health and Children, Senator James Reilly, his successor, the current Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and the current Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris.  The literature does not provide a single scrap of evidence to support that claim.  Nowhere in the world has anyone made a claim for improved clinical outcomes through locating a children's hospital with an adult hospital.</p><p>Deputy Kelleher took the trouble to travel a long way to the southern hemisphere to visit the Royal Children's Hospital in Melbourne, and we had a brief conversation about this some months back.  He noted the children's hospital was built in a wonderful healing environment with acres of space and that there was not an adult hospital in sight.  Of course, the most recently built children's hospital is in Liverpool in the United Kingdom, which is the very famous Alder Hey Children's Hospital.  It was built in a particular area with enough space near it to build a new hospital.  It is on its own and stands nowhere near an adult hospital.<br/><br/>I do not care what medical expert the other side brings in, I can tell the committee with absolute certainty there is absolutely no evidence whatsoever to benefit children through co-location with an adult hospital.  I listened to the CEO of the children's hospital, Eilish Hardiman, on radio recently.  She was challenged to provide evidence, and said there is lots of evidence and to look at Manchester, Sweden and Glasgow.  Manchester does not claim improved clinical outcomes through adult co-location and neither does anyone in Sweden or Glasgow.  What she was referring to, of course, is tri-location, which we support.  Stand-alone children's hospitals can function, as the hospital in Crumlin has done wonderfully well, providing excellent care for decades without the need for any adult input.  The minute we attach an essential co-located maternity hospital, then we introduce a separate group of patients who are mothers, and the children's doctors are not qualified to look after them.  They need an adult hospital.  The Rotunda Hospital will go to Blanchardstown, and it will be very happy to have the adult teaching Connolly Hospital at Blanchardstown look after its sick mothers once the intensive care unit has been upgraded and additional haematology sessions are added.  It will be very happy that its mothers will be cared for.<br/><br/>Unlike adult co-location, for which there is absolutely no documented evidence, I can provide scores of scientific papers to show improved outcomes, not only regarding survival but quality of life for children, who are delivered next to a children's hospital.  In 2006, Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin stated the new children's hospital must be co-located with a full service maternity hospital.  This is in keeping with a recent report, published ten years later, which stated there must be a full service maternity hospital.  The hospital also stated the effects of such will show lasting improvement in neonatal and newborn morbidity, which is damage such as brain damage, and mortality.  These benefits have been demonstrated in well-researched submissions by many obstetric and neonatal consultants.  It also stated these benefits are of such magnitude that its board believes the maternity component of the development should proceed simultaneously with the new children's hospital.<br/><br/>A specialist group comprising the department of cardiothoracic surgery, the department of cardiology in Crumlin, and the joint department of paediatric intensive care medicine at the hospitals in Crumlin and Temple Street wrote to An Bord Plean&aacute;la that:</p><blockquote>Co-location with a physically linked maternity hospital is, in our expert opinion, non-negotiable.  We are unwilling to endorse a national children's hospital on a site that cannot accommodate this truly critical adjacency.  To do so would be to fail those infants whom we are entrusted to protect.  To proceed with such a project will result in the avoidable death or disability of many new-born babies for years to come.</blockquote><p>It is absolutely critical that a full service maternity hospital be built on the St. James's Hospital site.  I wrote to the previous Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, pleading with him to apply simultaneously for planning permission for the children's hospital and a maternity hospital.  Once a children's hospital is built on the site the State will have to go back for planning permission for the maternity hospital, but at that stage there will be a huge children's hospital and a huge adult hospital trying to function.  The transfer of St Luke's Hospital, which is also to go on site, has been delayed.  There will be no room for a maternity hospital because the site allocated in St. James's Hospital is smaller than the site already occupied by the Coombe hospital.  Where is the space for the maternity hospital at the St. James's Hospital site?  There is space, but only if the 18 year old excellent outpatient department for adults is knocked down and moved somewhere else.  I do not know where it would be put.  This is an added expense.  According to the documentation supplied to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which I have cut and pasted, a new adult intensive care unit, a new adult accident and emergency department and a new adult facility management hub would have to be built, after which a maternity hospital could be built.  This is all because of a claim for improved clinical outcomes by building the children's hospital next to an adult hospital, for which there is not one scrap of evidence.</p></speech>

We do not know what technology is coming down the road.  Take the history of St. Vincent's University Hospital, which is relatively new at 45 years and I returned to work there in 1970.  It has doubled its frontage, leaving the old hospital behind.  It has added a multi-storey car park.  In that period the original St. Vincent's Private Hospital has been taken over by the public area and there is a new private hospital.  I reckon the total size of St. Vincent's University Hospital has increased between three and four times in a period of 45 years.  This is typical of what happens with hospitals.</p> <p>  I mentioned seven building projects in Galway.  A number of these were for new technology that was not present 12 years ago.  For example, we put in a 3-tesla MRI scanner, which was not available ten years ago.  We had to build for it.  We put in a new radiotherapy bunker for stereotactic radiotherapy, which was not available.  We also put in an interventional operating theatre, we added 50% to our capacity for inpatient beds, we doubled our day care and we trebled our laboratory space.  All of this was in a very well-planned hospital that was only opened 12 years ago.</p> <p>  Talk about 20% potential for expansion for a children's hospital which is supposed to last for between 50 and 100 years is one of the reasons that motivated me to get involved in the Connolly Hospital project, because I saw how absolutely daft the whole situation is.  It would be catastrophic for the future.  What will actually happen in a very short timeframe is that new facilities will have to be added off-site.  Take the example of a new facility for proton beam therapy, which is much more sophisticated than radiotherapy.  It requires huge infrastructure.  The Mayo Clinic has just built a new department which cost $200 million.  This cannot be incorporated into an existing building.  I am happy to pass around a leaflet to committee members to show why this is not possible.  It is because a linear accelerator is the base of the proton beam.  The leaflet will show committee members how sophisticated it is.  It is groundbreaking therapy for children with brain and other tumours.  It will become an essential part of our infrastructure but it could not possibly be on site.  There is an absolute disaster down the road in terms of further development if the St. James's Hospital site is proceeded with.</p></speech>

Has the relocation of the Rotunda Hospital to Connolly Hospital been locked down?</p><p>It was stated that the only publicly mentioned driver was improved clinical outcomes because of co-location with the adult hospital.  I am not saying the witness was being dishonest in saying it was the only one, but is that, honestly, the only reason that has been advanced in favour of the St. James's Hospital site in all of the discussions on this?</p><p> Dr. Healy said this was the first opportunity there has been for this matter to be aired.  My understanding is that the previous health committee considered it, heard submissions and met with representative groups from various sites.  Can she enlighten me on that?  I understand the witnesses are here as the Connolly for Kids group.  Can it be outlined for my own benefit and that of other members if the group is an amalgamation of a number of organisations or if the witnesses are speaking individually?  Are there organisations allied to the group?  If so, what are they?  That would provide the committee with an understanding of the kind of people and organisations or groups who share the concerns the witnesses are bringing to us this morning.</p></speech>

I spent an hour on the phone trying to find out what was going on and it turned out, because we had written to several Departments, that it was the Department of Children and Youth Affairs that we had a reference number with.  We do not know when that will happen.  Our concern is that if the main contract for construction is signed, a deadline will be reached.  We have a window of opportunity of perhaps a year or maybe less where people can see sense.<br/><br/>Everything that has been done at St. James's will not be lost.  The smaller unit can go there because that is where the smaller population is.  The demographics show that there are 75,000 people in the main catchment area for St. James's.  That comes from the planning application from the development board itself to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I refer to under 16 year-olds.  There are 100,000 under 16 year-olds in the Tallaght area and 100,000 in the Blanchardstown area who are within 30 minutes of the hospital.  The application did not say whether that was 30 minutes driving distance, but I presume that is what was meant.  That leaves another 140,000 children unaccounted for.  I do not know where they are meant to go.  I refer to the Wicklow kids and to others.  Be that as it may, of the children who will be using this hospital as their ordinary hospital in the way that Cork kids use the Cork hospital and Limerick and Ennis children use the Limerick hospital, two thirds will come from outside the M50.  Only one third will come from inside the M50.<br/><br/>The demographics of the under 18 childhood population for the country show that nine out of ten children live outside the M50.  Yet, here we are putting in all the tertiary children who are the sickest ones.  They are the ones who will use the hospital most, who will have the longest admissions and will include the highest number of day cases.  Dr. Breathnach is very familiar with those.  Over 50% of children coming to Crumlin for day care belong to that sickest group.  At the time of the Mater application, the then development board said 72% of admissions would come from the greater Dublin area while 28% would come from outside.  That has now been reversed.  It is now being stated that 22% will come from outside and 78% will come from inside.  I am referring to the sick children, which is to say the tertiary care children.<br/><br/>There are nonsense statistics going around at the moment in every county.  They have been published in the local newspapers.  The first sentence in this states that construction work started in August.  Construction work has not even been signed.  The tenders are due in one of these days.  I am reading from <i>The Sligo Champion</i>but the reports have been similar in all the county newspapers.  Ms O'Shea touched on this.  The paper reports that 1.3% of children attending the three Dublin children's hospitals come from Sligo.  However, what it does not say is what the 1% represents.  Does that 1% represent 50 children, 500 children or 5,000 children?  This statistic is a nonsense.  The other thing it does not say is for how long those children are in hospital.  They look at the database and see what the address is.  We have a parent on the committee whose child was in Our Lady's hospital in Crumlin for three years.  Someone mentioned Liam McEntee from County Galway who spent the first four years of his life in Crumlin.  One has all the access problems to deal with in that regard.</p></speech>

I tried for a six-month period a few years back to meet the Taoiseach to express my concerns because of my background and interest in the future of our children but I failed to get an appointment.  I tried to meet the then Minister, Deputy Leo Varadkar, and I got a reply to say he was too busy with media and other affairs to meet with me.  Any attempts I have made to meet with people that matter have been rebuffed.  I felt so concerned about it that I put a great deal of time and effort into trying to meet those people.</p> <p>  Mention was made of the Connolly for Kids Hospital group and people coming together.  What happened in my case was that I was acting purely as a concerned individual.  I made a 17-page submission to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and put a great deal of time and effort into trying to have a balanced argument as to why St. James's Hospital was unsuitable.  Other people came from different areas.  It was after the meeting with An Bord Plean&aacute;la that we came together as this group, realising that we shared the same concern for the children.  It just evolved in that fashion.</p></speech>

The decision has been made that the Rotunda will move to the Connolly site, but in relation to planning permission, I have before me the section from the Martin and Clear report, a planning assessment document which accompanied the Dolphin report.  It lists all the advantages and weaknesses of each of the hospital sites being considered for the children's hospital.  The Connolly Hospital assessment lists no weakness.  It is a greenfield site and planning issues are highly unlikely to arise.  In fact, the only item that is listed in the weakness section is the requirement to vary the development plan.  However, local authority members have already agreed to do that.  As such, it is not an issue and could be done contemporaneously.  On the other hand, there is an endless list of the strengths of the site meaning it should not be a problem just as for the children, it is a very straightforward site in relation to planning.</p> <p>  The Master of the Rotunda has said it will take perhaps five years to move to the site.</p></speech>

The city centre site at St. James's Hospital is likely to encounter severe delays because of construction complications associated with a site in the inner city.  I will ask Dr. Breathnach to address Deputy O'Reilly's question about clinical outcomes and whether it was the only reason given.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.360" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Finn Breathnach" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#L00400"><p>I thank Deputy O'Reilly for her very important question.  I had mentioned earlier that the claims for improved clinical outcomes were made by previous Ministers for Health, Senator Reilly and Deputy Varadkar and by the current Minister for Health, Deputy Harris.  I wrote an eight page letter to then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, and - after 30 years in the health service - I received a one line reply thanking me for my letter.  All of the concerns I have raised with this committee were in that letter to Deputy Varadkar and yet he continued for one and a half years or so afterwards to claim improved clinical outcomes.  My jaw dropped because I was advised of an interview which Senator James Reilly gave recently to Sean Moncrieff on Newstalk radio.  My jaw dropped for a number of reasons.  The Senator was asked why he picked the wrong place for the children's hospital.  He said that he had picked the right place and he proceeded to explain why.  He said that co-locating the national children's hospital with St. James's Hospital would allow children with very rare disorders, who currently have to travel abroad for treatment, to be treated in Ireland through bringing together the experts who are the super specialists who deal with adults and children for these very rare conditions, and that this was a primary concern and the primary clinical driver of the decision.  This is complete and utter nonsense and the Cabinet believed him.  Senator Reilly is asking us to believe and accept that if highly-trained children's doctors cannot manage a rare disorder, the children will be made better through some miraculous process of handing them over to the doctors who treat adult patients and who have absolutely no experience or training in looking after sick kids.  Of course there are children born with rare conditions and they will still be born with rare conditions such as conjoined twins, known as Siamese twins, but these cases are so rare that they have to be treated in a hospital with a global referral pattern.  There are children who need liver transplantation.  We have liver transplantation but not at St. James's Hospital.  It is in St. Vincent's Hospital, but they do not perform transplants for child patients because the number of children who require liver transplants is so small that they are afraid, and quite rightly so, that their expertise in looking after adults with not be sufficient to allow them to look after children.<br/><br/>I believe the committee had an opportunity on 20 October, which was just last week, to meet the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board during a walk-in session in Leinster House and that the members subsequently received a document on important information about the new children's hospital.  Consider the other reasons, apart from co-location, and the board's claims for the benefits of the co-location with the adult hospital.  It would take me a long time to go through this but the document was previously headed as Addressing some Myths.  It is a great public relations exercise.  Tens of thousands of euro have been spent on public relations and yet only 20% of the population think that St. James's Hospital is the right place.  The document states that St. James's Hospital &quot;has the greatest number of clinical specialties and national services in the acute adult hospital system&quot;.  So what?  They do not benefit children and they do not look after children.  It says it is a main teaching hospital, meaning that &quot;they have matching levels of service complexity delivered by highly specialist staff&quot;.  This is nonsense.  The largest number of specialties in any hospital is in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin.  It has far more than in any adult or other children's hospital.  If one adds the Temple Street hospital specialties, we then have another couple of specialties to bring it up to 41 or 42, including neurosurgery and kidney transplantation, which are not available in St. James's Hospital.  The document speaks of &quot;synergy&quot; between the hospitals.  It just goes on and on.  It is ridiculous.  It also says that the co-location offers a best practice model for the transition to adult services for children and young people.  This implies that when a young patient turns 18 years of age and needs to transition to an adult hospital, just because St. James's Hospital is there it is going to be wonderful.  Well, where is the national centre for cystic fibrosis?  It is in St. Vincent's hospital.  Where is the national centre for neurosurgical problems?  It is in Beaumont Hospital.  Where is the national centre for children with congenital heart disease and who are now going into adult life?  It is not in St. James's Hospital; it is in the Mater Hospital.  I could go on and on.  Orthopaedic surgeons who operate on children in Our Lady's Children's Hospital, Crumlin, will, if they operate in the new children's hospital on the St James's site, see them as adults in their adult hospital, which is Tallaght hospital, not at St. James's Hospital.  Those orthopaedic surgeons who operate on children in Temple Street hospital will, on the child becoming 18, see them in their adult hospital, which is Cappagh National Orthopaedic Hospital, not St. James's Hospital.  Other children will transition to somewhere it is convenient for them such as Cork University Hospital, University Hospital Limerick etc.<br/><br/>On economies of scale, the document is so disingenuous that it troubles me.  It states:</p><blockquote>Co-locating with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital will mean that the new children&rsquo;s hospital will have access to highly specialised equipment that it would not otherwise have access to.  An example of this is a PET scanner.</blockquote> <p>At the moment the PET scanner at St. James's Hospital cannot be used for small children.  The board knows full well that the children's hospital will have its own PET scanner.  Another benefit mentioned was a mass spectrometer available in St. James's Hospital, as if the children will be fed into this machine and come out fixed at the other end.  It is a piece of machinery through which tissue is analysed.  That tissue can be posted from anywhere in the world and is dependent upon somebody who is expert in operating the machine.  There has been nobody in St. James's Hospital to operate it since a person left. <br/><br/>The plan is to also relocate the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to the St. James's campus - the Rotunda Hospital and Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown are at the same stage - but there is no room to fit the full-service maternity hospital of the Coombe into the St. James's site.  The site that is on offer is too small; it is half the size of St. James's, as I have said before, and there is already a huge existing building there so the added cost of doing that is going to be a problem, including trying to find the money.  Almost certainly what the board will end up doing is having a high-risk maternity unit, which is smaller, having to rebuild the Coombe, which needs a rebuild and also having to staff this new high-risk maternity facility.  This goes against the recently-published maternity strategy in which a full-service maternity hospital is recommended.</p></speech>

My name is Eamonn Faller and I am a doctor who has spent a considerable amount of time working at St James's Hospital, but I will return to this later.  I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 14.  I am from Galway and the experience of living in Galway and requiring twice-weekly trips to Dublin for treatment lends me pretty good insight into the profound effect the location of this hospital will have on patients and their families.  The effect is profound and I will tell the committee why.  What is not being realised here is that one extra hour in traffic for a sick child is heaping misery upon mystery.  Among the most visceral memories I have of my own experience is being spread out across the back seat of my parents' car, nauseous and weak as the car crawled through Dublin traffic and wishing away every second of that car journey.  This experience was not particular to me; it will resonate with families up and down the country.  There is no doubt in my mind that an enormous amount of patient hardship would be saved by locating the hospital at Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown.  Nine out of ten patients who require complex and specialist care are from outside of the M50 and these are the people who will suffer most due to this poor decision.</p> <p>  With regard to teens transitioning to the adult service, I am a patient who would have benefitted from this co-location with St. James's Hospital.  My care was eventually transferred to St. James's Hospital after I reached the age of 18.  The other problems with the site absolutely dwarf any potential benefit that could be achieved in this regard.  On a personal level, issues with access during the acute phase of my illness caused me far more hardship than attending a different centre for follow-up after the age of 18.  The transition argument does not stack up at all in Dublin, given the fragmented nature of services.  A very small proportion of patients would have the potential to benefit.  Neurosurgery and renal transplant patients will still go to Beaumont Hospital, cystic fibrosis patients will still go to St. Vincent's University Hospital and cardiac disease and spinal surgery patients will still go to the Mater Hospital.  This brings us back to the potential for expansion, at least, in Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown over the coming decades and there might be potential to transfer services there.</p></speech>

It is important a forum is offered to them to express their concerns about what they see as the wrong choice for the national children's hospital.  There is no doubt we all agree on the need for a national children's hospital.  In doing that, however, it must be put in the most appropriate location.  We are here because the group suggests the choice of the St. James's site is not.  They have outlined many reasons for it, some compelling.  I am sure others will argue the opposite in support of the St. James's site.</p> <p>  Would any of the group have expressed views previously on the Mater site being the wrong one?  It would strike me that if St. James's is considered wrong, then the Mater would have been equally problematic for the same reasons.</p> <p>  Dr. Fin Breathnach referred to the fact that I was in Melbourne when I was a Minister of State and saw the site of the children's hospital there.  I did not travel specifically to see the site but I did take it upon myself when I was there to see it during the final stages of construction.  It was in a beautiful parkland setting.  The key issue, however, is about the services for sick children.  Why is the group arguing that Blanchardstown will give a better outcome?  Its submission stated locating the hospital at the St. James's site will result in avoidable deaths and disability of many newborn babies.  That is quite a profound statement.  Will the witnesses elaborate as to why this would be the case?</p> <p>  The group proposes the flipping of the site.  In other words, the satellite hospital would be located in St. James's and the major hospital would be located in Blanchardstown.  One can work out rough costings such as greenfield versus brownfield at around 25% and the cost of car parking.  Has a detailed analysis been done by the group?  The group claimed the relocating of the Drimnagh sewer at the St. James's site would cost &euro;18 million.  Has this been quantified by people who have experience in the costings of large projects?</p> <p>  The Dolphin report was commissioned after the Mater site was rejected by An Bord Plean&aacute;la and reported in June 2012.  It is quite a detailed report in many ways which I read from cover to cover.  It laid out many of the reasons for site location, not only for the physical building but the specialties within it, and the services to which Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Healy referred.  Is the group saying the Dolphin report, or its terms of reference, was flawed in its assessment in deciding that St. James's was the right location?  Why does the group believe the Dolphin report got it so wrong?</p> <p>  On public transport, and the lack of it, there is traffic congestion around St. James's.  As the lead arbitrator, An Bord Plean&aacute;la felt these issues could be addressed and overcome in other ways.  There are quite good public transport services to the St. James's' site.  For example, Heuston and Connolly Stations are linked by the Luas which actually goes through the St. James's site.  Does the group accept this may be important to many people who may wish to attend the site?  I accept initial transportation to the proposed hospital would be by car or ambulance.  However, for the parents and siblings of many patients who might be there for a long time, they may have the choice to use public transport directly to St. James's.</p> <p>  On the issue of bilocation versus a single modular stand-alone hospital, there is a proposal to put a maternity service in the St. James's site.  Part of the strategy is for the Coombe maternity hospital to go there.  I do not know whether that can be done, as I am not an expert in engineering or architecture.  We are led to believe it can happen, however.  Part of the longer term policy will see both maternity hospitals move from their present positions, namely, the Rotunda to Blanchardstown and the Coombe to St. James's.  Does the Connolly for Kids Hospital group believe the Coombe maternity site could move in its entirety or would it just be the high-dependency maternity unit with the rest of the hospital remaining on the Coombe site?</p> <p>  Since I became my party's health spokesperson and being a political person, I have also found there is politics in medicine too.  I remember during the debate around the Mater site that it was quite political, both in this forum and among medical professionals.  Many made their arguments with genuine and compelling reasons.  Is there any medical politics either in the context of the Dolphin report's recommendations or in the group's views that the report got it wrong?</p></speech>

The issue involved here highlights the challenge one has to deal with when faced with the scenario where after giving birth one's child has to be taken by ambulance straightaway to another hospital.  I believe one of the witnesses' offspring treated one of my children at one stage.  In terms of the  colocation of the maternity and paediatric services, I was struck at that time in the hospital by the challenge facing people who came from outside Dublin and I come from outside Dublin originally.  It was fine for me to go home at night and get clothes washed or whatever.  I remember there was a lady from Killarney in the hospital.  There are the difficulties faced by families, the health outcomes for the children, bonding and so on.  In their personal opinions do the witnesses realistically think that maternity services at the Coombe hospital will be moved to the St. James's Hospital site?  Do they think there is any possibility that it will not be a high risk maternity centre that is placed there?</p> <p>   Dr. Breathnach mentioned he worked in Great Ormonde Street Hospital.  Hospital access is one of my primary concerns about the St. James's Hospital site.  It will have emergency patients, children as well as adults together with people attending for outpatient appointments.  Somebody told me this would involve an additional 10,000 patients but that figure might be wrong.  How will the infrastructure cope with that?  How does Great Ormonde Street deal with that?  Guy's Hospital, St. Thomas's Hospital and London Bridge Hospital in London, in all of which I have worked, all seem to function fine in that city.  Are we just not able to cope with the infrastructure?  Have the witnesses any solutions to offer to the difficulty in terms of our infrastructure?  Dr. Valerin O'Shea or Dr. R&oacute;is&iacute;n Healy mentioned there was no weakness in the Connolly Hospital site.  Does that refer to only planning issues or is there anything they could objectively say is bad about the Connolly Hospital site?  </p> <p>  In his professional view does Dr. Breathnach believe that moving maternity services from the Coombe hospital to a restricted site at St. James's Hospital goes against the national maternity strategy?  To follow up on Deputy Kelleher's question about medical politics, do the witnesses have any views on that and the role that has played in this?</p></speech>

First, I would like to thank each of the witnesses individually and collectively and all the folk who work with them.  The witnesses have certainly helped me and the committee to better understand what is involved.  One of the witnesses make the point, in response to the case being by those on the other side, that  there were no advantages to the children's hospital being located beside an adult hospital.  To put it layperson's terms, are the witnesses saying that a child is simply not a smaller version of an adult or it could be put the other way around?  I am not a doctor.  Can the witnesses give me one or two practical homely examples of how that is not the case?  I am referring to how putting one's hands to a child is different from dealing with an adult in the same specialty?</p></speech>

The issue of the location of the new children's hospital has been discussed for literally 25 years.  We had decided on the Mater hospital site ten years ago.  The planning for it from Dublin City Council was almost through when An Bord Plean&aacute;la overturned it.  The decision on this matter was taken in 2012 and the site is only now being cleared four years on.  It will take a number of years yet before it is finished, if it goes ahead.  A process was followed by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It looked at all the issues the witnesses raised regarding  traffic, congestion, access and parking.  Would the witnesses agree that An Bord Plean&aacute;la took a decision in regard on the Mater hospital site because it had concerns about those issues but when it took a decision this time round, it did not have the same concerns?  Would the witnesses accept that?  Are they saying that An Bord Plean&aacute;la arrived at this decision incorrectly by not taking into account all of these issues, whereas it did take them into account in its decision on the Mater hospital?  The witnesses raised all these issues in their presentation.  Are they suggesting that the information given to An Bord Plean&aacute;la was misleading and it was not able to adequately examine it?</p> <p>  The witnesses raised the issue of flipping the site.  Would they accept that we are now four years on from the decision having been taken, we are still only at the stage of clearing the site and that if we were to start all over again with the Connolly Hospital site we would have to go back to the drawing board?  It would not possible to transfer the building because it would be a totally different structure.  There is underground parking on the St. James's Hospital site but Connolly Hospital is a different site and we would have to go back to the drawing board.  It would take anything up to 12 months to do a drawing, a presentation and the site outlay.  The planning process would take another six months and even then we are talking about 18 months.  The witnesses said that it could be all turned around in three years.  Do they think it a little optimistic to claim that the site could be flipped in three years?</p> <p>  The three clinical directors of the National Children's Hospital in Tallaght, Our Lady's Children's Hospital in Crumlin and Temple Street Hospital are all in support of this development.  The last line of the group's submission states:  "If the Minister fails to do so he should know with certainty that he will be responsible for the deaths of many children and the avoidable anguish of countless parents - your constituents".  Are the witnesses saying, in that final statement, that those clinical directors are jointly responsible?  It is a serious suggestion.  If they are backing this project, are the witnesses saying that the clinical directors will jointly be responsible in that situation?  It is important that we clear the lines here. A decision has been taken and it has taken four years to get to this stage.  We have been discussing this issue for 25 years.  Are we going to add another five years to it?  I am concerned about the time delay that would occur.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses.  They have made an excellent presentation, much of which I did not hear because I was doing a radio, so my apologies for that.  Many of my concerns about this issue have been raised by others.  The witnesses must be commended on their campaign, highlighting the concerns about this issue of the 60,000 who have signed the petition and those of many more.  They make a compelling and staggering argument for the Connolly Hospital site.  Having listened to what I heard of their presentation and their answers to my colleagues' questions, it is disappointing and extraordinary that nobody - from the Taoiseach's office or the offices of the Minister, Deputy Harris or the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Zappone - has offered to meet them.  That is disappointing.  If nothing else, they should be afforded the opportunity to put forward their argument and points in order that their case can be evaluated properly in the course of a democracy.  That is very disappointing.</p> <p>  I have three brief questions.</p><p>What, in their view, if they do not feel they have dealt with it compellingly already, is the justification for the St. James's site and not the Connolly site, which was the decision taken by Cabinet and Government, the planning authority and also by An Bord Plean&aacute;la?  What, in their view, is the best practice in other countries and jurisdictions with centres of excellence for children and how does what is being offered compare with that?  Have they been offered an opportunity to debate their concerns with the advocates for the St. James's site in order that they can have a formal discussion rather than hearing one side on one occasion and another side on another?  I wish to get their views on those.</p></speech>

Perhaps you could answer in a focused way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.383" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Valerin O'Shea" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#O00300"><p>I can answer a couple of these and it probably would be best to start with me.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher asked whether our views on the Mater site were the same as they are on the St. James's one.  Many of us met at the Mater oral hearing and all of us, I think, were opposed to the Mater site.  It is interesting to note that the Mater site was chosen.  That was the only site that was ever recommended.  It was recommended by the independent review group, and it was recommended over St. James's.  It was considered a better site.  The world and his mother could see that the Mater site was a ridiculous suggestion.  That puts into perspective the merits of the St. James's site, that it was considered not to be as good as the Mater site in the only report that ever made any recommendation, because no report recommended the St. James's site.</p> <p>  On Deputy Kelleher's question on the Dolphin report and whether we are saying it is flawed, we are not saying it is flawed at all but the Dolphin report has been misinterpreted as having somehow recommended a site.  The Dolphin report did not recommend any site.  In fact, the Dolphin report stated, "Having reviewed the sites, and the options presented to us, we are in a position to present these options to the Minister."  They were options that were presented, nothing more.  It is not a case of the Dolphin report being wrong.  The Dolphin report was exactly right.  It went into great detail on the planning matters as opposed to the medical functioning of the hospital.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked about the weaknesses at the Connolly site and said that since I had pointed out that there were no weaknesses mentioned for the Connolly site, she wondered whether that was just planning.  That was purely planning.  It was in answer to the question on the planning for the Rotunda.</p> <p>  On the question of An Bord Plean&aacute;la that Senator Colm Burke raised, the Senator is stating that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has looked at this in great detail and that it has decided that this site is suitable.  In fact, An Bord Plean&aacute;la rejected the Mater site because it stated that it was an overdevelopment for the site.  That was very obvious to everybody.  The hospital simply did not fit on it.  In the case of the St. James's site, the board avoided addressing any of the medical issues.  It purposely did not look at whether the maternity hospital will fit on the site.  It directly avoided doing that.  It did not consider that the medical concerns were a matter for it .  It deliberately avoided addressing those issues.  Space for expansion was the third matter that we consider crucial for the development of the children's hospital.  The board also deliberately avoided addressing it.  It said it was simply not a matter for it.</p> <p>  We have ended up with a decision from An Bord Plean&aacute;la that essentially looked at the structure and it has stated that this building will fit on this site.  The board has not looked at the function of it, and that is what is so remarkable.  It was a strategic infrastructure development because it was a national children's hospital but the board did not address that aspect of the planning application.  It struck me at the time as being akin to a strategic infrastructure development application for a road.  We would not view it favourably if the board decided that it did not have to consider traffic in this case.  The decision is akin to that.</p> <p>  The next question I would like to address is that of public transport that was raised by Deputy Kelleher.  Maybe Ms McNiffe, having experienced transporting a child to hospital, would address it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.384" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Aisling McNiffe" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#O00400"><p>I will give the committee a tiny bit of background.  My little boy was born 11 years ago and, like Deputy O'Connell's child, had to be transferred to Crumlin hospital from the Coombe hospital.  Little did I know that would be our home for the next three years.  Of course, it still is a big part of our lives and we are in and out a lot.  Children like my child and many children throughout Ireland cannot go on a Luas or a bus.  My little boy is in a wheelchair and is fed by a pump.  He is often on oxygen and requires a lot of medication.  He is also immunosuppressed and public transport is out.  We also live in Kildare and there is no public transport from my house.  It is really important to remember that 90% of those bringing their child to hospital, and it should be borne in mind that this will be the tertiary hospital for the sickest children, not children with a broken leg, coming from all over Ireland, will not be getting the Luas, the bus or the train.  They will be coming by car or by ambulance.</p> <p>  That brings me to access.  The committee members will know as they have already heard about it, but from a parent's point of view, can they imagine driving their child when it looks like they are going to die and they cannot get an ambulance?  Can they imagine that?  A person needs a hard shoulder or the M50.  The St. James's site does not offer that so it is not the right site.</p> <p>  Parking is also really important.  Can the committee members imagine in the same situation getting to the hospital and having nowhere to park if they had to take their child out in a wheelchair?  A person cannot park in Crumlin and walk up, as somebody said to me before.  Committee members know what the weather is like in Ireland.  I have a vulnerable child who cannot get wet.  They have to put themselves into the shoes of parents like me and many others throughout Ireland.  We are not that few and far between.  There are quite a lot of us.</p> <p>  The importance of space is one of the biggest problems with the St. James's site.  Without space, as the committee knows already, there is no room for expansion.  We know already that it is very unlikely that maternity co-location will be possible, but there will not be any green spaces.  We keep being told about this rooftop garden that will be the size of Croke Park.  It will not be.  It is to be almost the length, but not the size, of Croke Park.  It will be oval so that it will be a narrow space.  It will be split into two so there will be one third of an acre on both sides.  Then there is a little garden above that which will be half an acre in size, which must be evacuated if there is a helicopter landing.  All these matters have to be taken into consideration.  If committee members think of my little boy in a room of 10 ft. by 12 ft. for three years, and who has hospital acquired bugs, such as MRSA, he cannot leave his room.</p><p>He is also immuno-suppressed and so he cannot leave his room for his own protection.  There is no garden at Crumlin hospital.  We had our first walk around the streets of Crumlin.  I witnessed drug users on my way to the park.  I was too away far from the hospital and I had to walk around the park to get home.  My little boy was on an oxygen saturation monitor.  At that stage of our journey I was not competent and confident in caring for him without a nurse by my side.  You have to think of what our children need.  We have to give our children the best we can.  We must give them space.  The most important thing for a child is to be able to play.  It must be remembered that some of these children's lives are lived out in hospital and many never get home.  My son could have been one of those children.  It is important for us to have green areas where they can play.  We know from studies that nature has healing benefits.  One study of patients in a ward that overlooked a garden showed that the wounds of the patients that overlooked the garden healed faster than the wounds of the patients on the other side of the ward.  One's mental health is better when one has fresh air and green pastures to walk in.  You have got to think of the children.  The children have not been considered.  Quality of life is the most important thing.  Hospitals are not just for dying: they are also for living.  That is what our doctors are here for.  I thank God that we have doctors here today advocating for the most vulnerable of society.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.388" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Jimmy Sheehan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#P00400"><p>The issue of the delay that might occur if the decision was made to locate the new hospital at the Connolly hospital site rather than the St. James's campus, is one of concern for everybody.  The enabling works at the St. James's site started in August.  The timeframe for completion of those works is 12 months.  This means that the main contract will not be signed until some time next year.  The enabling works involves clearance of the site to bring it up to a greenfield site standard.  In regard to moving the project to the Connolly hospital site, almost all of the architectural work has been done twice already in respect of the Mater hospital site and the St. James's site and has been paid for twice by the taxpayer, such that there would be little further architectural work required.  While there would be some architectural work required, most of the detail in terms of proximity of departments, interaction between departments and so on has been worked out twice.  It would be easy to transpose that into a final plan for the Connolly hospital site.  </p> <p>  Three years ago I took the trouble to have tentative plans drawn up for the Connolly site to see how a hospital would sit there.  I reckon that within a six-month timeframe the remainder of the planning could be undertaken.  The construction programme and commissioning could be undertaken safely in a two-year period.  I say that because it took ten months to complete Blackrock Hospital.  Construction of Galway hospital, which was much more extensive, took 13 months to complete.  The commissioning period was two weeks.  The construction timeframe for The Hermitage was 15 months.  The timeframe around construction and commissioning is entirely dependent on organisation.  I am sure everybody here is familiar with the Empire State building.  It was designed and built in 20 months.  The timeframe from the laying of the first foundation to the capping off of the 86th floor was six months.  That building was built at the rate of one floor per day.  This was due to organisation and pre-planning.  My interest in hospital construction is around pre-planning and doing things in a rapid way.  There is huge advantage, if the intention is to do things within a 12-month timeframe, in specifying all of the equipment before any ground is broken so that everything is purpose-built for what is being put into it.  Unfortunately what we do in this country is build the hospital and then look at equipping it, which results in much of what has been done being torn down and a further two or three years lost on commissioning.  That is not the way I have operated.  It would give me extraordinary pleasure to make some contribution towards the construction of the new hospital in a rapid manner at the Connolly site on a purely benevolent basis.  I am prepared to give my services to the State for as long as is required and to have the hospital up and running within a three-year timeframe from the date the go-ahead is given.  </p></speech>

The size of the site was increased following the initial reports drawn up on the various hospitals.  That made a real difference.  The fact that the Rotunda Hospital is moving to that site makes it a tri-location and that is considered the optimum by everybody.</p> <p>  Dr. Breathnach will respond to the questions about Great Ormond Street Hospital and whether there is room at the St. James's site for the new maternity unit and whether it would be a high-risk maternity unit.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.394" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Finn Breathnach" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#P01000"><p>In regard to problems with the Connolly site, the document which the committee received from the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board states that pollution levels at the Connolly site are higher than at the St. James's site.  That is total nonsense.  The monitoring station is located at the junction of the N3 and M50.  It falls off 10 m away from the hospital.  The new hospital would be built 300 m away from that.  The pollution levels have been assessed and they are at rural levels.  It is claimed that the pollution level at the St. James's site does not exceed the EU standard: it does.  According to its own environmental impact statement, the nitrogen oxide level exceeds the statutory requirement of the EU.  Even worse, it greatly exceeds the World Health Organization's recommendations but we are told we can ignore those because they are not statutory for a health service.</p> <p>  On deaths and disability, I do not believe a unit will be built on the St. James's site.  Last year, there was a coroner's case concerning a baby who was transferred in a five-minute journey from the Coombe hospital to Crumlin hospital.  We are told that the neonatal transport service has not lost a single baby in transport.  This is because resuscitation of babies who are collapsing in the ambulance continues all the way to the children's hospital and at the children's hospital.  When resuscitation fails, the death is noted as having taken place in the children's hospital and not in the ambulance.  According to a Newcastle study, 25% of transfers create a problem for babies.  Only six days ago, there was a report in the UK presented at a neonatal meeting which showed that the haemorrhage rate into the brains of premature babies who are transferred is twice that of babies who are left in their cot.  Transfer, of itself, of vulnerable babies introduces brain damage and increases the risk of death.  The latest model for maternity is integration.  In terms of the McKinsey report and the history of the development of paediatrics, it states the next phase is a stand-alone children's hospital integrated with a maternity unit, where all of the births occur not in the maternity section of this one building but in the children's hospital.  Some 95 of every 100 transfers from a maternity hospital are sick babies and five are sick mothers.  Those mothers could be easily cared for in an upgraded Connolly memorial hospital.  A children's hospital, inclusive of a maternity unit, is a new international standard.</p><p>It cannot be achieved at St. James's Hospital for the next 100 years because of the way they are going to build it.  </p><p> If one looks at the Dolphin and McKinsey reports, it is stated that ideally the children's hospital would be co-located with an adult hospital.  According to the McKinsey report, the number one priority was space.  It states we must be pragmatic because international experience shows that space and access are needed.  That aspect has been totally ignored.  There is no space.  We are not talking about space in which to build it but the space needed to enable it to survive for 50 or 100 years.  The Melbourne site is so big they were able to build a new hospital, move from one to the other and then demolish the old one.  It is the same at Alder Hey.  Great Ormond Street Hospital is unique.  We talk about primary, secondary and tertiary care, but it provides quaternary care.  It is a hospital that accepts transfers from all over the world.  It does not have an emergency department.  It was built in 1850 on the edge of a much smaller city.  It has a name and will not move from the street on which it was built because it draws in lots of funding.  The transport infrastructure is so different from that in Dublin.  The hospital is easily accessible and the majority of its referrals are not emergency cases; they are electives, which means that one can plan a transfer.</p><p> Is there anything bad about Connolly Hospital?  Of course, there are medical politics.  I have never been a politician; I have done the best I can for kids all my life.  I do not recall ever attending a faculty paediatrics meeting because it is just a talking shop.  I have been too bloody busy looking after sick children while people talk about institutional chauvinism.  I am tired of it.   Some of the internal politics are revolting.  The position is that 85% of the sickest kids are looked after by Crumlin hospital consultants, but where are they in any of the committees?  Will you find one of them on them?  Their members are all from the less important units.  The politics are just incredible.</p></speech>

The location was picked before the model of care to be used.  The document which everyone saw in the D&aacute;il last week states the model of care was chosen in July 2016.  It refers to the function of or services to be provided by the hospital.  It was putting a square peg into a round hole and it was never going to fit.  It has involved compromise all the way.  The clinical directors group, a new creation of the HSE, has only recently been set up.  All of the people involved, including those on the hospital development board and the children's hospital group board, would not be if they were not pro-St. James's Hospital.  As it occurred a year after the St. James's Hospital site was chosen, there will not be "No" people on the boards.  Therefore, the committee should not believe anything they state.  They are all pro-St. James's Hospital because they have to be or else they would not be in their jobs.  There was probably only one application received for each position.  At this committee former Senator John Crown complimented St. James's Hospital on its aggressive campaigning to be chosen as the site of the children's hospital.</p></speech>

I appreciate that she shows a lot of passion in her campaign which I fully respect, but I am extremely uncomfortable with the statement made and will tell her why.

It implicates the three clinical directors.  It is in that context that I raise the question because it is a very serious allegation that the decision will cause deaths.

If it was being alleged that the clinical directors were acting in bad faith, that would be an allegation.  If the opinion is that the clinical directors are equally mistaken in their view as the Government representatives have been, it is a legitimate expression of concern which might point us to the need to invite the clinical directors to ask them whether they agree or disagree.  It is legitimate if they have a fear about the consequences for people to say certain parties will bear responsibility.  It is not an allegation of acting in bad faith.</p></speech>

None of the clinical directors work in intensive care units.  There is huge bias towards St. James's Hospital and Trinity College Dublin.  The only person from Dublin in the Dolphin group was from St. James's Hospital.  We recognise the statements made and know the people concerned.  We have worked with them and they are excellent people and clinicians, but there is a variation in opinions.  The New Children's Hospital Alliance opposed the Mater Hospital site, as did many consultants in Crumlin hospital.  Over 60 doctors and consultant paediatricians wrote to the newspapers about it, but there was no forum.  We were told to speak to the NPHDB or the children's hospital group.  We cannot speak to them because they cannot change; they are committed to the St. James's Hospital site.  There is no one to whom we can speak except legislators and elected Deputies.  That is what we are saying.</p></speech>

It is very important to point that out.  I am assuming that the people who have the letters "Dr" before their names on the list are medical doctors, not doctors of literature or something else.  It would show great disrespect if we were to attribute this to them and their professional capacity.</p></speech>

We have received an e-mail from a consultant in St. James's Hospital which highlights an article I read recently in <i>The Irish Times</i>on staffing.  According to Eilish Hardiman, 600 staff will need to be recruited for the children's hospital.  She has suggested affordable housing should be built for them.  The consultant in question wrote that staff were exiting St. James's Hospital in droves and that they did not want to work there.  The consultant said eight cardiothoracic intensive care nurses and seven radiographers had just left and that half of the staff in another department had applied for other jobs.  Nurses are arriving one hour before their shift starts just to get a parking space and the parking problem will get worse.  I made a telephone call to one of my former senior nurses in the oncology-haematology department in Crumlin hospital.  I cannot believe that even at this late stage no workforce planning has been done in that department.  No one has asked the specialist nurses who are impossible to replace because of a shortage worldwide whether they are willing to work in the children's hospital.  Most of the nurses in the three children's hospitals live in a place convenient to them.</p><p>None of them will have elected to work the James's site.  They require a car.  They are fertile, they have children, they drop the child to the cr&egrave;che, they live in Naas, Newbridge, Kildare, Ashbourne etc. and they drive.  If they are not given parking they will leave.  There is a great fear that both hospitals will fail. </p><p> We received under the freedom of information legislation the report of the expert independent international review of 2011.  The author of the report said the ideal location for the children's hospital would be green space, provide for unfettered access, accommodate research and educational activity, provide sufficient space to ensure the aggregation of all patient care services meeting current and future care requirements and be tri-located with an adult tertiary care and a maternity facility.  We agree that if there was a site and funding for such an aspirational location it would be a magnificent campus.  That statement was made before an additional 90 acres was made available for the Blanchardstown site in 2012.  </p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. John Pollock, NPHDB project director, who is accompanied by Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman, chief executive of the Children's Hospital Group, Dr. Peter Greally, group clinical director, children's hospital, Dr. Sharon Sheehan, Master of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital and Ms Caitriona Sharkey, patient and member of the Temple Street University Hospital Family Advisory Committee Temple Street, FACTS, committee.</p><p>The NPHDB has been invited here to update us on the progress of the site of the new children's hospital at St. James'.  The committee has no function in respect of the site of the location which has already been decided but we welcome the opportunity to engage with the NPHDB to hear its views on the Cabinet decision to locate the hospital at the site of St. James' Hospital.  The Cabinet of the day agreed to build a hospital at St. James' in 2012 and planning permission was obtained in May 2016.  Site clearance has commenced and the final construction contracts will be signed in the near future.  There has always been an agreement that a purpose built and dedicated hospital for children is a necessity for a functioning health service.  The debate, however, centred on the location.  The National Paediatric Hospital will be the largest infrastructural development in the Irish health service.  It will provide for essential specialist services for all children of Ireland at a single location, co-located with an adult teaching hospital and future maternity hospital when the Coombe is relocated to the site. </p><p>I draw the witnesses' attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Any submission or opening statement submitted to the committee may be published on its website after the meeting.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  I also remind members to switch off their mobile phones or put them in aircraft mode.  </p><p>We will now listen to the opening submission. </p></speech>

I am delighted to be able to share news of significant progress on this much needed and much wanted project.<br/><br/>Joining me this morning is Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman, the chief executive officer of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group; Dr. Sharon Sheehan,<b></b>Master of the Coombe hospital, Dr. Peter Greally, group clinical director of the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group board, and Ms Caitr&iacute;ona Sharkey, a parent who has had extensive interactions with paediatric services in Dublin.<br/><br/>Due to the scale and complexity of the project, we circulated some pre-reading materials to the members.  I hope they have had the opportunity to review some of those materials.<br/><br/>This morning I will provide an update on the design and construction aspects of the project while my colleague, Ms Hardiman, will give an overview of the extensive progress that has been made on the integration of services across the three children&rsquo;s hospitals at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght.<br/><br/>Before I commence the progress update, I want to say that, like the Connolly for Kids Hospital group, we, too, want to do the best for our children.  We also are parents and grandparents.  We have children, and we want to do the best for them.  We are also driven to make sure we provide the best facilities for all our children.<br/><br/>With regard to the progress update, commencing in September 2013, the role of the current National Paediatric Hospital Development Board is to plan, design, build and equip the new children&rsquo;s hospital at the St. James&rsquo;s Hospital campus in addition to two paediatric outpatient departments and urgent care centres - one at Tallaght hospital and one at Connolly Hospital - a 53-bed family accommodation unit and the children&rsquo;s research and innovation centre on a shared campus with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.<br/><br/>Following two years of procurement and design work by an international team and thousands of hours of engagement with families, young people, staff, local communities and three local authorities, a planning application for the new children&rsquo;s hospital and the associated developments was submitted to An Bord Plean&aacute;la in August 2015.  The application included a master plan, which is an important point, for the overall campus development at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital showing how up to three times the current area, including the relocated Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital, can be accommodated on this 50-acre site; a world-class children's hospital with 6,000 rooms, extensive gardens, including the rainbow garden which is the length of Croke Park; a hospital design and capacity based on measured activity currently in the hospitals, unmet clinical need and future projected demographics for the next 20 years.  When we open this hospital it will not be operating at full capacity and it will be 20 years before it reaches its full capacity.  Moreover, we submitted an environmental impact statement which comprehensively tested traffic and accessibility issues and concerns.<br/><br/>A ten-day public oral hearing was held in December 2015 which allowed those who are supportive of the project and those who have concerns about the location to air their views and have their questions answered.  I am pleased to say that in April of this year, An Bord Plean&aacute;la granted planning permission for the new children's hospital and the various elements I have described.  No changes were required to our design by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.<br/><br/>This major milestone for the most significant health care capital project ever undertaken by the State was welcomed broadly by families, young people, the staff of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals and those who have campaigned for almost 20 years to deliver this much needed resource.  Since planning permission was obtained, in August 2016 the development board appointed a contractor for the enabling works.  Those works are currently under way, including site clearance and demolition works.  Currently, we are in possession of approximately nine acres of land on the St. James's Hospital site.  Early in the new year, the full 12 acres will be handed over to us.  The Minister for Health, Deputy Simon Harris, together with children and young people who are current and former users of paediatric services, helped to get the digging under way in August.<br/><br/>With regard to the overall programme, tenders will be received by the end of this month.  By tomorrow, we will have all construction tenders back for both the main children's hospital and the satellite centres.  They will be evaluated before Christmas and we will bring a recommendation to Government in terms of our preferred contractor and to confirm the cost of the project, with a view to appointing a main contractor in January of next year.  The urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals will be completed in 2018 and, two years later, the main children's hospital on the St. James's Hospital campus will be completed at the end of 2020.<br/><br/>The hospital is about much more than bricks and mortar.  It is about the staff, children and young people who will deliver and receive world-class care within the new buildings.  I ask Ms Hardiman to provide an update on progress from a paediatric services perspective.</p></speech>

The Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group consists of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals at Crumlin, Temple Street and Tallaght, and we have been working for the past three years with the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board to develop a hospital that will meet the requirements of our sick children and the children whom we serve locally.  It is a project that the staff in the three children's hospitals fully support.  It is a badly-needed project that must be delivered in a timely manner.</p> <p>  As Mr. Pollock mentioned, the hospital is just one part of our plan for paediatric services in Ireland.  This plan is called the new model of care for paediatrics, which has been developed over four years of extensive engagement with parent representative groups, general practitioners, doctors, nurses and health and social care professionals in every paediatric service unit on the island of Ireland.  It is led by Professor Alf Nicholson and Professor John Murphy.  It has concluded, but it has been working for the past four years and central to that work was the development of the new children's hospital.</p> <p>  The new children&rsquo;s hospital at St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and the paediatric outpatient department and urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals will provide services to children and young people to ensure that the right care is given by the right team at the right time.  It is important for us to be clear about the primary functions of these new facilities.  First, the vast majority of work we undertake, which is 78% of the inpatients currently in the three children's hospitals, comes from the greater Dublin area, that is, Dublin, Kildare, Wicklow and part of Meath.  The future plan is to undertake those services through the hospital and the two satellite centres at Connolly and Tallaght hospitals.</p> <p>  Our second objective has the national remit, which is the highly specialist tertiary-quaternary care, for children across all of the island.  Currently, that comprises 22% of the workload undertaken by the three children's hospitals.  I fully support the previous group in its strong support for tri-location.  We in the Children's Hospital Group and the three children&rsquo;s hospitals fully believe that tri-location on this campus with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and the relocated Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital is the optimal configuration of services from a clinical perspective.</p> <p>  In terms of the three children's hospitals, the clinical directors, the medical boards and the nursing leaders believe it is best for us to co-locate with St. James's Hospital, which is the largest hospital and the leading adult teaching hospital, because it offers unparalleled opportunities for our paediatric services to be supported by the breadth and depth of sub-specialties that best support paediatrics.  Also, as a campus, it fits in with our vision for research and innovation.  Between its facilities already on the St. James's campus and the new children's research and innovation centre, it will drive advancements and treatments that will improve clinical outcomes for our children.</p> <p>  What we are about, however, is more than the building, albeit it is an important catalyst.  I am glad to report that the Children&rsquo;s Hospital Group and the three children's hospitals are working hard to integrate to ensure we become one before we move into these new facilities.  We have a major programme ahead of us, which includes establishing a new single legal entity to run the services on the three children's hospitals and manage them, and the transition to the new facilities.</p> <p>  In discussing everything we are doing, we must stay focused on the importance of this new hospital in addressing some of our concerns.  Currently, children, young people and their families are receiving treatment in buildings that are no longer fit for purpose.  We have heroic, talented staff that we value highly.  Despite their surroundings, they are doing great work but in sub-optimal conditions.</p><p> We support our colleagues, who have presented previously to the committee, in the absolute need for a new children's hospital.  It is, however, broader than that.  We also rely on multiple arrangements with several adult hospitals to support paediatrics and we need to move to position where that is much more co-ordinated with a large teaching hospital.   The ability to work collaboratively across all of the clinical specialties in paediatrics is hampered and limited by the fact that the specialties are on different sites particularly between Our Lady's hospital in Crumlin and Temple Street Children's University Hospital.  This means that our children and their families need to move across the city, our charts need to move across the city, our x-rays need to move across the city and it is not helping us in delivering optimal care.  Tonight, parents will be sleeping on the floor of a children's hospital beside their sick child's bed because we do not have the facilities to accommodate them appropriately.  There is limited car parking at Our Lady's hospital in Crumlin and there is none at Temple Street.  Our children deserve more.</p><p> In making progress, we have identified that there are 39 specialties within our existing services.  These specialties have mapped out, over the last year, what they are going to do and undertake before they move to this new hospital.  This is essential because while the building offers the opportunity to come together, fundamentally as a service we need to be working effectively before we transition to these new centres.  There is extensive, daily collaboration between the three children's hospitals; between the nurse, the clinical and the management leaders, on optimally getting the best from a clinical and operational perspective in designing this hospital.  We are on track for our programme and we will work with our colleagues in the development board to support this build.  We are already making changes in how we are delivering paediatric services such as introducing new beds and new types of beds into children's hospitals.  The new building will be a significant catalyst for positive change and it will afford us the vision that we want to deliver, as do all of us here, with what is right and best for our children.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.420" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#T00300"><p>Good morning, or good afternoon now, and I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  A number of questions arise which are not specifically based on the presentations we have just heard, but are related to it.  Obviously everyone supports tri-location.  We all accept and believe that it is a good idea - but concerns were relayed to this committee.  There was a degree of scepticism expressed about whether or not there will ever be a maternity hospital on the St. James's Hospital site.  If a maternity hospital is to be put in to the St James's Hospital site further concern was expressed about whether or not it would be a full services maternity hospital or an urgent care only maternity hospital and I have to be honest that I would share some of this concern.  That is my first question.  If we all accept that there is not a huge benefit to be had from bi-location and that tri-location is the key, I would be interested to know if the board has an estimate on when we would actually see tri-location on the St James's Hospital site.</p> <p>  Reference was made to 78% of proposed inpatients coming from the Dublin area.  Will the witnesses indicate where these figures came from because they have been disputed, on the basis of figures that have been publicly issued previously?  We would all need to understand exactly who will be using the new hospital and where the figures came from.  Perhaps Mr. Pollock and Ms Hardiman could give the committee a brief run through - it is in some of the documentation - on the car parking issues.  Traffic is a serious problem.  I lived in Dublin 12 for many years.  I was born in St. James's Hospital and I am very familiar with it and I know that the traffic around that area is a nightmare.  Parents have expressed concerns to this committee about driving through city centre traffic with a sick child in the back of the car.  Anybody's heart would break listening to that so perhaps the witnesses could give the committee some idea of how traffic congestion will be dealt with because there is going to be traffic congestion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.421" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#T00400"><p>I thank the witnesses very much for coming in to speak with us this afternoon.  To follow on from Deputy O'Reilly's questions, I would like to speak about the tri-location model.  Could the witnesses explain the reason why the maternity services from the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital cannot be done in tandem with the new children's hospital? Is it just the money or an ambition thing?  Is there any timeline for the start of the transfer of those services from the Coombe to the St. James's Hospital site?  The committee has heard presentations from people - I should not say the opposing side because we are all on the one side here - who have had different viewpoints.  Everyone has stated that the health and well-being of our children is priority and especially anyone with experience in dealing with the children's hospitals in this State.  I had reason to be in Temple Street with my youngest child last Friday and I am actually shocked at how bad it is.  I knew it was bad but if there was a fire in Temple Street people would be throwing children out from windows, it is that simple.  It is terrible.  My mother-in-law told me that the decor in Crumlin hospital is the same as when my husband had his tonsils taken out 35 years ago, as it was when I was there five years ago myself.  There is nobody out there who does not think that a new children's hospital is absolutely essential for the health, well-being and maintenance of the welfare of our children.</p> <p>  Reference was made at this morning's session to the model of care having been decided after the location.  Some people have claimed that.  Could the witnesses elaborate on that process as one that people could perhaps find fault with.  Many people seem to have issues with capacity, future proofing, expansion and demographics.  Can we grow on the St. James's Hospital site to accommodate the demographics and advances in health care?  Some of the people who have been in to the committee previously spoke about actual physical barriers - I believe it was the proton scanner or some other new machines - so could the witnesses talk us through any sort of barriers that they could see to development in the future.</p> <p>  I may have misinterpreted this but some of the clinical directors who have supported the St James's Hospital site - and I thought it was being implied - came on board and were in the process that was aligned to the St James's site.  I do not wish to twist anyone's words but perhaps they were part of the St James's Hospital ideology anyway and maybe they are not the most objective.  I may be twisting the words of previous presentations to the committee but I am trying to find out if that would be true to say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.422" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#T00500"><p>I thank and welcome the witnesses.  I cannot get out of my mind the image of the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, on the St. James's Hospital site with a shovel helping to commence works.  I hope there is more than the Minister down there with shovels; I hope there are a few JCBs or the deadline will certainly run longer than 2020.</p> <p>  There are a few issues and slight difficulties.  The board is charged with the responsibility of developing the site as proposed on the St James's Hospital site.  I am sure that if the Government had picked another site the board would be charged with the responsibility of developing that site.  The board's view can only be expressed on the site that has been chosen from the Government's point of view and the board's responsibility is to bring together the three children's hospitals in the context of the National Children's Hospital group and also the physical construction.  There are, however, issues that are very relevant with regard to the development of the site to which I would like some answers, on the physical aspects and with regard to the services that will be delivered when it is finally completed.</p> <p>  During the initial phases there has been a lot of concern about the actual physical construction of the hospital itself and the expense that will be incurred.  Mr. Pollock has already relayed the fact that the site had to be cleared to get to the stage where building work can commence.</p><p>These are all additional costs but they have to be incurred because the St. James's Hospital site has been chosen.  There is a 50 acre site overall and the National Paediatric Hospital Development Board will have approximately 12 or 13 acres available for the children's hospital.</p><p> Several issues have been raised.  One relates to future proofing and further developments that may be required in the context of the children's hospital.  This question is distinct from the maternity unit, which is separate.  In terms of future proofing, when the hospital is fully developed is it completely locked in to the site for ever?  Let us consider the amount of specialties in paediatrics.  Within the concept, plans, design and construction, is there for flexibility or manoeuvre in terms of expansion of specialties in paediatrics?  This arises because technologies and medical advances take place all the time.</p><p> This brings us back to the issue of relocating the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital to St James's Hospital.  Reference has been made to the fact that it is a tight site.  How confident are the members of the hospital development board, bearing in mind that An Bord Plean&aacute;la does not always get every decision right?  Either way, it is always the final arbitrator.  Once An Bord Plean&aacute;la decides one way or the other, that is the end of it.  How confident are the development board members that, in the context of the national maternity strategy, moving the Coombe to St James's Hospital can be done successfully when it comes to construction?  Reference has been made to how we could end up in a situation where the Coombe could not be relocated, but that there could be a high-dependency maternity obstetric service, a service for complications, in other words.  The view is that the Coombe cannot move in its entirety.</p><p> Another issue is parking.  We had a passionate contribution from a parent of a sick child today.  I have met several others in recent years while discussing this issue as well.  The issues of parking and the ambience are critical for parents and families.  Can the members of the development board elaborate on whether there is sufficient parking for staff, parents and family members who will be there for long periods as well as people who may wish to visit, such as siblings?</p><p> A related question is the issue of green space and open space arises.  The development board representatives have made reference to the fact that there will be a garden the length of Croke Park on the rooftop.  Can the representatives elaborate further on whether it will be a real park that will be available at all times for family and children?  Emergency transfer by air and road is another question.  The helicopter pad will be accessible on a 24-7 basis.  The helicopter would be flying in to a heavily populated residential area.  Transfers by road is another matter.  Can the representatives clarify the position on those areas?</p><p> There is a broader issue.  Ms Hardiman is charged with bringing the three hospitals together into one group.  How much consultation has there been with clinicians and worker representatives?  We have heard of cases, whether they are factual, of there being large numbers of staff leaving St. James's Hospital.  These include senior clinicians as well as nursing and ancillary staff.  Is this the case?  Does Ms Hardiman have any concerns about ensuring that the staff in the three hospitals will fully co-operate and move seamlessly into the new children's hospital?</p><p> I probably have a little more to say.  Will we have an opportunity to come back in?</p></speech>

In the previous session Dr. Jimmy Sheehan referred to the construction.  However, I did not need him to reference it, because it is something that continues to bother me a good deal.  We are very good at building but we are very slow.  Let us consider this street.  We have been digging up the street for the Luas.  The stretch is not 500 m but we are a long time at it.  While we have great expertise in the area of design and so on, I take the view that build management is an area where we let ourselves down from time to time.  Has the development board carried out forward planning in terms of the exact type of equipment that will be going in, and all that flows from that?  Such planning is essential, rather than carrying out the construction first and then assembling the parts of the hospital to fit equipment and so on.  That has been the case in some of our major projects in previous times.  We have not always covered ourselves in glory.  Has the development board seamlessly planned right through to the end?  Will the hospital be fitted out as it is built?  Will it all be done in time and on budget?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1401" speakername="R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#U00500"><p>I welcome the members of the hospital development board and thank them for coming before the committee today.  I feel a particular responsibility to vindicate the right of people, such as those in the group before the committee earlier, to raise questions about public safety, safety of children and public money.  That is my sole interest in asking the questions that I believe need to be asked.  I know some questions will overlap with what others have asked.</p><p>While it is true to say that we are all on the same side, in that we do not want the <i>status quo</i>to continue, it is clear from the earlier presentation that serious concern has arisen among eminent people and people of goodwill.  These people have declared to us that they have no vested interest.  They are not happy about the way they have been treated by Government in terms of consultation.  They are not happy with some of the claims which, they maintain, the hospital development board has made.  That has to be put out today and a response sought from the members of the development board.</p><p>Earlier, representatives of the Connolly for Kids hospital group alleged false and misleading statements were made to counter what they describe as their valid criticisms and the major shortcomings of the site.  For example, they say that in dispatches the hospital development board has claimed that one of the reasons the St. James's Hospital site is needed relates to the availability of a pet scanning facility.  They have pointed out that there is such a facility in Connolly Hospital.  Does this mean that the development board was wrong?  Was there something misleading in the response that the development board has provided to the Connolly for Kids group directly or indirectly?</p><p>The group makes serious and concerning claims to the effect that deaths will occur as a result of the choice that has been made.  Are these concerns not well founded?  I have in mind all the concerns about access, parking and future expansion.  We heard from a young doctor who talked about being shuttled to the children's hospital in the back of a car and feeling nauseous.  He was describing real life.  One could conclude that there was a real lack of empathy in the decision that has been taken.  Does the development board believe those concerns are ultimately not well founded?</p><p>Individually and without prejudice to the role that the development board members now have to play, does each member of the board believe that the St James's Hospital site is superior to the Connolly Hospital option from the point of view of the welfare of children and having regard to all the concerns expressed?  Would it have been the choice of each member of the development board, prescinding from the role they now have to play?  Would they have chosen St. James's Hospital over Connolly Hospital?</p><p>The development board representatives referred to thinking 20 years ahead.  Is 20 years too conservative?  Is that enough of a time within which to consider whether the right amount of thought has been given to expansion in future?  Can the development board justify its recommendations around space for expansion?  Has the board costed a facility on a greenfield site as opposed to the St. James's Hospital option?  What do the development board representatives think of the claims that &euro;200 million is the difference?  The claim of Connolly for Kids seems to rest on the idea that stalling the diggers now and starting again in Connolly would cost &euro;200 million less.  That is an astonishing claim.  Does the development board believe it?  Are those making the claim right?  Are they misguided?  I do not think anyone wants to suggest that anyone else is acting in bad faith, but that is an extraordinary claim.</p><p>Their claim essentially rests on two issues, namely, welfare of children - they allege future deaths if this choice is proceeded with - and an alleged massive waste of public resources.  "Allegation" is the wrong word.  "Prediction" is the correct word.</p><p> Ms Hardiman stated that the staff of the children's hospitals fully support the choice that has been made.  How can I reconcile that with the Connolly for Kids Hospital representatives' claim that a staff survey in Crumlin hospital in November 2015 showed that 84% thought St. James's was not the best site for the children's hospital?  Who am I to believe?  Can both statements be true?  I would be grateful for the NPHDB's opinion on that.  In the presentation this morning, reference was made to the three children's hospitals believing that St. James's hospital, as the largest and leading adult teaching hospital, is the best adult co-location partner for the new children's hospital.  With respect, is that really the issue?  The presentation made by the representatives of Connolly for Kids Hospital argued that adult co-location is not the primary lens through which this issue should be viewed.  Ms Hardiman said the NPHDB agrees with them about tri-location.  The essential point made by Connolly for Kids Hospital, if I understood it correctly, is that maternity hospital facilities need to be beside children's hospital facilities and that this is the core issue.  They claim that, through that lens, Connolly is the better option because of its greater potential.  The statement that these hospitals might believe that the best adult co-location partner is St. James's might be perfectly true, but is that the most important issue?</p><p> The Connolly for Kids Hospital representatives were sharply critical of what the former Minister, Senator James Reilly, had to say when he said that the primary clinical driver for the decision was that children with very rare diseases could be treated by St. James's adult hospital consultants and not have to travel abroad.  They state that was a false and nonsensical claim by the former Minister.  Are they right?  I would like to hear the views of the NPHDB on that.  Was that a competent statement by the former Minister?</p><p> What is or are the biggest weakness or weaknesses of the Connolly location in the view of the NPHDB?  I ask that in connection with my question as to whether the NPHDB has engaged, intellectually or otherwise, in a comparative cost analysis between a greenfield site and the St. James's option.  Those are my questions.  I apologise that the list is a little bit long.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.430" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Pollock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#V00300"><p>There are quite a few questions there.  I will start with the St. James's campus.  There is a big vision for the St. James's campus that people probably do not always fully understand.  It has come out of all reports that were written for Government on which the ultimate decision to co-locate was made.  Fundamentally, having co-location is the optimal solution.  That comes out clearly in all of the reports, whether it is the McKinsey report, the Dolphin report or the Clear and Martin report.  Co-location is fundamental.  What St. James's has as a campus is specialties and sub-specialties.  What does that mean for people who come to the hospital?  It means it has radiation treatment services.  Obviously, Connolly does not have a radiation treatment service so we would have to duplicate a service like that out in Connolly.  St. James's has access to the blood transfusion service.  Again, that is obviously a service that paediatrics requires.  I will ask my medical colleagues to elaborate on why these specialties are so important.</p> <p>  St. James's has 50 acres of land in the middle of the city centre.  It is going to undergo a radical change over the next number of years.  I invite the committee to come and visit the site.  It is currently made up of many single and two-storey buildings.  The development plan now permits the building of six and seven-storey buildings.  The children's hospital construction works are now under way.  Adults are already there.  It has blood transfusion services.  On the issue of maternity services and the Coombe, I will ask Dr. Sharon Sheehan to talk about her support for the site from the maternity side of things.  The Coombe will be delivered in the next number of years.  On this campus, there will be services from cradle to grave: there will be maternity services, children' services and adult services.  St. James's recently opened the Mercer's institute for successful ageing, MISA, building for the aged.  There are services for maternity, children, adults and the aged.  We also have access to radiation oncology services.  There are the blood transfusion services.  There is research carried out there.  There is the institute for molecular medicines and the Wellcome institute.  We are going to put the children's research centre right beside that.  They will share a mass spectrometer.  Buildings will be physically linked and staff will move from building to building.  They will share their research.  People ask, "Why is research important?".  Research is important because it is the future of treatment.  The research we do today is the treatment of tomorrow.</p> <p>  There is a big vision piece happening on this campus.  Out of that, we will get a campus that will rival anything in Europe.  It will be one of the great health care campuses and will compete with any in Europe.  What we get from that is the best staff and the best people wanting to work on this campus.  People automatically think of Great Ormond Street Hospital and they want to work there.  This is what we are creating: a health care campus across cradle to grave that people want to come to and have access to research in.  If we get the best people and staff, we get the best treatment for our children.  That is the big vision piece that might not always be communicated on our behalf.  I will ask Dr. Peter Greally to talk about why St. James's is so suitable from the clinical perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.431" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Greally" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#V00400"><p>It is great to have the opportunity to present the vision for the new children's hospital.  As a bit of background, I started my training in paediatrics in 1985.  I have worked in various capacities in each of the Dublin hospitals over the last four decades.  I observed a system in which we had really good, highly-trained people working in conditions that are not fit for purpose delivering very good clinical outcomes.  The system is not conducive to producing the best clinical outcomes.  There is a fragmentation of services.  There is a duplication and triplication of some services.  We have children who have quite complex needs needing to visit two or three sites to have their medical needs catered for.  We all agree that concentrating the medical expertise with increased volumes of activity into centres of excellence is a good thing.  As the group clinical director, I encounter that fragmentation and lack of integration every day when I am trying to deal with the medical problems that arise from the current system.  I firmly believe that this hospital needs to be built, built now and built on the St. James's campus.</p> <p>  I am a respiratory clinician by training.  I look after chronically ill patients with respiratory disease and cystic fibrosis in particular.  I became involved in clinical directorates because I saw how dysfunctional the system was.  Rather than just complain, I decided to get in there and try to do something about it.  In 2009, I became clinical director for paediatric services in Tallaght, where I hold one of my appointments.  Last year, in 2015, I became the group clinical director.  I was appointed in open competition.  I was involved in the appointment of the other three clinical directors.  These are the site clinical directors for Temple Street, Tallaght and Crumlin.  One of them is a specialist in neonatology and is very much an intensive care doctor.  Two of them are emergency department consultants.  That involves front-of-house, very acute medicine.  These are not people who are hiding from the coalface.  They see the problems that arise in trying to provide services for children in the current set-up on a daily basis.  These people were appointed in open competition and on the merits of their experience and training.  I just want to clarify that.</p> <p>  This project has received the wholehearted support of the medical boards of the three children's hospitals, as well as the boards of management of the three children's hospitals, the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital and the faculty of paediatrics.</p><p>Therefore, people whose main interest is the best care for children all endorse this project and location because we recognise that an integrated, tri-located campus has the capacity to care for the sickest of newborn children, older children, very ill mothers and adolescents with chronic diseases who will need to transition to adult care.  As Mr. Pollock mentioned, it is an academic campus that has the capacity to care for people from cradle to grave.  We therefore have great ambitions for this campus, and I envisage that the children's hospital, over time, will become a magnet hospital where the scale of our activities becomes such that we will attract medical and nursing trainees from all over the world who will want to work in our institution.  We will become a flagship hospital of international renown and will be a rival to hospitals such as Great Ormond Street Hospital.</p><p> I will say a few words on the evidence for tri-location.  I think we have all agreed that tri-location is a good thing.  The lack of evidence does not mean that there is a lack of benefit.  The lack of evidence means that no one has done a clinical trial or a trial that examines the outcomes of patients who have been treated in one system versus another, so that argument does not hold.  Many clinical interventions in medicine have occurred which have not been scrutinised by clinical trials but which we know to be beneficial to patients.  The modern trend, when building a new children's hospital, is to tri-locate it on a campus with maternity services and an adult academic centre.  These days, new builds of stand-alone hospitals are rare.  We have heard about Alder Hey but, in fact, Alder Hey wanted to tri-locate with the relevant hospitals in Liverpool but they were unable to cater for the scale of activity that Alder Hey was providing on a suitable campus.  I can give the committee plenty of examples of tri-located hospitals in the UK and elsewhere.  The most analogous to our proposal in the UK is in Manchester, but Glasgow Children's Hospital is also tri-located, as will be the soon-to-be-completed Edinburgh children's hospital.  The Lady Cilento Children's Hospital in Brisbane is also tri-located on an adult campus, so the evidence is that international best practice is tri-location.</p><p> Why St. James's Hospital?  The authors of the Dolphin report were asked to carry out an appraisal of the Dublin academic teaching hospitals.  They chose St. James's Hospital on its clinical and academic strengths, which I will go into in a moment, but it was also chosen because it has excellent public transport links.  Six bus routes serve it, there are three Luas stops near it, it is adjacent to Heuston Station and is closely adjacent to the N4 and M50.  No other hospital has such links.  The medical sub-specialisms available there, as we have heard, include blood transfusion, radiation oncology and PET scanning.  It is also the national or regional centre for haematology and coagulation disorders and oncology and provides craniofacial and maxillofacial surgery, immunology, vascular surgery, orthopaedics, plastic surgery and burns treatment, cardiology, respiratory treatment, renal treatment - the list goes on.  Unfortunately, none of the other sites had such a breadth of specialties.  These specialties are important because many children who are regular users of our service will require care in adulthood, and while not all of them will be catered for on the adult site, many can be.  I am not involved in defining strategy over the next 50 years, but I imagine that national centres will relocate to the St. James's Hospital site to facilitate that transitional care to adulthood.</p><p> A particular example of the importance of the transition to adult care is children who survive childhood cancer.  They are at risk of developing new cancers because of the chemotherapy used to treat their primary cancers.  Some children will have received radiation therapy, particularly to the brain area, and are therefore at risk of pituitary growth-type problems.  Children who have undergone palliative treatment for complex congenital heart disease require long-term follow-up and often follow-up procedures in adulthood.  Children who have chronic conditions of the kidney or joints will also require long-term follow-up.</p><p> An academic environment is extremely important as well.  I hold an academic appointment in Trinity.  Teaching and research is very important.  It should be remembered that today's medical and nursing students are tomorrow's clinical leaders and that current research leads to tomorrow's cures.</p></speech>

I will ask Dr. Sharon Sheehan in a minute to talk about the relocation of the Coombe, but one thing that demonstrates how we handle maternity services is that as part of our planning application to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, we did not lodge a planning application for maternity services.  That was not what we were asked to do by the Government.  That decision was only made in May of 2015, and we lodged our planning application in August of 2015.  However, what we did do is produce a master plan for the campus.  The people who know this campus best of all are now us.  We were told we would not deliver a children's hospital in this campus and that it was too cramped and too small.  We delivered a planning application and An Bord Plean&aacute;la adjudicated on it and made no changes to it.  We understand this site.  We understand how we need to stay within the Dublin City Council development guidelines regarding height and access to the sites.  We understand all the planning issues about overlooking and protecting residents.  We applied the same strategy as we applied for the children's hospital to do an outline design of the maternity hospital.  We have identified the site.  It is three acres.  Much of it is made up of a car park, which is the outpatients department of St. James's Hospital.  The other portion is a single-storey building, the outpatients department, which would need to be demolished.  That building was erected in the 1970s.  That three-acre site will be a full maternity hospital, and we have physically plotted all the connections, whether underground, for servicing it and for materials, or corridor links above ground for moving patients and staff from the maternity hospital to the children's hospital.  I am therefore extremely confident that we will deliver a maternity hospital on the site.  What our site capacity plan demonstrated is the 50 acres of land we have on St. James's Hospital site, and because of the fact that heights will go up as permitted under the Dublin City Council development plan, our building will be seven stories.  There will be more seven-storey buildings in St. James's Hospital.  Our outline master plan demonstrated that we can have the St. James's adult campus and the children's and the maternity hospitals, and on top of that we could build another children's hospital, so we could triple the development on the 50 acres at St. James's Hospital.  That is while protecting the listed building and the residents.  This campus of 50 acres can therefore triple in capacity, so we will comfortably deliver the maternity hospital.  Would Dr. Sharon Sheehan like to talk about why it is so important from her perspective?</p></speech>

My understanding is - and I ask the witnesses to correct me if I am wrong about this - that planning permission has not yet been received for the maternity hospital.</p><p>I ask the witnesses to factor in an assumption of planning permission.  We are all speaking about tri-location, but what is being proposed in the short to medium term, from what I can see as a layperson, is co-location, which we all agree is not ideal.  I apologise for the interruption but I must go and I want to be very specific about this.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.445" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sharon Sheehan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#X00200"><p>I thank the committee for giving us an opportunity to speak.  I am here at the master of the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital.  I am also a consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist.  Like Dr. Greally, I have worked the three Dublin maternity hospitals as well as in Limerick and in the UK.  I bring a range of perspectives to this.</p> <p>  Tri-location is absolutely essential.  It is really simple as to why we should tri-locate.  It improves outcomes and efficiencies across our services.  What is very important, and I would like to take this opportunity to dispel many of the myths circulating, is we are not talking about moving a high-risk maternity unit onto the campus.  We are talking about bringing the full breadth and depth of women and infant services that operate in the Coombe Women and Infants University Hospital onto the St. James's Hospital campus site to tri-locate with St. James's Hospital and the new children's hospital.  Any misconceptions about a high-risk maternity unit are ill-founded.  It is very important that it is the full breadth and depth.  For us, in our hospital, it is about looking after maternity services.  It is also very important to remember how much gynaecology service we deliver in our hospital.  It is essential this is catered for on the St. James's Hospital campus and this has been allowed for.</p> <p>  The full breadth and depth of women and infant services is very important and it has been raised previously regarding the national maternity strategy.  I had the great pleasure and privilege of sitting on the national steering group for this strategy.  It fully endorsed the tri-located model, which is very important.  Yes, it endorsed co-location but it fully endorsed tri-location, which is entirely consistent with Ireland's first and only national maternity strategy.  This is very important.</p> <p>  Another very important issue to take into account is that we are not just talking about moving to any hospital.  We are talking about moving to the St. James's Hospital campus.  It is important to remember that St. James's Hospital is the largest and leading adult acute service in the entire country.  It has the greatest number of national specialties and the greatest number of acute specialties.  This is not just moving to any adult service, it is moving to the leading service for clinical specialties and research and innovation on the St. James's Hospital campus.</p> <p>  When we look at tri-location, and it has been raised previously, we speak about the transition for mothers and their babies to paediatric services, but we must also think about the transition for mothers and women to adult services.  It is not just about children moving from paediatrics to adult care, it is about mothers moving across in a seamless transition to adult services.  We are not just talking about buildings, and this is very important.  Ms Hardiman mentioned this in her statement.  Much work has already taken place, so we are in a position where we can state we are virtually tri-locating.  This is not just waiting for a new shiny building and expecting our services to transition patients seamlessly across them.  This is all about the collaboration that happens long before any planning permission applications are sought or a sod is turned in the ground.  This is going on.</p> <p>  If I can speak about what is going on in the Coombe hospital at present with regard to maternal medicine, we operate one of the largest maternal medicine and comprehensive services for women with complicated medical histories during their pregnancies.  Consultation is provided across our experts in the Coombe hospital and experts in St. James's Hospital and Tallaght hospital.  This is already happening.  We offer mothers who come in with complex maternal medicine cases the absolute optimum of care.</p> <p>  With regard to location with the children's hospital, extensive collaboration is going on regarding our services and paediatric services.  An example of this is the all-Ireland fetal cardiac clinic.  This is being led by Dr. Orla Franklin, who is a consultant cardiologist in Our Lady's children's hospital in Crumlin and Dr. Caoimhe Lynch, consultant obstetrician and gynaecologist and fetal medicine specialist in the Coombe hospital.  This clinic looks after women from all 32 counties in Ireland.  No other fetal service in the country is doing this.  Mothers diagnosed with congenital cardiac anomalies in their babies in the womb are transferred and referred the Coombe hospital.  They meet experts in our hospital and in Crumlin hospital, where their care is mapped out as is a plan for their labour and delivery and for what happens to the baby once it is born.  This is happening right now.</p> <p>  This is the type of collaboration we need to have well-established before we think a shiny building will better enable it.  We already know the service we offer for those mothers whose babies have been diagnosed with this condition in utero means the outcomes for those babies has improved.  We are able to say this right now.  Tri-locating only enhances this in terms of the physical space.  So much work is already going on.  Understanding the importance of tri-location across maternity services for women, paediatrics and adult services is very important.  It is essential we do not lose sight of why we are moving onto the St. James's Hospital campus.  It is because of the benefits the hospital will be able to deliver for us and the benefits the new children's hospital will bring.  The benefits of tri-location are really simple.  It will improve outcomes for our women and their families and it will improve efficiencies across our services.</p></speech>

Unfortunately I had business in the Seanad I had to attend to.  I was moving a Private Member's Bill.  I have looked all the documentation on this.  With regard to the presentation made earlier this morning, I raised in particular the issue that An Bord Plean&aacute;la looked at the Mater hospital site and decided it was not the appropriate place for the children's hospital.  I asked whether all the issues regarding traffic management and parking were dealt with by An Bord Plean&aacute;la when the application went in for the hospital on the St James's Hospital site but I did not get an answer to this.  There is very much a myth out there about transport access to St. James's Hospital.  The witnesses have outlined the Luas line, Heuston train station and bus services.  However, genuine concerns were raised by other witnesses who appeared before the committee this morning.  Are the witnesses before us satisfied we can meet these concerns and that we will not be here in ten years' time stating the location was a huge mistake with regard to access?</p> <p>  There is much focus at present on the size of the site and that it is not adequate.  The witnesses referred to the fact the site is 50 acres.  This is not in the public domain.  Many people have the view it is a two or three acre site.  A message needs to be sent out on this because it is a problem.  I have visited the site and I know where it is.  There are a number of issues in the public domain.  We receive many e-mails from people who have a firm belief it is the wrong site.  What needs to be done to send out a positive message about the project?</p> <p>  Another issue is the timescale.  As I understand it, the site is being cleared at present and much work has been done.  When is building likely to occur?  The witnesses may have already gone over this, and I apologise if I am asking a question which has already been covered, but what is the timing from the start of building to actual completion to actual fit out to actual commissioning?  Will the witnesses give us some guidelines on the timing?</p> <p>  Are we anywhere closer to making a planning submission for the maternity unit?  If it goes through, has any indication been given by the Department on the likelihood of funding being provided?  What timescale does the Department have for funding a new maternity unit?</p><p>I accept that what has happened in the maternity units in Dublin is wrong in that they have grown at a phenomenal rate.  All of the hospitals have moved from a figure of approximately 6,000 to 9,000 deliveries in a short timeframe and been able to deal with the challenge, but that will not continue forever.  Have the delegates been given any indication about the availability of funding in the short and the long term and the timescale about which we are talking for maternity units?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.448" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Pollock" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#Y00200"><p>Deputy Louise Reilly's question was linked with this issue.  In terms of timelines, we are further on than the Rotunda Hospital in moving to Connolly Hospital because we have done two things.  First, we have a master plan in place.  We have physically identified the location of the site.  Second, we have future-proofed our services within the children's hospital.  For instance, in the case of the energy centre, clinical sterilisation servuce and facilities management, FM, logistics, we have built in spare capacity for when the maternity unit will come on line.  That will help to bring down costs.  The Rotunda Hospital is not as far advanced.  A master plan for the site has not been completed.</p> <p>  I am not aware of when the Government will commit funding, but I estimate that it will take approximately two years from when the funding is committed to develop the brief, lodge the planning application with An Bord Plean&aacute;la and receive planning permission for the St. James's hospital site.  Thereafter, it will probably take two years to buiild the hospital.  If the Government was to commit funding, that would be the timeframe involved, but it is a matter for the Government to decide.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.449" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#Y00300"><p>I hope it is okay to group some of the questions on services.  Specifically, questions were asked about the figures that had been made public for health care planning.  To be clear, the figures quoted for the children who attended the three children's hospitals are factual.  We collate the data for the counties from which children come to avail of inpatient and day case services.  Not only that, we have carried out a geo-analysis of where children attend emergency departments.  We did this with the health intelligence unit and found that 95% of the children had attended their local emergency department.  Using CSO figures, with the health intelligence unit, it has been mapped that the children were from within a 10 km radius of St. James's Hospital.  The mapping exercise was engaged in using postcodes.  It has demonstrated to us that 48% of the children living in Dublin are within 10 km of St. James's Hospital.  This was a key element in identifying where a hospital should be sited.  Most of the rest, from a health care planning perspective, was focused on where we saw the population growing in the fuure - to the north west and south west of the city and in the greater Dublin area.  Hence, both the analysis and the social deprivation index, an indicator of where families use health care facilities, were used in identifying where paediatric outpatient and urgent care satellite centres should be based - in Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.</p> <p>  One of the primary objectives, as a service provider, is to locate a hospital where most of the population live - the inner city - and then provide what is predominantly used on a daily basis, that is, outpatient and urgent care centres, at locations convenient to these families, that is, off the M50 to provide access to outpatient and emergency services.  That would meet most of their needs.</p> <p>  A first draft of the model of care to be used was developed in the planning of the hospital at the location of the Mater hospital.  This was endorsed by the three children's hospitals.  The HSE has since established the clinical care programmes, as part of which a clinical care programme for paediatrics and neonatology was established.  There was extensive engagement that was much wider than that engaged in previously in all of the paediatric, neonatal and maternal units.  A consensus based model of care has been developed, the engagement on which not only included the doctors, nurses and health and social care professionals in the three Dublin children's hospitals, as well as the maternity hospitals in Dublin, but in all 20 paediatric units throughout Ireland, as well as in the three regional units at Galway, Limerick and Cork.  A family advisory group that represented many of the advocacy groups on children's diseases and health care issues also took part in the process.</p> <p>  The fundamental principles underpinning a single hospital have never been refuted.  Everyone understands we would all be better under one roof.  However, that it be at the centre of a network for paediatrics is a strong requirement.  We do not want it to be all about a building.  We believe the services for children in Cork, Limerick and Galway and regional areas need to benefit from us working in a networked way.  Therefore, while we are coming together as specialists under one roof, the plan is to afford specialties opportunities to support our colleagues in the regions.  For example, five doctors are working across the three locations in endocrinology and diabetics.  Many of them could subspecialise if they were all working together and help our colleagues in the regional units. </p> <p>  Expansion was one of the issues raised.  Again, this is a health care planning objective of ours.  We have planned to 2046, which was as far as we could go using CSO projections.  When we looked at the issue of expansion, we took into account all activity in the children's hospitals, all unmet clinical needs because of capacity issues, future population growth and trends in epidemiology.  As hospitals expand, it occurs predominantly in two areas - intensive care and high dependency units and outpatient units.  Taking these into account, we have demonstrated that the hospital will meet population requirements until 2046.  We are doubling capacity in the facility in the area of critical care.  We will not open all of the beds when it opens in 2021.  We have designed the hospital in such a way that the corporate offices will be located beside critical care services in order that they will be able to expand by one third within the existing building by moving the corporate offices to another part of the campus.  We have also identified grey space in services that cannot be moved within the hospital such as the emergency department, the imaging department, ICU and the theatres.  We are building rooms that are probably bigger than the ones we are in in the middle of the imaging department.  In ten or 20 years new technology could be developed and we will have the capacity in the imaging department to take it on board.  </p> <p>  When looking at the provision of an outpatients department, it is important to note that everything does not necessarily need to happen at the hospital, as we have demonstrated in locating paediatric outpatient and urgent care centres at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals.  The intention is to have the people whom we serve in the greater Dublin area use them and not the hospital when it opens.  If we need to expand further after 2046, we will look at having further outpatient and urgent care centres, as opposed to everything having to be provided in a hospital that provides for the tertiary-quaternary needs of children.</p></speech>

To be clear, the national cancer programme has led the way in planning proton therapy which only three to five children need.  It is more for adults.  We access such facilities in London.  Something of that nature, a highly specialised treatment, would have to be developed with paediatric and adult services in mind.  St. James's Hospital is the largest provider of cancer services in the State.  It is also the provider of radiation oncology services.  There will be future expansion of radiation oncology services for both paediatric and adult services.</p><p>I heard mention of a PET-CT scanner.  No, we do not have a PET-CT scanner and will not in the children's hospital because such small numbers use it.  We will access the one that is already in St. James's Hospital.  Yes, we have developed a workforce plan.  We engaged with the directors of nursing, the clinical directors, the health and social care professionals and the management of the three children's hospitals.  The plan outlines our staffing requirements for the next five years to open up both the paediatric and outpatient urgent care centres at Connolly hospital and Tallaght hospital and the new children's hospital.  We have also identified that the majority of the staffing increase is in the nursing area.  In planning for that we have a workforce planner specifically for nursing looking at the supply of children&rsquo;s health nursing over the next five years in a planned way, as opposed to getting to the point where we realise we need to train more such nurses.  We have a systematic process identified of what our requirements are and a plan put in place over the next five years to look at how we can supply.  There is a global shortage of some specialties but we are also looking at whether there are new and different roles that can be introduced to alleviate some of the pressures that have been well established in other jurisdictions in particular areas.</p><p> I am pleased that people picked up on the fact that it is really important that while the building is a catalyst, there is strong consensus across the staff of the three children&rsquo;s hospitals.  We have had more than 1,000 hours of engagement.  Currently, we have 200 of our staff working in planning the rooms.  We have 6,000 rooms that are being designed.  They are attending meetings on planning.  I reassure the committee that the staff within the three children&rsquo;s hospitals are actively engaged in designing the hospital and, more important, they are actively engaged in how we are going to work together as a single legal entity by 2018, before we move into the new hospital.  Before I came here my previous role was CEO of Tallaght hospital, which was a merger of three hospitals.  It is really important that the building works because we are the hospital that will be providing services to the children of the greater Dublin area and all of the national services but it is really when people come to get treated by doctors, nurses and health care professionals that we will get the integration right.  We have some great fundamentals driving that, because no other hospitals in the adult system or even in the maternity system, work in an integrated way as do the three children&rsquo;s hospitals.  Every day we have staff going between the three children&rsquo;s hospitals.  Every day we have patients and families going between the three hospitals so we work already in that manner.</p><p> I heard reference to a staff survey.  I wish to clarify that is not an official survey.  It was not endorsed by the management and leadership of Crumlin hospital.  It was a SurveyMonkey survey that one puts up on a web page.  I completed it myself ten times so I question the validity of the outcomes of the survey.</p><p> I was asked whether I personally believe that St. James&rsquo;s Hospital is the right site.  Absolutely, yes.  I come very much from a personal position.  I have spent 25 years in management.  I am a nurse by background and I was a director of nursing in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital for five years, the deputy CEO there for almost four years and the CEO of Tallaght hospital for three years.  In all of those years of experience, I recall the time when a very sick mother with twins from the Coombe had to come to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital to deliver them in our theatre because she needed critical post-operative access to ICU.  That was the toughest day of my medical and management history, whereby we had to deal with a woman who was critically ill and almost at the stage of barely surviving and two very tiny babies.  We had to organise incubators to come over from Crumlin hospital and all of the special requirements for the mother from the Coombe.  I am pleased to say we worked on that but it took a significant amount of effort for all three of them to survive, and they did survive.  Our vision for the future is driven by those experiences, whereby we will have a corridor length to travel if the mother is at high risk and needs to get into the adult ICU and when babies and neonates require neonatal intensive care.  I am very much personally driven by that most harrowing experience of my career.</p><p> In terms of weaknesses in Connolly hospital, we work with the management and staff in that hospital because we are planning an urgent paediatric care and outpatient centre.  We have very good relationships with the hospital in regard to that.  People in the area are very pleased to have paediatrics on the site of that hospital.  Families are already attending the emergency department there because of their adult requirements and they look forward to the day when they will be able to attend for all of their requirements, not just adult but paediatrics.  We have had engagement with the GPs locally who see this as a good development, as opposed to going into the inner city to get those treatments.  Having said that, if I was to outline some of the examples of where the benefits are between Connolly hospital and St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, it has to lie-----</p></speech>

For example, we have 300 children with cancer and a lot of them have leukaemia.  We are rated fourth in the world for outcomes for paediatric leukaemia.  Some children require bone marrow transplant.  At the moment if a relative such as the mother or father is the donor, he or she has to have bone marrow extracted in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, while at the same time the child is in a theatre in Crumlin hospital.  The bone marrow is brought over and has to be donated there.  That service is not moving from St. James&rsquo;s, which has been well established as a leading national service for adults.  We want a situation whereby the mother and child are on the same campus at this very traumatic time when the bone marrow is donated and is also transplanted.</p> <p>  Radiation oncology is already on the site.  St. Luke&rsquo;s has moved its services to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.  We have children with cancer who require full body radiation and at the moment they travel to St. Luke&rsquo;s.  Our intention is to move that to St. James&rsquo;s so that there is a corridor length involved when they attend for radiation oncology as opposed to having to travel from another campus for the service.</p> <p>  A total of 25% of consultants within the three children&rsquo;s hospitals have adult-based specialties with a special interest in paediatrics.  All of our cardiac surgeons are also adult cardiac surgeons.  All of our neurosurgeons are also adult neurosurgeons and that will not change.  None of those are at Connolly hospital.</p> <p>  At the moment, within the three children&rsquo;s hospitals we have to engage with our colleagues in the adult hospitals to support us in some very specific areas.  For example, we do not have vascular surgeons in paediatrics.  We have a very early stage development of interventional radiology where imaging radiologists go through veins instead of using open surgery to get to the organs they need to get to.  That is much more established in the adult services.  Those types of consultants are very competent in dealing with highly complex situations around bleeding.  Sometimes when we have children that need very complex surgery we invite those surgeons to attend and be in the theatre at the same time so that they can help the paediatric surgeons.  Those are the types of specialists who are in St. James&rsquo;s Hospital and who are not in other hospitals and who really help us at times of crisis and when we have really sick patients.</p> <p>  In regard to rare diseases, we definitely are working-----</p></speech>

St. James&rsquo;s Hospital&rsquo;s laboratory services already support the three children&rsquo;s hospitals so they help us in the diagnosis of some illnesses and conditions.  The new challenge with the children&rsquo;s hospitals is that we are getting successful at treating some very rare diseases and children are now surviving into adulthood.  One example of that is intestinal dysfunction.  It is where a small number of young children do not have any small intestine and they end up not being able to absorb some key nutritions and they have to have them delivered intravenously.  That is done in the children&rsquo;s hospitals.  Those children are now surviving into adolescence and we are now working with St. James&rsquo;s Hospital, which has the greatest gastroenterology unit, in order for those children to move from Crumlin hospital to St. James&rsquo;s Hospital.</p><p>Last year, in the case of haematology, which is the blood diseases, we transferred some of the sickle cell anemia cases.  Sickle cell anemia is a very rare condition.  Due to the inward migration, particularly from sub-Saharan Africa where there is a high prevalence of the disease, it was evident in the children in Crumlin.  We have successfully treated those children to adolescent stage and they are now transferring to the haematology services at St. James's Hospital.  For the first time on this campus-----</p></speech>

The co-location with St. James's Hospital is about supporting the 22% of the really complex work we do.  Our other core objective is meeting the local requirements of the local children, given that 48% of them live in the area within the M50.</p> <p>  If I may continue with the example, we are very successful in our paediatric cancer services.  We are approximately fourth in the world with some of our outcomes.  However, we have concerns with regard to adolescent cancer, because it is an area that falls between the adult and the paediatric services.  The new cancer strategy has identified that as a key area for significant investment and improvement so we can save lives.  Some of the adolescent children require paediatric chemotherapy regimens, which are very well understood by oncologists in the paediatric service, but because some of their cancers are adult type cancers such as sarcomas they need to be based with colleagues who deal with those in the adult service.  In the future it is about co-working between paediatrics and adult services to get the best people together on these types of rare conditions.  Internationally, that has been demonstrated to lead to better outcomes, which means more survivors and less mortality from these rare diseases.  St. James's Hospital provides us with the opportunity to do that.</p></speech>

When Dr. Finn Breathnach and several other members of the delegation from Connolly for Kids appeared before the committee they were quite definite that co-locating with an adult teaching hospital brought no additional benefits to children.  You have referred to some of the benefits that will arise, so how can experienced paediatricians be so diametrically different on that point?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.473" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#AA01300"><p>We are going to differ on this because we have very experienced paediatricians currently delivering the most specialist services to our children and they fundamentally believe that co-location will add benefit.  If you speak to Professor Smith or Professor Capra about oncology, they believe and strongly advocate that being on this campus will result in better survivorship for children with complex conditions.  Dr. Peter Greally might wish to add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.474" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Peter Greally" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#AA01400"><p>I can base it on my own experience.  In addition to being a respiratory paediatrician I cover the acute and general on-call roster, so it is unselected patients coming in with any number of disorders.  I am based in Tallaght Hospital where we are co-located with adult services.  Over the last year I have had three cases of adolescent patients who have presented with conditions that are relatively rare in children, and there was not necessarily the expertise within paediatrics to deal with them, where we called in the relevant specialists in the adult services to help us.  That was just my experience and other colleagues in Tallaght would have had the same experience.  Sometimes it can work the other way.  Again, these are rare situations but it is one piece of a jigsaw.  It is not just one thing that dictates whether co-location or tri-location is important, it is the totality.  Sometimes adult physicians encounter rare disorders which are more commonly seen in children, so it works the other way.  We are occasionally consulted to give our opinion on those disorders.  It is part of the overall picture.  It is not necessarily the key driver, but it is an important contributor.</p></speech>

Ethically, I do not believe it would be possible to do it.  However, I point to the fact that newly built children's hospitals are rarely stand-alone now.  The tri-location model is the norm.  Stand-alone new builds for children's hospitals are the exception.</p></speech>

As I understand it, Alder Hey as an institution wanted to tri-locate but because of spatial issues in Liverpool and the scale of the Alder Hey clinical operation there was not the capacity to accommodate it.  With regard to Melbourne, which historically has been a stand-alone children's hospital, it is adjacent to Flemington Road and, if memory serves, there is an adult hospital and maternity services 2 km to 3 km up Flemington Road.  Although it is stand-alone, those services are adjacent.</p></speech>

That was what Alder Hey was trying to do, but it was not viable.  Previous reports of CEOs of major children's hospitals, which are often referred to, all support tri-location, including the CEO of Great Ormond Street Hospital.</p></speech>

It is not proposing that we build a stand-alone hospital.  We are saying the same thing as the group that appeared before the committee before us.  Tri-location has been shown to be a better model, and we are all saying that.  We are showing with our proposal that tri-locating on the St. James's Hospital site is the best option.  However, there is no dispute among ourselves or any other group that tri-location is the preferential model.</p></speech>

I have a long history of attending Temple Street Children's University Hospital as a parent.  During my time there I have become involved in the Temple Street family advisory committee, which is an active group of parents and members of advocacy groups.  I am also a parent representative on the governance, quality and patient safety committee in Temple Street, so I hear at first hand the impact the hospital infrastructure has on the ability to deliver a quality and safe service.</p><p>We all agree that is what we want. </p><p> My son was born 11 years ago with a very serious condition that required multiple surgeries and stays in hospital and many visits over the years.  I am one of many parents who have spent nights on roll-away beds and chairs in wards with six or eight patients.  I have spent a great deal of time in children's hospitals and the level of care given by clinical staff is exemplary and has been fantastic in our case.  Staff, parents and children are inevitably challenged by the infrastructure and conditions in which they are working.  </p><p> I will address some of the issues that have been raised, including parking.  When my son first visited Temple Street Children's University Hospital 11 years ago, the walls were lined with plans for the Mater Hospital.  Eleven years later, we still do not have a new, world class children's hospital for all of the children of the country.  I accepted the decision of the experts and planning experts that the Mater Hospital was not the right location for the new children's hospital.  I also accepted, based on trust, the decision of expert planners to grant planning permission for the James Street site and the Government decision that this site was the best location.  For me and many of the parents with whom I interact, the issue is one of delivering a world class hospital and children's health care system from which everybody in the country will benefit.  My primary concern and priority is delivery of the new hospital in the earliest possible timeframe.  </p><p> Mr. Pollock or Ms Hardiman may elaborate a little on some of the traffic management aspects of delivering the new hospital.  Temple Street children's hospital is located in the heart of Dublin city.  As I stated, I have spent years visiting the hospital and traffic at different times of the day is like traffic elsewhere in the city centre.  One issue that has not been mentioned is the stress caused to parents when they do not know if they will secure a parking space.  Arriving at Temple Street with a sick child in the back of the car, I have been unable to find a parking space at times because the hospital does not have allocated parking.</p><p> The new hospital will have parking and will offer a new and innovative facility of pre-booking a parking space.  This will remove an enormous amount of stress from parents travelling to the hospital.  Integrated public transport services will also be available, in my case to my child's grandparents who visit from Derry and County Clare.  The integrated public transport service will enable people to reach the hospital, which is a major step forward. </p><p> As a parent of a child who is in hospital, my needs are very basic.  At times, I need privacy to have a private conversation, which is certainly not possible in Temple Street children's hospital.  This is not the fault of the hospital but the result of the infrastructure at the hospital.  I also need to be able to sleep, find something to eat and get some fresh air.  People have spoken about outside space.  I have looked at the plans for the new hospital.  From my experience with Temple Street hospital, the outside space in the new hospital will be fantastic.  Sick children do not need a space the size of Croke Park but a place where they can spend some time with siblings and other family members and get some fresh air.  From what I have seen in the plans for the new children's hospital, they will deliver this.  </p></speech>

We have always been conscious that parents coming to the hospital with a sick child will drive and we have never suggested they take a bus or Luas.  That was never our plan.  From the outset, we have prioritised the car parking spaces for families and parents coming to the hospital.  A total of 675 car parking spaces have been ring-fenced for parents.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has confirmed this and made the number of spaces a planning condition.  This means we could not change it, even we wanted to do so.<br/><br/>As Ms Sharkey indicated, one of the anxieties parents have when coming to the hospital is whether they will find a car parking space.  Parents will be able to pre-book parking using a facility similar to what available to visitors to Dublin Airport where people can pre-book a space and when they arrive at the car park their car registration is recognised.  The barrier is then lifted and the driver parks in an assigned parking space.  The new pre-booking facility at the hospital will remove an anxiety faced by parents.  <br/><br/>We also recognised that some parents will arrive at the hospital in highly distressed circumstances and will obviously not have the luxury of pre-booking a parking space.  The accident and emergency department will have 27 car parking spaces.  A parent who arrives at the accident and emergency department with a child in an emergency will find a concierge service.  The parent will hand the car keys to the concierge and enter the hospital and the car will be parked for him or her.  The St. James's hospital campus caters for everybody, those who need to drive to the hospital and those who prefer to use public transport.  As Ms Sharkey stated, grandparents who do not drive may wish to visit their grandchildren at the weekend.  They will be able to take a train to Connolly Station or Heuston Station or a bus to Bus&aacute;ras and travel straight to the hospital.  The green and red Luas lines will connect next year, making the site even more accessible.<br/><br/>We also recognise the need to look after staff and a further 325 car parking spaces have been provided for staff.  These spaces will be prioritised, for example, members of staff living 1 mile from the hospital do not need to drive to the hospital.  This is the way cities have evolved.  <br/><br/>I am sorry Senator R&oacute;n&aacute;n Mullen has left the meeting.  He asked what is the significant weakness of the Connolly Memorial Hospital site.  We know a great deal about Connolly hospital.  In lodging an application for planning permission for a 5,000 sq. m. site, we had to comply with local, regional and national transportation policies.  The An Bord Plean&aacute;la inspector, in his report ruling on granting us planning permission, stated: </p><blockquote>There is a flaw, in my opinion, in the argument put forward by some of those who advocate a greenfield site adjacent the M50.  They appear to assume that unfettered access off the national and primary route and unfettered access to on-site car parking can be accommodated.  The same national, regional and local transportation policies are equally applicable at that location as they are at the application site and do not support such a strategy.</blockquote> <p>What the inspector was very much calling out in these remarks is that if one chooses a greenfield site without access to public transport, only one mode of transport, namely, the private car, is available to access the site and this means providing car parking.  This does not align with transportation policies.  The idea that thousands of car parking spaces would be provided at the Connolly hospital site is, therefore, a myth. <br/><br/>The inspector went further in his report when he stated: </p><blockquote>In that regard, it is interesting to note that in its written submission to the Board, Transport Infrastructure Ireland (TII) placed strong emphasis on the applicant delivering upon its MMP to reduce the generation of car commuter traffic, especially in relation to the satellite centre sites at Tallaght and Connolly hospitals to protect the national road network in the vicinity of those sites...  If the TII was concerned about the relatively small satellite centre of <i>c</i>. 5,000 sq.m. proposed under the current application at Connolly hospital, it may not be unreasonable here to suggest that they might have greater concerns if the NCH/CRIC/FAU of <i>c. </i>125,000 sq.m. was proposed there instead. </blockquote> <p>He is pointing out that if the TII had concerns about a 5,000 sq. m., what would be its concerns in respect of a site of 125,000 sq. m.  The inspector's report continues:</p><blockquote>Furthermore, there is no guarantee that locating the NCH on a greenfield site adjacent the M50 will avoid the congestion some fear will be encountered accessing the St. James&rsquo;s site.  The upgraded M50, as referred to by some at the Hearing, is experiencing congestion too. </blockquote><p>On this day last week there was major congestion on the M50 where even the hard shoulder was closed.  That is a recurring theme.  It is a myth to think that the M50 does not have problems because it does have problems.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la, in its wisdom, looked at all of these issues and called out very strongly that it has concerns.  I think that is a fundamental weakness.</p><p> The inspector also referenced the other major weakness in his report.  He said there are many people who are not in favour of the St. James's Hospital site and on that point they are in agreement.  After that they are not in agreement because some favour Tallaght, the Coombe, Connolly hospital or a greenfield site in the middle of the country.  There will never be a site that everybody rallies around because there is no perfect site.  There is the best site and that is what we have got. </p></speech>

I have heard some people opposed to the site run down the Dublin 8 area, which I think is inappropriate.  I would describe it as a diverse community.  We discovered that as part of a study on the impact of the hospital.  The people living in the community range from people with low levels of educational attainment to people with the highest levels and PhDs.  One of the ambitions we have set ourselves and with which we have engaged with Dublin City Council is the opportunity for a project like this to support the regeneration of an area.  This opportunity cannot be missed and the docklands is an example.  Regeneration can take place with proper planning.  The big vision piece that I spoke about for the campus will attract other industries that want to locate in close proximity to us.  The opportunity for regeneration of the area is huge.  Within our construction contracts we have embedded community clauses.  It means the contractor has a contractual obligation to employ staff from the area.  We have gone into schools and sold the ambition of having a career in hospitals.  Some people have said people should just think about careers in catering and cleaning.  We wanted to set a bigger ambition and for children to say, "Why can't I be a nurse or doctor and this is the campus I want to work in."</p> <p>  Our offices are on the site, as the Chairman is aware.  We have experienced no issues with security.  We have a drop-in centre at the Rialto bridge where residents have been invited to visit the site.  Residents support the project on a 10:1 ratio.  Our offices on the site have models and images of what the hospital will look like.  We have encountered no issues at the location, so we are welcome in the area.   </p></speech>

They expressed the view that the Minister should intervene and locate the hospital the Connolly Hospital site.  The last paragraph reads: "If the Minister fails to do so he should know with certainty that he will be responsible for the deaths of many children and the avoidable anguish of countless parents."  It has been implied in the submission that the location at St. James's Hospital will cause deaths.  It is a serious suggestion that needs a response.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.493" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eil&iacute;sh Hardiman" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016102700002#CC00700"><p>I shall reply.  I thank the Senator and agree because our primary focus is to improve services and patient safety is always of paramount importance.  The reference to loss of life is usually made to the transportation of neonates just born.  We are all on the same side in terms of supporting the tri-location argument.</p> <p>  The leading clinical expert in the transportation of neonates, who are small babies, is the neonatology transportation programme.  Dr. Jan Franta, who leads that programme, presented at the oral hearing on the 4,000 transfers that happen between the maternity hospitals located all around Ireland and the children's hospitals and maternity units in Dublin.  All of those transfers were analysed for an instance or learning that can take place and nothing untoward has occurred in the transportation approach.  </p> <p>  We have a challenge because the vast majority of the population that we want to serve, the people who live in the greater Dublin area, need a new hospital.  That is one of the hospital's functions.  In addition, we can only have one hospital on the island that deals with highly specialist cases and, therefore, it must be based in the greater Dublin area.  How do we work as a system to ensure that, where we have rural-based sick children, they safely transfer?  That is how other jurisdictions like Wales and Scotland look at the issue and the same happens in  Australia, which has a large landmass to cover.  </p> <p>  We have clearly identified, in the national model of care for paediatrics and neonatology, that while one centralises highly specialist services one must put in what we call a retrieval service where we retrieve really sick babies and children.  At the moment the retrieval service is 24-hour and seven days a week for neonates, who are the small babies born in any of the maternity units.  I shall let Dr. Sharon Sheehan talk about this matter too.  I note the vast majority of babies who are born with serious medical issues tend to be diagnosed beforehand and tend to experience a planned delivery, predominantly in the Coombe but also in the other maternity hospitals in Dublin.  Even with that one will have babies who are born with a condition that went undetected.  We have put in place a process where a highly specialist neonatologist who works in intensive care and a nurse or midwife will travel to the maternity unit where the child is stabilised.  They will stabilise the child there and bring him or her back to Dublin.  That system has been demonstrated internationally as a much safer way than trying to do this work in another way.</p> <p>  The retrieval service is fine for children up to the age of six weeks.  In paediatrics we are looking to roll-out a similar retrieval service for children aged six weeks up to 16 years.  We have managed to do so on a Monday-to-Friday basis.  We continue to recruit paediatric intensivists and will expand the programme to provide a 24-hour and seven-days-a-week service.  The plan is if there is a really sick child anywhere outside of Dublin, or even within Dublin, one needs to use the ambulance service, which is very good at dealing with these cases.  I have heard some of the parents talk about travelling in ambulances with really sick children but travelling is the right thing to do.  The children can be stabilised and we send our specialists to places like the Cork, Limerick or Galway units, where the child should go to be stabilised, and then we bring them back to the children's hospital.  We would use the helipad and helicopters or roads, whichever is the best method of transportation.  That model is part of the national model of care for paediatrics.  We will roll it out over the next five years.  I wish to assure the public and parents that really sick children should use the ambulance or go to their regional hospital where we will go to retrieve the really sick children and bring them to Dublin.  This type of model has saved lives in other systems.   </p></speech>

At other times it does not make a difference as it is easy to reach the required destination.  As has been mentioned, the M50 is always extremely overcrowded at peak times and sometimes it is virtually impassable.  Some people even refer to it as a carpark in the morning and evening peak times.  If anything goes wrong, the M50 gets blocked for quite a while.  </p> <p>  We must aim to provide the highest quality and most extensive services at the one location, in so far as is possible, in order to ensure there is a service available to patients and their families.</p></speech>

That is a major issue, but Mr. Pollock might elaborate on another matter.  Has there been any mention of families and accommodation facilities?  It is an issue that has come up.  I remember many years ago having to contact people in Dublin who were building houses to consider allowing a family to use a house for a period of time.  We are down to this.  Has any thought been given to families and accommodation facilities and the broader issues involved in construction?</p></speech>

We had a family forum which was made up of family representatives.  Many of those who have presented to the committee as members of the Connolly for Kids Hospital Group actually sat with us in designing the hospital.  As such, we have engaged in meeting the requirements of families.  From a family perspective, there are single rooms which will contain a bed for a parent to sleep comfortably with a child.  In addition, there will be a family lounge within what we call "dressing gown distance" of the critical care units, including ICU and the neo-natal intensive care unit, which, because they tend to work on a 24/7 basis, can be noisy, particularly because there are ventilated patients.  The family lounge will include 28 bedrooms, as well as a seating area, a kitchen area and showers in order that predominantly mothers but parents can stay within dressing gown distance of critically ill children.  The planning application also included a 53-bed family accommodation unit adjacent to the front door of the children's hospital.  That is where the Ronald McDonald House will be located.  Ronald McDonald House has long experience in Dublin at Crumlin hospitaL, as well as internationally, in accommodating families who stay overnight or must travel long distances.  Currently, there are 16 such beds available; therefore, 53 beds represents a significant increase.  We receive requests for accommodation in Dublin in the children's hospitals and have matched that demand and planned for it.  We intend to deliver these services.</p> <p>  One of the things at which we are looking in collaboration with Dublin City Council is what the accommodation around the hospital needs to be like more generally.  There should be accommodation for key workers.  I have worked in London and the USA where one was able to find an apartment near a hospital.  We have not previously looked at this issue in the design of cities to support really big developments such as the planned campus at St. James's Hospital.  We are looking at general accommodation needs which require to be met to support a campus of this size.</p></speech>

As our remit is to design, build and equip the hospital, the skill set on the board reflects this.  We have Mr. Tom Costello who was CEO of Sisk, the largest builder in the country; procurement expertise from the Office of Government Procurement; an architect from Northern Ireland, Mr. John Cole, who was the chief architect for the Northern Ireland health service; and financial services, contracts and legal expertise.  It is very much a board that was assembled with a fixed remit to deliver a hospital from start to finish.  We were asked if we had looked at equipping the hospital.  We absolutely have.  We have appointed a dedicated team of four people and have lists of all the equipment that will be provided in the hospital - from desks, beds, imaging and theatre equipment to X-ray machines.  It is on our procurement list and we are advancing with these plans.  They have been put out to tender.</p> <p>  We were asked to elaborate on the provision of green spaces.  We have four acres of green space in total on the campus.  There are multiple gardens.  From the point of view of parents and children, it is within that oval, a garden that is longer than Croke Park, in the middle of which we have what we call a biome in order that, even on a wet day, one will be able to sit in that space and look out on the garden.  It is very sheltered because the in-patient wards will surround it.  Staff, families and patients will be able to go there and it is big enough to be segregated.  Children who are immuno-suppressed and cannot go out with the other children will be able to use the segregated areas.  At ground level, we will have what we call our "meadow garden" which will be open to everybody, including the public and local residents, and which will be over an acre in size.  On the southern boundary where the Luas line runs, there will be a linear park which are creating as part of the development.  The Luas stop at Rialto is 30 m from the front door of the hospital and there will be another garden located there.  The three-storey finger buildings out towards the South Circular Road will feature internal courtyards.  We are very conscious of our neighbours across the road, which is why the buildings will not be too high.  The courtyards will be accessible to out-patients who want some fresh air and to get out of the hospital environment.  On the third floors of the buildings, there will be break-out spaces for staff.  If one needs a break from the hospital, one will have a quiet space where one will be able to take a cup of coffee and sit.  In total, four acres of green space will be provided on the campus.</p></speech>

Mr. Conall Boland is deputy chairperson; Ms Loretta Lambkin, chief officer; Ms Rachel Kenny, director of planning; Mr. Gerard Egan, director of corporate affairs; and Mr. Chris Clarke, secretary to the board.</p> <p>  In 2015 An Bord Plean&aacute;la saw a 9% increase in case intake.  As there has been a similar increase so far in 2016, there has been a small upturn in the numbers of cases before us.  In the same period in 2015 we had an 80% compliance rate with the statutory period of 18 weeks across all case types.  The average time for a decision to be made across all cases was 16.9 weeks.  For normal planning appeals, we had an 83% compliance rate, with the average time for a decision to be made being 15.1 weeks.  I apologise for all of the figures, but in An Bord Plean&aacute;la we live on them.  Certain case types and individual very complex cases took longer, some a good deal longer, than that to decide, but the majority of cases are decided on time.</p> <p>  In 2015 we introduced a new initiative, Project Freeflow, to clear the simpler cases, small housing developments and that type of case, out of the system as quickly as we could, with an internal objective of meeting a 14 week turnaround time in dealing with less complex cases.  It was a pilot project and we dealt with 218 such cases in 2015.  We have a set of criteria, a kind of triage system, for deciding which cases can be dealt with under that system and achieved a figure of 78% in meeting the internal objective of having a turnaround time of 14 weeks.  There is no diminution in the level of assessment or decision making in these cases; they just move faster through the system.  We considered it would be in the interests of householders in making relatively small applications or appeals and ours to decide them quickly.  The initiative is being continued in 2016 and we hope to see good results.  It has helped us to bring down our average turnaround time per week.  In 2007 we were dealing with over 6,500 appeals and applications.  This figure has gone down this year to between approximately 2,100 and 2,300.  There is an upturn.  However, we do not expect it to go back up to 6,000 but believe it will increase.  </p> <p>  In 2015 more than 60% of cases involved residential developments, while 169 involved retail developments.  We dealt with retail utilities - energy infrastructure, water and other developments.  Even though residential developments account for a huge percentage of applications and appeals, some of the other cases are very complex and take up a lot of time.  Under the residential heading, in 2015 householder developments - small extensions to existing houses - accounted for approximately one third of the work.  The next heading was single houses, urban and rural, including single infill houses, followed by multiple residential - two plus.  That is the profile of the cases we dealt with in 2015. </p> <p>  We have a strategic infrastructure development division of the board and in 2007 the Planning and Development (Strategic Infrastructure) Act 2006 gave new powers to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to act as a one-stop-shop, with direct application of certain cases to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  These cases are set out in the Schedules to the Act.  We have to decide whether a case qualifies as a strategic infrastructure development.  When it is approved, the application is made directly to the board.  There is no appeal allowed against a board decision in these cases, except a judicial review which is allowed for in all cases.  Pre-application consultations are provided for in these cases also.  Many of them require an environmental impact assessment and an appropriate assessment under the habitats directive.  These directives are very important.  Environmental issues have become more important in planning, particularly in the context of implementation of EU directives.  The strategic infrastructure development cases are often very high profile and can be controversial.  They generally attract a lot of public participation and, in general, an oral hearing is held.  Their complexity makes it extremely difficult to achieve an 18 week target, particularly when an oral hearing is held which can take two to three weeks.  The inspector must then assimilate not only the written material he or she has received but also what he or she has heard at the oral hearing and assess and evaluate it.  These cases generally take a few board meetings to go through.  There is a lot of information involved in them.</p><p>In order to analyse and evaluate it etc., we spend much time on them.  It is extremely difficult to do it within 18 weeks and those are the kinds of cases that are taking the longer times.</p><p> I said the Act started in 2007 and we have done a total of 85 strategic infrastructure cases since.  The document outlines the break-out of the type of cases we have done in the past two years, 2015 and 2016, and there is a chart giving a little more detail on that.  There were seven strategic infrastructure development wind farms coming before us in those two years.  Wind farms usually go to a local authority and to us on appeal, so we can see wind farms in two different ways.  We had two very significant port developments, electricity developments and three major hospitals.  We had the redevelopment of Dublin and Ringaskiddy ports, which are two extremely large developments, and both of which were granted by the board.  We also dealt with the National Rehabilitation Hospital in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, a forensic mental health services hospital in Portrane, a number of wind farms and the significant case of the children's hospital at the St. James's Hospital campus.  Although there are not that many cases, they take up much time and effort between the inspectorate and the board.</p><p> I will move to housing development.  In one of the first slides seen by the committee, it was indicated that almost 60% of the An Bord Plean&aacute;la case load consists of housing development.  As I said, they consist of householder developments and single house developments, both urban and rural, along with multi-unit developments.  In recent years, the majority have been householder and single house cases, and there has been very little big development going on.  We all know that.  There were very few significant multi-unit developments.  When we see multi-unit developments, which we categorise as over 30 units, they are prioritised for attention in the board and generally get decided within the timeframe.  They are tagged when they are received and they go through pretty quickly.</p><p> There is a graph demonstrating fairly starkly the way in which the planning appeals for residential units above 30 have gone in the past few years.  At the height of the economic boom in 2007, there were 568 developments over 30 units and by 2013, that had gone down to 19.  In the past couple of years we have begun to see a small rise in those multi-unit developments of more than 30 units.  It went from 35 in 2014 to 60 in 2015 and already this year we have 66.  Many of those came in the second and third quarter of the year.  We are beginning to see more development in that area.</p><p> Staying focused on housing, there is a slide on housing developments with more than 100 units.  The committee knows this type of development will be the subject of the new legislation that is going through, and I will come to that in a moment.  The total number of appeals received in 2016 for these was 15 and our average time for decision on those was 19.2 weeks.  In 12 of the 15 cases, we met our statutory objective of 18 weeks and with one of the other three, we came in a day over the 18-week period.  The other two were significantly complex cases with very significant planning history attaching to them and significant connections with other difficult cases with significant planning history.  They were just difficult cases and they went beyond the 18 weeks.  In general, these kinds of housing developments are relatively straightforward and the vast majority are decided on time.  We are very conscious of ensuring that is done.</p><p> I will deviate from the annual report to speak briefly in this context about Rebuilding Ireland - Action Plan for Housing and Homelessness published in July by the Minister, Deputy Coveney.  It allows for direct applications to An Bord Plean&aacute;la for large-scale housing developments and student accommodation, with no appeal apart from a judicial review of the decision.  It relates to developments of more than 100 houses, including student accommodation.  There is a connection with strategic infrastructure development, which is a similar type of legislation but for much more complex development.</p><p> In what is proposed for housing, the committee has seen and discussed the general scheme.  It will have seen that there is a mandatory pre-application consultation with the local authority before An Bord Plean&aacute;la is ever involved.  There is then a pre-application process led by An Bord Plean&aacute;la, with the developer and the local authority, and that is to be complete within nine weeks.  As I stated, the planning application comes directly to An Bord Plean&aacute;la at that point.  Submissions from the public, the planning authority and prescribed authorities are taken at that point in the usual way.  All the submissions and application documents etc. are assessed by an inspector and a board decision must issue within 16 weeks of receipt of the application.  It is very tight but we will establish a strategic housing division that is required in the legislation.  We are putting together a special housing team within the board to deal with the applications, so they will get immediate attention.</p><p> We have been assured the necessary resources will be forthcoming.  We have been discussing the mechanics and practicalities of the implementation.  We know we will need some extra resources and we have been assured we will get them.  We are confident that will happen.  We are happy to take on this work and ensure efficient decision making in this regard, dealing with what is a housing crisis.</p><p> To return to the annual report, between 2015 and 2016 four strategic development zones were approved by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  That provides a significant quantum of planning permissions for residential development with commercial and mixed-use areas.  We conducted a look-back earlier in the year at all the strategic development zones we dealt with since that legislation was introduced.  From what we can see, we think they work well.  It gives an opportunity for better-quality coherent built environments delivering sustainability.  There is potential to deliver a really high-quality built environment, and it is something that should be encouraged.</p><p> I will change tack and speak about the legal challenges we face arising from our decisions, although this is contained in our annual report as well.  Planning is very litigious and it gets great interest from the public.  In the almost 40 years of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's existence, more than 700 of its decisions have been challenged in the courts.  The reason is because the development of infrastructure in particular at this stage is often very controversial among the public.  Traditionally, we have had ordinary planning appeals to do with housing, residential development etc.  The increased complexity of environmental legislation arising from European Union directives and the European Court of Justice case law, as well as national case law decisions, all give more scope for making legal challenges.  This means we have a developing legal framework because of case law.  We had a very significant court judgment in late 2014 to do with a wind farm.  I will not go into the details but it meant that a number of wind farms that were in front of us had to be delayed while we sought further information to comply with the court judgment.  In some ways, the way in which the law develops is a moving target.</p><p> There is also the implementation of the Aarhus Convention.</p><p>It gives rights for public participation in environmental decision-making.  We think including special cost rules in the legislation has also increased the number of judicial reviews that have been taken.</p><p> The graphic in the presentation shows the number of judicial reviews per annum against our caseload.  In 2008, we had almost 6,000 appeals and 45 judicial reviews were taken.  In contrast, in 2014, when we did not even have 2,000 cases, we had 42 judicial reviews.  I put it down to the environmental, to a large extent, the Aarhus provisions in the cost rules, the greater interest that people are taking and the knowledge those in communities have about their rights and all of that.  The blue column in the graph in the presentation shows that at the end of September 2016, we had 35 cases already.  It looks like we will be close to, if not at, the same level as 2014.  It looks like a high number.  There are costs attaching to that, and there is a slide with our breakdown of costs.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la spends approximately 11% of its expenditure on legal cases.</p><p> The bulk of our decisions are upheld.  A graph in the presentation shows the results of proceedings in the High Court for 2015, when 15 decisions were upheld and one was not.  There are all sorts of other decisions, such as orders being quashed.  Sometimes we can concede a case, generally on a technical issue, and sometimes appellants withdraw cases.  Some years are better than others, but in general, looking back over a number of years, the vast majority of our decisions are upheld.</p><p> All the accounts are in the annual report, but I will give the committee a flavour of them.  Our total income in 2015 was &euro;20.8 million.  It can be seen how that has developed.  Our income decreased from 2011 onwards.  We had some increase in 2015, some of which was to do with investment in an ICT project that we have running at present and for which we were funded by the then Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, now the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.</p><p> Legal fees amount to 11.4% of our total expenditure in 2015.  Most of our expenditure is on salaries, PRSI and superannuation.  Approximately 10% is spent on establishment expenses.  We use consultants for various issues, mostly to do with casework.  These are all listed at the back of the report.  Sometimes we need to bring in an ecologist or different professionals, such as those with an engineering specialism, and that is what that is about.</p><p> An organisational review of An Bord Plean&aacute;la was established in 2015 by the then Minister, Deputy Kelly, and that report was published in March 2016.  The report acknowledged the excellent reputation for independence and impartiality of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and recommended ways of enhancing that.  It put forward a broad change agenda for the organisation to ensure what it called a fit-for-purpose organisation - the then Minister asked them to design something for a fit-for-purpose organisation - in meeting present and future challenges.  We are in the process of putting together an implementation plan to take forward the key recommendations, and that is in preparation.</p><p> A number of actions we had identified are progressing.  There is an overview group, composed of the Department and ourselves, which is overseeing the implementation of the key recommendations.  That will report to the Minister at some stage.</p><p> When the review was put in place, we put off developing a new strategy for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, which was due, on the basis that we would like to see what was in the review and use it to inform that new strategy.  We will get that under way within the next month.</p><p> A transformational change has been going on in the organisation, from a paper-based system which we have always had for the 40 years of our existence to a new digital platform.  We, like many public service organisations, have embraced that.  We made significant progress on the implementation of that major upgrade.  The project, which we call "Plean IT" is to deliver an efficient, IT-enabled organisation providing a fully digital service for the public, including online submission of cases, payment of fees and review of documentation.  It will be a complete transformation.  As it stands, if a person wants to look at a file in An Bord Plean&aacute;la, he or she has to come into the board's offices in Marlborough Street.  Once this project is fully rolled out, such a person will be able to do that from his or her own PC, laptop or whatever.  That will be a significant change.  People will also be able to make applications and appeals and submit other documentation online and pay their fees.  Clearly, it is a major project and the organisation is fully engaged in the change initiatives that are required to make that happen.</p><p> Although we think we are a fit-for-purpose organisation given that we produce good, robust planning decisions that are upheld in the courts, the challenges we have to be a fit-for-purpose organisation relate to doing it in a new way.  We have to maintain our reputation for integrity, fairness and transparency.  That is the key aspect for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and will be our number one objective.  We must make robust planning decisions in light of the increased levels of complexity.  We have to ensure the continuity and consistency at decision-making level because everybody - the public, the local authorities who are the planning authorities, and others - depends on that.  We also have to ensure the appropriate resources and necessary skill sets are available to us.  We are in ongoing talks with the Department about that.  We have to deal with increased caseloads and priority housing applications in a timely manner.  We have to take on this new housing legislation and make it work.  We have to deliver this ICT project to provide a modern digital customer service.  In the middle of all that change, we have to keep our performance going and ensure we continue to meet our SOPs and our objective of dealing with at least 80% of cases within 18 weeks.</p><p> I acknowledge the huge amount of work that the staff in An Bord Plean&aacute;la put in to the results in 2015.  Every member of staff in An Bord Plean&aacute;la contributed to it.  This is not something the board or any particular part of the organisation did on its own.  It was a whole-team effort.  I acknowledge that in putting our annual report before the committee.</p></speech>

I very much welcome such detail in her presentation.  A number of my questions are answered within that already.  The streamlining processes that she has gone through are very much welcomed and appreciated.  There are a number of questions.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.514" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1379" speakername="Victor Boyhan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016102700002#D00300"><p>I welcome Dr. Kelly and her team.  I am familiar with the board's work.  I have been engaged in planning appeals from time to time and, in fairness, I have been fairly happy with the outcomes.</p> <p>  I want to go through the two documents that were presented to us, namely, Dr. Kelly's opening statement on behalf of the board and her PowerPoint presentation which I took the time to look at in advance of attending the meeting.</p> <p>  Our Library and Research Service had all the back issues of An Bord Plean&aacute;la's annual report but the people there said they had not received a hard copy for the past three years.  I accept the world has moved on, and Dr. Kelly spoke of IT and paper.  If Dr. Kelly has a few spare hard copies for the Library here, three or four Members were looking for them yesterday.  Clearly, they wanted to see them.  Someone sent me a copy today.  I am one of these hard copy Members.  I recognise Dr. Kelly's comments in this regard but she might consider that.</p> <p>  I have looked at An Bord Plean&aacute;la's accounts.  They are always well presented and I am not going to get into that too much.</p><p>I am more concerned about the action plan for housing and homelessness.  We cannot presume that this legislation will all go through.  There is a summary proposal for legislation and a scheme has been published.  It may vary.  There are mixed messages coming from different political quarters.</p><p> An Bord Plean&aacute;la's website states that the planning process provides a comprehensive appeals process and yet we have heard Dr. Kelly say there would be no appeals on a number of matters, which greatly concerns me.  I am very conscious of the role of local government practitioners and local authority members in empowering and engaging citizens.  That is why there is such great activity in the planning process.  That is a weakness, but it is not An Bord Plean&aacute;la's fault.  It is political.</p><p> I seek clarification on some of Dr. Kelly's comments.  The presentation refers to a general scheme of a Bill as published which includes provisions for the direct application of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  There is reference to the time constraint.  Dr. Kelly said she was confident about having resources.  How confident is she?  What is the commitment on resources?</p><p> In winding up, Dr. Kelly spoke about An Bord Plean&aacute;la's ambitious IT project, which is great.  Until that is operational, however, it is not acceptable that citizens have to travel on a bus or train from west County Cork to Marlborough Street to look at hard copy files.  It is not a problem for me because I live in D&uacute;n Laoghaire, but other people have to travel to the board's offices.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la should have these files online where people can view them and consider them.  Dr. Kelly spoke about the Aarhus Convention and she clearly knows that it provides for a citizen to be allowed engage in a process.  People will be denied engagement in a process until An Bord Plean&aacute;la has its IT and digital hub operational.  That is a real weakness.  I want to be helpful.  Perhaps Dr. Kelly could highlight this genuine concern to the Minister and ask for resources to do that.</p><p> Dr. Kelly spoke about being fair and getting third party appeals, which echoes what I am saying.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will not get third party appeals on the housing scheme.  How does Dr. Kelly square that with fairness and equal access to the planning process?  She has confirmed that there will not be a third party appeals process, something I knew.  We need that.</p><p> Dr. Kelly spoke about the funding.  Let us hear about that.  We know An Bord Plean&aacute;la is missing deadlines for critical infrastructure.  In one case which is dear to my heart - I will not mention it here - the board has missed three deadlines.  Despite people attending a board oral hearing a year ago, we have heard that only in September of this year did the report from the An Bord Plean&aacute;la inspector go to its board.  That needs to be explained.</p><p> Dr. Kelly also needs to explain why her inspectors are being overruled by her board.  There have been very complex and detailed submissions by very competent and able inspectors, and yet Dr. Kelly's board has overridden their decisions.  That has not been adequately explained to the public.  I have been involved in some of these and I cannot understand the rationale of a board of people.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la needs to open up.  Transparency was one of Dr. Kelly's key words.  If the board is overriding its very able and competent inspectors, Dr. Kelly needs to explain that fully to the public to instil confidence.</p><p> I understand there is to be a scaling back of oral hearings.  Currently, people can appeal to the board.  Ultimately, it is the prerogative of the board, it can decide, that is the scheme, which is fair enough, and I do not have a difficulty with that.  There is some suggestion, however, that oral hearings would be used very sparingly.  There is an issue there and I would like Dr. Kelly to clarify it.</p><p> Dr. Kelly spoke about the 18-week period and efficiencies.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is not meeting its 18-week target.  As it stands, the board is taking on additional work and I presume, therefore, it will have additional staff.  Will some planners be seconded to the board from local authorities, as has been suggested to me?  I would be opposed to that, as is the Irish Planning Institute.</p><p> On this issue of IT, I commend the former Minister, Deputy Kelly, who commissioned this report which made recommendations.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is to agree a strategy and this committee should be kept informed on that.  I fully acknowledge the independence, impartiality, expertise and professionalism of the board, which is exceptional.  However, An Bord Plean&aacute;la's communication of its decisions is weak.</p><p> On the IT platform, I want the board to consider this.  The members do not necessarily have to respond today.  In terms of exercising democracy, the planning process provides for a comprehensive appeals process.  However, people cannot even make an intervention if they have no access to the material, the drawings and other information.  We see a deficit in some local authorities that do not even have colour copiers and colour printers for maps and graphs.  Until An Bord Plean&aacute;la's IT system is operational and available to everybody, including every planning authority, the board is not in a position to proceed with having some kind of fast-tracked centralised planning system in Marlborough Street.</p><p> I thank the witnesses for coming in.  I am greatly interested in their work.  This is a weakness and it should be highlighted to the Minister.  More important, Dr. Kelly has said she is confident she will get the necessary resources.  I ask her to outline to us the commitments she has.  It is also our job to impress on the Minister to resource An Bord Plean&aacute;la fully.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.516" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1357" speakername="Pat Casey" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016102700002#E00200"><p>I thank Dr. Kelly and the rest of the delegation for coming in this morning.</p> <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has achieved 80% compliance on the decision-making process.  What are Dr. Kelly's views on having mandatory time limits from now on?  Even though it achieved 80% compliance, 400 cases were not decided within that timeframe.  It is important that we move to a time-bound process.</p> <p>  Given the lack of legislation on wind energy development, what is the importance of the wind energy strategy in individual county development plans to An Bord Plean&aacute;la's decision-making process?</p> <p>  County Wicklow has a number of very small quarries and the new regulation requiring an environmental impact statement, EIS, and appropriate other assessments is making them almost unviable.  We are shutting them down, in effect.  We will need this stone from somewhere at some stage.  Much of this may have been driven for Europe where there are much larger quarries.  Can anything be done in this regard?  In one serious case, Wicklow County Council granted permission for a quarry.  It was appealed to the board, which refused it.  Now Wicklow County Council is being sued for loss of earnings by that company.  Where is this all going?</p> <p>  Further to what the Senator said, do the witnesses have statistics for the number of occasions on which the board has overruled the decisions of inspectors?</p> <p>  The most important matter before us at the moment is the fast-track planning process.  I also have some reservations as to whether this is fast-tracking.  Dr. Kelly has said she has been told that the resources will be forthcoming.  However, are the resources available?  Are there people with appropriate qualifications available in Ireland?</p> <p>  Dr. Kelly mentioned the nine-week pre-planning process, which is time bound and which is fantastic.  However, there is another pre-planning process prior to that within the local authorities.  In a recent presentation from departmental officials, we were informed that it is taking 28 weeks on average.  If we add 28 weeks to what is being presented here at the moment, we are not far away from where we were.  As part of that, an environmental impact assessment or Natura 2000 assessment may be required.  I am not sure if I am reading it correctly.  Is the board requesting an additional eight weeks to make a decision on whether that pre-planning application will need an EIS or an EIA?  After that, if it is in a Natura 2000 site, it needs a further eight weeks.</p><p>Is that only to tell the applicant that these assessments are needed?  If not, what is the purpose of it?  In that case, we are adding another 16 weeks onto the whole process.  I have concerns about whether we are actually fast-tracking the process when some of these issues are not quite clear.  The pre-planning around local authorities is not time-bound and, therefore, that period could go on forever.  The Minister says that it is important that we get quality in the application process.  I do not fully understand from reading the heads how that is determined and what the process is.  Is it in the pre-planning process?  If one gets an application through the pre-planning process with the board, can it then be turned down in the application process because it is a poor application?  If that is the case, there is something wrong there.</p><p> The Senator also honed in on the issue of public consultation.  One aspect of the heads is a material contravention of a county development plan or a local area plan.  Normally that would have nearly two stages of public consultation at local level.  From what I am reading, it will only have one stage of public consultation if it is in the fast-track planning process.  This would be in the case of a site that is not zoned.  At least in the case of a zoned site, it goes through a development plan process and then a public process.  I am worried about public consultation in the fast-track process.</p><p> I have an observation to make.  Are we actually too concerned about the number of houses that we are building in the planning process as opposed to creating sustainable communities moving forward?  Maybe we should have a more balanced emphasis on that.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.519" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1303" speakername="Dessie Ellis" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016102700002#F00300"><p>I thank Dr. Kelly for her presentation and her staff for coming before the committee.  There are a few things I wish to ask.  I notice that An Bord Plean&aacute;la generally tries to make a decision on an application in 15 or 16 weeks.  The one thing that stood out was the number of wind farm applications that were receiving refusals.  I know that may be down to the court case and the court judgement, but there certainly seems to be many of them judging by the presentation Dr. Kelly made.</p> <p>  Increasingly, members have residents coming to us and asking about the judicial review process.  We all tell them that it is a very costly affair and that they cannot afford to deal with it.  That is a big problem.  Do we have a rough idea of what a judicial review costs?  I know it probably depends and varies, but I would like to get a rough idea.  We have had some cases in which people have been requesting it.  I had not experienced a case before in which the local authority refused a planning application but the developer appealed it to An Bord Plean&aacute;la and received the permission to go ahead.  Are there many cases of that where An Bord Plean&aacute;la grants the appeal that had been refused by the local authority?  I am curious because I had not experienced it before.  I am thinking of the Lanesborough case up in Fingal where the old castle was on the edge of Finglas.  It caught a lot of residents by surprise.  They thought that they had managed to stop the development and suddenly it was appealed successfully by the developer.  I am curious as to whether there are many such applications and decisions being made.</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have a view on the fast-tracking of the housing planning process?  Do they agree with it?  I am not asking them to go against the Minister, but it is something that has been very much set in stone that the process goes through the local authority and other stages.  Now the process will bypass many of those stages.  While we all agree with trying to deliver housing quickly, we would want to be very careful that we do not give people the opportunity to appeal and get their way.  Once An Bord Plean&aacute;la makes a decision, what is left for the citizen?  It is only a judicial review, which is very costly.  I believe that will be a bone of contention for many people.</p> <p>  I am interested in the use of environmental impact assessments on large developments and the EU rules attached to them.  Does An Bord Plean&aacute;la find them very time-consuming in their consultation?  They seem to drag on for a long time.  They require consultation and it probably sucks up many resources in terms of time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.520" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1385" speakername="Grace O'Sullivan" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016102700002#F00400"><p>I thank Dr. Kelly for coming before the committee.  I have a few questions.  Senator Boyhan brought up the question of transparency.  It does seem to be a weakness, particularly in the area of the strategic infrastructure development, that the public does not seem to be able to access information in a timely fashion to be able to make an input.  As Senator Boyhan says, that people have to come from rural Ireland to Dublin is not efficient or acceptable in this day and age.  An online facility would be very useful.  In its absence, transparency is a concern.</p> <p>  I have a question about the multi-unit developments.  What is the process for developments that are currently idle to be re-activated and to come back into supply?  I consulted some people prior to the meeting and the strongest reaction I received was to the fast-tracking of the developments of 100 units or more.  There is real concern among the public about the fast-tracking.  Of course, we recognise there is a housing crisis.  However, there are concerns already among the public.  That comes back to the issue of transparency and people having the information in order that they are not jumping to the conclusions that are often put out by the media, which can be misleading.  How will An Bord Plean&aacute;la provide notice to citizens of any proposed development plans in excess of 100 units?  What will happen to the site notice?  Is that something that will be of the past?   In terms of universal design, how will developments of 100 units or more take regard of age and disability?  Will that be a part of the process if everything is being rolled out at a rapid pace?  Does Dr. Kelly anticipate hiccups in the process?  What weaknesses can she identify that might impede the process?</p> <p>  We have heard talk about the planning regulator.  Has Dr. Kelly been in contact with the Minister about the planning regulator position?  What will be the role of An Bord Plean&aacute;la in the appointment of the planning regulator?  In Dr. Kelly's presentation, she spoke about four strategic development zones, SDZs.  What is happening with the area on the north side of the river in Waterford?  I do not know if that is an acceptable question.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses and thank Dr. Kelly for her presentation.  I acknowledge what has been said by previous speakers, much of which I agree with and I await the response of the witnesses in that regard.</p> <p>  The witnesses are well aware that we are in the midst of a housing crisis.  I would go so far as to say it is an emergency.  There is much talk and debate about new legislation to deal with the need in this area.  As stated by previous speakers, it needs to be focused but balanced with built-in reviews and sunset periods in order that we, as legislators, can evaluate the strength or weaknesses associated with the efforts being made collectively by us all to address this huge crisis, which is the greatest single crisis facing the economy and society.  We know this from our constituency clinics.</p> <p>  It is our job to ensure that An Bord Plean&aacute;la is focused but balanced and to ensure it plays its part in responding to this crisis.  For example, in regard to the legislation to fast-track planning in respect of projects comprising over 100 units, I agree with the thrust of that, although there are elements of it that need to analysed and debated by the Oireachtas with a view to improving it.  My biggest concern in that regard, among other things, pertains to the ability of An Bord Plean&aacute;la to meet the expectation that will be placed upon it.  Does An Bord Plean&aacute;la have the necessary personnel and resources to enable it to meet the demands that will be placed on it?  I agree with those demands.  I am happy to see that there is provision for a statutory period within which the board must make a decision.</p> <p>  I want to respect the wishes of the Chairman and so I will not mention specific cases, but the witnesses will be well aware of a case involving Bord na M&oacute;na that has been put back twice now and in respect of which the High Court has said that if there is no decision by January, it will be in the negative.  That will have huge implications for my constituency and the greater midlands region and for Bord na M&oacute;na and the 1,200 people employed by it.  We are speaking about an area of Bord na M&oacute;na's business that is the only one that is profitable despite the fact that there are commitments to-----</p></speech>

This, to me, proves there is a lack of capacity to deliver decisions.  That is only one example.  There are many others.  I apologise for having mentioned that one but the witnesses will understand the gravity of the situation and the impact it could have on those I represent and who have given me the privilege to be here.</p> <p>  I am equally concerned, and rightly so, about the growing number of representations being made to me by people who are at their wits' end in relation to their being able to find a home into the future.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has as much of a role to play as the rest of us.  Great expectations will be placed upon it in the context of this legislation and possibly other legislation to address this crisis.  I am conscious of the fact that we have area-based plans, county plans, regional plans and spatial strategies to which An Bord Plean&aacute;la must have regard when dealing with appeals but none of those were designed at a time or in a space such as that in which we find ourselves now.  That worries me.  I do not think An Bord Plean&aacute;la can appropriately deal with the crisis while having regard to plans that are years old and do not take account of the current emergency.  For this reason, I would have preferred the establishment of an authority to bring forward emergency legislation to allow for a period of suspension of many of these items to allow houses to be built.  Ultimately, that it is what has to be done.  We can talk all day long about the provisions in the Finance Bill but that is a demand solution to a supply problem.  There is a need for a holistic approach by the Houses of the Oireachtas by way of emergency legislation to provide for a period of suspension of those plans to allow address of this problem, in respect of which we can all stand back in two or three years' time and suffer the consequences or accept the plaudits in terms of whether it has failed or succeeded.</p></speech>

In 2007-08 over 500 multi-applications were made to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  This year, only 65 or 68 applications were made.  Is it the case that the majority of applications in respect of projects of over 100 units would always end up with An Bord Plean&aacute;la anyway?  If Dr. Kelly does not have that information today she might forward it to the committee.</p> <p>  I fully respect what members have said today but I am supportive of fast-tracking the planning process for many reasons.  Local members do have a role to play in planning decisions in the context of local area plans and development plans but where an application goes through the proper statutory process with the local government, councillors do not have a role, except to air the concerns of their constituents, which they will still be able to do at their meetings.  I recognise that we have to tease out that issue further and, perhaps, to amend that  process slightly.</p> <p>  I also acknowledge that as mentioned by Deputy Cowen, we need a focused and balanced approach but much of the action plan in terms of Rebuilding Ireland is around rebuilding supply.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la will have a huge role to play in that regard.  I would like to hear more detail around the type of resources that will be required.  I fully respect that the witnesses cannot reference any planning application or any locations mentioned here and I do not expect specific answers in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.530" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016102700002#G00600"><p>I thank members for their questions, to which I will try to respond.  If we have not sent hard copies - I think we did - to the Library, we will send them in the next few days.  We will certainly do that in respect of the years for which they are missing.  A number of questions have been asked and so if I do not answer specific ones members might come back to me on them.</p> <p>  In regard to the Chairman's question about the 100-plus unit applications, approximately 60% of them are appealed to An Bord Plean&aacute;la currently.  In other words, 60% of the 100-plus projects go through the planning authority and then come before An Bord Plean&aacute;la on appeal.  In the vast majority of cases, the local authority decision is upheld by An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  In respect of the recent past, they are the figures.  </p> <p>  On resources, we have an expert planning inspectorate in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Ms Rachel Kenny is the director of planning.  She is a very experienced director.  We have good expertise such that I think setting up an emergency organisation to deal with planning and some of the other things suggested is probably not a good idea.  We are happy to offer our expertise to help in this regard.  We immediately said to the Department that we will play our part but we cannot do so within our current resource base.  We have put together a plan, which is outside of our current workforce plan but will be contained in the 2017 workforce plan that all public sector authorities are required to produce.  We have looked in detail at the projections for the next two years in terms of numbers.  We do not know the number in that regard but we have some estimates, in respect of which we have sought sanction from the Department for a certain number of staff members.  The Department came back to us recently asking us to formalise that.</p><p>The process of looking for the staff to do the work is in train.  I say I am confident we will get them because we have been told we will.  That is as confident as I am about it.  That is as confident as anybody in the public sector can be about staffing.  I believe we will get them.  We intend to put experienced people in a housing group within An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  Some of the new staff we will get may well be in that group, but it is likely that it will consist of existing experienced staff.  That will allow us to start this process with an experienced panel of inspectors.</p><p> Housing applications can be big, but they are generally not that complex.  They are not as complex as those involving strategic infrastructure developments.  They generally do not necessitate an environmental impact assessment or involve appropriate assessment issues.  There is no question of projects being brought forward on anything other than zoned land.  As far as I know, that is what the legislation is designed for.  We will not be doing anything outside it.  The public and the local authority will already have gone through the planning stages informed by the county development plan and the local area plan.</p><p> While we are very conscious that this is a different scheme, it is similar to the strategic infrastructure development scheme in the way it will run.  Anyone who has an interest in one of these schemes, including any member of the public, can make submissions to the board.  Submissions are treated very seriously by the inspectors.  That part of the process is working very well in the case of strategic infrastructure development schemes.  I do not think people believe their detailed submissions are not heard, even if they might not like the decisions made at times.  Although the legislation is written in a way that does not allow for appeals, An Bord Plean&aacute;la staff will be very conscious that the board is the court of final appeal to a certain extent.  We will be very conscious of the need to look at what people say, as we are in strategic infrastructure development cases and others.</p><p> We think we can do this within the very tight timeframe provided for, but we have not tried this before.  I cannot say for sure there will be no glitches.  We are certainly planning to provide the resources we need to deal with it in a very structured way.  We want to ensure not only that housing developments will ultimately be granted permission, but also that the process will be fair and transparent and could result in planning permission being granted or refused, depending on the quality of what is requested.  The developments will receive the same independent and fair assessment as any other housing or other development.  If it is a good development and meets everything that needs to be met, planning permission will be granted.  If that is not the case, it will not be.  That remains the case.</p><p> When we have been considering housing developments in recent times, we have been very conscious of the design manual for urban roads and streets, the aim of which is the development of sustainable communities.  When we have been considering large housing developments and strategic development zones, we have been requiring developers to focus on sustainable communities, not just housing estates of the traditional type.  We will be demanding high quality.  We will be able to set out our concerns in that regard for developers during the pre-application process.  During the pre-planning stage we will ensure there are no major gaps in proposals in areas such as water supply and wastewater services.  For example, we will make sure traffic densities are within the county development plan guidelines and other guidelines.  Applications that tick all of these boxes should be robust.  They will still be applications at that stage and it will not be a case of pre-decision.  It will still be possible for the applications to be granted or refused, but at least we will have flagged at an early stage the concerns at which the board will be looking as it makes its decision.  We will try to meet our deadlines.</p><p> The new housing development cases will be available online from day one.  Hard copies will always be available in local authority offices and An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  It will be possible for people to access and see these details.  The system in this regard is no different from the current local system.  People will be able to see applications in local authority offices.  It will not be any different.</p><p> We do not yet know what the fees will be.  Obviously, we will discuss that matter with the Department.  I assume they will be along the same lines as the fees that apply to ordinary applications.  I do not know and cannot say as I have not seen anything on it.</p><p> I will address some of the comments made about the IT system.  We have worked for 40 years without the direct access digital platform we are to produce.  It is clear that the system is working.  Planning applications are available at local authority offices.  The whole file is also available in An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  I assure the committee that An Bord Plean&aacute;la has been one of the most transparent organisations in putting the decisions of inspectors, etc., online during the years.  It was one of the first organisations to have a proper website with this kind of information available on it.  In every single case the inspector's report, the board's direction and order are put on the website and available for everybody to see.  That has been the case for quite a number of years.  We are very conscious that many people avail of this service.  I am talking about the provision of an enhanced service, rather than the development of a new one from scratch.  There is no question of our having to stop doing things until we get the IT system ready.  We have been running the organisation very effectively for 40 years without it.</p><p> While I am on the subject of information technology and transparency, I must mention that there was a big change in 2007 for An Bord Plean&aacute;la and society as a whole when strategic infrastructure development cases started to come to us in direct applications.  At that stage, we insisted on there being a dedicated website for each such application.  We demanded that all of the documentation from the applicant's side such as plans, drawings, environmental impact statements and Natura impact statements should be available on the applicant's website.  In those days we were not in a position to host such information on An Bord Plean&aacute;la's website.  Therefore, we insisted on the applicant having a dedicated website.  A similar approach will be taken to housing applications when they come to us directly.  From day one we insisted on people being able to see applications.</p><p> When we make a decision, we are legislatively required, for reasons of transparency, to give reasons for it and address the matters to which we gave consideration.  The board does this on the face of the order.  We set out our reasons for every part of the decision.  That information is available.  Similarly, the legislation gives the board the ability to overturn the decision of an inspector in some cases.  If it does so, it has to explain why it is overturning the inspector's report.  Not only does it have to give the reasons for the decision, but in overturning an inspector's recommendation it also has to specifically address the matters to which it gave consideration and state why it has made its decision.  We have been doing this for many years and will continue to do so.  I know that people sometimes feel not enough reasons are given, particularly if the decision is not the one they wanted or were hoping for.</p><p>That issue has been the subject of many judicial reviews during the years.  I said earlier that there had been 700 reviews.  While I do not know exactly how many were about the reasons given and the matters to which consideration had been given, it was quite a lot.  Our reasoning has generally been upheld in the courts.</p><p> I heard what was said about individual cases.  I will not say anything about them, save to say large strategic infrastructure cases are extremely complex.  The environmental directives from the European Union have been put in place to protect the environment and have to be met to the letter of the law.  Many citizen groups look precisely at whether we are meeting the requirements of the directives, right down to making very detailed submissions.  They do take a long time to deal with.  In some cases we have had a court quash a decision of the board, possibly based on an EU environmental or habitats directive or an environmental impact assessment.  Frequently, when the case comes back to us, we have to look for further information to fill the gaps identified by third parties or the courts.  There is no doubt that it can take a long time to deal with them, but we do try to do so as quickly and as efficiently as we can.  Sometimes to provide the further information required an applicant can be required to engage in extra surveying for a year or two.  Nothing can come back to us until these surveys are completed.  It has added much complexity to the system.  Nevertheless, we have to remember the reason for the directives is to protect the environment and the precious resource we have available in Ireland.</p><p> Senator Grace O'Sullivan asked whether ageing and disability factors would be considered in housing provision.  The guidance in place is on a better mix of housing, which we take into account.  It involves a mix of houses and unit sizes.  That was what I was referring to in mentioning the design manual for urban roads and streets, DMURS.  When we are looking at large developments, we are looking at whether there is an appropriate mix of units, etc.  Ageing and disability factors will be taken into account.  The building control code also covers some of the specifics, including ramps, lifts, etc.  These cases can be referred to us on appeal based on building controls.  It is all part of the building regulations.</p><p> The number of inspector reports overturned was 13% last year.  The figure stays remarkably steady at between 11% and 13% every year.  The legislation allows for the board to overturn an inspector&rsquo;s report.  If we do, we have to give a reason and state the matters to which consideration was given.  There would be no need for An Bord Plean&aacute;la if we were to agree 100% with what an inspector said.  He or she could decide all cases.  However, the Oireachtas decided in its wisdom that the inspector was not to have the last word on the issue and that An Bord Plean&aacute;la would review an inspector&rsquo;s work and make the final decision.  That is precisely what we do.  It is healthy that there are some reports overturned.  Otherwise, it would be just a technical decision.</p><p> It does happen that a developer has a refusal from a local authority overturned, but it only happens in a minority of cases.  First parties have a right to appeal a decision as much as third parties do.  They can and do appeal, but the majority of original decisions are upheld.  I can get the committee specific numbers if it wants me to do so.  On occasion, we grant permission for whatever reason, but, again, we have to state the reasons for our decision.</p></speech>

We do not really have a role to get involved with the local authority, or any other party, in how they conduct their business.  When a local authority grants permission for a development, it is important that the local community stay involved until the end of the appeal period.  Clearly, a developer can appeal to An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The community can then make observations to us, as in the case of any other appeal.  It is just that the boot is on the other foot.  The community is the observer rather than the appellant.  Where people are really concerned about a development and a local authority refuses permission, they need to stay involved to ensure they will be involved in the next stage.  In general, in the cases we see, we receive observations from third parties.  In that sense, most third parties are aware of their rights and responsibilities.</p></speech>

I cannot say that enough.  If this provision goes through, the board will be facilitating the Government in fast-tracking housing developments without third party involvement.  Will Dr. Kelly clarify this?</p> <p>  An Bord Plean&aacute;la expressed a valid concern about strategic development zones.  It stated clarity was needed on who was responsible for the funding and delivery of the infrastructure, as well as the economic viability of the scheme that needed to be considered at the outset.  I am familiar with two strategic development zones which have presented this problem.  The board is dealing with strategic development zones.  In some cases, we have a local authority acting as the agent or promoter of a zone.  There needs to be greater clarity in this regard.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has identified the problem, but I have not quite heard what it is suggesting in this regard.  Will it provide more detail?</p> <p>  Who will enforce the decisions of the board?  We know from local authorities all over the country that it does not get involved in the enforcement of its decisions at local authority planning level.  It makes decisions but washes its hands of enforcing them.  In this case, it will be totally responsible for the fast-tracking process.  Applications will go directly to it and it will decide on them.  Is it committed to enforcing its own decisions?  I believe it should be.  I do not believe anyone should make a decision who does not have the power, tenacity and commitment to enforce it.</p> <p>  Who appoints the board?  Is it all political?</p><p>I seek clarity on who appoints this board.  How transparent is the appointments process of the board Dr. Kelly works with?  Will she elaborate on the way she interfaces with that appointments structure in terms of the members?  How involved is the Minister of the day in the appointment of this board?  That is another area that may need reform.  Dr. Kelly should share her experience in terms of the way the members of the current board were appointed.</p></speech>

Dr. Kelly said that if a proposed site appears to have gone through the county development process, an AA has probably been carried out on that proposed site.  Is she saying that will be adequate?  The heads of the Bill provide for an eight-week window.  I do not know whether that eight-week window is to give time to An Bord Plean&aacute;la to decide on whether an AA or an EIA is needed.  I seek clarity on that.</p> <p>  Also, must the decision of the local authority be made at the pre-planning stage before it goes to the board rather than it being left with no timeframe on it?  I would be concerned about that.  I never thought of the long-term consequences in terms of An Bord Plean&aacute;la making the decision as to who will enforce this, who will control the development contributions and the number of times a site will be inspected.  If all that falls back on the local authority, they will need some finances to fund it.</p></speech>

If An Bord Plean&aacute;la is fast-tracking the process, I assume the judicial review option is still open, even with that fast-tracking process in place.  Will Dr. Kelly give us some idea of what that would cost a citizen because it may be the only way to proceed if he or she has an objection of any description?</p></speech>

I said there is no appeal, but the third parties are heard from the very beginning of the applications process.  Third party observers will make their submissions.  The inspector will review, evaluate, assess and make a recommendation to the board.  The board will see the submissions from third parties at board meetings, but it is a one-application process.  There is no appeal to our decision, but that does not mean that third parties will not be heard.  Third parties will be heard.  They will have the opportunity to make whatever submissions they want and they will have them evaluated and assessed in the normal way.  The board will consider those alongside the application when the board is making the decision on the application.  There is no question that third party views will not be represented to the board; they will be.<br/><br/>Senator Boyhan asked about enforcement.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la is a statutory body set up under the Planning and Development Acts agreed by the Oireachtas.  It has no enforcement role whatsoever, and it never did have one.  The board was originally set up as an appellate body in the 2007 Act and began to take the direct applications on strategic infrastructure development.  The Bill is only a general scheme at the moment but we are trying to plan forward.  When the Bill is enacted it may give us these provisions to do direct applications but we do not have any enforcement function.  Planning enforcement has always been carried out by local authorities.  It has been the case for all the years of planning that the local authorities carry out the planning.  The board has no role to play in that regard.  It is not that we consciously wash our hands of anything.  We do the job we are asked to do, make the decision and move on to another decision.  It is not that we are ignoring enforcement; it is outside our <i>vires</i>to have anything to do with enforcement.<br/><br/>On the EIA side, the EIA-AA screening part in the scheme before us refers more generally to EIA and AA screening outside of housing.  It is almost a stand alone piece that is being put in with this part of the scheme.  It applies to all kinds of projects.  In terms of the scheme it is a little confusing in that it is not only applicable to houses.  The county development plan, the local area plan, LAP, and any of those high-level plans have already had strategic environmental assessment, SEA, and appropriate assessment carried out at the macro scale.  Were appropriate assessment or EIA to arise on an individual application before us, that would be one of the issues that would be flagged at the early stages.  Nobody would be coming back to the board with an application without an EIA where one was required, but it would be a big thing to have to do at that stage.  I imagine that people who are putting forward developments under this scheme and who want them decided within a fast-track area will know if they need an EIA and will do that project elsewhere.  Fast-track is for projects that are ready to be determined quickly.  It would have to have all that information to hand immediately.  If they are ready to do that and they have the EIA it can be done but otherwise, it will not.  The EIA and the AA process would involve the public being involved at the earliest stage because separate regulations apply to those under the European directive.  Those projects are almost in a separate category.<br/><br/>On the board appointments, the Planning and Development Act sets out precisely how board members and the chairperson are appointed.  To deal with the chairperson first, the chairperson is appointed following a public competition, which is run through the Public Appointments Service.  Following the competition, two or three names go to the Minister of the day, I understand the Minster proposes a name to the Cabinet and the appointment is made.  The chairperson's appointment is for a seven-year term.<br/><br/>The ordinary board members are appointed in a different way and this has been the case since the establishment of An Bord Plean&aacute;la.  The Act sets out a number of statutory nominating bodies under a number of headings such as the economic sector and so on.  I do not have the exact details but there are five or six panels and those panels consist of organisations that are either involved in the environment, the community, education and so on.  There are different panels of people.  The Act requires the Department to seek nominations from those bodies when board membership becomes available.  The nominations go to the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  They are assessed by the Department and the Minister makes the final decision on those, but the nominating bodies have different ways of deciding who to nominate.  Some of them go through interview procedures.  Engineers Ireland is one of the nominating bodies and it would usually seek expressions of interest, conduct interviews and recommend somebody on the basis of that process.  Other bodies have different processes.  An Bord Plean&aacute;la has nothing to do with it.  It is conducted by the Department under the terms of the Planning and Development Acts.</p><p>The nominating body model is meant to get a board that reflects civil society because the nominating panels are reflective of civil society.  In fairness, it has worked very well over the years.  It brings forward people with experience in various areas who are nominated by civil society to sit on the board, but the final decision rests with the Minister.</p><p> Regarding legal fees, we do not know what happens on the other side.  We do not know what costs other people are incurring.  We only know what we have to pay.  We only know third party costs if they become visible and we have to pay them.  It depends on the arrangements between the persons taking the judicial review and their legal team.  Sometimes we understand that solicitors or lawyers will take a case for people on the basis that if they win, they will get paid.  We do not really know what the fees are.  I do not know the average.  Our experience suggests there is a huge variation in arrangements and costs.  It also depends on the size of the case.  Some cases have two or three senior counsel, a few junior counsel and many other people attending.  Depending on how the case goes in the court, it could be there for one day, half a day or 16 days.  We have no control over that.  It is very difficult to come up with an average on it, so I cannot really help the Deputy on that.  It is an expensive activity.</p></speech>

One of the issues that was coming up was appeals regarding how much the section 48 scheme levy should be for SDZ housing areas.  That is not an area over which we had any jurisdiction.  Another issue that was coming up repeatedly was the provision of transport, water and rail infrastructure, who would be responsible for it and how quickly into the scheme it had to be delivered.  Another issue that was coming up was the standard of design.  Sometimes the standard of design and building in terms of energy and architecture can be even higher in an SDZ area, delivering a very high-quality product.</p> <p>  Having looked back over the schemes, it appeared to us that there was room for better alignment between, say, the central decision at government level to nominate an SDZ and the mechanisms between that at regional and local authority levels as to who would deliver the various pieces of infrastructure to make it happen and when.  What we saw in some cases was maybe a lack of alignment between the various tiers involved.  In the planning stage of an SDZ and when the commitment is being made, people should bear in mind at an early stage the economic viability of the project and that if an area is nominated as an SDZ, it seems to work better if all the people with responsibility act together and have thought through who will deliver what.  We do not have specific solutions, but people should bear that in mind when nominating.</p></speech>

In the absence of a national policy on wind energy, does An Bord Plean&aacute;la follow the county development plan policy and then quarry?  What are the witnesses' views in that regard?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-27a.557" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Mary Kelly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HP22016102700002#L01800"><p>I noted those two questions.  I am trying to figure out what I have not answered.  On reading the decisions and the board orders that come out on wind energy, it will be seen the issues to which we have regard.  We always have regard to the county development plan and we have regard to any wind energy strategy where it exists.  An important part of our considerations is the presence or absence of a wind energy strategy.  It is always taken into account.</p> <p>  Obviously, I cannot answer about any individual quarry case and I will not attempt to do so.  The legislation on the regulation of quarries is extremely complex, and any of the people working in the field of quarries to whom the Deputy has spoken will probably have told him that.  We must follow that legislation to the letter.  Quarry development has happened in Ireland in a somewhat unregulated way over the years, but the European Union has insisted that we look back and redress the deficiencies, particularly in environmental impact assessment and appropriate assessment.  There have been a series of regulations and legislation on quarries that we have had to implement.  Between us and the planning authorities, there has been an awful lot of work on this.  It is very difficult for the quarry owners as well as for us to make decisions in this regard.  It is very complex.</p></speech>

The planning regulator will exist completely separately to An Bord Plean&aacute;la, and we will not have any formal relationship with it as such.  We have not spoken to the Minister about the planning regulator, but over the years since it was mooted, we have had various discussions with the Department with responsibility for the environment, if only to tease it out in the first instance and then come to a conclusion eventually that it should be independent of An Bord Plean&aacute;la and planning authorities and should be an independent body.  That is our understanding of it.  I have no further information on it.  I think the legislation is going through the Houses at the moment but, other than that, I understand that the regulator will have some function in examining and reviewing An Bord Plean&aacute;la's systems.</p> <p>  I was asked about an SDZ in Waterford.  I can report that we do not have any application for an SDZ in Waterford so I can comment on that.  If we did, I would not be able to comment on it.</p> <p>  I have been tardy in replying to Deputy Casey.  He asked about mandatory time limits.  It has not generally been a feature of the planning Acts for An Bord Plean&aacute;la, but a statutory objective period was introduced in 1992 which has worked well so far.  We have an internal objective of meeting it 80% of the time.  There will always be cases that cannot be determined within the time because we do not have the information to determine them.  There is a mandatory time limit on this housing.  It will be the first time we have faced one.  We must put our resources into it and make sure that we meet the mandatory time limits.</p> <p>  My opinion on mandatory time limits is that they could hamper good development because if a decision has to be produced within a certain amount of time and there is not enough information to grant, something might be refused at that point which, with a little more information, could have been a good development and got through.</p></speech>
