In the interests of brevity - I understand I have about ten minutes - my opening statement will be an abbreviated version of the written statement I made to the inquiry.<br/><br/>So, by way of background, the NTMA has a number of diverse functions, all of which are clearly defined in legislation.  A common theme running through all of its functions, with the exception of its State Claims Agency, is its engagement with capital markets.  Its original mission was to fund the Exchequer borrowing requirement and manage the national debt in a cost effective manner.  This mission has been added to by various Governments over the years.  The additional function most relevant to the banking crisis was the NTMA's role as manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, NPRF, and I was the director responsible for the fund up to December 2009.  The NPRF was controlled by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission, a body corporate which was independent in how it made its investment decisions.  When I was appointed CEO of the NTMA in December 2009, I became an <i>ex officio</i>member of the commission.  The legislation governing the fund was amended in 2009 in the context of the banking crisis to enable the Minister for Finance to direct the commission to make investments in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  In reporting on the fund's investment performance, the commission clearly delineated between the performance of those investments which it had made under its own discretionary powers and the so-called discretionary investments in Bank of Ireland and ... or directed investments in Bank of Ireland and AIB.  The NTMA had no role in relation to the oversight of the banking system and no responsibility in relation to the provision of liquidity to the system.  We believed that the role of lender of last resort fell to the Central Bank and ECB.<br/><br/>2007-2008: The function of the interbank money markets became increasingly problematic through 2007, culminating in the UK in September 2007 in the collapse of Northern Rock, a financial institution which heavily relied on non-retail funding in a way not dissimilar to Anglo Irish.  There were sharp falls in 2008 in the share prices of Irish banks with, for example, the share price in Anglo Irish falling by 18% in one day.  These falls reflected concerns about the impact of the continuing fall in Irish property prices on the banks' earnings and also the wider international background of non-functioning money markets.  In September 2008, the NTMA was invited to attend, with the Department of Finance, meetings of the domestic standing group and, depending on my availability, I attended meetings of that group.  The deteriorating liquidity position of the Irish banks, in particular Anglo Irish and INBS, was the group's biggest concern and, on foot of those concerns, the Department of Finance put in hand, as a contingency measure, the drafting of legislation providing for a scheme for bank and building society nationalisation.  <br/><br/>On 14 September 2008, Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy.  Around that time, the Minister for Finance asked the NTMA to retain corporate finance advisers in the area of bank resolution.  I was involved in procuring the services of Merrill Lynch in that context.  Merrill Lynch subsequently provided advice which formed an input to the deliberations culminating in the Government decision to guarantee the deposits and debt liabilities of six domestic financial institutions, the covered institutions.  As the committee is aware from evidence given by my colleague, Brendan McDonagh, the NTMA was not involved in the deliberations of 29 and 30 September.<br/><br/>While the guarantee helped the covered institutions, in particular Anglo Irish, to attract funding through the interbank market and retail deposits, at least in the near time ... term, the share prices of the quoted banks continued to perform poorly, signalling continuing market concerns about their profitability and possible requirements for fresh capital.  In a statement issued on 30 November, the Minister for Finance said that, in certain circumstances, it would be appropriate for the State, through the National Pensions Reserve Fund or otherwise, to consider supplementing privately sourced additional capital for the covered institutions.  On Saturday 13 December 2008, with my colleague Brendan McDonagh, I attended a day-long meeting in the Department of Finance, where the question of bank recapitalisation was considered.  We pressed strongly at that meeting for the nationalisation of Anglo Irish, which was also the approach recommended by Merrill Lynch.  In the event, the view that Anglo should be recapitalised, rather than nationalised, prevailed.  A Government announcement on 21 December 2008 on recapitalisation said that there would be an initial State investment of &euro;1.5 billion in Anglo and that agreement had been reached with Bank of Ireland and AIB that each would issue &euro;2 billion of preference shares to the State.  At the request of the Minister for Finance, I was heavily involved in the discussions with Bank of Ireland and AIB, leading up to that announcement.  </p>  <p>         At the outset of those discussions, the banks resisted the suggestion that they needed fresh capital and, in particular, the provision of capital by the State.<br/><br/>2009: The proposed recapitalisation of Anglo was abandoned with a statement by the Minister for Finance on 15 January 2009 that it would be taken into public ownership citing &quot;a weakening in its funding position and unacceptable practices&quot;.  In the meantime, there were ongoing discussions with Bank of Ireland and AIB on how their &euro;2 billion capital injections could be achieved.  Against an international backdrop of banks generally increasing their core tier 1 capital, it was agreed in discussions, which I chaired, that the State would provide &euro;3.5 billion core tier 1 capital for each bank through preference shares.  It was the view of the NTMA that, given its bigger balance sheet, AIB was likely to require more capital than Bank of Ireland but AIB stuck to its view that its problem was no bigger than Bank of Ireland and that it would only recommend to its shareholders a deal based on its quantum of additional capital being the same as Bank of Ireland&rsquo;s.  The Minister for Finance decided that the &euro;7 billion of capital was to be provided by the NPRF.  The NTMA engaged PwC and Arthur Cox to undertake due diligence on the two banks.  To help us oversee this exercise we retained Sir Andrew Large, a former deputy governor of the Bank of England, as a &quot;trusted adviser&quot;.  In response to a request from the Minister, the due diligence exercise was tasked with forming a judgment with respect to the probability of each bank&rsquo;s core tier 1 capital being above the regulatory minimum at end-2011 and with identifying matters or issues which might reasonably be considered of a &quot;red flag&quot; nature.<br/><br/>The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission reported in March 2009 to the Minister on Bank of Ireland.  The due diligence results indicated that there was a reasonable prospect that, allowing for the proposed capital injection of &euro;3.5 billion by way of preference shares, the bank's core tier 1 capital would be above the then current regulatory minimum 4% at end-2011.  The National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission reported the Minister on AIB in May 2009.  The results painted a doubtful picture about whether the bank would be above its regulatory capital minimum of 4% at end-2011.  The Minister directed that both capital injections be proceeded with and the NTMA, on behalf of the NPRF, executed on them.<br/><br/>As CEO of the NTMA, I was an <i>ex officio </i>member of the NAMA board from its inception in 2009 and, in its early days, was heavily involved with Brendan McDonagh in recruiting its senior management team.  I believe that the decision to set up NAMA was the correct one and, based on the NTMA&rsquo;s engagements with institutional investors and the credit rating agencies.  I am strongly of the view that its success played a huge role in Ireland later regaining access to the debt capital markets.<br/><br/>In June 2009, the Minister for Finance invested &euro;3 billion in share capital of Anglo Irish.  The Minister invested a further &euro;1 billion later that year.  These investments were made in cash drawn from the Exchequer and the NTMA was not involved in their execution.  As the committee will be aware, subsequent capital injections were made in the form of promissory notes.  The use of the promissory notes had the advantage that their redemption by the Exchequer was spread out over a 20-year period, thereby easing the pressure on the NTMA to access capital markets.  At end-2009 Ireland remained relatively highly rated by the major credit rating agencies, notwithstanding downgrades over the previous 18 months in response to the deterioration of the public finances and the very evident stress in the banking system.  Ireland was broadly rated AA or equivalent, but generally with a negative outlook.  The NTMA raised &euro;35.4 billion in long-term funding in 2009.<br/><br/>2010: In February 2010, the Minister for Finance announced his intention to delegate certain functions in the banking area to the NTMA.  This announcement stated &quot;All of these functions will be carried out on behalf of the Minister, and in close consultation with the Minister and relevant officials in his Department and building on the existing very close co-operation between the two organisations.&quot;  The initiative to delegate the function was the Minister&rsquo;s own and was not in response to representations by the NTMA.  From a policy setting point of view, very little changed in reality with the Department maintaining a tight grip on policy issues, albeit with input from the NTMA, among others.  However, the delegation order brought all of the covered institutions operationally within the remit of the NTMA.  Following the making of the delegation order, the NTMA built up a banking unit staffed by experts in banking, bank analysis and corporate finance.  In March 2010 the Central Bank announced that banks would be required by year-end to meet a base capital ... core tier 1 capital ratio of 8%.  The Central Bank also announced the results of a prudential capital adequacy review, PCAR, which indicated that both Bank of Ireland and AIB had additional capital requirements.  The AIB requirement was further increased in September 2010 based on experience of the actual discount rate or haircut applied by NAMA.  The NTMA banking unit was involved in executing, on behalf of the NPRF, the necessary transactions, which, in the case of Bank of Ireland involved private sector capital, to address the capital shortfalls.  The Central Bank also identified significant additional capital requirements for Anglo, INBS and EBS.  </p>  <p>         The extent of the additional capital requirements and, in particular, the huge loss announced by Anglo during this period were major factors in Ireland subsequently having to withdraw from the bond markets.</p> <p> The NTMA's funding and debt management unit raised &euro;19.9 billion in long-term funding in 2010.  We concentrated a significant portion of our long-term borrowing programme in the earlier part of the year in order to maximise the advantage to the Exchequer of the good terms for Irish sovereign debt which existed at the start of the year.  As a result, the NTMA had achieved its borrowing target for 2010 before conditions deteriorated markedly during the final quarter of the year and we had to cancel auctions which were scheduled for October and November.  At end 2010, not least because of Ireland&rsquo;s entry into the EU-IMF programme, Ireland&rsquo;s credit rating was barely investment grade and, indeed, one rating agency subsequently marked it down to sub-investment grade.  The tone of eurozone sovereign bond markets was severely damaged in October 2010 when, at an EU summit in Deauville, Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy said that holders of eurozone sovereign debt should be forced to take losses or haircuts as part of any debt restructuring.</p> <p> I was a member of the team of Irish officials who were directed by the Minister for Finance to hold discussions with the EU Commission, ECB and IMF in mid-November 2010.  At the time, there were ongoing substantial losses of corporate and retail deposits by the Irish banks.  In response to a request from the Minister for my views on whether Ireland should apply for an EU-IMF programme, citing the severe liquidity strains on the banking system and the risk of a collapse of the system, I wrote to him on 21 November 2010 recommending that an application be made.  I said I envisaged that such assistance would provide for a capital strengthening of the banking system and, although likely to be expensive, would also provide sizable funding to the State.  I stressed that appropriate liquidity support from the ECB would be a necessary complement to a decision to apply.  Unfortunately, such liquidity support was, in my view, only grudgingly provided by the ECB to the extent that their public utterances could have been much more supportive.</p> <p> On Saturday 27 November 2010, I wrote again to the Minister, at his request, furnishing comments on the proposed programme of financial assistance with particular reference to its implications for debt sustainability.  I said that the &euro;35 billion earmarked in the proposed programme for proposed ... for potential capital injections in the banking system would, if implemented, substantially increase the risk of sustainability of the national debt.  I recommended that, with a view to mitigating the extra burden on the Exchequer represented by such additional borrowing, the question of a formal bail-in should be considered through aggressive liability management or a resolution regime with respect to the subordinated debt and senior unguaranteed debt on the banks' balance sheets.  Together with the Secretary General, Department of Finance, and the Central Bank Governor, I attended part of the Government meeting held that night where consideration was being given on whether to accept the proposed terms of the programme to be told by the Minister that the question of a formal bail-in, which he himself apparently had favoured, had been flatly rejected at a meeting earlier that day of the G20 in Korea, a fact of which I was not made aware until then.</p> <p> 2011-2012: As part of the conditions of the EU-IMF programme, the Central Bank undertook in early 2011, under the supervision of the ECB, a further PCAR exercise.  In the context of mitigating the cost to the State of providing further capital support to the banking sector which was expected to arise for that ... from that exercise, and for which, as I mentioned already, &euro;35 billion had been earmarked, the NTMA commissioned a study to look at a bail-in-burden-sharing scheme involving senior as well as subordinated debt holders in the covered institutions.  The scheme identified substantial potential savings, depending on the level of discount or haircut applied.  For the scheme to proceed, the support of the troika was critical but once again such support was not forthcoming.  Nevertheless, liability management exercises were pursued through 2011, which helped mitigate the cost to the State of the Central Bank's 2011 PCAR, the results of which were announced on 31 March and which identified an additional capital requirement of &euro;24 billion.  During the first quarter of 2011 the NTMA banking unit conducted the sale by auction of the deposit books of both Anglo Irish and INBS.</p> <p> Following the entry into the EU-IMF programme and an announcement in February 2011 by the Minister for Finance to second the NTMA banking unit to the Department of Finance, the strategic focus of the NTMA shifted back to what we regarded as one of our core roles - funding and debt management - and the challenge of regaining access to the capital markets so that Ireland would have sufficient funding visibility at end 2013 to exit the programme.  That challenge was made all the more difficult because, in addition to demonstrating that we had enough cash to meet day-to-day Exchequer needs after the end of the programme period, there was an Irish Government bond falling due for repayment in mid-January 2014 in an amount of some &euro;12 billion, which we would have to demonstrate to the market was "money good".  Irish sovereign euro denominated bond yields hit record highs in July 2011 with the yield on the two-year bond reaching 22% and that of the benchmark bond hitting 14%, implying huge falls in the market values of those bonds.  </p>  <p>         The spiking of Irish bond yields well into double-digit figures, more or less coincided with Moody's downgrading Ireland to sub-investment grade, which meant that part of Ireland's long-standing investor base was no longer open to us.  We therefore embarked in mid-2011 on a vigorous programme of engagement with over 200 existing and potential institutional investors in Ireland, the UK, the rest of Europe, the US and the Far East.  The investor relations programme yielded relatively early results when, in 2012, we raised &euro;5.2 billion on the market in long-term debt, regained regular access to the short-term markets and succeeded in reducing the outstandings on the January 2014 bond to &euro;7.6 billion.  A hugely supportive development in 2012 was the statement by the President of the ECB that the ECB was prepared to do whatever it takes to save the euro.</p> <p> 2013: there were two further supportive developments in 2013.  These were the commitment by the EFSF and the EFSM to extend the maturities on their programme loans and the replacement, on the liquidation of IBRC, of the promissory notes provided to IBRC with long-dated floating rate sovereign bonds carrying maturities of up to 40 years.  The combined effects of these two initiatives was to reduce by &euro;40 billion the amount that otherwise would have to be refinanced over the next ten years and to extend the average maturity on Ireland's public debt from seven and a half to 12 and a half years.  The NTMA raised &euro;7.5 billion in long-term debt in 2013 and reduced the outstandings on the mid-January 2014 bond to &euro;2.7 billion.  The Exchequer ended 2013 with sufficient cash and other short-term investments to cover 12 to 15 months' financing needs, facilitating the exit from the programme.</p> <p> Conclusion: I believe that the NTMA responded positively to the expectation of the Minister of Finance that we work closely with him and his Department in seeking a resolution of the banking crisis.  Our involvements brought us into areas which were well outside what were our core functions.  The crisis was domestically generated but the complexity of its resolution was added to by the global banking crisis, which had seen the collapse or rescue of household names and the major dislocation of international bank markets.  The apparent absence of crisis management skills in the ECB - in contrast with the IMF - was, I believe, also a complicating factor.  Ultimately, in Ireland's case the crisis resulted in, among other things, capital markets being closed to us.  Forming judgments and making decisions to try to come to grips with the crisis was obviously complicated by a lack of reliable information in a hugely volatile environment.  Decision making in such circumstances can seem like trying to catch a falling knife.  So, for example, it was only on the third attempt and with the benefit of knowing what the NAMA discounts or haircuts were likely to be that the banks were adequately capitalised.  I trust, Chairman, that the committee will find my statement helpful.  Thank you.</p></speech>

So, to the extent that there was contact it probably would have been with Brendan.  But just to, maybe if I could, just step back from it for a minute, I mean, the NTMA's role is ... in that space is to fund the Exchequer and to make sure that the Exchequer has sufficient cash to meet its day-to-day requirements.  </p>  <p>         We had a very conservative approach to risk.  I don't think anybody would thank us if the money which had been garnered through borrowing or through tax receipts had been lost through some sort of placement with, with, dodgy counterparts.  However, you know, the Minister who ultimately gave us a direction to place deposits with the, with the banks, he, again in my opinion, would have had a much wider public policy take on the issue and would have taken into account, presumably, considerations that were outside the narrow remit of the NTMA.  But I mean the signal was very clear and, and left ... could not have left anybody in any doubt.</p></speech>

So obviously, you're here with us today so perhaps if you could tell us what your view was about the approach of nationalisation and on what analysis did you base the view?  If it is correct that your view was that the bank ... that those, that the two banks be nationalised.  Or indeed maybe all of them, I don't know.</p></speech>

But what informed that view would have been the business model which clearly was different from the mainstream banks, if I could use that term.  So I referred in my opening statement to the collapse of Northern Rock.  I mean, that had a business model, in a way not dissimilar, it wasn't entirely the same but not dissimilar to Anglo Irish, to the extent that it relied for its funding on non-retail deposits, and it seemed to us that for the foreseeable future, the interbank market was hopelessly broken, not just in Ireland but globally and so it, it also .... I think the information to the extent that we were involved, from September 2008 .... we were, we were directed by the Minister for Finance to assist in, in looking at the problems which were arising, that there was a lack of visibility, really, around Anglo and its funding and we felt that the earlier you got your hands around the throat, so to speak of Anglo, the better.  Whether, ultimately, it would have made any difference to where we are today, that's a matter of conjecture, but we felt looking at the business model, looking at the background intuitively it was the way to go.  I mean, we didn't have ... we ... it wasn't based on a detailed, sort of, business case, if that's the question you're asking me.</p></speech>

And we would have pushed strongly, and I think Brendan McDonagh may have mentioned this in his evidence, for the regulator to get a third party in, which ultimately was PwC to do a deep dive, so to speak, on the books of all the financial institutions.  And that was the first time, certainly from our point of view, that it became obvious to us that various connections had exposures to all the financial institutions, and when you aggregated those connections, it was a frightening vista.</p></speech>

So, again, what was the analysis ... at this point, at this time ... and why ultimately was your pressure resisted?  Why did the Government decide instead to recapitalise?</p></speech>

And it was only ... it was only towards the back end of the meeting that we got a chance to, to, to express our views and indeed I remember at that stage, the chair of the meeting saying to me, who was the then Secretary General of the Department of Finance, when I tried to express a view that, in fact, I didn't have a view because I was the agent for the Minister for Finance.  But notwithstanding his ruling, so to speak, I did forcibly express the view ... that the proper course would be to nationalise the bank.</p></speech>

We took the view that buying preference shares, depending upon the conditions of the preference shares, which would have to obviously be discussed, had potential, as I said in the written statement which I've submitted to the inquiry, for letting subordinated debt holders off the hook and that in itself was a compelling argument for nationalisation.  And we repeated that view in a subsequent e-mail that we sent to the Department of Finance early the following week.  But notwithstanding that view, as I said, the decision was taken.  Now, we wouldn't have been party to the detailed discussions in the Department, presumably with the Minister and whoever else, in arriving at the decision to go the recapitalisation route, rather than the nationalisation route but our clear ... our views were very clear and we also, as I said, adduced that argument that it could have the potential to let the subordinated debt holders off the hook.</p></speech>

And then, as we got drawn into the controversy or the crisis in September 2008, which was when we attended the very first meeting with the Central Bank, I think it would have been around then that the view crystalised that it was a broken model.

I mean, looking at it, you could take the view that it probably was the least bad solution.  I  don't know.  I ... they could have nationalised Anglo Irish that night, or announced that it would be nationalised but I was a bit taken aback mainly because, as I said, I had been involved in some of the discussions the previous week, but not all of them, and I certainly hadn't got the impression that we were that close to making such a big call.</p></speech>

I ... at the risk of delaying the committee, I was due to travel to Germany to meet my grandchildren on the Wednesday and I postponed my visit because of the meeting with the Taoiseach and I headed off on Thursday and I think I came back on Saturday and I went off to New York for a meeting in connection with the pension fund on Monday.

Now, I'm not an accountant but he assured us that they were solvent.  It seemed to me, as a non-accountant, that it was highly debatable as to whether they were solvent or not, on the basis of my understanding of the definition of "solvency" is an institution's ability to meet its obligations as they arise.  And if you just take the snapshot of the night of the guarantee, but for the guarantee, presumably, Anglo wouldn't have been able to meet its obligations and, therefore, arguably, could have been regarded as being insolvent.</p></speech>

And the questions are fairly straightforward questions, I think, and that's what he said himself, you know; what is the current value of the top 30 loans and so on?  It's not really to go through the questions, but rather to ask do you recall getting this document?  And again did you have a view?

He certainly, I think, did.</p></speech>

And the rolled-up interest was part of the loan conditions made to certain debtors.  And, by definition, with the interest being rolled up, the loans couldn't be in default because there was no interest payable.  But what we found interesting, and again as a non-accountant I found extraordinary, was that the banks were accruing as income the interest in those rolled-up arrangements.  So I remember when we did our due diligence on AIB, we asked them about the extent of the rolled-up interest because with the collapse in the property prices, it was obvious to us that rolled-up interest probably would never be collected, and yet for prior years those rolled-up interests had been treated as income and would have been reflected in the profits of the banks who clearly ... which clearly, therefore, with the benefit of hindsight, would presumably have been overstated.  So I remember that was one of the issues that we focused on but I think it's the extent of the questions underlines, or punctuates, the lack of detailed knowledge, which is the point that I've already made.</p></speech>

I mean, we were asked for our views by the Minister, which we gave in the detailed letter of 27 November.  And a central plank to that letter was mitigating the cost to the State and increasing the chances of achieving that sustainability, which was very marginal in ... in our view, through burden-sharing, because this extra &euro;35 billion which the troika insisted on, was a huge potential addition to the debt.  So we weren't told about that.  You'll have to ask the Department of Finance why they didn't tell us, but anyway we didn't know.  I went along to the Government meeting and, as I have explained in my submission, I was told there by Minister Lenihan that the G20 had ruled that out.  Why they ruled it out ... I gather it was a line, and I'm into hearsay, I don't know whether I'm ... or speculation, it was a line pressed by the American Treasury Secretary, who was worried about the systemic issues.  Mind you, it seemed totally incoherent to us because if you go back to the statement made at Deauville by Chancellor Merkel and President Sarkozy, they were calling for the haircutting of sovereign bonds.  And why would you haircut sovereign bonds, why would you not haircut the bonds which were the source ... at the source of the problem, i.e. the bonds issued by the challenged financial institutions?  So it seemed to us in making that ... in making that submission, that it was certainly not inconsistent, or if you like, consistent with what ... what ... Merkel and Sarkozy had said at Deauville.  And also, if I may, on page 95 of Vol. 2 of my green book there ... and I hadn't seen this 'til it was sent to me by the committee, if you look at the second paragraph there on page 95 of Vol. 2 of my green book, this is the IMF looking back on the experience of the programme, they say, "The second lesson is that it is unfair to impose the burden of supporting banks primarily on the domestic taxpayers while senior unguaranteed bank holders get paid".  And then, in the last sentence in that paragraph, it says, "Eurozone partners precluded the Irish from imposing haircuts on senior creditors of insolvent banks."</p></speech>

You're very welcome, Mr. Corrigan.  Can I start by asking about the haircut on the acquisition of loans by NAMA from the participating institutions.  It ended up around 57%.  Can you comment on the level of discounts which were ultimately arrived at and the reasons why you believe those discounts were so high?</p></speech>

But the haircuts ... the haircuts would have arisen, to the best of my recollection now, and I'm struggling a little bit here, on the basis of the fall in the property values - the underlying property values - which would be an obvious consideration, but also the fact that, in a lot of cases, the supporting legal documentation was deficient.  So that, in taking over the loans, the ability of NAMA to rely on the underlying collateral, on foot of legal enforcement, was undermined by ... in the absence of those documents.</p></speech>

I think it's generally accepted that the NAMA process over the course of 2010 took longer than expected, so to what extent were the delays in that process as a result of the, you know, incomplete security documentation, incomplete documentation generally, large collateral or differences in loan valuations?  What type of difficulties did NAMA encounter when they went in and did the due diligence on a loan-by-loan basis?  And did that feed into the overall delay in transferring the loans across?</p></speech>

I mean, I mentioned earlier that when we got the initial PwC reports, which were commissioned by the regulator, the extent of the system's ... the banking system's exposure to individual debtors became clear.  In other words, that a debtor went along to Bank A and borrowed, went along to Bank B and borrowed, C, D, and E, and the NAMA process brought the resolution of the individual debtors together.  Otherwise, if it was left to each individual bank to do it, I think we'd still be struggling.</p></speech>

You may not be familiar with his evidence but that's the broad thrust of it on NAMA.</p></speech>

And then over the course of 2009 and 2010 when there were various rounds of bank recapitalisation, what was the nature of your discussions with Government and your advice to Government in relation to recapitalising the financial institutions?</p></speech>

And in the first round, it was very much left up to the NTMA, on foot of a request from the Minister for Finance, to determine some estimate of the likely requirements of the banks for extra capital.  And it was on foot of those discussions that the initial capital injections of &euro;3.5 billion in Bank of Ireland and AIB arose.  Then things assumed a more orthodox setting, if that's the right word, when, in 2010, the Central Bank did its PCAR.  Because, as I said at the outset, the NTMA, in a formal legal sense, had no role in relation to the banking system but we did have substantial assets in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and, through the amendments in the legislation, the Minister took power to be able to direct the fund to invest.  And the first investment was ... all three rounds of capitalisation, to the extent that the fund was involved, were done by way of direction from the Minister.  But the first round of recapitalisation, the Central Bank really wasn't involved in it and maybe that in itself says something.</p></speech>

So this is when the new Government were preparing the announcement on the banking strategy and the issue of burning senior bondholders as well as junior bondholders resurfaced.  So on page 62, if we can take us to page 62 of that.  The NTMA is setting out a proposal for burden-sharing and, in total, the proposed burden-sharing is of the order of &euro;15 billion but the proposed burden-sharing for senior bondholders is over &euro;9 billion, &euro;9.1 billion if you add all of those up, and the NTMA actually recommended that the Government would proceed with this burden-sharing.  So, can you tell us the background to this, Mr. Corrigan.  Were you asked to prepare this paper?  You refer in your witness statement to commissioning a study.  What assistance did the NTMA get in preparing this paper?  And what is the origin of it?</p></speech>

So, it was on foot of that we revisited the question of burden-sharing and I think it's fair to say that in the paper, we do say the haircuts are indicative only but, I mean, it was a strategy that we recommended, which was consistent with what we recommended back the previous November.</p></speech>

Well, the recommendation is: "... subject to a view being taken by Government [on page 64 at the bottom] on the potential implications of an adverse reaction from the external authorities and the implementation of an appropriate legal framework, immediate steps should be taken following the announcement of the PCAR/PLAR results to enable burden sharing with both senior and subordinated debt."  So you're not saying there that the Government should only do this if the external authorities endorse it; you're saying that the Government should take account of potential implications from an adverse reaction from the external authorities.  So I suppose what I'm asking, Mr. Corrigan, was it the NTMA view, at the end of March 2011, that the Government should proceed with burning senior and junior bondholders?</p></speech>

And the figures that are there for the haircut on junior bondholders, the total is about &euro;5.7 billion.  That largely subsequently did happen.  I know the previous Government imposed about &euro;10 billion of losses on junior bondholders, the current Government about &euro;5 billion, so that would be out of the pool which is identified there, I would imagine.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I mean, the key issue was around the senior bondholders and whether they should have been haircutted.</p></speech>

Again, I wasn't involved directly in the discussions but Minister Noonan would have been and it was a flat rejection by the troika.</p></speech>

Was that your view?</p></speech>

So upsetting hedge funds wasn't something that particularly worried us.</p> <p> The other thing I should mention was that in internal simulations which we did within the NTMA around the debt sustainability it all ... it hinged to a ... there are three moving parts within that issue of whether the debt is sustainable.  First, there is the nominal GDP growth rate, second, there is the average cost of funding the stock of that and, thirdly, there is the primary surplus that you have to run in order to sustain the debt.  The growth rate ... there was a lot of uncertainty attaching to the growth rate if you back to 2011.  We had come through the horrors and if, for example, you took the growth rate projected for Ireland by the ECB, you were looking at debt to GDP ratio rising to 160% according to our internal simulations.  So the situation was far from clear and, indeed, one of the issues which I didn't mention in my submission was that the reduction in the interest rates by the external authorities was an important factor in actually bringing about the sustainability of the debt.  That, coupled with the extension of the maturities.  So, if you like, what appeared like a very challenging situation back in 2011; there were certain measures which eased the challenges.</p></speech>

Can I take you to again, your own booklet, Vol. 1, page 63, and this relates to an approach by the Libyan Investment Authority, no less, to the NTMA in November 2010 and they were proposing to make an investment in Bank of Ireland - proposing to take a 24% stake in terms of ordinary shares from the pension reserve fund and to invest &euro;1 billion of the pension reserve fund shares in preference shares.

The approach, as I recall it, was made in the first instance to Bank of Ireland who then approached us.  And, around this time, there were a lot of approaches around different institutions.  For example, there was a Malabraca Consortium, which was interested in Bank of Ireland and was also interested in EBS.  This was at the early ... relatively early stages of the entry into the programme but before the entrance into the programme.  We felt this was an issue worth pursuing.</p></speech>

I know we can all look at this with the benefit of hindsight what's happened in Libya.  But certainly, the Libyan Investment Authority were a very highly-regarded sovereign investment fund and had a very substantial diversified portfolio of investments globally.  So again, to the best of my recollection, we would have checked with the Department of Foreign Affairs as to the appropriateness and ... of ... from a political point of view, if I can use that term, of engaging with the Libyans and they were comfortable for us to do so.  In the event, the Libyans didn't ... they didn't pursue the negotiations and the reason they didn't pursue the negotiations is because they couldn't be comfortable around a third round of recapitalisation which might arise and they weren't prepared to write a blank cheque-----</p></speech>

And so Colonel Gaddafi didn't quite almost own a good share in Bank of Ireland, Mr. Corrigan?  Not quite.</p>  <p>  Can I take you to the shareholder management unit within the NTMA which was announced in February 2010 and was established by order in March 2010?  So this was going to be a new banking unit as such within the NTMA.  Can you clarify the role which was fulfilled at that time?  And then you make reference to in August 2011 that the banking unit of the NTMA was seconded to the Department of Finance.  So for a year and a half it remained within the NTMA building, is that the case?</p></speech>

Can you elaborate, what do you mean by that?  The ECB was providing record levels of funding to the Irish banks as we know at that time.  What was your reaction to the letter from Mr. Trichet of 19 November 2010 which essentially threatened that the ELA may not continue if the Government did not provide ... enter a programme?</p></speech>

My point is, while they signed the cheques, they never actually came out and said that they really stood behind the system.  </p>  <p>         And again the difference between that and when the ... Mr. Draghi made the statement that they would do whatever was necessary, confidence is a huge issue in financial markets.  It's not all about writing the cheque.

And I mean, the type of questions, which aren't recalled in my submission, was what would be the likely effect on Ireland's standing in the capital markets of going into an arrangement with the IMF and I expressed the view that there was a strong probability that we would end up, for example, in sub-investment grade and that we would struggle to get back into the markets.  There were, sort of, discussions of those nature but as to whether the question of burden-sharing with the senior bondholders could be re-entered, that didn't come up.  I was just told it was off the table, period.</p></speech>

Again, we would have had serious concerns about the sustainability of the debt and, certainly, in their private moments, when the troika on those rare occasions when they would have dropped their guard, they would have shared, to some extent, our concerns at that point in early 2011 around the sustainability of the debt.</p></speech>

It's what you do.  That's ... we were responsible for the management of the debt and a question is, is the debt sustainable?  And we did a number of simulations based on different growth rates and, as I said earlier, if you took ... if you took the Department of Finance's growth rate, which, to be fair to the Department, their projections over the period of the programme more or less turned out to be the case.  But at the most pessimistic end of the scale, was the ECB, which would have envisaged, to the best of my recollection now, a growth rate ... a GDP nominal growth rate of, I think, 2% less ... lower than the Department's.  You were looking, in certain circumstances, at a debt-to-GDP ratio of 160%.  Now, you've got to go back ... you're looking at this in late 2010, early 2011 and it behoved us ... if that was in the range of possibilities as we saw in our simulations, it behoved us to bring back the question of burden-sharing back onto the table.</p></speech>

Is that how you then came to the view that this didn't need to be pursued any further?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Corrigan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#U00800"><p>The debt sustainability threat, as we saw it, was eased over the period of the programme by three key concessions.  The first one was in July 2011, when the interest rates were reduced by around 2%.  The effect of those was to reduce the interest rate on the stock of debt, which is the key metric in terms of debt sustainability ... to reduce the interest rate on the stock of debt by about a half per cent.  So that was a big ... a big concession in July 2011.  And then, the extension of the maturities of the EFSF and the EFSM from ... and finally, the substitution of the floating rate Government bonds with maturities of out to 40 years for the IBRC promissory notes.  So the combination of those, certainly, significantly helped on the debt sustainability question.</p></speech>

Thank you.  I just want to go back to the recapitalisation, if I may, for a moment.  And in your opening statement, you go through the different recapitalisations but you talk about, in 2009, this ... a further &euro;1 billion in share capital in Anglo and that, "These investments were made in cash drawn from the exchequer and the NTMA was not involved in the execution of the transactions."  So why was this one done?  Why was it done without your involvement?  Why was the cash drawn from the Exchequer and not what had been happening beforehand, which was preference shares or share capital?</p></speech>

He felt, in the back of his mind, that, ultimately, we would get the money back and, therefore, it was appropriate to take those investments out of the NPRF.  And it was through our management responsibility for the NPRF that I became involved in it, as I think I explained in my submission.  At that time, I was the director responsible for the NPRF.  So it was really through the NPRF - and it was around the investments that were coming out of the NPRF - that the NTMA became involved.  Subsequently, that responsibility or, if you like ... responsibility is the wrong word, that involvement widened out.  But the initial cash injection for Anglo came out of the Exchequer and that deal would have been closed on by the Department of Finance officials.  We would not have been involved in it.</p></speech>

Can I just ask then, I mean, was there resistance to the NTMA's advice in Government circles during the period of the crisis?  We've heard about, you know, exchanges you told us about earlier on in December when you were talking about the favouring of the nationalisation of Anglo.  We heard it from Brendan McDonagh in terms of his exchanges with the Financial Regulator.  The NTMA wasn't in the room on the night of the guarantee.

And it states:</p> <blockquote> 	[T]he deposits ... [sorry] the transfer of the deposits and NAMA bonds should proceed despite the operational risks involved ... The NTMA accepts that this approach is appropriate in the absence of agreement by the Troika to vary the commitment to this effect in the programme ... This is a risk but given the insistence of the Troika we appear to have no other option. </blockquote>  <p>Can you comment upon the operational risks?</p></speech>

I have difficulty actually recalling the operational risks.  But some of the ... some of the issues involved ... I looked back on papers which were given to me by the agency ... but, for example, and this surprised me when I looked back on it, in the case of the transfer of the deposits to Irish Life and Permanent, there were, for example, TUPE implications involved in that.  So the thing was wider than just a simple financial transaction and again, I think, over 200 employees went to Irish Life and Permanent as a result of the transaction.  So it was quite ... there were quite a number of strands to the transactions but, in the end, it was successfully executed on.  There were ... it was an open tender.  I think there were five bidders for one set of books and three bidders for the other.  </p>  <p>         But it wasn't something ... a process, to be frank with you, Deputy, that I was directly involved in.  We would have left it to the banking team. </p></speech>

I mean, one of the main pillars of the troika programme was the downsizing and reorganising of the banking sector, and the Anglo Irish-INBS restructuring plan was a key part of that.  So it was one of the key metrics.  I mean, we had the Governor of the Central Bank, the Secretary General of the Department of Finance and myself would have had weekly telephone calls with the troika after we entered into the programme, so close was the degree of their monitoring on what we were doing, so this would have been an item that would have been ... would have featured at the time on the ... on the weekly telephone calls.  I mean, frankly, we just got on and did it.  There were dangerous risks recognised in the ... in the memo for Government.  What the consequences would have been, it clearly would have set back the programme somewhat but, what the consequences would have been beyond that, I don't know.</p></speech>

That discount gave rise to losses in the banks; those losses in the banks gave rise to a need for recapitalisation; that recapitalisation was made good by the State.  So in the case of AIB and Bank of Ireland, I think there is a reasonable expectation, which I would share, that the State will see most, if not all ... and it has, in fact, already in the case of Bank of Ireland and I would expect, with astute timing, it will get its money back in the case of, of AIB.  Clearly, in the case of Anglo Irish, the money is lost to the taxpayer.</p></speech>

I have no information on ... on that, but I noted it was given here in evidence.  I think that we were probably heading for a bailout anyway.

I hadn't the benefit of all the discussions that took place that weekend, and on 29 and 30 September.</p></speech>

There was a deep dive into the banks, that was a term that you used, subsequently to all the financial institutions by PwC.  They subsequently reported to the Minister that the banks were solvent.  Could I ask your view about that analysis by PwC?  That's Project Atlas, where they took most of the valuations from the banks.  Was that a worthwhile exercise?</p></speech>

As to their conclusion that the banks were solvent, they ... this was, you know, as I said, trying to address this issue over the three or four years was like trying to catch a falling knife, which isn't ... which is a very dangerous exercise, so they ... I wouldn't question their judgment that at the point in time when they reported that it was their professional judgment that they were solvent.  But clearly the property values continued to fall and the whole funding regime continued to come under more strain, so while they probably were solvent at that point in time, clearly the situation deteriorated rapidly.</p></speech>

Are you aware that that was the case?  And then my final question, were you one of the people who ... it's been - again in previous evidence - it's been stated that representatives from the IMF and the Irish delegations did not believe that the national bailout was sustainable and it would not work.  The first question was, the NTMA position clearly stated; are you aware if it was clearly stated?  And then the unsustainable ... unsustainability of the national bailout?</p></speech>

I wasn't there.  I ... if the Taoiseach says the position of the NTMA was represented, well then I take that to be the case, but I can't confirm it to you, which is the question you're asking me.  On the second question, we had doubts about the sustainability of the debt under the programme.  But, again, the programme was the only show in town.  It was ... it was borderline, in our view, but, again, we recommended it on the basis that it was worthwhile going for.  But, as I said to Deputy Murphy, then the subsequent concessions made in the form of the interest reductions and so on and so forth copperfastened the sustainability.  But absent those, we could be having a different discussion today, I don't know.</p></speech>

Mr. Corrigan.  Could we put up the Corrigan core document, first one there, please, 002?  </p>  <p>               I've given a note to the ... Mr. Corrigan, this ... just, I want to draw your attention this, its page 118 in the document you have in front of you, Vol. 1, and its up on the screen as well, the last two paragraphs on that page please.  If you can scroll her up ... yes.  Little bit more please, yes, thank you, that's it.  This relates to post-nationalisation of Anglo and the transfer of deposits, etc., to Allied Irish Bank and then from Irish Nationwide Building Society to Irish Life and Permanent.  And as you see there to ... that AIB received &euro;8.6 billion in Anglo deposits, purchased senior NAMA bonds with a nominal value of approximately &euro;12.2 billion, and "AIB has also made a cash payment of &euro;3.5 billion".  And then, Irish Life and Permanent received INBS deposits of over &euro;3.6 billion, "purchased Senior NAMA bonds and other bonds with a nominal value of &euro;3.7 billion in addition to share ownership of INBS' Isle of Man subsidiary".  IL and P also made a cash payment of &euro;2.3 million.  In so far as you can, Mr. Corrigan, recall that those procedures which, were carried under the Credit Institutions (Stabilisation) Act, could you just give us a picture of the type of sale process that was involved here, how it was approached, the bids that were received, the evaluation that was carried out and then the completion of the transactions, the deposit transfers, etc.? </p></speech>

There were five institutions bid in one case, and three institutions bid in the other and the AIB was ... won the competition for the Anglo deposits and IL and P for the INBS.  I think in the case of the INBS, I think there were five bidders and I think in the case of Anglo there were three but I'm not entirely sure.  But, as I said to ... in response to a previous question, I wasn't intimately involved, but, I mean, there was ... it would have been a tender competition that was run internally and would have been overseen by an internal panel within the NTMA with appropriate external input.</p></speech>

Some bids were submitted, again just looking back on it, which were conditional, which meant that they were sort of tails hanging out of it and it wouldn't have been a clean transfer.  So the main thing was to get a tender proposal that conformed with the tender as laid down at the outset of the competition and that was the main criteria.</p></speech>

Just to move, Mr. Corrigan, if I could have the letter NTMA 002501, and this is a letter, Mr. Corrigan, that you wrote to the Minister, Brian Lenihan, on 27 November 2010, and if we can go to the second page of that letter please, it's .... yes.  And you're very concerned here ... you're ... the letter is talking about a &euro;35 billion requirement.  Now, Deputy McGrath has covered some of this territory, I just really want to revisit for a little while.  So, you ... &euro;35 billion necessary for bank recapitalisation and you're extremely concerned about the effect of this on the national debt, etc.  And then, you are recommending in the paragraph, "The NTMA recommends that all possible avenues towards mitigating the extra burden be pursued."  You mention there the &euro;12 billion, subordinated debt and the &euro;20 billion in senior unguaranteed debt on the balance sheets.  And then you want, or suggest, "An aggressive liability management exercise / resolution regime has the potential to significantly reduce the extra burden."  At that stage in November, how much did you think could have been shaved off the burden that came onto the state and the taxpayers?</p></speech>

I don't know that we had a specific figure in our mind, but I mean the &euro;35 billion that the troika had identified, that has to be seen in the important context of one of the objectives of the programme was to reduce the ... the loans-to-deposit ratios in the banks from something like - some of them were as high as 160% - to around 120%.  Now that involved ... would have involved and did involve, the bank ... the banks selling assets.  And it seemed to us at the time, and it was a big concern in the discussions with the troika, that there would be a fire sale of those assets because they were very gung-ho on getting the figure down to this figure of around 120%.  And of course, that fire sale in itself would have given rise for more capital.  So, we had a real concern that the &euro;35 billion would be required.  And it would've ... it ran the risk of ... in the event, the figure crystalised out at &euro;24 billion and then allowing for liability management exercises and private sector capital injection into Bank of Ireland, the actual figure I think ended up around &euro;17 billion.</p></speech>

You were close to the National Pensions Reserve Fund for a long period of your working life and the legislation in 2009 was changed allowing the Government to direct funds to Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank. You mentioned this in your statement, &euro;7 billion.  Can I ask you, you had been in charge, you had been seeing how these funds had been managed on behalf of the Irish people, what was your feeling about this particular change and to see this kind of money from the pension fund going into the banks, at the time?</p></speech>

We had built up a management team who had done a very good job.  The performance of the fund was considerably ahead, over its lifetime, of the private sector analogues and ... but, I mean, we're subject to public policy direction but it certainly felt like a death in the family at the time.</p></speech>

We outsourced the management of European equities to some London houses, for example, and we asked them for their views on whether, for example, they would buy shares in the Irish banks at that point in time and the ... for all sorts of reasons, which are now obvious, they said that they wouldn't.  So if it had been invested conventionally in the markets, the return, I believe, would have exceeded the return earned to date ... so far.</p></speech>

So when they reported on the performance of the fund, they reported two performance figures, one for what they called the discretionary portfolio, that which over they had control, and the other being the directed portfolio.  I think one of the consequences of the direction was that the ... certain shares had to be sold off, certain bonds had to be sold off and the portfolio that was left under the management of the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission had to be rebalanced back to what we considered a prudent, diversified, investment portfolio.  So, again, there would have been costs involved in that rebalancing but they clearly delineated between, as I said, the discretionary portfolio and the directed portfolio.</p></speech>

Their mandate was defined to seek the optimal financial return on their investments, provided they were happy with the level of risk.  So when this policy decision was made by the Government and the legislation was changed, that was not something that they expressed an opinion on.  They were policy takers, not policy makers.</p></speech>

Just a final question.  One of the key requirements was your ability to fully inform potential investors regarding progress in consolidating public finances, recapitalising and restructuring the banks and regaining competitiveness.  You also referenced a statement by the ECB President that the ECB was prepared to do whatever it takes to save the euro.  So, Mr. Corrigan, can I ask you, can you outline the source and flow of information from the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland and can you please outline what form this took and how effective it was for your needs?</p></speech>

They developed what's known in the trade as quite a sophisticated pitch book, which is actually up on the NTMA website, and to the extent that they wanted information re-presented or reconfigured in a certain way for, if you like, marketing purposes, certainly, the bank and the Department were extremely helpful in that respect.</p></speech>

I mean, you talked a little bit about that idea of being less than equal partners and your former colleague, Mr. Somers, referred to it as an inner circle and when asked what meant he said ... in evidence, he talked about the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and sometimes the regulator and that, if you like, the NTMA was outside that, and you've talked about a less than equal partnership.  So did that extend to Ministers ... either of the Ministers for Finance and your relationship ... the NTMA's relationship with the Ministers and then, particularly in relation to the pressure that you came under to ... first of all, to direct the deposits to be put and then for those deposits potentially to be increased, which I know they weren't, but can you just describe that relationship?</p></speech>

In terms of access to the Minister, Minister Lenihan would have been the main player, obviously, and we ... I had good access to the Minister.  The question of Trichet's letter was mentioned earlier and I don't think, actually, I responded to the question at the time, but we weren't shown Trichet's letter at the time.  Again, just to ... just to, sort of ... I'm not into spinning any conspiracy theories but to underline the comment about the uneven nature of the ... the unequal nature of the partnership.  So the officials, I think, like to think of the NTMA as providing technical advice.  That was a word that they frequently used.  I think the political expectation was for a lot more than that and, as I said, in the conclusions of my statement, I think we did whatever was asked of us.  But at times we probably could have been brought more fully into the picture.</p></speech>

Mr. Corrigan, a number of differences have emerged between the NTMA's position on some issues and the Department's and Senator O'Keeffe went through some of those there - the nationalisation of Anglo, your view that AIB would need more capital than Bank of Ireland, the issue of placing deposits in the banks.  So can I ask: do you believe that the NTMA was sufficiently listened to by the Department on all of these issues?  Did the NTMA provide their written rationale to the Minister?  And was it common or normal practice for the advice of the NTMA on some issues not to be reflected in the actual decision?</p></speech>

I don't necessarily believe that the emergence of differences was unhealthy.  I mean, at the end of the day, the Minister is the decision maker at the Government and at the end of the day, while we had access to the Minister, it would be the natural inclination of a Minister, I would suggest, to listen maybe a little bit more closely to his officials.</p></speech>

Mr. Neary said, "there is no evidence to suggest Anglo is insolvent on a going concern basis ...  He felt INBS was in a similar situation."  Do you recall that meeting and do you recall if the NTMA challenged that assertion that the banks were solvent, including Anglo and INBS, at that time and it was simply a liquidity issue?</p></speech>

In normal times, probably up to six months.  In more strained times, like in 2013 when we were coming out of the programme, we had to have 12 to 15 months visibility.  So it's a bit of a moveable feast but it ... certainly when we had to cancel options, which was totally unprecedented, even if you had six months' funding ahead, you couldn't see beyond that and the clock runs fairly quickly in those circumstances.</p></speech>

Mr. Farrell, you are very welcome before the committee this afternoon.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#DD00400"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  As requested by the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis, I am providing this witness statement in my capacity as CEO of the Irish Banking Federation, the Federation of International Banks in Ireland, a position I held from January 2004 to June 2013.  I'm endeavouring to address the broad themes which the joint committee has requested of me in my capacity as CEO of IBF for the period - the relevant period - to the extent possible in this capacity.</p>  <p>  By way of background, IBF was established in 1973 on Ireland's accession to the European Economic Community to represent the Irish banking sector internationally as well as domestically.  FIBI was formed following the establishment of the International Financial Services Centre so as to provide a particular focus for the needs of international banks.</p>  <p>  My own appointment as CEO of IBF commenced shortly after the establishment of the Irish Financial Services Authority.  My responsibility was to assist the council of the IBF in formulating strategy for the IBF and implementing that strategy.  The council of the IBF typically consisted of either the group CEO or the head of the Irish retail banking division of the main Irish banks, domestically-focused international banks and the CEO-country managers of several of the internationally-owned, internationally-focused banks.  I represented the sector at European level as a member of the executive committee of the European Banking Federation and I also represented the sector through membership of a number of relevant Irish industry and State-sponsored bodies.  I also represented the sector for certain engagements with the media and in engagements with the State and with public representatives.  Such engagement took place when common themes existed for the IBF&rsquo;s membership, which themes had been endorsed by the council of the IBF.</p>  <p>  My tenure covered two quite distinct, separate phases.  The first phase was the period 2004 to 2008 which saw a significant increase in the number of financial services companies and banks operating in the domestic Irish consumer banking markets, culminating in, for example, over 13 providers of mortgages.  This was a period of rapid but, as subsequently proved, unsustainable economic growth, with overseas banks entering the market - either directly or through acquisition - and with the established banks seeking to grow their business and/or responding to this wave of intense competition.  At the same time, there was also considerable growth in the number of banks establishing internationally-focused activities to operate from Ireland.</p>  <p>  The second phase involved the aftermath of the international and domestic banking crisis from mid-2008.  The impact of this crisis and its aftermath on the stakeholders of the IBF&rsquo;s member banks, including their customers, shareholders, staff and the taxpayers of their home countries - including, of course, Ireland - is well documented.  The aftermath included some of the following outcomes - retrenchment, insolvency, restructuring, nationalisation and exit for a significant number of banks operating in or from Ireland.  In some cases, this reflected the fact that entire banking groups' business model and activities were fatally or fundamentally flawed or a recognition that the business models for their Irish activities were either flawed or could not be maintained as they sought to preserve capital, liquidity and reduce costs.  The designs of the group business models for these banks and of the business models for the Irish activities of these banks had a number of different features and they responded in a number of different ways to the challenges these business models faced.  However, common business model flaws were: under-capitalisation; over dependence on wholesale funding; aggressive pricing; and loosening of credit standards coming into the crisis, followed subsequently by rapid retrenchment to core - often home country franchises - post the crisis.  The burdens on the Irish taxpayers and on the shareholders of the domestic Irish banks from the flaws in their business models has been the subject of a wide range of reports and investigations, including this inquiry.</p>  <p>  Noteworthy has also been the in excess of approximately &euro;50 billion which has been borne by the shareholders-home taxpayers of overseas banks, who had to recapitalise their subsidiaries competing in the domestic Irish market, and/or losses they actually incurred as they retrenched from the Irish market.  This retrenchment-exit also caused significant difficulties for Irish consumers as they sought to make alternative banking arrangements away from the products-product providers which proved to have been unsustainable and/or customers finding that their loans-mortgages had been sold to entities where the customer had no choice in the matter.  I should also say that, as a member of the executive committee of EBF, I witnessed similar pre and post-crisis features across the banking industry to differing degrees of severity.  Given the role of IBF as described above, we were not privy to, and did not have a role in adjudicating on, the funding or liquidity policies, the risk management models or the composition, skills and experience of the boards of individual banks.</p>  <p>  My term as CEO of IBF commenced shortly after the formation of IFSRA, as I've said, and I noted early on that the consumer director sat on IFSRA's board whilst the prudential regulator did not.  In the period up to September 2008, the primary interaction I had with IFSRA was on consumer-orientated regulatory matters and initiatives and this was the focus of the agreed strategy of interaction agreed with me by the council of the IBF for the domestic banks.  For example, during my tenure the IBF had the responsibility for co-ordinating the implementation of a range of consumer focused initiatives such as the Dormant Accounts Act, interbank switching codes, IBF-money advice bureau - known as MABS - debt protocol, promotion of electronic payments, consumer protection codes and the establishment of the Social Finance Foundation.  For the international banks, there was considerable focus on taxation-related issues and skill shortages in the Irish market.  I sought on several occasions to have broader dialogue with the Central Bank on general banking issues but was given the clear message that IFSRA was the primary conduit for engagement.  There was also a focus for the IBF on engagement, through the EBF, with the European integration agenda in terms of payments, consumer protection and other initiatives to complete the EU Single Market in financial services.  From time to time, we also submitted technical papers prepared by members in response to regulatory consultations both locally and at EU level.  To my recollection, business model discussions and general issues of prudential regulation in areas such as capital, liquidity or credit standards were not a notable feature of agenda discussions within the IBF or between IBF and regulatory or other authorities.</p>  <p>  As CEO of late ... of IBF, I was, in late 2004, appointed by the Minister for Finance as a member of the financial services consultative industry panel, which was in existence up to June 2010.  The role and mandate of the panel was to act in an advisory capacity to the newly-established Irish Financial Services Regulatory Authority.  Its role was similar to panels operating in other jurisdictions, such as the practitioners panel which operates in the UK under the aegis of the Financial Conduct Authority.  The panel published five annual reports covering the period 2005 to 2009, inclusive, the broad themes of which were as follows: a critical focus on the balance struck between the prioritisation and allocation of resources to the conduct of business - i.e. consumer - and the prudential regulation roles of IFSRA; a request that the regulator deepened its understanding of individual firms' business models given the diversity and complexity of regulated firms operating in Ireland; consideration be given to having a designated senior executive focused on IFSC supervision; with reference to EU legislative and regulatory agendas, it proposed the appointment of a dedicated senior executive with responsibility for co-ordination of the Irish engagement and response; it proposed reviews of competition barriers in retail banking; we called for extensions of provisions of consumer codes to non-deposit-taking entities then operating as mortgage lenders; and sought the application of regulatory impact assessments to major regulatory and legislative initiatives; called for investment in HR and IT support services and review of the associated shared services model which then in place between the Central Bank and IFSRA; we commented on proposed industry levies and methods of allocation and general commentary on IFSRA's annual budgeting process; and the promotion of benchmarking against best practice regulation in comparable jurisdictions.  </p>  <p>           In the interests of time, Chairman, I'm going to summarise the verbatim piece from the report.  But the panel in its final annual report of 2009 noted that the panel was to ensure a meaningful participation in the debate around the reform then under way of the regulatory structure.  We published a paper in that regard, and it was acknowledged subsequently as a significant contribution to that debate, and that culminated in the Central Bank Reform Bill of 2010.  And among the things that we had stressed and that we found reassuring in the actual publication of the Bill, was that the single most important ingredient required for successful reform was the quality of the people.  There was a very good beginning made with the appointment of Central Bank Governor, Patrick Honohan, and Financial Regulator, Matthew Elderfield.  The regulator's strategy was proposed to the ... or presented to the panel prior to its public announcement and we noted very positively the fact that a lot of the recommendations we had made previously in relation to the critical importance of an appropriate skills mix in the regulator, an understanding that the regime should be risk based and not &ldquo;one-size-fits-all&rdquo;, and the importance of a strategic policy unit was all broadly contained within the strategy, so we were very pleased about that.  </p> <p> As the crisis unfolded during the second half of 2008 the various members of the IBF became increasingly focused on their own specific issues and it became apparent that for some of the subsidiaries of international banks the key decisions were being taken outside of Ireland.  The members of the IBF had different senses of priorities, were reluctant to show their hands, for obvious reasons, and had differing degrees of mandates to articulate to the IBF as to what they wanted the IBF&rsquo;s mandate to be in engaging with relevant authorities and regulators on solvency and liquidity issues.  Engagement with the Central Bank, IFSRA and the State during this time tended to be focused on issues such as bank support mechanisms for customers, including those in mortgage arrears, and IBF obligations arising from the introduction of the credit institutions scheme.  </p> <p> Prior to 29 September 2008, IBF had no mandate from the IBF council to discuss specific Government liquidity or solvency support initiatives for the sector with the authorities and was not a party to considerations by the authorities on such matters.  During 2009, and particularly after the arrival of Professor Honohan as Governor of the Central Bank of Ireland and Matthew Elderfield as regulator, there was increased evidence of cross-stakeholder working groups involving the Department of Finance and the Central Bank of Ireland, where IBF was a participant on sector wide issues such as mortgage arrears, codes of practice were ... where codes of practice, etc., were developed and enhanced, and I witnessed a high degree of co-operation and interaction.</p> <p> With regard to the troika, we were used by the troika as a source of information, particularly during 2011 and 2012, and views were solicited on a range of themes including: competition-related matters and issues; sectoral initiatives and progress on mortgage arrears resolution.  We had a number of discussions regarding judicial process, legislative and regulatory impediments we believed were exacerbating the problem and presenting barriers to resolution, and our views regarding proposed reform of the bankruptcy regime and the introduction of a personal insolvency framework.  We also discussed access to credit for SMEs and support for firms with a sustainable business who were experiencing financial difficulties.  All such interactions with the troika were either done in conjunction with the Irish authorities, or the details of the engagement were shared with the Irish authorities.  </p> <p> That concludes my statement.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

I think I was approached by an executive search and select company.  I think the name of the company, I think, was Amrop at the time.  I know it was a competitive situation.  There were obviously quite a number of applicants for the position.  I was interviewed by a number of senior executives from the banking sector.  I think I may have had more than one, perhaps two or three interviews.  And subsequently I was made an offer of employment and appointed.  I took up the position then in January 2004.</p></speech>

Well, I suppose, first of all, over the period of my time as CEO of IBF I dealt with, I think, three different Governments.  There was the Fianna F&aacute;il-PD Government.  Then there was Fianna F&aacute;il, Green Party and the PDs.  And then there was the Fine Gael-Labour Government.  My <i>modus operandi</i>was the same in every circumstance.  I developed a professional relationship with Ministers, with Oireachtas Members, with policy makers, with the senior civil servants and other civil servants, and other stakeholders that I had reason to engage with as part of my mandate.  And my dealings with them was the same regardless of their political composition or direction.</p></speech>

I mean, how much is how much?  I mean, I suppose I had a very busy agenda.  I had a mandate which was for a sector that was a regulated sector, which was subject to legislation.  The Department of Finance had a particular role in relation to the sector.  The Central Bank obviously and the Financial Regulator were the appropriate regulators and therefore in order to discharge my mandate, I had to have a reasonable degree of interaction.  I had meetings with Ministers and officials.  I had meetings sometimes, but not that often, I have to say, with Ministers themselves.  And I would have had ... I'd say my primary action probably ... interaction was with officials.</p></speech>

I said, and for the record, that all my relationships and dealings with all politicians and with the public authorities was appropriate and professional, and at all times.  Now, I would also add that it is not unusual for somebody with a background in public affairs or political life to be involved in advocacy or representation; it is actually quite common and it runs across organisations such as the IFA, such as ... I could go on at length to name the organisations, and there are lots of former politicians who are also ... work with, since they've retired from their positions, with public relations firms, with advocacy groups.  So, it is absolutely a common occurrence and it would be surprising it if were other than that.</p></speech>

I do want to change now, Mr. Farrell, and just refer to your opening statement.  You described in it the period 2004 to 2008 as a period of rapid, but, as subsequently proved, unsustainable economic growth.  To what extent do you now consider that the banking sector has borne any responsibility for the unsustainable element of economic growth in that particular period?</p></speech>

In a draft memorandum to Government in October 2005, it stated:</p>  <p>The Irish Bankers Federation approached the Department of Finance in April 2005 regarding changes to the Investment Intermediaries Act. ... They [being the IBF] have engaged McCann FitzGerald Solicitors to draft the legislation in conjunction with all of the major issuers of Covered Bonds in Ireland who have been closely involved in the process e.g. Depfa, West LB, Bank of Ireland GM.</p>  <p>  Is it usual, or, was it usual, in your time in the IBF, to draft legislation for the Department of Finance?  How much of that legislation made it into the final Act?  And what impact did it have, do you believe, on the banking sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.387" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#FF01000"><p>Okay.  There's a number of parts to that question so maybe I might just provide a bit of context first of all.  The Asset Covered Securities Act was introduced in 2001, well before my time as CEO of IBF.  It enabled the sector here to provide covered bonds as a method of funding, principally for the mortgage market.  This is a system that had been in place in Germany for over ... a couple hundred years, same in Denmark, same in France, so what we were doing was merely coming into line with what was a very accepted funding instrument internationally.  The Act of 2007 was an amendment to the original Act of 2001; it was an amendment.  The reason for the amendment of the Act was triggered by the pending introduction of the capital requirements directive, otherwise known as Basel II.  That was the EU's method of giving effect to Basel II.  And, because this concerned capital, it cut across almost all elements of the Asset Covered Securities Act and these instruments.  So, in order for the covered bonds legislation and the instruments to remain compliant, and to remain relevant and to be able to continue to be transacted, there had to be amendments made to the Act in order to align it with the capital requirements directive.  So, that was the principal purpose of the amendments.  It says in the note, and I have it in front of me, that it says we drafted the legislation.  I would feel, and I, you know ... the note is what it is.  We did not draft legislation.  What we would have done was said, in order for the Act to align with the capital requirements directive, these are the areas we believe will require amendment.  At the end of the day - and you will know this as legislators - parliamentary draftsmen, ultimately, frame legislation, Attorney General's office will have significant input and eventual sign-off, and, ultimately, it will go before a committee, and, ultimately, it will be placed before the House.  So, that was the context and that was the actual background to it.  Could I just say, as well, that, you know, it was fairly complex legislation and that may well again explain the rationale for having a third party, because I know, myself, the Department of Finance itself retains external legal advisers from time to time to advise them and support in looking at legislative issues and drafting of legislation.</p></speech>

I admit, in your answer, that you said that it would be unlikely that you drafted legislation.  I'm only referring to the note, but-----</p></speech>

I want to ask ... to turn now, maybe, to the area ... particularly the area surrounding the guarantee itself, and ask you if you had any interaction with the late Mr. Lenihan or Mr. Cowen between the end of 2007 and the introduction of the guarantee.  We've had evidence from a number of witnesses at this stage that there was lobbying of various natures as to a political guarantee or, you know, ultimately, the blanket guarantee that was introduced.  Would you have had any interaction along those lines in that period?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#FF01600"><p>Not that I can recall.  And I have looked at the evidence that has been submitted so far and I think it calls out different individuals, different interactions, talks about banks being ... interactions, or whatever.  But, you know, again, these kind of matters - and I did refer to it in my statement - would be highly sensitive, market sensitive issues, and, you know, banks, as I said before, were extremely coy, and understandably so, in the realm of the banking federation, about discussing issues that were relevant to their own specific businesses, or that might give any, kind of, insight into their specific businesses or business models.  So, it's not unusual that we wouldn't have been involved in any of this discussion.  Like, I would have woken up to the newspaper announcement of the guarantee the same way as everybody else in this ... the vast majority of people in this country.</p></speech>

How many banks or banking institutions would have been members of the federation?</p></speech>

But, there were 70 banks, of which about 13 or 14 of them were operating in the retail-domestic market, and the rest of them were banks ... sorry, were financial institutions with banking licences, operating, in the main, out of the IFSC.  Some of them were located regionally as well, but, in the main, they were located in the International Financial Services Centre.</p></speech>

I would be anxious to be helpful.  I mean, they, they ... obviously with a busy programme, we employed 16 people that were fairly specialised individuals and the fees varied according to the size of the bank's balance sheet, if they were a domestic bank, and then we had a fee arrangement for IFSC banks, which was related to whether they had over or under 40 employees, which was just an arbitrary number that we picked at the time.</p></speech>

The same kind of issues were at play for us.  So therefore it wasn't likely, it was impossible that any bank was going to come to me, either bilaterally or certainly not in a forum of other banks, to say we have an issue with X or we have an issue with Y. Our job was to represent the banks where they had common positions and at a reasonably high level where they could co-operate around a particular issue.  Remember, and I think I might have adverted to it, I mean, banks would have sometimes made their own individual submissions and issues because they might have a particular specific point of view that was not accommodatible within the broad-church view that we would be advocating on behalf of the collective of banks, if that makes sense.</p></speech>

I want to turn, or actually perhaps before I turn just to finish on the guarantee area, the IBF hosted - we have discussed this particular function that took place in Dublin on 26 November 2008 with several witnesses who came before the inquiry, a retirement function for the chairman of the regulator, Mr. Patterson.</p></speech>

I think it's important though to give context.  Mr. Patterson retired as chairman of the regulator, I think it was in April of that year.  He had been ill, I think that's common knowledge.  As a common, as a courtesy, I suggested to him that we would have a dinner at some stage.  His illness obviously meant that time elapsed and it was eventually November by the time it happened.  In the meantime the guarantee had happened but you know in those circumstances - damned if you do and damned if you don't.  The dinner happened, it was a two-hour affair, it was during the working week.  It was a pretty sober affair because it was during the working week.  There were no speeches, there was certainly no business transacted at it.  It was a social occasion and understandably, the way it was reported subsequently, the optics of it were far from good.  But that was the background to it, it was as straightforward as that.</p></speech>

The joys of representing a broad church of membership, obviously I had a number of quite irate members.  First of all, you had the banks who were operating in the retail domestic market here but had a foreign parent.  They were naturally, as you can imagine, they were quite annoyed.  They felt that they were being placed at a disadvantage so they ventilated their concerns to me quite robustly.  Then there were the two banks, Depfa  and WestLB I think, if I recall them correctly, in the IFSC who had been availing of and using the covered bonds programme that I mentioned, which had its origins in the 2001 Act.  They had been using that programme to issue bonds, finance and public sector assets, for quite some time and they were outside of it.  Then there was the added complication that Depfa, and this is well chronicled in the public realm, was for a short period of time seen as an orphan in regulatory terms because it wasn't clear whether it fell within the ambit of the regulatory authorities here or Germany, although I think with the benefit of hindsight it was very clear that it fell within the German responsibility because it had been acquired by a German bank some time previously.  So they were also concerned and that was the context for the note to Dermot McCarthy.</p></speech>

The Clearing House Group operated under the aegis of the Department of the Taoiseach.  The Clearing House Group was a multi-stakeholder group.  It had financial services representation, public sector representation on it.  It was chaired by the Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach, Dermot McCarthy, and it was charged with the promotion of the IFSC among other things, that was its broad mission.  I felt, given that role and given that he was the chairman of it, that it was also important to convey the representation that I had received from what was an IFSC bank to him as well.</p></speech>

I mean, here's the reality of it, I come back again to the fact we are a representative body, we have an absolute obligation to represent our members' interests.  When they raise a matter of concern with us, we have an obligation to advocate that to the relevant authorities.  Depfa were themselves directly advocating their position to all of the various authorities as well.  I am sure WestLB did likewise and I am sure the other banks that were operating in the retail market did so too.  But our job is to convey that view.  I mean, I think it is quite hypothetical as I said, if for a very brief period Depfa's status was unclear but it was quite quickly resolved and in any event their liability ... the German regulator took over responsibility in that situation.</p></speech>

My final question Chairman, again, it goes back, I suppose, to where I was at the start.  In your time, particularly in the time that you were  chief executive of the IBF in the run-up to the guarantee, when Mr. Neary was the chief executive of the regulator, Mr. Hurley was the Governor of the Central Bank, can you briefly outline the nature of the relationship that you would have had, the level of contact that you would have had with either or both gentlemen, the level of even social contact outside of your lobbying activity as chief executive of the IBF?</p></speech>

Then ... I hear references in some of the transcripts to golf but I'm not a golfer, I've never been one, so that ruled me out on that point.  And I would have met the regulator as a courtesy call for a cup of coffee maybe once every couple of months.</p></speech>

Because I think I adverted earlier on in my witness statement that, you know, I was quite methodical about the idea that I should identify all my stakeholders and try and build a relationship with them.  That's what you do as a good advocacy body.  In the case of the Central Bank, though, I found that there was constantly, kind of, getting the, sort of, impression that the point of contact was to be the regulator and that's what I did.</p></speech>

I'll tell you what the background to it was.  We were asked to convene on that basis by the authorities, because at that time, there was a purported pandemic because of avian bird flu, and, at one stage, it was estimated that if it got the grip that was being speculated upon by the World Health Organization, which is an authoritative body, that 25% of critical services and banking infrastructure and payments could be paralysed.  And we were asked by the authorities to convene a group to examine this issue and it became a standing group then after that because it looked at things like cyber-crime risk and other such issues.</p></speech>

I have any recollection of what the content would have been it would have been around, as I said, things like the original one which was pandemics and the potential impact of them.  And it was very real at the time.  It may seem funny at this vantage point but it was very real issue at the time.  And cyber-crime risk was also another very real issue.

Right.  When ... you mentioned that the IBF weren't aware of the bank guarantee and you woke up that morning like everybody else.  So, we have uncovered in this inquiry that discussions in terms of guarantees and, indeed, legislation were being drafted as early as April 2008.  So, is it the IBF's position that they were unaware of any of that process of consideration of legislation or anything to do with that until after the announcement of the guarantee?</p></speech>

So, naturally, there was an international backdrop and it did come to wash on our shores of issues around liquidity, tightening up of wholesale funding access to it, all of that kind of thing.  But, we weren't involved in any specific discussions, or even general discussions, about guarantees or the like.</p></speech>

That's the bank guarantee decision; we all woke up that morning and we knew that the ... we found out that the Government announced it, well, most of us in the country anyway, that weren't in the loop.

Okay.  Was the IBF ... I presume you weren't aware that one of the ... it's suggested that one of the main banks drafted its own bank guarantee.  Was the IBF aware of this?  Was it consulted on the draft?  Did the IBF ever receive a copy, before or after, of the bank's own version of the guarantee?</p></speech>

Our job was to represent the banks collectively on issues that we could establish a collective and common position.  And you can deduce from that that a lot of issues then, particularly when they're referred to individual banks or referred to individual banks' business models and the like, fell outside of our ambit.  And that's not unusual.  That would be the same in any other representative body.  Members will come together when it's in their interests to advocate a particular postilion, but when it comes to their own individual business and the way they operate their businesses, they will play their cards very close to their chest because, that's business intelligence, and they're not going to share that information with somebody else.</p></speech>

Mr. Farrell if we can go to the ... just picking up what Deputy Phelan was talking about.

And I want to go the point where you say that, despite the fact that the Government, this is a Government recommendation, or a memo to Government, a memo to Cabinet.  Despite the fact that you said that you didn't draft the legislation, although it stated in this report that you did ask for McCann Fitzgerald, I think ... yes, McCann Fitzgerald to draft the legislation.  You say that something was drafted, but it would have been just points.  </p>  <p>               The final Bill would have been drafted, as you said, by the draftspeople of the Houses of the Oireachtas, but the job that McCann FitzGerald did on behalf of the IBF in terms of what's said here is the draft legislation, did it look like draft legislation?</p></speech>

This is my understanding, open to correction: there was an amendment in the updated legislation which included the ability for commercial mortgage to be collateralised and then be issued on the back of a covered bond.  First of all, a covered bond is a very highly rated instrument.  It has huge legal protections in it and it's retained on balance sheet, unlike a securitisation which is off balance sheet.  So a covered bond is a very good instrument.  There's nothing wrong with it.  It's a very, very good instrument for funding.  Let that be on the record.</p>  <p>  They asked for the inclusion of commercial mortgages and I think there might have been a general interest more broadly than that.  The fact was, across all competing jurisdictions, peer jurisdictions, the ability to include commercial mortgages in covered bonds, where there were covered bonds legislation was already the norm, so we were just, literally, coming into line.  That was legislation of 2007.</p>  <p>  The statutory instrument which gave effect to the element that allowed commercial mortgages to be collateralised was placed before this House, I understand, and I'm subject to correction, in mid-2008.  At that stage, as we know, events had overtaken us and, again subject to correction, but my understanding is that Anglo - you named the institution - didn't do a transaction under that particular mechanism.  I'd also like it to be recorded that, using the covered bonds legislation, it became a vitally important instrument for all of the banks operating here, because it became an acceptable method of collateral to post at the ECB window for liquidity purposes.  And we all know how important that actually became because the ECB had certain criteria for liquidity and one of the types of the liquidity they were prepared to accepted ... or collateral they're prepared to accept at their window for liquidity purposes were covered bonds.</p></speech>

That was the quote that you had.  One of the objectives of the inquiry is to arrive at the understanding at the logic and rationale that underpinned the Irish banking business model.  The people who designed the system, who regulated the system and who lobbied for changes to the system were all intelligent and rational people.  Can you explain to the committee, what was the rationale for making an Irish banking model, in your own words, complex and opaque?  Who benefitted from such a complex and opaque system that was created?</p></speech>

You just ... you intermediate money.  People give you the loan of their money and then you lend it to other people.  But it's also a highly regulated sector, so that brings its own levels of complexity and opacity.  It's also heavily legislated for and then there's all the governances that flow from the fact that it's an internationally-traded service.  I'm not best placed to determine how banking got to the level of opacity and complexity that it did.  The fact is, it did.  I made that statement in Kenmare.  I acknowledge it and, you know, since then the changes that have been undertaken in regulatory frameworks have, to some degree, tried to reduce some of that opacity and simplify it like, for example, the ring-fencing of investment banks from retail banks.  And actually that is probably one that speaks to your question which is that investment banking ... banks developed into situations where they became conglomerates, where they were investment banks and retail banks and, of course, investment banks are notoriously complicated instruments and they are quite a degree of opacity as we learnt through the crisis.  I think that spread across banking groups as well.</p></speech>

We weren't knowledgeable on or we didn't have access to the details of what was happening in individual banks.  Now you cited specifically the Oireachtas committee meeting that I was at.  I think an interrogation of that transcript will show that I caveated my statements by drawing on what was acknowledged at the time as good authority and I referenced as my source for my statements, the IMF, the OECD, the ESRI, the Central Bank and the regulator.

It's getting a lot of air time. Authorities generally around the world are mobilising to think about what they can do in terms of contingency planning around critical systems, banking being one of them.  I think it would be appropriate to gather the banks together and to discuss this issue and try and find a mechanism to deal with it."  And they may well have ... as I said, I don't have a particular recollection of being at the meeting but they would probably have attended it.  I wouldn't be surprised because, from time to time, the Central Bank or the Department would attend a meeting because they might brief on a particular piece of legislation or an initiative that was under way and it would be an opportunity to brief members on the detail of it.</p></speech>

Sorry, I'm endeavouring to give some context to my answer.  I was also conscious that there was a smaller number of people working on prudential regulation.  But can I say to you, Senator, that I mean, the whole backdrop, the whole policy context, the whole focus was on consumer regulation.  And I made this point in Kenmare and I got some criticism for it at the time because what I said was that, ultimately, when the public woke up to the reality of what happened, they weren't interested in knowing, "I don't know what a tracker mortgage is", they wanted to know, "Is my money safe?"  And what I'm saying is and I think you .. everyone will appreciate and understand this, the ultimate guarantor of the consumer's protections is strong prudential regulation.  And my belief was that the starting point for the focus was too skewed towards consumer and conduct of business and I think the evidence that has been given thus far by Mr. Brian Patterson, by the expert reports have all validated that as well and have remarked upon it.</p></speech>

It's not to be confused with, "Are you prepared to support more resources?"  We called out a whole number of initiatives that we thought the regulator should do.  Every one of them would cost money.  And the chairman at one stage - I can't remember which chairman; there were two - I know was on the public record, I think it's in the public realm as saying that if resources were the issue, the industry would not be found wanting.  That was on the basis that we were paying 50% of the fees.  Now, by the way, just in relation to 50% of the fees, just to be clear, the 50% of the fees paid by the industry was not the industry's idea; that was what was decided by the authorities at the establishment of the regulator.  And there's a whole debate about regulatory capture and whether that can happen as a result of the fees.  Other jurisdictions, they chose to fund it from the exchequer.</p></speech>

We continue our engagement with Mr. Farrell, is that agreed? Agreed.  Okay, I just want to deal with one question there Mr. Farrell and I'll come back to you in the wrap up there.  It's in your witness statement and it's in relation of your witness statement which the IBF to prepare a note for issues raised and circulate to attendees.  It's just one, it's a minute of a ... it's a minute of a meeting, if I can get it up on the screen there just for assistance purposes.  And I just want to ask you ... I'll just refer to a particular quote on that and then if I can move on from it.  You said prior to 29 September 2008, the IBF had no mandate from the IBF council to discuss specific Government liquidity solvency support initiatives for this sector with the authorities, and was not a party to considerations by the authorities on such matters.  Now, the note here ... I just want to refer to that, so in that regard ...however in July 2007 the IBF did participate in a liquidity funding workshop, this was attended by the IBF representatives of the major banks, and a representative of CBFSAI Central Bank Financial Services Authority of Ireland.  The summary note of which was sent to Department of Finance, which I think we have here.  And can you recall the note of issues that the IBF was committed to producing from this meeting and was this circulated to the attendees?  And what were the key issues being discussed at that time?</p></speech>

Well, my ... The outline of what I said still stands obviously, that we didn't get involved in the individual banks ... in relation to liquidity solvency, business models, all that kind of thing.  Again, this was a collective discussion.  And I haven't seen this before, but to the best of my recollection ... first of all I'm not ... to the best of my recollection I don't think I was at the meeting.  I'm, I may ... again I think it would have probably been handled by our prudential director because it would have fallen into that area.</p>  <p>  I think the background to it was that at that time, and I did advert to it earlier, there was continuing tensions in liquidity terms across global markets.  And at that stage I think some time in 2007 ... around that time ... the Central Bank introduced a new liquidity regime for all the banks.  And they required a whole new reporting arrangement with the banks for liquidity.  They asked them effectively to put their liquidity requirements as they matured out into different time buckets on a cash flow basis, so that they would have a much clearer line of sight as to what the liquidity requirements of each of the banks were going forward.  And that was understandable, given the heightened situation that existed in liquidity markets generally.  And, my understanding, that meeting would have been one where the banks would have come together collectively to understand ... or to use that form to understand what exactly the nature of the requirements would be and report in terms, tease out any questions they might have, the detail of it, and such like.  And that is ... to the best of my recollection it would be my understanding of the context for the actual meeting.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Farrell.  Mr. Farrell ... this is reference, Chairman, to Mr. Farrell's book of evidence, page 27.  You might put that up on the screen, please.  And it relates to the Regling and Watson report and more particularly it relates around that the Regling and Watson, that:</p> <blockquote> 	[The] setting of macro-economic ease in growing financial integration, bank managements in Ireland faced new major opportunities.  However this environment also entailed challenges for [banks, particularly around the area of] governance. </blockquote>  <p>And Regling and Watson report goes on to say that the challenges weren't met by the banks and &quot;Errors of judgement in bank management and governance contributed centrally to Ireland's financial crisis.&quot;  The questions for Mr. Farrell are: was the Irish Banking Federation aware of these challenges its members faced?  And if not, did they feel that the IBF was fulfilling its mandate and was representing the sector's interests accurately?  And before you departed from the IBF in June 2013, what had you put in place to ensure that the IBF could accurately represent the sector's interests and ensure banks met future challenges regarding banks' governance? So it's really around the whole area of the day-to-day governance and the challenges that brought.</p></speech>

I go back again to the fact that IBF is the representative body; it is not a regulator; it doesn't have a legislative mandate to be a regulator; it doesn't have the resources to operate in the sphere of governance and to provide challenge or direction to banks around governance.  That's absolutely not its mandate.  That is the mandate of the regulatory bodies that are charged with actually regulating the sector and all of the other authorities around corporate compliance-----</p></speech>

What changes did I make?  I go back again to the situation that from the very outset the whole environment, the discourse, the context for everything that happened in regulation was heavily weighted towards consumer conduct of business rules.  In fact, when I think about all of my engagements with Oireachtas committees, I'd say 90% - up to the crisis - were all about consumer conduct of business-related rules.  There was very little, if any, discussion about prudential matters.  So there was a consensus around that the area that the focus was going to be, from a public interest point of view and from the regulator's point of view was consumer, consumer, consumer.  That, kind of, led.  So, as us ... as a representative body having to face off against regulatory authorities and so on in terms of representing members' interests, the majority of our skill sets and the people that we employed were in that space of consumer conduct of business.  And even some of the things we did which we're, you know, probably associated with - like the switching codes, consumer protection codes, the debt relief protocol with the Money Advice and Budgeting Service - they are all testament to the fact that a lot of our output was in that whole space.<br/><br/>Post the crisis I was challenged, my team were challenged, to adopt to the change in environment, so we had to re-skill the team that we had.  We brought more people in with more knowledge of prudential matters.  We hadn't a head of prudential <i>per se</i>, I don't think initially, when I was appointed.  We had a head of wholesale, which is something different-----</p></speech>

I mean, there's a number of dimensions to that.  We were all aware of the fact that there was a liquidity challenge globally and it impacted here.  It was in the public realm; it was being reported on a regular basis.  Wholesale markets were drying up.  So, of course, I was conscious of that.  As regards the situation closer to home, we had that liquidity meeting with the Central Bank where they were, obviously, showing concern and they were actually asking for a more regularised format of reports, so I was conscious of that.  Was I having meetings with individual banks about their individual liquidity positions and how they were fixed?  No.</p></speech>

Thank you very much, Deputy.  I'm going to just deal with a couple of questions myself, Mr. Farrell, and then I'll invite both Deputy Doherty and Deputy Phelan to wrap up.  Mr. Farrell, you represented both banks operating domestically and international banks, and those operating in the Irish financial services centre.  In your opinion, was Irish financial regulation policy geared towards the development of the Irish financial services centre?  And I'd like, maybe, how you would comment on how this impacted on the level of intrusiveness of regulation which might be targeted upon domestic banks as a result of a growing financial centre on the quays.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Farrell" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#OO01300"><p>That's a good question, Chairman.  I know that that has been a topic here, and it has been explored with some of the previous witnesses.  I think the conclusion of Nyberg, the conclusion of Honohan, and, indeed, of Patterson and others, has been that while there was a clause, if we'll call it that, in the mandate of the Financial Regulator, that said it should promote financial services, that the overriding mission statement was to promote and secure financial stability.  I think that, without misrepresenting them, I think they all pretty well said that that did not become a barrier to good regulation.  They also ... I think again, it has been said here that we work within an EU-wide framework of regulation so it had to be applied without fear or favour regardless whether it was international or domestic bank.  So, to the net point, I don't believe it did; I think there's a, kind of, narrative out there that says otherwise, but I don't think the evidence supports it.</p></speech>

And maybe just to test that proposition further, in earlier testimony, I think it was Mr. Roux from the Central Bank who was here, and, a line of questioning developed with him that the principles-based regulation, which is the formal term for what later became colloquially known as light-touch regulation, was an international rule; it wasn't just specific to Ireland.  But the interpretation of principles-based regulation may or may not have been applied in the appropriate way that they may have been in other jurisdictions, given the level of indebtedness and the impact of the financial crash in this country.  In any way, was the establishment of the Irish financial services centre a vehicle by which the interpretation of principles-rules regulation was applied differently in this country to other jurisdictions?</p></speech>

I mean, there was lots of evidence ... there's a debate about how much power the Financial Regulator had, and the Financial Regulator - and again I think it speaks to the evidence that's been here before - had quite a range of powers which were never utilised.  It had sectoral concentration limits which were, in their own words, "in abeyance"; it had the ability to raise capital limits for certain types of lending; it had the ability to rely on a compliance statement under company law, which was never actually called in; it had the ability to apply sanctions to the administrative sanctions regime for prudential matters, but it only ever applied them in the case of consumer.  So, I don't know what that speaks to, but I do know that, as I said, there were powers there but, as to ... what was the context for their application, non-application, I am not sure.  I don't believe it was because of the fact that there was a financial services centre here.  I mean, London has a major financial services centre; other centres, Luxembourg, they had issues during the crisis.  It didn't lead to the kind of level of crisis that we experienced in this country.</p></speech>

Referring to your opening statement, Mr. Farrell again, it may have been slightly touched on earlier, but I want to quote from it.  You say that you "noted early on that the Consumer Director sat on IFSRA's board whilst the prudential director did not".  When did you notice that, as a matter of interest, and why did you specifically reference this in your opening statement?</p></speech>

I think it has been referenced by a number of the witnesses who were directly involved in regulation that, with the benefit of hindsight perhaps, there might have been more emphasis on the consumer conduct of the business side.  That is the direction that was set.  The people involved were merely working according to the mandate they were given, but that was the mandate, and I suppose, the old adage, we have to constantly remind ourselves about like, that the ultimate guarantor for the consumer is sound prudential regulation.</p></speech>

I always tried to keep our focus on prudential, but then, you know, we were ... to a degree, we were a creature, in a sense, of the system that we worked with so, you know, our focus, ultimately, moved more towards consumer protection-type matters because that's where the direction of travel was in regulatory terms.</p></speech>

We also called out the fact that there was feedback from firms, particularly more complex firms, that they would have a desire that there would be more a focus put on ensuring that the people who were regulating them would have a deeper and more detailed understanding of their actual particular business models.  So there were some comments and observations made in that space.</p></speech>

Exact number, I suppose, in essence we were probably down to the indigenous banks, and, in the IFSC, there was some retrenchment as well, because what happened internationally was that as all banks came under pressure, there was a political desire ... I'm sorry there was political momentum and there was momentum within the banks themselves to retrench to their home markets.  In other words, let's stick to the knitting, let's look after the core markets and the customers of those core markets, which meant that a lot of subsidiary activity, IFSC, tended to run down or be closed.  I would say, and I think it's important to say it, like, the IFSC is not an abstract, kind of, concept.  As we speak, like, the IFSC employs about 35,000 people, generates about &euro;2 billion in corporate and payroll taxes, and, just by way of putting that in context, it's the equivalent of the vote for 2015 for the Department of Agriculture, Marine and Food, and for the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  So it is a substantial contributor to the Irish economy.</p></speech>

Well, just briefly, the compliance statements were being brought forward as a specific provision specifically for banks and there was already an existing compliance statement capability in the Companies Act and our view at the time, which I think was a legitimate view, was that there was potential for duplication.  I think where the thing ... I think where it finished up was and I think there is correspondence to this effect and I think it may have been referred to as well in the evidence that's been given thus far by some of the Finance people, was that the Department decided not to proceed with the compliance statements specifically to financial institutions because it was forming the view that there was adequate reliance could be placed on the provision of the compliance statement of the Companies Act and it also directly and pointedly, I think, communicated at the time to the Financial Regulator, that they did have this power, they did have this provision and they could rely on it if they required a compliance statement.  Let the record show that, as again, it's open to correction, but as from my limited investigation of it, I don't think that particular provision, i.e., seeking a compliance statement from a financial institution under the provisions that were there, was ever activated during the period.</p></speech>

So, for example, in relation to Anglo and the contracts for difference and we know that in March of that year, three months before you made this statement, that it was already seeping out to sectors that there may be an issue and that some people suggest that was the reason for the St. Patrick's Day massacre.

If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  And I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  The utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  And members of the public and journalists are reminded that these are documents and that they are confidential and should not publish any of the documents so displayed.</p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets of core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. McCarthy please.</p></speech>

The scale and impact of events which are the subject of this inquiry are such that the work of this committee constitutes an important public service.  I wish to support fully the committee in its work by answering your questions and by furnishing, as I have, a statement regarding 15 lines of inquiry before the committee.  I will seek in my answers this evening to assist the committee as much as I can, as I sought to do in my statement, by setting out matters within my direct knowledge as Secretary General to the Government within the constraints of Cabinet confidentiality and acknowledging that many were matters in respect of which I didn't have expertise or responsibility.  I will summarise my statement under six headings.  In my statement, I indicated that I believed the conclusions of the Nyberg commission of investigation provided a broadly convincing account of the circumstances that led to the crisis.  Nyberg describes serious failings by a wide range of actors, including a number of key elements of the public service.  He notes that, ''Each one is [...] responsible for their own actions and inactions contributing to the accumulation and realisation of risks in financial markets''.  </p>  <p>         Everyone who was in a senior position in the public service over the relevant period, including myself, is burdened by these failings, and the deep awareness of their human consequences.  With the knowledge and analysis of that period which is now available, like others I am challenged by the question of whether I could have done more to avert the damaging outcomes from the crisis.  My regret is tempered only by the belief that I have performed my duties to the best of my ability.</p> <p> On the regulatory regime, following consideration of the report of an implementation group, the Government approved a proposal to establish a single Financial Regulator within a restructured Central Bank.  The proposed arrangements were altered following consultation with the ECB.  The Government reviewed the provision for a separate board structure for the Financial Regulator as an important focus for accountability and responsiveness to public and consumer concerns.  Following publication of the proposed legislation in 2002, further comments were received from the ECB, as a result of which the Governor's role in relation to the budget and staffing of the regulator was strengthened.  The ECB also welcomed the fact that the Financial Regulator would remain a constituent part of the Central Bank.</p> <p> The annual reports of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator were submitted for information to the Government.  These recorded the significant number of inspections of financial institutions carried out, and regulatory returns examined.  The report in respect of 2006 highlighted that international independent reviews of the Financial Regulator's performance contain positive assessments of the regulatory system in Ireland.  In its report of 2007, the IMF supported as appropriate the risk-based framework operated by the Financial Regulator in prioritising supervisory resources.  The Government decided in 2009 to create a new, integrated regulatory system under the direction of the Governor.  The Government was advised that, pending the enactment of new legislation, the boards of the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator had made changes to the operation of the existing legislative framework through improved linkages between banking supervision and financial stability.</p> <p> On fiscal policy, the budgetary cycle involved the Minister for Finance setting out the broad economic framework within which budgetary decisions should be shaped.  This provided a context for the engagement by the Department of Finance with individual Departments to settle their spending Estimates.  The Department of Finance's proposals were based on securing financial stability and the productive capacity of the economy, while avoiding inflationary pressures and addressing priority needs.  The Department pointed out the potential for reverses, both domestic and international, associated with declining competitiveness, exchange rate movements, increases in commodity prices and the possibility of a downturn in construction activity.  The Department recommended the maintenance of a cyclically-adjusted positive general Government balance and containing the growth in current expenditure to the nominal rate of economic growth.  From 2003 to 2006, the stability programme reports presented to the Government identified a gradual and orderly reduction in housing output to a more sustainable level as a significant factor likely to impact on economic performance, partially offset by growth in other components of investment expenditure.  In the report for 2006, the potential for economy-wide consequences of construction-specific developments, such as rising interest rates, was noted.  The moderation in prices and activity in the property market in 2007 was highlighted.  The absence of a sense of impending crisis was reflected by an assessment by the IMF in 2007, which noted that the banking system was well-capitalised and profitable and that stress tests by the Central Bank indicated that even in an extreme scenario, the major lenders had adequate buffers to cover a range of shocks.  Economic policy was not formulated by Government in the belief that there was a serious risk to financial sector stability.</p> <p> The framing of budgetary proposals in Government discussions had regard to the terms of the relevant programme for Government and specific objectives adopted by the Government.  The substantial reduction in the debt-to-GNP ratio, substantial budget surpluses, significant annual transfers to the National Pensions Reserve Fund and an ambitious programme of investment in infrastructure to increase productive capacity, with little or no recourse to borrowing, created a sense of confidence with regard to fiscal matters.  There wasn't a single view about the conduct of policy or the outlook for the economy.  There was of course awareness of contrarian views occasionally expressed in the media regarding the risks of an economic collapse.  It was widely considered that this was improbable, while vulnerabilities were nonetheless acknowledged to exist.</p> <p> Most decision-making requires judging the probabilities of events occurring while striking a balance between competing objectives in the context of Government policy.  </p>  <p>         Collective responsibility requires members of the Government to support decisions once taken.  The legitimate exercise of its democratic authority by the Government must be respected by officials.  For example, the Department of Finance in its budgetary submissions signalled a preference for a lower rate of expenditure increase than occurred in a number of years.  In the years leading up to the crisis the direction of Government policy was not significantly altered in the light of parliamentary scrutiny.</p> <p> On banking matters, the primary relationship between the banking sector and the Government was through the Minister for Finance and the Department.  The banking industry was represented by the Irish Bankers Federation and Financial Services Ireland on general policy matters such as the development of the national payment system.  From the establishment of the IFSC, the Department of the Taoiseach chaired the Clearing House Group whose members included representatives from the Departments of Finance and Enterprise and Employment, the Revenue Commissioners, the Financial Regulator, the IDA and, later, Enterprise Ireland.</p> <p> The Clearing House Group and a range of associated working groups provided a forum for exchange of information and suggestions between different categories of participant in the sector.  As its name implies, the group was primarily a vehicle for commercial intelligence gathering in the context of the competition between jurisdictions for investment.  The focus of the group was the identification of opportunities and a variety of specialist activities, the marketing of Ireland and the tackling of barriers to growth, such as availability of skilled personnel.  The operation of a credible regulatory system was seen as critically important in securing the reputation of the industry and attracting appropriate new entrants.  Discussion at the Clearing House Group covered a broad range of public policy.  Concerns voiced at times about proposals which were seen as disproportionate, by reference to international practice, were pursued bilaterally with the relevant agency.  In published strategies for the future of the sector, industry representatives expressed their support for a regulatory system which was effective, consistent and efficient.</p> <p> Turning to the bank guarantee, in the period leading up to 29 September 2008 the Government was briefed on liquidity difficulties in the Irish banking system by the Minister for Finance and increased the deposit guarantee to &euro;100,000 on 20 September.  On the evening of Monday, 29 September a meeting attended by the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance and the Attorney General was advised that, unless measures were taken before the financial markets opened on Tuesday morning, irreversible damage could be done to the economy through a banking collapse.  The expectation that no Government would allow a bank to fail, especially in the aftermath of the Lehmans example, was reinforced by the potential consequences outlined to the meeting.  It was made clear that no European or ECB initiative was in prospect which would address the immediate crisis faced by Ireland.  The advice was that the Government had one opportunity to make a decisive intervention, to stabilise liquidity and secure the Irish banking system.  It would have no certainty of success but the alternative was certain disaster.</p> <p> A request to meet from the chairs and chief executives of AIB and Bank of Ireland was agreed.  The banks' representatives confirmed the gravity of the funding situation for the Irish banks, with difficulty in getting even short-term funding from the money markets.  The negative sentiment towards Ireland was focused on particular institutions, but all were now impacted.  They argued that effective action was necessary to reassure the markets.  The Taoiseach and the Minister resolved that a broad guarantee would be recommended to the Government.  The option of nationalisation of Anglo was considered, but it was concluded that such action could have more negative than positive effects on market confidence.  It was also understood that a decision to nationalise Anglo could be taken at a later date, should it be appropriate.</p> <p> The guarantee would be offered on commercial terms and would provide a framework for any measures required to build market confidence in the Irish banking system.  The approval of the Government was given by an incorporeal meeting which was conducted in the early hours of Tuesday, 30 September.  A particular concern was that the guarantee might be challenged on European state aid grounds.  It was agreed that a formal notification to the European Commission would be made immediately.  A full supporting case, including all of the material considered in the discussion, would be detailed in a submission at the earliest opportunity.  The European Commission subsequently approved the decision as an appropriate means to remedy a serious disturbance in the Irish economy.</p> <p> On the programme of assistance, in response to international concerns by mid-2010 about the State's financial position, the Government began the preparation of a medium-term expenditure framework in tandem with the fiscal responsibility framework.  </p>  <p>         It was considered that public confirmations for a recovery plan of the adoption of a comprehensive programme of fiscal reforms and specific measures to achieve the necessary deficit reduction by 2014 would improve market sentiment towards Ireland.  The continuing dependence of the Irish banks on ECB liquidity support was evident, as was a market view that further recapitalisation would be necessary.  The ECB Council conveyed to the Minister for Finance that the Government should apply for European financial support.  Department of Finance officials travelled to Brussels for exploratory discussions on the parameters of a possible programme of assistance if the Government were to decide to apply.  The tentative nature of these discussions reflected the Government's concern that the conditionality of any such programme could include unacceptable terms such as changes to the Irish corporation tax regime.  On 19 November the President of the ECB wrote to the Taoiseach and to the Minister for Finance stating that ELA could only be continued if Ireland applied to the Eurogroup for financial support and proceeded with a decisive restructuring and adequate recapitalisation of the Irish banks.  The Minister, in consultation with the Governor and the CEO of the NTMA, sought the approval of the Government for a formal request for external assistance, given that the Government could not borrow in the market at current rates and the serious liquidity problems in the Irish banks.  Some days later, the national recovery plan was published by the Government - the programme of external assistance was formally announced on 28 November.  Imposing haircuts on unguaranteed senior bondholders was raised with the international institutions during discussions on the programme of assistance.  The concept was strongly resisted because of their concern about its potential impact on wider financial stability.  In March 2011 the agreement of the ECB was sought but declined for the announcement by the Government of a statement of intent to impose burden-sharing on unguaranteed senior bondholders in Irish banking institutions in wind-down.</p> <p> On changes since the crisis, with regard to the conduct of economic policy the establishment of the Fiscal Advisory Council and the oversight by the European institutions as part of the European semester have brought a greater transparency to Irish fiscal policy.  Policy analysis is supported by greater economic expertise within the public service.  The national risk assessment framework is a positive development and the legislation to provide for the registration of lobbyists and lobbying activity should also assist in the monitoring of efforts to influence public policy.  It is clear, however, that irrespective of any structural or capacity developments that may be implemented, Governments will still be faced with a need to exercise judgment in setting fiscal policy and in assessing the risk to be taken into account in framing budgetary decisions.  That concludes my opening statement Chairman and I am happy to answer the committee's questions.</p></speech>

In your opening statement on page 11, you state that:</p> <blockquote> 	Collective responsibility requires members of the Government to support decisions once taken.  The legitimate exercise of its democratic authority by the Government must be respected by officials. </blockquote>  <p>You were Secretary to the Government and Secretary General of the Department of the Taoiseach from 2000 to 2011, so you were at the top of the Civil Service for three different Governments and three different Taoisigh.  So in that role, if you could just clarify, can you overrule a Taoiseach or Government or act against a Government's wishes?</p></speech>

I think there are certain circumstances when one would, like any public official, be required to decline to comply with a direction if it was perceived to be unlawful and there are certain circumstances in relation to the expenditure of resources when one would be entitled to seek a written direction to be copied to the C and AG.  But in general terms, overruling Taoiseach or Minister would not arise, I think.</p></speech>

I think in the formulation of policy and the furnishing of advice, the Department of the Taoiseach, through myself, would have provided a core element of information and advice, primarily in relation to the conduct of Government business, in other words, preparation for Cabinet and the management of Cabinet committees and then the particular responsibilities that the Taoiseach would discharge personally.  But the Taoiseach would also be in possession of advice from other sources, including his political advisers, his ministerial colleagues outside the Cabinet framework and obviously from other, more direct personal engagements.</p></speech>

In other areas, it would be largely a matter of co-ordinating material coming from other sources.  The Department of the Taoiseach isn't an analytical Department.  It doesn't have an extensive policy analysis function.  It primarily acts to ensure that information from other Departments and agencies is available and presented in the appropriate way.</p></speech>

How do you explain the reversal in spending in 2002, following the general election?  So, at the beginning of the year, for the first six months, spending was 22% higher, year-on-year, but, by the end of the year, it was only 14% higher and, after the election, a memo was sent by the then Minister for Finance to the Departments requesting that they cut back on expenditure.</p></speech>

I think revenues contracted another 14% in 2008, and all of the spending increases for 2008 were reversed in the budget for 2009.</p></speech>

Were you ever concerned that the Government was not using fiscal policy appropriately to manage the economy following the adoption of the euro?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.825" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#SSS00800"><p>I think that there was a concern about the need to ensure that the fiscal policy was appropriate, given the impact of the adoption of the euro, and that there should be, on a cyclically adjusted basis, a degree of headroom to provide for any reversal that might arise.  The amount of that headroom as recommended in the June or July annual submissions by the Department of Finance was pretty modest and in most years was, in fact, achieved. So one would, perhaps, assess, in retrospect, that the degree of countervailing force, if you like, to be provided by fiscal policy wasn't sufficiently understood.</p></speech>

What was your response to the European Council censure in February 2001 which said that they had "repeatedly urged the Irish authorities to ensure economic stability by means of fiscal policy, and it regretted that this advice was not reflected in the budget for 2001 despite developments in 2000 indicating an increasing extent of overheating"?</p></speech>

On the one hand there was, I think, acceptance that there was a case to be made in respect of the performance of fiscal policy, but there was also a sense of dissatisfaction that the terms of the censure was not either proportionate or equitable having regard to the performance of other member states.</p></speech>

But the actual concern it was expressing about the management of fiscal policy.  Brian Cowen said in his appearance before the committee - and this is using fiscal policy to counter for economic stability given that we didn't have monetary policy in our control anymore: "Such conditions do not appear to have received adequate attention over the period 2000 to 2006."  Do you agree with that?</p></speech>

But I think it's important to say that, as I understand it, the estimate or calculation of the cyclically adjusted balance, certainly in advance, in respect of the Irish economy, is not an easy task.  And in the core documents provided, there's reference to the extent of the recalculation by the IMF over the period of the seven months as to what the actual cyclical balance had been, in retrospect, never mind in prospect.</p></speech>

And, in that respect, I think he's probably right.</p></speech>

You were a member of the McDowell group on the establishment of a single regulatory authority for the financial services sector.  Why was your proposal for the new structure, the one that was favoured by Government ... Charlie McCreevy called it the McCarthy compromise?</p></speech>

I can't say why it was favoured by Government but I suspect it might have been for the reasons that it seemed to me to be a possible way forward, as a member of the committee.  I should say that I was representing the Department nominally because the Department had an IFSC responsibility.  At that time, I had no involvement with the IFSC, so mine was a watching brief.  And in the discussion, it seemed to me that the desire to have a focus for accountability and engagement through a board, a statutory board, which would be accountable to the Oireachtas, was important but the ... equally, it was important to have a clear, direct oversight from a financial stability point of view from the Central Bank functions.  And, therefore, it seemed to me that a process which had a focus for accountability and operational autonomy but overseen by a stability framework made sense, and I suspect it did to the members of the Government as well.</p></speech>

In other words, in the same spirit as a meeting which I had accompanied the Taoiseach to on the previous Friday, I think, in the Department of Finance.  So my expectation was that this was a briefing in anticipation of the scheduled Government meeting the following morning.  So my demeanour, if you like, my expectation in arriving was that this would be a matter of hearing a briefing and to prepare what might be put to Government.</p></speech>

Perhaps ... just to explain, my primary responsibility as Secretary to the Government was what was the Government's action and what was required of it and, therefore, the conduct of the incorporeal meeting, which ... the minutes of that, obviously, were presented subsequently to Government for signing an adaption as usual.  What transpired the following day, of course, was that there was a series of parliamentary engagements where the reasons for the decision were outlined by the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance and there was extensive briefing and speech material prepared in ... mainly in the Department of Finance for that.  It had already been decided the previous night that the notification and submission to the European Commission on the state aid issue would be done immediately and that all of the material which was considered during the course of the night would be reflected in that.  And I saw, within hours, material which suggested to me that that process was, indeed, under way and would be comprehensive.  So I didn't make a record of my own in regard to the night.</p></speech>

He had assessments which were based on judgment, in the context of a very fevered international environment, and presented with the necessity to make a rapid decision, which could only be a judgment call, there was no analytical route to the right answer.</p></speech>

If that is ... and that ... I've been told that that's what the scene was.  Now, how that changed from five or six in the evening to guaranteeing everything that moved by three or four o'clock in the morning, I don't know.  And, as I say, I think its a bad idea taking important decisions in the middle of the night. </blockquote>  <p>So, how do we go from the possibility or from possibly guaranteeing &euro;10 million, &euro;10 billion to keep Anglo open until the weekend, to guaranteeing absolutely everything in the Irish banking system?</p></speech>

And it was considered also in the, in the context of the formulation of the guarantee strategy itself, that in other words, there mightn't be an immediate beneficial impact of sufficient scale such that they would still need liquidity support.  But it was in the context of the scale of the outflows, which was reported, and very much on the explicit advice of the Governor and the Financial Regulator that in, in taking a step which mightn't be effective, there was a real risk that one would be removing the possibility of taking a second step that would be effective.  In other words, there was one shot.</p></speech>

I hope that's not me, it is me, my apologies Chairman.  I was sure I had ... I will ... indeed, apologies, Chair.  I think in light of the advices which were presented and the discussion, there would have been strong concern that if one moved to buy a day or two, that that was money that would be burnt, in the context of the immediate issue but also that the prospect then of taking effective, decisive action would be diminished.  So it wasn't seen as a viable alternative.</p></speech>

Subsequently, particularly in the evolution of the banking strategy and then later again in the run-up to the bailout decision, certainly the Minister would have had a number of conversations with president Trichet, obviously, routinely in the ECOFIN context, and he would frequently have reported those, both formally to Government and more informally.</p></speech>

And did they always manifest themselves through the Governor?  And thirdly, when the Governor spoke about such issues was it always understood to be the case that if the Governor spoke this was Jean-Claude Trichet's position?</p></speech>

The Governor, obviously, is a member of the ECB council so would normally be expected to reflect the position of the ECB in any event in terms of ECB functions.  But I think the Governor would always have made it clear if he was purporting to represent the view of the president, as such.</p></speech>

Can you elaborate on the substantive differences, if any, between the troika's position in the negotiations and the provisions within the national recovery plan?</p></speech>

It was primarily a fiscal framework for achieving the 3% deficit by 2014 with a strong set of commitments and messages about growth and jobs strategy, which, of course, were critically important in terms of debt sustainability.  So that was the primary difference.</p>  <p>  On the fiscal adjustments and the pace of the adjustment to achieve the required deficit, I don't think there were any significant differences, Senator.  Obviously, in the memorandum of understanding, some of the content of the national recovery plan was expressed in a more granular way in terms of timescales and deadlines and so on.</p></speech>

Were they specific ... to where, you know, on the fiscal plan - you said the fiscal plan was the difference, rather, that didn't include the banking side - and were they specific on where there needed to be cuts?  Mr. Cowen, when in, in his own evidence in questioning, we asked him and he said that there was flexibility.  Was there flexibility or was there... were they prescribing measures or were they just interested in the bottom line?</p></speech>

In other words, the pace of the adjustment.  And there was certainly a view that the initial phase of this multi-annual plan should be as ambitious as possible and there was discussion about figures of &euro;7 billion, &euro;8 billion, &euro;9 billion, as opposed to the &euro;6 billion which was ultimately adopted.  On the specific measures, in the course of consultation ... and I think Kevin Cardiff's evidence was correctly specific about this, that the text of the plan wasn't shared with the international institutions, to my knowledge, but there was certainly discussion about issues which might be addressed, some of a general structural kind, obviously the broadening of the tax base as part of the adjustment.  They were also, I think, very emphatic about the need for labour market adjustments and, in particular, the reduction in the national minimum wage.</p></speech>

Elements of it had been submitted to Government.  In fact, I think, perhaps in three instalments, the text was considered formally by the Government.  So while that process was under way within the Irish system, the text wasn't shared with the international parties.  That happened, I think, in the couple of days coming up to publication, which, from memory, was, I think, 24 November.</p></speech>

And that developed then into the precautionary discussions that Kevin referred to on foot of the pressure to engage in a programme of assistance.  So during that process, things which would appear ultimately in the recovery plan were certainly being discussed in substance with the Commission and IMF people but they weren't party to the drafting, shall we say.</p></speech>

That was required initially in the drafting to improve market sentiment that Ireland would be able, in fact, to achieve the targeted deficit reduction.  As things evolved, it was also necessary to be specific so that the terms of the programme of assistance would be equally clear.  So that was the overriding concern.  So there was flexibility within that framework but there was also a strong analytical base for choosing the things which were specified in terms of structural change, both on the revenue raising and the expenditure reduction side.</p></speech>

In Mr. Trichet's letter of 19 November 2010, he said and I quote, "If you don't do this, your banks will lose access to ECB and even national central bank support with disastrous consequences for your country."  Do you have any insights, perhaps, from the Department of Foreign Affairs' colleagues or bank contacts on why this letter was sent, given that it would appear from evidence, the bailout process had at least formally commenced in the months leading up to November 2010?</p></speech>

As you say, the process of, at least, preparatory engagement was well under way and I can only assume that it reflected the sense of anxiety on the part of the ECB about both the extent of their exposure to the Irish banking system, but also the broader euro situation where the fragility, the spreads <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>peripheral member states and so on were creating a very worrying outlook.  And I think the need to, in a sense, close off this particular source of instability was probably a very high issue of concern.  I've no greater insight than that.</p></speech>

I haven't paraphrased in any way.  So if it's incorrect, it's incorrect here from me.  So, then when we got the banking side of the bailout or of the agreement, was there ... whereas the Commission had been prescriptive only in part on two issues and suggested that you could usefully look at the minimum wage issue and the service agreements issue, did the ECB take a similar benign approach to the banking side and allow you to make the suggestions or was it a case that as, "We had the use of a quarter of their loan book'', as another witness put it, they were going to call the tune?</p></speech>

There was, obviously, concern in the Irish side, the Government side, that the cost of taking on capital commitments should be kept to the minimum, and that the degree of capitalisation should provide only enough, and not more than enough, to meet all the, if you like, prudential and objective requirements.  Obviously, there was a concern that the degree of capitalisation shouldn't produce negative outcomes, such as, for example, the desire to have a rapid deleveraging of the assets of the Irish banking system, which could produce significant losses and further capital requirements.  So, there was certainly tension in the process around that issue and the outcome, as you know, was a combination of a direct and immediate or almost immediate, draw-down and capitalisation.  And a contingency provision which would be brought into play following the prudential capital assessment.</p></speech>

I've asked this to a lot of the secretaries of Departments that were in: can you outline if there were any requests from political outside bodies or otherwise, for reductions in expenditure or increases in taxation between 2000 and 2011?  Other than from people like the IMF.  I mean, I'm talking civil society, politicians, interest groups, unions.</p></speech>

Thank you.  Mr. McCarthy, I'll just deal with one or two issues and propose we might take a little bit of a break then.  Mr. McCarthy, on ... Kevin Cardiff stated in testimony that a one-page draft guarantee document was produced on the night, this is the night of the guarantee, and it was copied and was circulated.  So, I'll just bring up ... it's coming up there, Mr. Cardiff's statement, you'll see it there as the paragraph ... at the lower side of the page, it says, &quot;In fact, the decision/press release went through, probably, a dozen drafts, each one mostly only a little different to the previous, before it was finalised.&quot;  When this was discussed further with Mr. Cardiff, when he was before the inquiry, there was an engagement between Deputy Doherty and Mr. Cardiff which ... the transcript would read, Deputy Doherty speaking says, &quot;Okay and the 12 drafts of the statement that you mentioned in your opening statement that were created, were any of them circulated or were they saved on your computer, or were they just ... was it an open file that kept continued to be edited?&quot; and so on, to which Mr. Cardiff replied:</p> <blockquote> 	It was probably an open file.  I was sitting at the computer of a guy called Joe Lennon who was one of the Taoiseach's advisers simply because his room happened to be next door.  I think Joe or someone else was going in and out.  I might have been in and out myself but that it was an iterative process. </blockquote>  <p>Deputy Doherty then said &quot;So none of those documents were ... none of those drafts were circulated at any time to the meeting ... any of [those] drafts?&quot;  To which Mr. Cardiff says: &quot;Oh, no, they were all circulated at the meeting.&quot;  So the 12 drafts found themselves in the room at every given stage.  Do you know who produced this draft document right from the get-go and did you receive a copy and what eventually was done with the copy circulated?</p></speech>

I've seen that in material which was sent to me yesterday.  I wasn't aware, until the evidence of William Beausang, that there was a draft generated in the Central Bank.  There was a draft on, on the night, which was produced.  But, it was produced, as I understood, from within the room, so to speak, or from Kevin, Kevin Cardiff's drafting.  It did go through a number of iterations in discussion-----</p></speech>

One was in terms of the giving of six months notice for the termination of the guarantee; that was removed.  There was another, which I can't immediately recall, but in terms of the spread ... Sorry, the second change was the reference to all institutions being solvent, that warranty by the regulator.</p></speech>

But the substantive part of the statement is whether the banks were going to be included in it or totally included or as not, which I would imagine would be a very significant moment in that draft at whatever stage.  So at what stage do you recall that actually being in there?</p></speech>

I think William Beausang referred to 9.20 p.m. or 9.30 p.m. as being when he received this draft.  My recollection is that it would have been considerably later than that before there was a text on the table.</p></speech>

And I recall, vaguely, seeing documentation which, I think, might have been being put together for the Nyberg commission, which had that material so unless I am misremembering, I think there should be the possibility of recovering at least some of them.</p></speech>

Mr. Sheehy said in his evidence that the expression about solvency, about the banks being all solvent, that that would be in the final draft and it was taken out.  I am just wondering what your recollection of that particular part of the draft was?</p></speech>

I cannot say how early, but in an earlier version of the text, certainly it did refer to the Financial Regulator confirming that all of the institutions were solvent.  But I do recall in the discussion that the regulator was uncomfortable with that, not because he didn't believe it but because in effect a public assertion of that in a Government statement would carry market implications.  Now, I saw Mr. Sheehy's evidence to the committee and I have no doubt there was also a parallel, perhaps, conversation, but I do recall the regulator being unhappy that that would be expressed in that way.</p></speech>

I just want to deal with one issue with regard to the guarantee on a more macro level with you, Mr. McCarthy, before we break.  And that's to put the question to you: in your opinion did the duration of the guarantee, which was a two-year duration, create the conditions for the funding cliff that precipitated the bailout?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1043" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#DDDD00100"><p>It may have done, Chairman, in this sense: that clearly a time-limited guarantee was always going to create an exit issue.  Now, that was anticipated quite early on and my recollection is that, in early 2009, the Minister sought the approval of the Government to seek agreement for a variant on the guarantee scheme to allow the issue of longer-term bonds and there was then a new scheme, the eligible liabilities guarantee scheme, which was approved by the Commission much later in 2009.  Then there was the question of extending the period from September 2010 and, from recollection, I think it was June, or mid-year, that that approval was received.  So, there were attempts to avert that cliff situation emerging but, I think, in practice, it did contribute to the timing, the build-up of those liquidity pressures in the latter part of 2010.</p></speech>

But that wasn't, obviously, the sole motivation because the ongoing liquidity challenges and, indeed, the recapitalisation programme-----</p></speech>

In particular, the level of the haircut and the period that it took to make the transfer.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy, you're excused ... or suspended.  So, the witness is reminded that once he begins giving evidence, he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to his evidence or matters that are being discussed before the committee.

There were grounds for believing that it might, as there were for other issues, like collateralisation, and I think the Government, in my view, rightly, decided that it wouldn't be pressed to confirm that it was applying until it was satisfied that such unacceptable conditions were not going to arise.</p></speech>

The question was what would be effective in achieving the outcome which stability required.  In the particular case about the national minimum wage, which I mentioned, I do recall that as being referenced as a matter of particular interest from the Commission.  It coincided with a view, developing in the Irish system, that, perhaps, this was, indeed, a timely way of stimulating employment growth in, in effect, the low wage, low productivity areas of the economy.</p></speech>

So I think that was the context in which I would have made that observation.  It sounds like the sort of contribution I would have made in other contexts too.</p></speech>

We have evidence that certain people in the room argued for a nationalisation.  Which side were you on?</p></speech>

So I was listening to the debate to, I suppose, assist the Taoiseach in trying to refine what were the net issues.  And it seemed to me on the particular issue of nationalisation that the case that this was something which could have a negative as opposed to a positive outcome, was credible.  And it was enhanced by the fact that you could move on and nationalise later.  But if you made an announcement about nationalisation that wasn't well received, you couldn't undo it.  So from a purely prudential practice point of view, it seemed a logical approach to take and in that sense I was happy.</p></speech>

The committee has heard evidence that the issue of solvency was, and this is paraphrasing, but was part of that argument or the loan book of the banks was part of that argument.  From your understanding of being present on the night, what was the rationale to nationalise one of the banks instead of guaranteeing it?</p></speech>

In fact, there were, as the committee has heard, strong assertions from the regulator that the bank was solvent.  But the question was was the negative sentiment towards it creating a negative overspill across the rest of the system.  So being seen to engage with that, address it and, in a sense, send a message that restructuring of some kind would occur was, I think, the attraction.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy, on page ... sorry, page 4 of your own statement, you say, "The European Commission and the ECB favoured a front loading of adjustment within an overall adjustment of at least &euro;15bn by 2014."  Do you recall what rationale they provided for that kind of adjustment in such a short period of time?  Do you also recall what the Irish view was and what the IMF view was?</p></speech>

So, I think that was their ... their concern.  On the Irish side, there was a view that there certainly needed to be credibility about the achievement of the required reduction in the deficit but that that pace of adjustment would cause economic and social dislocation beyond the benefits which it would create.  </p>  <p>         So ... and in the end, there was agreement on a figure of &euro;6 billion, which seemed to be a balanced assessment.</p></speech>

Now again, I'm asking whether or not this information here, relating to the Quinn Group, would have been known by the Taoiseach?  I appreciate now that he was on the way out as Taoiseach and there was a new Taoiseach coming in but, I'm talking here about Mr. Ahern, whether or not you in your role would have been aware of this information relating to Se&aacute;n Quinn and the contracts for difference?</p></speech>

So, in ... Mr. Cowen has given evidence that he would have been notified some time in March about the contracts for difference.  So, you're saying you were not aware?  You, as Mr. McCarthy, were not aware and you're not aware whether Mr. Ahern was aware?</p></speech>

In the first, they certainly did make, if you like, prepared presentations, if you like, of the situation as they saw it.  And they were asked to develop various points, mainly by the Governor, who was engaging, and I think the Taoiseach had asked him to, in a sense, lead the reaction from the official side.  And the Taoiseach and Minister, as I recall, said very little in that first phase.  There was a second phase in relation to their capacity to provide liquidity support if that was required.  In fact, that second phase was the asking of them to consider whether they could and I think the third phase was the response to that as a proposition.</p></speech>

Mr. Cardiff has given evidence that it was his view that the Taoiseach, if you like, seemed predisposed at the start of the meeting pretty much to ... towards a guarantee.  Now, I know that you missed ... I think you missed the beginning ... the very beginning of the meeting, but I think you did say in evidence here today that you had thought it was a briefing meeting for the Cabinet meeting that was due the next day.  So how did it turn into something else altogether?  And do you think that the Taoiseach was so predisposed?  Thank you, Chair.</p></speech>

I don't know what was the particular context that led to the calling of the meeting.  So it might have been more than that in the Taoiseach's mind, for example.</p></speech>

My recollection is that it was the Minister for Finance indicated that the bank representatives wanted to come in.  It may have been already known to the Taoiseach that this was going to happen, but that was the first that I heard of it.  </p>  <p>         In terms of whether the Taoiseach had a predisposition, that wasn't my sense.  I think he was reacting to the strong view from the Governor and the regulator that a firm, decisive intervention was required in the context of something which was now not just system-wide from an Irish point of view, but was rapidly becoming an international financial meltdown.  So I think it was in that context that, if you like, his steering of the conversation probably headed in that direction.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy, you're very welcome.  Can I start by asking you about some evidence given by Kevin Cardiff when he commented that ... on the decision to enter into bailout negotiations in November 2010, he said the communication at ministerial level over the weekend prior to the announcement of the start of negotiations had not been clear enough to prevent them walking into trouble, referring to Ministers Dempsey and Ahern, in particular.  So can you please set out what steps, if any, were communicated to you to ensure that there was a harmonised message across Government around this time on the entry into negotiations?</p></speech>

In a communications situation like that, the Taoiseach would normally engage directly with the Minister for Finance and then with the Government press secretary and the Finance press officer.  I think that there was probably some ... I believe the Ministers concerned did indicate that they had made some efforts to get a steer, so to speak, but I wasn't privy to that.</p></speech>

Okay.  Can I just clear up one issue with you?  Were you present when the banks, Bank of Ireland and AIB, were informed of the Government decision to go down the guarantee route because we've had conflicting evidence from Bank of Ireland and AIB?  Bank of Ireland's evidence was that they certainly knew on the night and left Government Buildings on the clear understanding, having been informed that there would be a guarantee whereas Eugene Sheehy of AIB said he woke up to the news the following morning.</p></speech>

You say on page 11 of your witness statement, when you speak about parliamentary scrutiny, that, "As a general observation, it is understandably more likely that parliamentary time and political engagement will arise in respect of specific actions or measures rather than broader policies and options".  Is that your experience of what happened in the time that you were Secretary General to the Government - as an observer of parliamentary scrutiny - that the focus was on, you know, specific issues rather than overall policy direction and major systemic issues?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1185" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#UUUU00500"><p>I think it would be my, sort of, very broad characterisation of, if you like, the way in which Government was held to account by the Oireachtas that it gathered life, if you like, in terms of specifics, either done or undone, rather than the broader issues.  And, for example, given I had a particular association with social partnership, I was always surprised - and maybe at some level disappointed - that there was never much interest in debating social partnership agreements or NESC strategy reports or whatever, even though, for example, at the Taoiseach's request, I did suggest to the committee on Seanad reform at one point that they might take a particular interest in engaging with NESC and the social partnership process.  So it's just a general observation.</p></speech>

So would you say that that represented a failing of Oireachtas scrutiny, that lack of attention maybe on the bigger issues, the bigger questions, as opposed to, you know, maybe local issues or specific Government decisions rather than policy direction.  Was it a failing in your view, or not?</p></speech>

And I think Government, of course, should do the right thing, the public service should prepare the right advice.  But I think it would have added to the challenge - which Wright concludes was absent - had the Oireachtas been more systematically focused on the analysis of strategy.</p></speech>

But also because of the desire to give a clear, unambiguous, definitive message through the guarantee.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy, you were present at this crisis meeting, liquidity crisis meeting, on 25 September as Secretary General to the Government.  Do you recall that meeting?  Do you recall the reference to what David Doyle said, for example, about potential loss exposures in Anglo and Irish Nationwide, &euro;2 billion after capital in the case of INBS, Anglo could be &euro;8.5 billion and - we're just closing off a line of evidence here; it's been difficult to get to the bottom of this issue - but do you recall it by any chance?</p></speech>

I suppose the context of that question is: was there any suggestion then, or right up to the point where the decision was made to guarantee the banks, that we may have to put capital in behind our decision, that the banks may need additional capital because of loan losses that are coming down the track?  Was that ever suggested?  Was it ever there in the background to the decision?</p></speech>

I'm not sure that anyone proposed or voiced the view that a specific State recapitalisation would be required but some element of restructuring certainly was envisaged.</p></speech>

In all of the advice and information that was available on the night, I think it was the appropriate response, given the risk assessments that were offered.  With the benefit of hindsight, if the knowledge base was what we now know about the vulnerabilities, I don't think we would have got to the night of the guarantee in that way.  So, if you like, both in terms of what was presented and what might be a plausible counter-factual, it probably was the right thing.</p></speech>

And can I put it to you that the deposit guarantee scheme was an increase from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 - a fivefold increase, we were multiple of what other jurisdictions moved up to, you know?  I suppose what I'm asking you was, were you and the Executive trying to do too much with one fell swoop?</p></speech>

In a sense, the increment was from a strong guarantee of retail deposits, which worked in the retail market, into a collapse, or what appeared to be a collapse, of the whole interbank funding system internationally.  So, in that sense, the need for, if you like, a decisive game changer appeared to be unarguable.</p></speech>

They were frozen and small countries generally, small banks in small countries, and Ireland, in particular, was at the sharp end of that, so the availability of normal short-term funding had dried up.  So that was one issue.  The question of whether separately there was a lack of market confidence in the banks as ongoing institutions, I think it is true that there was concern, more than concern at their property exposure in an environment where property-related exposures across the international system were regarded as deeply problematic.  Whether that meant that the market was calling it correctly, in so far as that was a market view at that time, I'm not really in a position to say.</p></speech>

On 30 April this year in Kilmainham, Jean-Claude Trichet, the former ECB President, said that Ireland had "total expenditure on compensation of employees in the public sector grew by close to 200% between 1998 and 2008 [ten-year period] compared to the [EU] area figure average of ... 45%" over that period.  The social partnership agreements, including benchmarking, played a pivotal role in that respect.  Thus when determining the pay terms of social partnership agreements, did external benchmarking with other economies feature as part of the process?  If you actually might elaborate and if no, did this give rise to economic risk?  And it's coming, Chairman, the reference ... it's Vol. 1. pages 21-34.</p></speech>

The social partnership rounds, if you like, and the benchmarking exercise, at least the first one.  On the pay determination, the public service pay agreements were, in a sense, a function of the private sector agreement.  The process of wage negotiation under social partnership was, while there was a joint employer representation of IBEC, CIF and Department of Finance and Congress on the other side, in fact, the structure of the agreements were somewhat different but the primary mover, so to speak, was the private sector agreement, which tended to be reflected more or less in identical terms but with different phasing and generally a pay pause relative to the private sector one.  The actual levels of the increases were broadly shaped by inflation.  It was an inflation-based bargaining process, in essence, certainly after the year 2000, when tax relief wasn't factored in as a-----</p></speech>

That wasn't acceptable to the union side and the employers had to formulate their offers in that context.</p></speech>

Could I look at Vol. 2 of your own book, Mr. McCarthy, on page 89?  What it refers to, Chairman, is a reply to Mr. Trichet in two lines, "I wish to acknowledge receipt of your letter and enclosure of 16 October [2008] which will be brought to the Taoiseach's attention as soon as possible."  And the date of that non-response, if you like, or just acknowledgement, is 30 October.  And when you turn over the page, Mr. Trichet was making suggestions like the ECB opinion notes that, "I am writing to request that the Irish Government arrange that interbank deposits with a maturity of up to three months be excluded from the liabilities covered under the draft scheme."  What was happening?  There was such a delay in reply.  He was our paymaster and he was making a suggestion which would have saved us money.  And we said, "Yeah, we got your letter a fortnight ago."  When did we actually reply to Mr. Trichet in that correspondence?</p></speech>

In fact, I believe it cited the financial stability reports that Senator D'Arcy was referring to earlier.  It ... as I recall, it did anticipate, as, indeed, did the Department of Finance, that there would be a reduction in the level of housing output.  It looked at issues like the potential impact of land hoarding on the price of land and, thereby, the price of houses.  It's broad conclusion was that, if you like, the economic rent that was extracted through the capitalisation of reduced interest rates on the price of housing had largely worked out of the system because the ... by that time there was an easing, at least at that time, there was an easing in house prices, and there ... the analysis suggested that, while there had been this very significant output of housing, that there were still very substantial unmet needs, in the greater Dublin area in particular, and for people on low to modest incomes, and they recommended that over time the level of provision of social housing, and a more effective set of supports to the private rented sector, should support housing output as the private demand attenuated.  So, I think that was the broad analysis.  It wasn't forecasting a collapse, the hard landing, it-----</p></speech>

From my reading of the material, wasn't there an amazing failure to respond between August 2007 and the collapse at the end of September 2008?

On that particular issue, I think there was an orientation to define the problem as a liquidity one, and it was, of course, in origin, a liquidity one, which meant that the concern about the solvency question, the capital adequacy, the potential exposure on loan books, and so on, wasn't engaged with as early as it arguably should have been.</p></speech>

NAMA found records ... were totally defective?  Did some of them disappear in this interval between being bailed out and eventually we got around to seeing what the total bill was?

In the event that ... the scheme of the guarantee, in other words, the particular commitments that covered institutions had to enter into in order to access the guarantee, was quite broad and directive and it gave enhanced powers to the regulator in terms of the conduct of the institution, its funding strategies, as well its loan book ... its management of its loan book.  So in a sense the framework for ... not just due diligence but acting on the due diligence was created by the scheme itself.  But that was very much a second best to having had that degree of oversight and engagement and knowledge well in advance of the guarantee.</p></speech>

I'll try not to be repetitive, some of them may have been asked already but, firstly, I just ... you wore many hats, I suppose, in your time as Secretary General to the Government and Secretary General to the Department of Taoiseach ... I should say Secretary to the Government and - it's been referred to earlier on - your chairmanship of the NESC and also your role in regard to social partnership.  And, therefore, you could be said, I suppose, to have been in a particularly strong position to observe the interconnectedness between different public bodies that led ... or that existed prior to the banking crisis.  Against that background, what, if any, follow-up analysis was done internally within the Department of the Taoiseach or, indeed, the NESC on contrarian views on the soft landing theory?  We've had different evidence from many witnesses going back to the start of the inquiry, a lot of it outlining that the soft landing rarely if ever materialised in other jurisdictions but there was a belief in this country that it was going to be ... we were going to be a different case, among certain people.  Has there ever been any analysis along the lines I'm asking conducted?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1345" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#BBBBB01000"><p>I believe that the NESC, in relatively recent times, has produced a number of studies of what happened in the housing market including, it has to be said, its own misreading of some aspects of the situation when the housing report was produced in 2004.  Why the dots weren't joined up in a sense is, I think, your question, Deputy, and that's something I've tried to reflect on.  And part of the answer, I think, lies in issues which were raised before the committee by John FitzGerald and Alan Ahearne, that there was a ... there was a certain segregation of financial stability issues from others and, as Wright observed in his report in the Department of Finance, if you like, a bringing together of the different dimensions of risk weren't ... wasn't effected.  It certainly wasn't communicated to the Government.  I think we were perhaps distracted by a number of things which were ultimately peripherally important.  Like, for example, we had no exposure to the US sub-prime problem, which seemed to be the initial origin of the international financial crisis.  </p>  <p>         The fact that our fiscal outcomes were so impressive and ... and, I mean, at a particular point in the mid-2000s, one of the tasks of the Taoiseach's Department was to organise the orderly management of the international delegations coming to see how the Irish situation was so successful.  So there was, I think, ultimately, if you strip it all away, there was a failure of analytical rigour and I don't think that can be laid at the door of the political system.</p></speech>

By 2008, it had risen to &euro;18.8 billion, an increase of 120%.  Now, I know you weren't Secretary General to the Department of Finance but, obviously, you had a role in relation to social partnership and you had an overall role as the person who would have been regarded as the most senior civil servant.  Were there any alarm bells ringing for you at that eight-year, 120% increase in the cost of the public service, if you like, in general?  And did you raise any of those concerns, if you had ... if you had them?</p></speech>

There was the increase in head count and there had been very significant and deliberate increases in the staffing of a whole variety of services which were regarded as underdeveloped.  Then there was the question of the rates of pay, which were, in effect, a function of, as I mentioned earlier, the levels agreed in the private sector and, in a sense, that's as it should be, that the public service should follow rather than lead.  In aggregate, the affordability of this and the competitiveness dimension of the overall situation were concerns and there was clearly going to be an adjustment required, which was, in fact, explicitly referenced in the text of the social partnership agreement in 2006, "Towards 2016".  And I was interested to see, in the documents sent to me, background papers prepared in the Department of Finance, which I hadn't seen before, regarding the desired outcome of those discussions and I was, I suppose, pleasantly surprised to see that the text of what they desired was actually reflected in the text of the outcome, so they were obviously making their contribution.  So, an adjustment to a different path, both in terms of the composition of output and the funding of the State, was flagged, was expected but was, I believe - and I did believe - something which would evolve in a ... not in the teeth of a collapse.</p></speech>

Can I ask, in relation to again your role as Secretary General to the Department of the Taoiseach, in your time in that period you worked with three different holders of the office.  Mr. Cowen was here on two separate occasions and he outlined to the inquiry how he placed ... or I suppose I'm paraphrasing him really now, but he felt that there were people who had responsibilities - such as the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator - and that he let them do their job, I suppose, so to speak, and he relied on the evidence and the information that they gave him.  Do you think that there was any substantial difference between the three holders of the office in your time period, in terms of how they viewed the information that they were getting from those quarters?  And I might have a bit of a follow-up on that, but if you could answer that maybe first.</p></speech>

I'm not sure that the ... that those differences of approach would ultimately have had any great bearing on the sort of input or impact that the authorities would have had because, unfortunately, it doesn't look as though they had the wherewithal to convey the right message.</p></speech>

Others, most notably witnesses that we've had from the ... previously maybe working with the NTMA, expressed concern with regards to the capacity of the regulator, in particular, to do the functions that were delegated to that authority.  Did you at any point in time share any of those or have any cause to have concerns about the capacity of the regulator to perform their function?  And, in particular, I suppose, I'm asking the question in relation to ... or did you ever get involved in a discussion in relation to the number of staff that would have been doing the prudential regulation of financial institutions?</p></speech>

My main ... in fact, until the period of the crisis, my only engagement with the regulator was in the context of the IFSC, and staff from the regulator would attend meetings with the clearing house group, and I'd have to say my observation in that forum was that they were confident and competent in their interactions.  They sometimes came under pressure, which I understand might still be an issue, about things like the timeliness of turnaround of applications for authorisation and clarity about new forms of authorisation and so on, but my observation was that they engaged with those robustly and didn't display anything that would've caused me to doubt their competence at least in those areas that came up for discussion.</p></speech>

Finally and briefly, we've had evidence particularly, I think, from Mr. Cardiff in relation to not just outside forces, but individuals and groups that came to him and maybe others within government prior in the earlier part of 2008 before the guarantee outlining the possible need for a political guarantee and then maybe a more extensive guarantee.  Were you aware of those approaches yourself and did anybody in that time period approach you on those matters?</p></speech>

I'll just wrap up with a couple of questions, Mr. McCarthy, and then Ill invite the two leads to wrap up as well and any closing comments you may wish to make yourself.  I just want to bring a minute up on the screen there just for a moment.  It's in your own book of evidence, its DOF01B02.  It's a minute of a meeting where there is a discussion with liquidity and insolvency, in particular to Anglo and INBS and so forth.

And the short note there, I think, does capture, as I recall, the range of issues that would have been covered in the presentation.  It wasn't an occasion when any decision was expected and, certainly as I recall, none was made.</p></speech>

Given the nature and the seriousness of obviously what was being discussed here, could I put the question to you, Mr. McCarthy, when even approximately - I'm not looking for the specific hour or the specific date, but by approximation - did you become aware that the whole, say, borrowings situation presented a systemic risk?  And how was this risk relayed to you, and by whom?</p></speech>

No later than quarter 2 of 2008, okay.</p>  <p>  If I can just deal with one final issue then, Mr. McCarthy.  There's a table in your evidence book there, and I just want to bring that up.  And the two tables relate ... one is a ... it deals with sectoral lending volumes, in billions, and you can see a, kind of a, significant growth factor there from ... going from '01 into '02 and then a massive escalation ... quite significant escalation where we go from just in about ... I reckon these are millions ... I'm assuming ... in around &euro;50 million in around 2003 up to &euro;250 million in 2007.  There's quite a big peak.  And there's another table here ... sorry, they're billions actually.  I've just been ... they're not millions, they're actually billions.  I just wanted to bring up another table there as well for you and that relates to the increases in public services allocations.  These are from 2000 to 2008.  What we see here is in millions again, but if you remove the commas, I presume ... or go by the commas, they're actually billions.  We see, in social welfare, an increase in that period of 160%.  That's from &euro;6 billion to over &euro;17 billion; in education, just under &euro;4 billion to &euro;8.5 billion - I'm just giving the approximate figures here now to you; health, of just under &euro;5.5 billion to &euro;15 billion or, actually, over &euro;15 billion; capital investment going from &euro;9 billion up to &euro;9 billion; total expenditure going from just under &euro;26 billion to over &euro;62 billion, an increase of 141%; in terms of GDP, expenditure of plus 71%.  Okay, so in regard to that table, what we see here is a huge increase in public expenditure allocations between 2000 and 2008 at 141% in total, which was precisely double the growth in GDP over the same period.  As I then say, when combined with the statistics on the parallel major growth in construction-related lending, were these two sets of figures alone not sufficient warning for Government that a bubble was being created?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1371" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#EEEEE00700"><p>Well, on the expansion in credit, Chairman, clearly, it is a very dramatic increase, but the interpretation of that in terms of risk to financial stability was something which Government would have relied on a Finance assessment to ... to create and they, I suspect, in turn, were taking full account of the financial stability report from the Central Bank, and it ... I think it's a matter of fact from previous reports that the assessment, the tone, and the messaging didn't flag that this was something which threatened financial stability.  It created vulnerabilities but not a pending crisis.</p>  <p>  On the expenditure increases, they were very significant, but as a result, I suppose, of the strong output, in particular, from the construction sector, their funding was ... appeared to be accommodated in a way which was compatible with a strong fiscal outcome.  In reality, the elements of a bubble were building up, but if you like, the distillation of that into a clear analysis and message wasn't received.</p></speech>

And putting aside concepts like groupthink, herd instinct, and all the rest, if somebody just arrived to these figures coldly, not taking on the, kind of, media environment or influences or anything, just looked at these figures coldly, should they be giving at least amber signals that there is potentially a problem here?</p></speech>

But the ... in the messaging as received, it was amber and not red.</p></speech>

So in your view was Government aware at that time that there was an amber light, to use that parlance?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1375" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dermot McCarthy" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015071500002#FFFFF00400"><p>I believe so, Chairman.  Certainly by, I think, 2006 the ... if you like ... the amber was very visible.  It might have been flashing a bit earlier.  But the emphasis, if you like, in terms of the risk to economic performance that were highlighted included the potential downturn in the construction side.  But also issues like exchange rate movement, commodity prices, the fate of the US economy.  By contrast with those issues, this was something under, potentially, some measure of domestic control.  What the messaging was understood to be saying was that it was no different, in terms of its risk significance, to those other issues.</p></speech>

You'd have been familiar with that messaging as well at the time.  In regard to that messaging, are you aware of any evidence, and I'm not talking about commentary that's taken from third parties or external agencies that are not in Government but NGOs, financial institutions, whatever.  I'm talking about evidence that was either in the Department of Finance or in the Department of the Taoiseach that supported - and I'm talking about evidence-based support now, as opposed to commentary-based support, that supported a soft landing theory?</p></speech>

And they would have been advising that an orderly transition to a lower sustainable output was what was to come.  My recollection is that the ESRI medium-term review in 2003 and their <i>ex-ante</i>appraisal of the national development plan in 2006 did provide analysis of the housing market that concluded with forecasts of housing demand and output that the soft landing was a credible and likely outcome.</p></speech>

Just three brief questions.  We had in evidence from Ann Nolan that before nationalisation of Anglo could take place that the bond agreements would have to be analysed and looked at and ... to see what was there.  But at the same time the Government was preparing legislation for nationalisation of a bank, more than likely Anglo.  So were you preparing for nationalisation of Anglo in the run up to that night of the guarantee, including that night, without having done the due diligence work on the bond agreements in the bank?</p></speech>

In terms of the percentage rate, 5.8% not being reasonable it said in one of the core documents there rather than bring it back up, and there was a quote where it was estimated that the most comparable rate for eight-year money at the time was 6.02%.

I think this was the first time in which, in which the new support mechanisms were being applied and in, in the way in which they were deployed there was as much attention in my view, from what I could observe, on protecting the interest of the contributors, as ensuring the effectiveness with the recipient, so that the interest rate was ... it was reasonable, having regard to the alternative market rates but it was certainly posing a significant sustainability issue.  And it was flagged as an area of particular concern, both by the Governor and the CEO of the NTMA, as well as the Department of Finance and it was clear ... that opportunities would have to be sought to bring about a lower rate at the right time.</p></speech>

Would you like to revisit that on the basis of what you said to do with lobbying?  I mean do you feel that there was excessive lobbying or did this have an unhealthy input, or why do you feel things are better now or will be better with the registration of lobbyists, if you, if you said earlier that there was no ... you saw nothing in your 11 years?</p></speech>

I ... my view is that it's healthy to have that as transparent as possible and that the merits of what people are being asked to take on board can be assessed.  I don't believe that Government was too vulnerable to lobbying effort.  I did believe and do believe that lobbying capacity is not equally distributed around society and one of the strengths of social partnership was that it gave everyone a seat at the lobby table and they had to listen to each other.  There are other ways of doing social dialogue, clearly, but all of that is supported, in my view, by a good regime and a realistic regime for monitoring lobbying activity.</p></speech>

I want to speak briefly about what has happened since last Sunday or early Monday morning.  I will place it in the context of successive so-called rescues of Greece and draw a few conclusions about what this may mean for the eurozone going forward.  First, we need to be clear that what emerged at the weekend has not moved Greece any closer to an exit from reliance on official lenders.  The economic situation remains very grim.  The Greek economy looked briefly last summer as if it was beginning to recover.  There was then a political crisis towards the end of the year and things began to turn downwards.  We do not have very recent data but with the banking system closed down, as a result of actions by the ECB, in the middle of tourism season, it is reasonable to guess that economic activity in Greece is declining.<br/><br/>A number of forecasts are quoted this morning in the <i>Financial Times</i>from people who think that output will be down again this year.  The events of the weekend have also reminded people that there are fundamental design flaws in the eurozone and that these have yet to be properly addressed.  <br/><br/>I want to say a few things about this third Greek rescue.  Of course, it has not been negotiated yet.  All that happened at the weekend was that a process was initiated and there will now be discussions and negotiations that may eventually lead to a third so-called rescue programme for Greece.<br/><br/>I will give a little bit of background.  When states lose access to the private sovereign debt markets they can no longer run budget deficits, nor can they replace historic borrowings as they fall due.  Unless they can get some form of non-market finance, they will be forced immediately into possibly highly destructive fiscal corrections.  There are international mechanisms to avoid that.  The most important one is the IMF, which is a kind of credit union for governments.  Governments can go there if they can no longer finance themselves on the private debt markets.<br/><br/>In Europe we now have a common currency and arrangements have emerged in crisis circumstances in Europe.  As members of the joint committee know, the IMF has been corralled into these.The objective of official lending programmes as traditionally provided by the IMF has been simple - it is to return the distressed country as quickly as possible to credit-worthiness and hence to market access, without unnecessarily severe contractions in economic activity.  That is the objective of these programmes.  Sometimes they work and sometimes they do not, but mostly they have worked around the world.<br/><br/>We had a second programme for Greece in 2012.  This is the third one.  A second programmes means that the first programme failed and a third programme means that the second programme also failed.  The third Greek programme remains to be negotiated.  It will have to be implemented against the background of an economy which seems to be contracting again.  The banks are closed for business and will probably require yet another recapitalisation.  Greek government debt is already approaching 180% of GDP.  Some people feel that it will now rise to 200% if the rumoured terms of the third programme are enacted.<br/><br/>Of course, Greece has already been in default twice to the IMF.  The summit communiqu&eacute; released on Monday morning indicates that the third programme will have the following features; no early recapitalisation of the banking system that is not provided for in the communiqu&eacute;.  The communiqu&eacute; is only a draft.  It was done in a hurry and is also very badly written.  The detailed programme may fill in some of the gaps.  As of now, however, there is no provision for the early recapitalisation of the banks, or even for the early re-opening of the banking system; a renewed and front-loaded fiscal contraction - this, it should be borne in mind, in an economy that is almost certainly contracting again; and third, no write-down of state debt.<br/><br/>Commentators have already warned that a programme along these lines will likely see GDP in Greece not just fail to stabilise but also possibly to contract further.  I have cited two references to short pieces that were published yesterday and which are worth looking at.  There has been a score of other pieces by economic and financial commentators around the world, which are along the same lines.  They identify a high degree of risk that the third programme for Greece will also fail.<br/><br/>I would remind members of the committee that there is a third programme because the second one failed and there was a second one because the first one failed.  These people are predicting that there will be a fourth.<br/><br/>The communiqu&eacute; lists a series of reform measures, some of which could assist economic recovery in the longer term.  None of them is likely to have sufficient effect inside the programme horizon to offset the negative impact of new expenditure cuts and new tax increases.<br/><br/>I want to go back briefly to the first Greek rescue in 2010.</p><p>The financial crisis erupted around the world in 2008.  The European sovereign debt crisis started in Greece in 2010.  There had been weakness in various peripheral sovereign bond markets through 2009 and spreads widened and so on.  The first crisis of a country that looked as if it could not borrow at all happened in Greece.  The troika did not exist until the Greek rescue was put together in 2010, which was important and has cast a long shadow.  The background is that the government changed at the end of 2009.  There had been a New Democracy government under a man called Karamanlis, which had fiddled the figures.  The public finance numbers were not correct.  Public debt was much higher than it appeared to be and the budget deficit was much bigger.  The new PASOK government under George Papandreou progressively discovered the scale of the holes in the public finances, Greek prices fell and eventually Greece was forced out of the bond market and had to be rescued. <br/><br/>At this stage virtually all of the Greek state debt was debt to private investors in Greek sovereign bonds.  Greece did not have any official debt or none worth talking about.  Briefly, the state debt in the early months of 2010 turned out to be 115% or 120% of GDP.  People had thought it was much lower but the figures were not correct.  The budget deficit was into double digits and the economy was contracting.  In those circumstances, it is unrealistic to argue debt sustainability.  There were economists in the International Monetary Fund, IMF, at that time who argued that the Greek debt was not sustainable and there should be a haircut of sovereign bond holders.  That was not done.  It was overruled by the political leadership of the IMF and pressure from the big European states.  The first so-called rescue of Greece was a rescue of its creditors.  That will be familiar to people who followed what happened here with the creditors of the bust Irish banks.  Many of the problems we are dealing with date back to the failure to handle the first Greek rescue properly. <br/><br/>One of the things that disturbed me and many other observers about events last Sunday was the explicit threat to expel Greece from the eurozone.  The manner in which it was delivered was laughable.  Wolfgang Sch&auml;uble, the German Finance Minister, referred to a five year time out from membership of the currency union.  That is utterly impractical and could not be done.  The fact that the threat was made was extraordinary.  This is meant to be a currency union, its members have abolished their own currencies.  They do not have any currencies.  People talk about bringing back the drachma as if it was still alive somewhere in a cave on Mount Athos and could be revivified.  It does not exist.  Greece does not have a currency any more than Wexford has a currency.  To threaten a state which has abolished its own currency with expulsion from the common currency is an extraordinary event and it was a first.<br/><br/>This in turn means that the risk of an ultimate Greek ejection from the common currency has not gone away.  As for the programme, if a third programme for Greece was being designed by economists rather than politicians who are trying to allocate blame, it would have several features.  It would have to show a clear path back to market entry, that is what financial rescue programmes do.  When the IMF takes the plane south, to Latin America, as it has often done, to Brazil and Mexico and places like that, its <i>modus operandi</i>is to find out how bad is it; say the debt is too big; find out who was foolish enough to lend the money, whether the government or the banks; break the bad news; give it a haircut; lend the government enough to get through a few years in which it will have to cut the budget deficit anyway, because it is a structural deficit, and hopefully get the country back into a position where it can borrow money again; and try to do that without deflating the economy too much.  That is what these financial adjustment programmes are supposed to do.  That is what it says in the text book.  That was not done in the first or second Greek rescues.  It looks like it is not being done in the third.  That means that the decisions at the weekend do not merely not address the problems in the Greek economy but they also do not remove the risk of Grexit.  Some of the newspapers on Monday reported this as great news and it means the risk of a country being flung out of the euro has been removed.  I do not think that is the correct interpretation.  That risk has not been removed.<br/><br/>As for the programme itself, there have been new reports this morning that the IMF may not participate in the next programme.  The German government tried to make IMF involvement a condition of there being a third programme.  There has been a lot of angst in the IMF about its involvement in 2010.  The IMF was split.  Many people in the IMF did not want to go along with the first Greek programme because they thought it was not properly designed and that it did not pass a test which has been in the IMF rule book for ten or 15 years, since the Argentinian crisis.  The rule is not to lend IMF money to a country unless the programme is going to make its debt sustainable and will get the country back into the sovereign debt market under its own steam within a few years.  That is my paraphrase of the rule.  The rule is known colloquially as the &ldquo;no more Argentinas rule&rdquo;.  The IMF had to ignore that rule, which it did not because the economists wanted to but because the executive board, which is political, and the then managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, wanted to participate in the Greek rescue as a junior partner with the European institutions.  The clock has turned, however, and it looks as if the executive board of the IMF may forbid the board to lend any more money to Greece because the deal does not respect the rule that it shows a plausible way to debt sustainability for Greece.<br/><br/>There is a long report in <i>The Financial Times</i>this morning, which I find credible but who knows?  The IMF has non-European members.  They are called China, India, Brazil, Australia and all sorts of other people.  It is their money as well.  Greece is in default to the fund and they are all conscious that what they agreed to do in 2010 was a mistake and it is possible that the IMF executive board will decline to participate in the third programme as envisaged.  The Germans have said they will participate only if the IMF does because there is some convoluted argument that they trust the IMF and they do not trust the European Commission or something.  I do not know what it really is about.  I would not assume the IMF is going to participate.<br/><br/>If any of the committee members have free time during the summer and want to understand the international politics of what is going on, they should read a paper by Paul Blustein about the first Greek deal.  It is a fantastic paper.  I note it at the bottom of the document I circulated.</p><p>This guy used to work for the IMF and he has spoken to all the principal actors.  I regard the May 2010 Greek deal as the original sin in the mismanagement of the eurozone crisis and this guy has nailed it.  If one reads nothing else about the first Greek bailout, this is the thing to read.  He has spoken to all sorts of people.  People retire all the time from the IMF.  Once they retire, they are free to tell the truth, which they are not allowed to do when they are in office.</p></speech>

I will finish with a few comments on the implications of all this.  A blame game has been going on for the past six months: the Greeks screwed up;  the Greek Government did not do its negotiations properly; the finance Minister wore a leather jacket; his wife forgot to wear a helmet on her motorbike or whatever.  Similarly, there have been allegations that the Europeans were engaged in blackguardism and blackmailed the Greek Government and all of that.  That is just a blame game.  What is interesting is whether the third programme passes the simple tests for a feasible and plausible rescue effort for a country that is in a mess.  To claim to be involved in the financial rescue business and then for it to say it is really upset because the country it has been sent to is in a mess is kind of weird.  Of course it is in a mess.  That is why the country called it.  Those in the ambulance business tend to find people who are injured when they are called out and they do not expect the callers to be able to drive the ambulance.</p> <p>  The explicit and unveiled threat last weekend of expulsion of a member of the eurozone was a pretty extraordinary event.  I can quite understand why the Greek Government felt it had to capitulate.  However, it creates a situation in which this common currency area is no longer seen as irrevocable by its leading member.  I think that will create conditions of instability very quickly the next time some country gets into trouble.  If that country is a big country such as Italy or France, the systems are retrievable but if it is a small country such as Portugal, Slovenia or Ireland, we now know that the small countries are expendable.  It is a fact that every finance Ministry in Europe has prepared contingency plans for what they will do if this thing blows up.  They will all deny it, for good reasons, but they all have them.  If I were involved with one of these smaller countries, I would be dusting off those plans now.  There is an increased risk the currency union will unscramble at some stage.  It is now clear that the smaller countries will be deemed expendable in those circumstances.  It has been a very bad week for Greece but it has been a bad week for the eurozone.</p></speech>

It was not an economic project.  It was not designed by economists and most economists were probably quite antagonistic to it.  I am, therefore, going to be forced to say something about politics and to step outside my own area.  I agree with Mr. Colm McCarthy that no side has come out well over the current impasse.  Syriza had a very weak hand to begin with and played it very badly.  My graduate students were asking me over recent months whether it had not got any diplomatic advice.  Germany has reversed 50 years of hard work developing goodwill on the part of the other peoples of Europe.</p> <p>  Ireland has not played its hand well over this impasse either.  I remind the committee of a comment the historian Joe Lee made 30 years ago.  &ldquo;[While] the &lsquo;political&rsquo; skills of Irish representatives in negotiating situations are widely acknowledged ... there seems to be no comparable criterion for assessing the calibre of conceptualisation of the Irish case.&rdquo;  He is suggesting that we have a very good diplomatic service, which I think has stood us in very good stead.  However, the comments my graduate students made about Syriza can also be levelled at the Irish Government.  Traditionally, the Government's comparative advantage has been as arbitrators and facilitators in negotiations.  It did not make any attempt whatsoever to play that role this time round.  We seem to have forgotten a point Garret FitzGerald stressed repeatedly.  Every time he spoke about the European Union, he noted the important role the European Commission played as a defender of the interests of smaller states.  The European Commission has really been sidelined completely over the course of this impasse.  It has been sidelined over the course of the crisis going on years.  It is in our interests and the interests of other small and weaker states to try to resurrect the power and the influence of the Commission.  Instead what we have had over recent weeks is a naked battle of interests.  In these kind of battles, the interests of the strong will always dominate the interests of the weak.  This is something we really need to bear in mind.</p> <p>  Let us think back to the logic behind the single currency.  Flexible exchange rate systems lead to dramatic fluctuations in international competitiveness which can lead to conflict between states.  They are, therefore, regarded as undesirable.  The system of fixed exchange rates which we had over several decades or so in the run up to the introduction of the single currency was also regarded as undesirable because it did not prevent speculative attacks against currencies in the fixed exchange rate systems.  I am sure the committee will remember sterling crashed out of the fixed exchange rate very dramatically in 1992.  Then the speculative pressure came on Ireland and we crashed out shortly thereafter.  The single currency was seen as a way to avoid the undesirability of both flexible and fixed exchange rates.  Now, as Mr. Colm McCarthy said, rather than having an irrevocably fixed single currency that prevents speculative attacks, we have returned, under this notion of a Greek timeout from the euro, to that era of fixed exchange rates which are not irrevocably fixed.  We are now back into one of those worlds, which was deemed undesirable to begin with and one of the benefits of introducing a single currency.</p> <p>  Economists always view the introduction of a single currency essentially as a European federalist project.  It was known that there were design flaws in the system, but the assumption would be that when cracks appeared, that would lead to closer integration, essentially a united states of Europe.  It is clear there is no appetite for this now.  The people who constructed the euro to begin with were of that kind of federalist disposition and assumed that ultimately we would move in that direction and have something like a big Washington budget that cushions states of the US when they are hit by a shock.  We have no equivalent in Europe.  That is what I mean by euro federalism.  There is clearly no appetite for that now so we are stuck in limbo, or in a worse place.</p> <p>  The rigid fiscal rules that have been imposed and strengthened over time in the eurozone were really designed to obviate the need for that sort of Washington-style budget.  The notion was if countries adhered rigidly to these fiscal rules, they would not get into the sort of crisis where a Washington-type budget might be required.  Those fiscal rules were policed by the no bailout clause.  The no bailout clause said, "If you make mistakes, you suffer."  It was designed to ensure mistakes were not made.  The no bailout clause imposes costs on lenders as well as borrowers.  If a company goes bankrupt, lenders suffer as well as the company.  The no bailout clause rule was overturned in the Greek case in 2010 by the troika.  As Mr. Colm McCarthy said, the IMF tore up its own rule book in tearing up the no bailout clause.  If the no bailout clause had been rigidly imposed in 2010, the IMF would have said essentially that Greece was bankrupt and that people who lent money to Greece would have to take a haircut or write off their debts.  That was overturned.  It was very strange that the IMF did it but the IMF, as Mr. Colm McCarthy said, is politicised.</p><p>Since then the successive Greek deals have said, in essence, and I will try to put it as pithily as possible: "We will lend you more money, which you will never be able to pay back, in order to help you pay off your creditors".  That is what these Greek deals say.  When I say it in that way, it is clear that it cannot work.  These debts will be written off sooner or later.  Ten years hence, when we are out of this crisis, these debts will be written off.  </p><p> Essentially, all this talk about reprofiling is a pretence or mirage.  If Colm McCarthy owes me &euro;1,000 and he is supposed to pay it back to me tomorrow, which is like money is my pocket, reprofiling means that I tell him not to mind paying it off tomorrow but I will take it from him 50 years hence.  That is what reprofiling is.  It is really the same as writing off the debts.  It is pushing them out so far into the future that, essentially, it is meaningless.  Governments do this for political reasons, not for economic reasons.  It is essentially the same as a write-off except it does not allow Greece to return to private markets.  Greece is still sitting with this high nominal debt to GDP ratio, so it cannot borrow in private markets.  It is the same as a write-off except it does not achieve the same purpose as a write-off would, which is to allow Greece return to private markets and borrow to get its economy under control.</p><p> For Greece, the situation with the current deal is that reforms are mandatory.  Nobody disagrees with reforms.  In the Irish case, to be honest, when the troika came here most economists more or less breathed a sigh of relief thinking that this would enable some reforms to be introduced in Ireland that the politicians could not get through because of the power of vested interests.  The question is whether that has actually succeeded, whether we have seen the legal profession opened up or not and so forth, and whether those reforms have really been achieved.  Reforms are a good thing, but reforms will yield economic benefits only in the long run.  There is no way that a reform will appear in the form of increased GDP over the next year or two.  It is a long run process.</p><p> The second element of the Greek deal is more austerity.  Austerity is detrimental in the short run.  It is a great deal more detrimental to Greece.  An equivalent amount of austerity in Greece is much more detrimental to the economy because the Greek economy is so much more closed.  With austerity in Ireland much of the hit is taken by imports.  We are three times more open to imports than Greece is, just as we are far more export oriented.  Being an open economy means that part of austerity is cushioned as the blow is taken by imports.  More austerity for Greece has a more dramatic impact on Greek GDP.</p><p> The final point I wish to make concerns the role of the European Central Bank, ECB.  Again, politics comes into play here.  For the last few years Mario Draghi has been the hero of the weaker, peripheral nations in Europe.  When he announced quantitative easing and said the ECB would do whatever it takes, that was to the benefit of the debtor countries.  The creditor countries, such as Germany, did not like it.  In the long term it is like inflating away one's debt.  Mr. Draghi was a godsend to the European periphery.  Politically, he and his cadre have seen that they have moved too far in terms of being in the corner of the weaker, peripheral states and over the current crisis they have reversed position and taken a course of action that has been detrimental to the peripheral states, particularly to Greece.  As Colm McCarthy has been writing, the Greek banks were solvent the last time it was checked, therefore the role of the ECB is to carry out its main function, which is to provide liquidity to banks that are solvent but illiquid.  It has failed in its duty to do that, for political reasons.</p><p> We are in a mess and, as yet, no exit strategy has been mapped out from the mess. </p></speech>

They tend to think: "It is a flipping mess.  What will we do to fix it?"  We are driving an ambulance and the patient is lying on the side of the road spewing blood.  The trick is to see if there is some way to fix it.  One does not interrogate the patient and ask if they were driving too quickly and the like.  One gets him on a stretcher and into casualty as quickly as possible.  Politicians tend to play a different game.  It is like 12 year old children playing football when some fellow gets a kick in the head and they say: "It was not me, ref, it was him or him".  That is really what has been happening for the last six months.  Various governments have unwisely got into stuff relating to what was the source of all the problems in Greece.  Everybody acknowledges that Greece has had poor macro economic management for 30 years or longer, since the 1970s, and everybody acknowledges that the Greeks did not come up with a terrific medium-term plan and so forth.</p></speech>

Debt write-down is a necessary condition.  It is not sufficient.  I will put it this way.  Consider April and May in 2010, a time when the Greeks owed approximately 120% of GDP.  It turned out to be a little more when the final figures were compiled, but everybody thought at the time that it was 115% to 120%.  The Deputy will recall that it was the Papandreou government.  The deficit was thought to be 10% of GDP that year, although it turned out to be a little higher as well if memory serves.  In addition, and very importantly, the economy was in a nose dive.  If one has a high debt and is running a high deficit, which means the debt is increasing, and the economy is sinking, that is debt unsustainability on any reasonable metric.  That is why the first Greek deal was such a mistake.<br/><br/>Currently, there are people who are saying that the Greeks owe 180% of GDP, but the repayment terms have been stretched out, some of the loans are now 30 year loans and so forth.  Some of the loans have the feature that the coupons do not have to be paid for the first five or six years, although some of the IMF loans are more up-front.  Some people have been saying that Greek debt is not as bad as it looks because of favourable reprofiling and the other matters Professor Barry mentioned.  That is fine.  However, look at the <i>Financial Times</i>supplement today and the page which shows what government debt is trading at in the secondary market.  One should do that from time to time because everything else in the <i>Financial Times</i>is some guy's opinion.  The figures show what that debt traded at yesterday, which was an interest rate of 12.26%.  That means Greece has unsustainable debts.  There is not a large amount of Greek Government debt out there at present, but what is out there is trading at an interest rate which is way off the chart of anything that is conceivable.  That is the bond market to which Greece is allegedly going to return.<br/><br/>I cannot repeat this often enough - the purpose of these financial rescues is to get the distressed country back to an ability to borrow at affordable rates of interest within two or three years.  That is what those programmes are always designed to do.</p></speech>

In November 2010, we were the second country to get into trouble and the troika was more organised by then.  The troika was a shotgun marriage that arose early in 2010 in quite disorganised circumstances.  We were the first outing it had as a threesome, as it were.  The deal that was done here featured an adequate amount of financial support, in my opinion.</p><p>Some of it involved us selling off financial assets owned by the Irish Government.  That is another day's work.  One of the weaknesses or unsatisfactory features in the financing of the Irish programme was the application of very high interest rates.  I am sure members will recall that this was resisted by the IMF at the time.  The IMF guys in Dublin were very unhappy with the terms of the November 2010 deal, but they were overruled.  If I recall correctly, the initial rate on the European money was 5.8%.  I think the rates on some of the other stuff were even higher.  Subsequently, the Irish Government succeeded, including the via the promissory note deal but separately as well with the European financial stability facility money, as it was called, in getting a lengthening of maturities and a reduction in interest rates.  The initial interest rates were ridiculous.  They were absolutely unpayable.</p></speech>

One of the great political taboos is to question the euro in any way.  Obviously, we have lost exchange rate and interest rate tools.  As Professor Barry has mentioned, we have probably returned to a fixed exchange rate system that could come under speculative pressures.  Is there a body of economists who are looking at a structured route out of the euro in this scenario that would be as safe as possible?  It is the view of many economists that if Greece does not get a write-down, it will not be able to function within the euro.  If that is the choice Greece is facing, it must be the case that a level of work is being done.  What would be the best way?  What would that path look like?  What supports could the EU put in place at a humanitarian level to ensure that path is not as disastrous as it would otherwise be?</p></speech>

The assumption is that a disorderly unwinding of the euro would be catastrophic.  Greece would not necessarily pull out by choice.  If the ECB was not providing it with the necessary liquidity, presumably the Greek Government would start to issue IOUs which would become the new drachma and would ultimately produce a currency to pay off those IOUs.  The general presumption is that this would be catastrophic for Greece because it would lead to hyperinflation.  The new currency would not hold its value.  It would depreciate rapidly and cause hyperinflation.  Nevertheless, it might be beneficial for Greece in the long run, depending on whether it denominated its debts in this new currency or whatever.</p> <p>  The exchange rate has been extremely beneficial for Ireland's recovery over recent years.  I checked the data before I came to this meeting.  In terms of the US dollar, &euro;100 would have translated to $160 in 2008, but now it is closer to $100.  In terms of sterling, &euro;100 would have bought &pound;90 in 2010, but now it buys &pound;70.  The exchange rate has been very important for us.  The weakness of the euro has been a major component of Ireland's recovery.  That is why I lauded Mario Draghi earlier.  It has been hugely beneficial to Ireland.  As Greece is essentially a closed economy, it does not benefit nearly as much from this as Ireland does.  In a way, this has been an unanticipated benefit to Ireland of having the euro.  Of course, there is no way of predicting whether the euro will be weak or strong.  It is a sort of random factor that has worked in our favour.</p></speech>

It means the country has no exchange rate policy any more.  That is for sure.  Professor Barry has explained that.  He is quite right when he says that the weakening of the euro over the past while has been particularly beneficial for Ireland.  We are much more likely than the continental European countries to trade in sterling and dollars.  They tend to trade more with one another.  If a country scraps its own currency, it has deeper consequences beyond exchange rate policy.  It means that for all practical purposes, it is using a foreign currency, the creation and destruction of which it has no control over.  If its banks get into trouble, it cannot provide them with liquidity other than with the permission of what is for all purposes a foreign central bank.</p> <p>  Down through the years, some countries around the world have chosen not to have a currency.  Montenegro is an example.  When Montenegro was established as an independent state, the Montenegrin authorities decided not to bother having a currency.  The Deutsche mark, which became the euro, had been the popular currency in the Balkans.  As a result, Montenegro does not have a currency; it just uses the euro.  A few other European states, including the Vatican and Kosovo, use the euro without being members of the eurozone or the EU.  It would be fun if the Vatican got slung out.  I thought the Vatican banks had problems a while ago, but the ECB did not seem too bothered about it.</p> <p>  I would like to answer the important question that has been asked by Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n.  A country in the position that Greece is in now might not benefit hugely if it had an independent exchange rate.  As Professor Barry has pointed out, Greece does not have a broadly based export sector like we have.  It is a quasi-closed economy.  However, if Greece had an independent currency, it would certainly be able to provide liquidity to its banking system.  In such circumstances, it would not have had to take the sucker punch that has been the closure of its financial system in recent weeks.</p> <p>  I was also asked about the practicalities that would arise if countries had to deal with some kind of chaotic break-up of the common currency area.  It could be incredibly messy.  It has happened in the past.  Two currency unions in Europe - the rouble zone and the Yugoslav dinar zone - broke up in the 1990s.  In the case of the rouble zone, each of the 15 constituent states in the Soviet Union retained a local central bank.  The central bank of the Soviet Union was the Bank of Russia in Moscow, but there was a central bank quasi-branch office in Kiev, in Almaty in Kazakhstan, in Belarus and in all the other places.  When Russia resigned from the Soviet Union, the local central banks in places like Kiev decided to start dishing out liquidity to all the new banks that were created there by politicians' chums.  There was a massive creation of reserve money by these new central banks in places like Ukraine.</p></speech>

Of course, people got very fond of creating money, as they do.  The region in question ended up with huge hyperinflation.  Brand new currencies had to be established, and were established, in Ukraine, Belarus, Kazakhstan and so on.  The whole thing was chaotic.  It was a very costly way to break up a currency union.</p> <p>  The circumstances were worse in Yugoslavia because there was a war, which is a really bad way to break up a currency union.  Somewhere I have a 5 billion dinar note that was presented to me with great ceremony by fellows in the central bank in Zagreb.  I might have lost it.  It is worth about sixpence.  There was phenomenal hyperinflation in the region.  There are currency unions that have broken up.  If there is some kind of cataclysmic event that breaks up the eurozone - it would really have to involve Italy or France going bust, rather than expendable places like Portugal - I hope and presume it will be managed.  I think the reason Mr. Tsipras ultimately threw in his hand relates to a problem encountered by individual member states in the system.</p><p>I am sure he was advised he did not have any cards.  It is very difficult to create a new currency in competition with an old one that is already in circulation and very credible.  If Texas decided to go independent, it would be up against it in trying to introduce a new currency in competition with the dollar.  It would be a different story if one were to try to introduce a new currency in Croatia in competition with a currency that has 5 billion printed on a note which is the price of a newspaper.  The authorities in Greece would probably not have succeeded in getting their people to hold a new currency.  In all the states around the Balkans that have currencies, the balance sheets of the banking systems are mostly in euros.  That is true is Croatia and in Serbia.  Serbia has a currency called the dinar and Croatia has a currency called the kuna.  Croatians use the kuna for buying newspapers and cigarettes but the currency that is held in banking matters is the euro.  It is similar to a common feature in Latin American, which is called dollarisation where transactions in the economy are largely dealt with in a foreign currency.  </p><p> What can countries do that are worried that something like this might happen?  A country can either try and introduce a currency of its own in adverse circumstances, which would be incredibly difficult for a country like Greece - it could use it as IOUs for paying wages but that would be about it - or a country could see if there is an alternative foreign currency it might use, at least temporarily, whose central bank might be more accommodating than the one in Frankfurt.  This country has options in that regard that Greece does not have.</p></speech>

I listened with interest to the witnesses discuss the reasons bailouts should work, which is to return distressed countries to creditworthiness in order that they can enter private markets, and I agree with them on that.  It is a simple analysis.  Professor Frank Barry said that economists are a forward-looking people, and I agree with him on that, but so are business people.  I come from the world of business, and I am viewing this in a simplistic way as he has profiled it.  I disagree with his analysis of reprofiling debt and pushing it out many years into the future.  The debt is still there as a percentage of GDP and people lending money are not silly.  They carry out due diligence and realise what is at play.  If one pushes debt out a long period into the future, it means one has not crystallised the loss.  One may crystallise it when it can be afforded but it has not been crystallised immediately.  In essence, that allows a country or business that is in debt to have a cashflow, which is what keeps everything afloat.  Reference is often made as to who the wealthiest person in Dublin is today, and it is the person who has the handle on the most liquid cash.  It is not the person who has the most assets because a person may not be able to dispose of them.</p><p>What do the witnesses consider is the value of honest engagement?  People in business trade a great deal with people they trust.  So much can be put down on paper but from the financial meltdown we have had, and we have had more experience of it than most, I have noted that it is the people one trusted and worked with who are the ones that have brought us through it .  Any new customers we were getting in that distressed period were coming from a distressed situation and one was very cautious to move in because one could be exposing oneself when one did not need more exposure.  With Greece, it comes down to what is its honest engagement here and what is the general compliance.  We are all meant to be a European community working together.  We cannot say it is terrible and this is a case of the large countries versus the smaller countries when we expect everyone to engage honestly.</p><p>I read Mr. Colm McCarthy's article in the <i>Irish Farmers' Journal </i>last week in which he said something which he mentioned briefly in his presentation, and he can correct me if I am wrong, that the money that has already been lent is lost.  If we were to agree with him that this money is gone, would we not be not daft if we did not ensure the taxpayers' money that is going to this new &euro;80 billion plus bailout is secure?  I cannot stand over money going into a black pit again.  The mistakes of the past have been made but we cannot endorse new mistakes.  There is a simple concept in business: one borrows money, one makes decisions and if one makes bad decisions, one suffers.  However, the minute one runs out of cashflow or out money that has been agreed with one's lending institutions, one has lost control of one's business.  Until one figures out a way to get that cashflow back, one has lost control.  Essentially, Greece has done that; it has lost control.  It finds itself in a desperate position and it needs to work extra hard to ensure it gets itself quickly back to a position where it can borrow again.</p><p>As Professor Frank Barry said, the euro was a political venture.  Europeans have embraced the euro.  He and I will have met many people who would say it is great that we can buy items in other countries where we know the cost and the exchange rate.  I have bought many machines and other items I needed for business in the eurozone and the transactions were transparent in terms of currency.  I remember when two of us travelled to France in the early 1990s and when we exchanged &pound;50 or &pound;60 in traveller's cheques, we got different amounts in the local currency.  It was a joke and we were being ripped off left, right and centre.  We should not forget the bad days.  The reason politicians sought to introduce a common currency was that there was a demand for it, and I believe it is worth fighting for despite all its frailties.</p><p>There were many reasons for the foundation of the European Union but there were two main ones, one of which was security in Europe because there had been two major wars within a number of years and Europe was decimated.  Thankfully, we have had reasonable security even though it could be argued that there are many threats on the outskirts.  The second main reason for its foundation was food security.  The Union has delivered on that, much to the detriment of many farmers.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I am also engaged in farming and we have seen that the prices paid to farmers for products is the same as the prices they were paid 20 years ago.  However, the EU has kept the food in the consumer's shopping trolley at an affordable price and it has also ensured the food is traceable, which is important.  The European Union has introduced many positive measures.  It guaranteed equal pay for women and it introduced many other good measures that would not be in place without it.  I dislike the spinning of this discussion into one of larger states versus smaller states.  That angle should be kept out of this discussion.  It is not fair.  This is about taxpayer's money and Mr. Colm McCarthy might address that point.</p></speech>

The Deputy was right to raise the question about trust between member states.  It is a type of confederal arrangement of 28 states, 19 of which are in the eurozone.  Clearly, the sight of people on the Greek side running around accusing one another of blackmail and terrorism was not great.  On the other hand, some senior European politicians, including Jean-Claude Juncker, announced a few weeks ago that all those guys who were complaining about the design flaws in the eurozone were an Anglo-Saxon conspiracy.  There has been a great deal of loose talk on both sides.</p> <p>  To return to my earlier point, countries get into trouble because they are not being run very well.  To go along to a financially distressed country and start complaining that it is not run as well as Denmark is silly.  By definition, it is not very well run.  Otherwise we would not be there.  I have some familiarity with Greece.  It does not have the breadth of a modern economy we have, nor does it have the public administration we have.  The Greeks have intense problems with low level corruption, which is very common throughout the Balkans.  It is the same in Romania, Bulgaria and Croatia, which are in the EU, and in several other countries such as Macedonia, Albania and so on.  We get bothered because there are very occasional scandals here involving corruption in planning, fiddling around with zonings and all that.  That is in the ha'penny place by comparison with what people take for granted in south-eastern Europe.</p><p>People do not have to pay speeding fines; they just slip $10 to the police officer.  If one tried it here, one would be arrested.  They do not pay taxes, but bribe tax officials.  They do not pay customs duties, but do deals with the customs officers.  One can buy examination results in universities and pay for better grades.  One of the scandals in Greece is the waiting lists for the medical system.  People can move up the waiting lists by bribing officials in the public hospitals.  I am not denying that problems exist in Greece or that successive Greek Governments have been slow to address them.  However, Greece is in a mess, and the purpose of a financial rescue programme, which should have been the case in 2010, is to fix it, not to kick it down the tracks.</p><p> In 2010, a large amount of money was loaned to Greece which it used to pay off the foolish lenders to previous Greek Governments who should have taken a hit upfront, not as a moral measure but as a practical one.  This is how business people deal with financial no-hope cases.  For example, if they are not getting their money back, they will take 50 cents in the dollar and move on.  It is not business-like to pretend anything different.  If one has loaned money to someone who is not going to repay it, one has lost the money.  It is gone.  One can put it into one's books today or in ten years' time.  The act of putting it into the books is not the source of the loss.  The source of the loss was the lending decision.  Much of the extend-and-pretend that is happening is due to the fact that European governments do not want to tell their taxpayers they loaned their money to Greece, that it was a mistake and they should not have done it.</p><p> There is some spin going around that the Greeks have not bothered their barney over recent years making any effort to rectify their situation.  It is not true.  Speaking from memory, while the Greek budget deficit in 2010 was 15% of GDP, last year it was 3%.  In circumstances in which the economy was collapsing, they knocked ten points off the deficit by increasing taxes and cutting public spending.  The idea that the Greeks responded to the 2010 deal by lying on the beach drinking ouzo is incorrect.  There have been shocking caricatures in the Greek newspapers of Germans as Nazis, and in the German newspapers of the Greeks as layabouts.  I have no sympathy with either characterisation.</p></speech>

I am very supportive of the advantages Ireland has derived from being part of the EU, which has been spectacularly crucial to our prosperity.  However, the eurozone is a different matter.  It is a component of the EU.  The benefits to which Deputy Barry referred have derived from our membership of the EU.  There is no element of euroscepticism in what I am saying, given that I have been referring specifically to the eurozone.  However, Deputy Barry is correct to make the point that there have been benefits to our adoption of the euro as well as costs, for example, the transaction cost benefits.  It is wonderful to fly abroad and use one's own currency.  Against that, we must weigh the costs, which we are pointing to.  In Deputy Barry's comments he appears to downplay one of the costs, namely, the political tensions raised, particularly during recent months, by the negotiations essentially between the Germans and the Greeks, although other countries have been involved.</p> <p>  Although I do not read the British newspapers very frequently, I have been devouring them during recent weeks to see how it is playing out there.  The British newspapers from right to left have all been supportive of the Greeks and hostile to the German position, which is of interest because it may have an impact on the outcome of the forthcoming referendum in Britain.  If Britain withdraws from the EU, it would be very detrimental to us.  If the eurozone collapses and Greece is forced out of it, it may also force Greece out of the EU.  Mr. McCarthy has spoken about the break-up of previous currency unions that have had a detrimental impact on trade.  Countries exporting to Greece will not be happy to take these new IOUs or whatever new currency is developed there.  When Argentina defaulted, Argentine ships were seized around the world.</p> <p>  The great benefit to Ireland of being in the EU, aside from the agriculture sector which I will not talk about, has been that it has allowed us to act as a magnet for foreign direct investment in a way that would not have been possible otherwise.  If trade relations in Europe break down as an outcome of the messy disentangling of the eurozone, it would be catastrophic for us.  I am not a eurosceptic in that regard.  It is beneficial to keep those issues separate from each other.</p></speech>

Although Mr. McCarthy said we were different from the politicians, he suggested that for political reasons we must be careful about the use of strong language on either side and that loose language had been used.  I suggest it is time for blunt language.  Mr. Varoufakis said that when he made economic arguments, of the sort Mr. McCarthy has just put, in a measured way to the Eurogroup, he might as well have been singing the Swedish national anthem, and just got blank stares.  They were not interested in the measured, objective economic arguments such as Mr. McCarthy has just reproduced, almost word for word, from the interview with Mr. Varoufakis published in the <i>New Statesman</i>.  Almost any economist, left or right, looking at this is saying the same, that the judgments and policies made by the Eurogroup, headed by Mr. Sch&auml;uble, had nothing to do with sound economic management and was purely about politics.  If it is not about sound economic judgment, we must ask what is it and what is motivating it.  I would be interested in hearing Mr. McCarthy's opinion.  We must be honest.  If it is not about sound economic judgment, which it clearly is not, and it is about shoving something unsustainable from every point of view down the throats of the Greeks, we must speculate about the real motive.  It is not about hyperbole.  We must be honest.  Greece was subjected to economic terrorism and political bullying for purely political reasons and our Government went along with it for purely political reasons.  Mr. Varoufakis said the Irish, Spanish and Portuguese Governments were, to his surprise and disappointment, among the most energetic enemies of the Greeks during the negotiations because they were afraid of the political embarrassment that would result if they sided with the Greek Government in saying there had to be debt write-down and a lifting of the austerity.

It is unhelpful in a political negotiation for the various people involved, including people in the Eurogroup and some of the Greek politicians, to have resorted so quickly to hyperbole, which does not move matters forward.</p><p>In 2010, when Mr. Varoufakis was teaching in the University of Athens, he wrote a piece stating he thought the 2010 deal was silly.  He thought the debt was unsustainable then and that the deal simply relabelled some Greek sovereign debt, which was a dodgy asset in various French and German banks, as a liability of taxpayers.  In other words, he objected to the 2010 deal along the lines outlined by me, Professor Barry and numerous other people, including those on all sides of the political spectrum.  Whether the deal was more offensive to socialists or capitalists, it is hard to tell.  Deputy Boyd Barrett referred to Mr. Varoufakis's interview in the <i>New Statesman</i>during the week, which was very interesting.  It might have been a bit self-serving since he was the only witness.  Some of the details are amazing, such as the fact no minutes were taken.  He was quoted somewhere else as stating the fact he criticised the May 2010 deal upset many people, on the basis that in politics one will always be forgiven for being wrong but one will never be forgiven for being right.

The fact there is a third rescue is an indictment of the second one and the fact there was a second is an indictment of the first, particularly if one does not accept the narrative that the Greeks spent the past five years on the beach.  I do not accept this narrative.  I fully concede the Greek Government should have done more on tax reform.  It is still arguing about the independence of the central statistics office.  One of the senior officials there was blackguarded by successive Greek Governments.  It is still going on and it should not have happened.  However, it is not true Greeks made no effort at adjustment.  They did so in very adverse circumstances.  It is difficult to have much sympathy for either set of protagonists.</p></speech>

The crisis could escalate again this week.  A few minutes ago I received a text stating many of the ministers in the Syriza Government have resigned and there is a general strike on the streets against the deal.  We do not know what will happen.  Mr. McCarthy has stated what the Greeks are being asked to accept is unsustainable and will not resolve the crisis, and we will be back here again.  Therefore, do we not have an obligation at this stage to look at plan B?  Otherwise, we are simply looking at a dire situation waiting to see what will happen.</p></speech>

One either believes that careless lenders should take haircuts up-front in the cause of financial health, or one does not.  If one does one must state the European institutions and the IMF, who signed up as lenders for this poor deal in 2010, and for an inadequate second deal, made silly loans and in the interests of restoring financial health they should now take haircuts.  We are great in this country for saying the clowns who lent money to Anglo Irish Bank should have got haircuts.  We all agree with this.  Fair enough, I think the clowns who lent money to the Greek Government in 2010 should get haircuts, including European Governments and the IMF.</p></speech>

The process of dealing with the Greek crisis has been incredibly politicised.  I suspect Mr. McCarthy might agree that in many ways it would have been better if the European institutions were not involved with this and if it was actually just determined by the IMF.  The IMF is well used to making these decisions.  It advocated in 2010 that a Greek haircut should be imposed.  We know what the IMF advocated here at the time of our bailout.  The whole process and the participation of the European institutions has made the whole thing messier.  The IMF might well be able to go in now and state it will impose a haircut on Greece's creditors but this would not necessarily be extended to Ireland.  This is how the IMF might well resolve the political difficulties faced by the Irish Government and other governments in feeling unable to adhere to this type of outcome.  We all understand the constellation of political factors in Ireland which caused the Irish Government to take the decisions it has.  Perhaps the way out is for the IMF to deal with these issues, if it were prepared to do so.</p></speech>

Another view states the IMF should have kept out of it altogether and let the Europeans sort out their own mess.  This is an increasingly popular view, needless to say, in China, India, Brazil and other countries which are now exposed.  The critical point is that the no bailout clause means haircuts.  The logical corollary of stating there will be no bailouts is that France or Germany will not pay for Belgium or Greece if it goes bust.  We do not have a united states of Europe.  This is not Texas and we do not willingly transfer tax revenues across international boundaries except in a very small way.  The no bailout clause in the original design of the eurozone made sense.  There was no banking union, which did not make sense, but the no bailout clause did make sense provided everybody understood what it implied.  What is implied was that if one lent money to the Greek Government, the Greek banks or anybody else, one would get a haircut the minute they got into trouble.  The abandonment of the no bailout clause in May 2010 has fathered all of the antagonism ever since.  If this had not happened the <i>Bild Zeitung </i>would have had nothing to write about Greece.  The consequence of this would have been that various financial institutions in France, Germany, Britain and elsewhere would have had problems in 2010, but they would have had to have been dealt with by their own governments.  Instead, the debt problems were laundered through the Greek treasury.</p><p>That is the source of all of these.  There was nothing really wrong with the no-bailout clause.  What was wrong was that they abandoned it.</p></speech>

We have had a very long term and the buckets and spades are in the back of the car.  We did not need to be sent away in the mood they have induced.  They have given a very baleful assessment - although being baleful is not a reason not to analyse it.  However, the commentary amounts to an indictment of how the Union does its business today and secondarily an indictment of the creation of the euro project within that Union.  How do we deal with this situation?  It can be dealt with along the lines suggested by Deputy Boyd Barrett and one is likely to end up like St. Ruth at the Battle of Aughrim when he put up his head and got it shot off.

The arrival of President Hollande has not changed that very much.  That raises many questions and many people are concerned about whether the Union is becoming a Union for corporates rather than for people.  None of that undermines anything that Deputy Barry has said about how Ireland was transformed by membership of the Union.  However, that is an enormous question confronting us now.</p> <p>  On the flaws in the euro, we did not have bank resolution and we did not have supervision of the banks in the way we should have.  We now have this.  What other flaws do the witnesses see that can be rectified?  Deputy Boyd Barrett asked a fair question: name any school of economics that believes that debt sustainability is the outcome in Greece.  It is difficult to find any school of economics or credible economist who thinks that.  The reason behind what Mr. Varoufakis alleges in his piece with regard to Spain, Portugal, Ireland, etc., is that those countries made a pragmatic assessment of what was feasible and cut their cloth to measure.  The write-down was not going to happen in these discussions at the weekend.  If that meant "Grexit", that meant "Grexit" as far as the German mindset was concerned.</p> <p>  Here we have this noble project that has achieved so much, but the practical politics of it at the moment is that, whether it is in the Bundestag or in the ECB, the German mindset is dominant.  We politicians can rail against it all we like and economists can point out what the witnesses have pointed out here today, but what was likely to come out of last weekend's summit that would have addressed this situation in a way that was likely to lead Greece back to market access?</p></speech>

Banking union is critical.  The critical flaw in the original design of the eurozone was the absence of banking union and that remains.  Some people are writing about banking union in the past tense as if it was done and dusted.  Until there is a Europe-wide system of bank resolution, probably some system of insurance for bank liabilities and a non-discretionary universally available lender of last resort function for the central bank, then we do not have a meaningful banking union and we do not have those things.</p> <p>  It is extraordinary that people can talk about banking union in the past tense as if it had already been achieved.  We witnessed in recent weeks that the gunboat that was sent down the Aegean was not one that floats.  It was the closure of the banks by the European Central Bank which decided not to act as a lender of last resort to the Greek banking system.  That was the design flaw that really mattered.</p> <p>  A definition of a monetary union should be one in which the address of the headquarters of the bank does not matter and has no consequences for the solvency of that bank.  I will give an example.  In the United States, Delaware specialises in company secretarial business.  Many people there do company registrations and all that.  People think there are tax deals in Delaware that are better.  That is not really true.  However, many US corporations are headquartered in Delaware, including many banks.  I believe that Lehman Brothers was headquartered in Delaware.  Somebody noted that if Delaware had been a member of the eurozone rather than of the United States of America, when all these banks went bust the Governor of Delaware would have been asked to bail them out using the tax revenue of Delaware to do so.  However, he was not asked to do so because the United States is a monetary union, there is no question about it.</p> <p>  The United States also has a no-bailout clause, which has applied to several cities in the US.  Detroit went bust recently.  The people who bought Detroit bonds are getting 50 cents on the dollar.  That is after the substantial fiscal transfers built into the US system, so the US has a banking union and Europe still does not.  That remains the big design flaw.  It is the resolution of bust banks that is critical in all this.</p> <p>  Banks go bust in the United States every week.  Every Friday officials from the Federal Reserve arrive to a bank and fire all the management, and the bank opens on Monday with the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation taking care of the depositors.  That is not how it worked in Greece because we do not really have a monetary union, just a common currency area.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked the important question of what might have been done last weekend.  What might have been done last weekend could have been done in 2010, namely to show the Greek political system some - even distant - sight of the winning post.  One has to show the horse that there are just two furlongs to go and one might get there.  That is why debt has to be written down.  It is also why we need to avoid frontloading the austerity too much.  It is not possible to wave a magic wand and say that there is no need to balance the budget ever.  That is silly.  However, one must be very careful about the phasing and timing of the fiscal consolidation measures, something that the IMF, in fairness to it, was always careful about in the programme here, as I am sure the Deputy is aware.  However, sadly those things were not done and I am fearful that we will end up with another botched deal for Greece.</p></speech>

The corollary of that is countries get out of trouble because they are run very well.  I am sorry Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett is not present to hear that comment.  From a politically partisan perspective, much has to be said about the way this country has been run since we entered into a bailout programme and managed to exit it successfully.</p> <p>  The point was made that Ireland was the second bailout experiment, the first being Greece.  The difference was that when it came to our turn, we had an adequate amount of financial support.  The IMF had similar concerns and was not happy with the percentage point on our debt but we managed to use the European financial stability facility, EFSF, money to lower the interest rate, did a deal on the promissory notes and so on.  In effect, we reprofiled our debt.  Ordinary people recognise that when one takes out a mortgage on a house, one is reprofiling one&rsquo;s debt, banking on the mortgage going down over time as one&rsquo;s income improves, a reasonable level of inflation which will improve the value of one&rsquo;s income over the long term and the value of that asset increasing over time.  I do not see anything particularly wrong with the idea of reprofiling debt, assuming - I do not want to sound like Margaret Thatcher - a country behaves a bit like a household.  In other words, it manages itself properly as a successful economic entity.</p> <p>  At the time of the first Greek bailout, its debt-to-GDP ratio was 120%.  How much less was Ireland&rsquo;s?</p></speech>

Of the &euro;64 billion that went into the banks, some of that only emerged in 2011.  At the end of 2010, Ireland&rsquo;s debt ratio was well under 100%.</p></speech>

My understanding is that before the Syriza Government came to power, Greece had returned to positive growth but is now back in negative growth.  There was light at the end of the tunnel.</p><p>There has been a lot of talk about Germany&rsquo;s role in this.  At a conference I attended recently in Europe, I noted it was other small European countries which were unhappy about bailing out the Greeks, like the Baltic states.  A commentator from Latvia said the <i>per capita</i>income there was half that of Greece.  The owners of Greek debt now are other European countries.  Some of them are not particularly happy to be taking any further hits when their people earn half as much as Greek citizens.  It is unfortunate this debate focuses entirely on Germany and not the other European countries which stand to take the hit.</p><p>I am not surprised at the stand the UK&rsquo;s media is taking on this.  One of the issues around Brexit and euroscepticism is the fact that Europe has become too obsessed with the euro project.  That is one of Britain&rsquo;s dissatisfactions with its engagement in Europe.  The idea the euro experiment is falling into some kind of disrepute is happy days for some of the UK media.</p><p>There is dissatisfaction with Germany.  Is there an honest broker who could do a better deal like, for the sake of argument, Matteo Renzi, and might be able to pull some of the more disparate voices together around a table?  There have been two failed bailouts in Greece.</p><p>It looked as if Greece was coming out of the tunnel before the election of Syriza.  Europe has come some way in protecting the euro and eurozone member states from the circling sharks waiting to see the next blood in the water.  We have had the stress tests and have put money in place to protect against the next run on the euro.  Mr. McCarthy made the point in an interview on why the ECB pulled liquidity out of the Greek banks.  My proposition is that &euro;2 billion was taken out of Greek banks in a short period.  This was a run on the euro without the Greek Central Bank imposing, or indicating it was even willing to impose any capital controls.  That surely made sense.</p></speech>

One of its declared objectives is the end of financial fragmentation in Europe.  That was one of the trumpeted purposes of the EMU, the Economic and Monetary Union.  One would need to have an economist&rsquo;s sense of humour for this but the idea that capital controls are an instrument of economic policy and monetary union is absurd.  That is a Heath Robinson monetary union.  It is a bizarre idea.</p> <p>  Senator Hayden is correct that the Greek economy did seem to be recovering last year.  It looked as if the budget deficit, as conventionally measured, was down to about 3% of GDP.  The non-interest deficit was heading down towards zero or even a small primary surplus this year.  However, there was a lot of political uncertainty in the last months of the Antonis Samaras government last year.  Syriza then won the election.  The election of alternative political parties that might be inexperienced and radical is what economists call endogenous.  If one squeezes a country for five years with no-hope programmes, then one cannot predict who will win an election.  Experienced people, including those in the IMF, take those matters into account and try to avoid programmes that fail for such a long period, precisely because one will get political instability as a consequence.</p> <p>  On the point about the small European countries such as Slovakia and Latvia-----</p></speech>

The Senator referred to them taking further hits on the money they have lent to Greece.  What I and, I believe, Professor Barry were trying to say, and this is what it says in the Ladybird guide to financial rescues, is that the losses have already occurred.  This business of believing that the losses are caused by the decision to recognise them is the source of many of the current difficulties.  People lent money to the Greek Government as part of the official lending programmes and much of this money was used to pay off other creditors, which is the way these things go.  At the end of the process, there was a very sharp contraction in the Greek economy and it is probably contracting again.  Greek debt is retailing at interest rates of nearly 12.5% on the secondary market and the country cannot repay the money, which means the debt is not sustainable, as the International Monetary Fund concluded.  This means that when the Prime Minister of Slovakia states his country does not want to give any more money to Greece he is misunderstanding the point.  He or his predecessors decided some years ago in effect to buy Greek Government bonds, although they were not in that form but that is what it amounts to.  These have since reduced in price, which is tough but these things happen.</p></speech>

Needless to say, there are major structural differences between the two economies, the most crucial of which is the export orientation of the Irish economy.  As Mr. McCarthy indicated, we are highly dependent on sterling and the dollar.  The decline in the value of the euro has been very beneficial to us.  We have also been incredibly lucky in terms of the export sectors in which the economy is concentrated.  This is not a matter of pure luck, however, as it is also the result of Government policy and the policies pursued by public agencies over decades.  Our goods exports are concentrated in pharmaceuticals.  Indigenous industry exports are concentrated in food and agriculture and services exports are concentrated in computer and information technology services.  It has been very beneficial to have an economy that is concentrated in all of these sectors.</p> <p>  Let us take pharmaceuticals as an example.  As a sector, pharmaceuticals have increased as a share of overall eurozone, British and US imports.  It has been extremely beneficial to us to have been in these sectors.  Greece has such a different structure from Ireland that imposing austerity in Ireland has been necessary, one would say, because if we run out of money we have no option but to impose austerity.  This has not been sufficient to explain the recovery, however.  One cannot say that imposing equivalent austerity in Greece will have the same result because Ireland and Greece have completely different types of economy.  </p></speech>

We are in a different position entirely from Greece.</p> <p>  I ask the witnesses to respond to my question on the moves that have been made towards banking union.  Last year, only seven - the figure may be even lower at this point - of 129 European banks failed stress tests and we established a bank resolution mechanism which will be backfilled with funds to protect the banking system.  I am personally committed to Europe and ensuring Greece continues to be a full member of the European Union and euro.  Do the witnesses not agree, however, that the markets have factored in a Greek exit from the eurozone?  The markets fell by approximately 2% at the start of the first day of the recent crisis and finished the same day even less than 2% down.  Have we simply moved on and have the markets factored in the difficulty of Greece?  Is it not the case that a Greek exit from the euro would not be the catastrophe Mr. McCarthy believes it would be?</p></speech>

That would have a very bad effect.<br/><br/>On the Senator's question about the completion of banking union, there are three components of a proper banking union.  The first is centralised supervision of the banks, the second is centralised <i>ex ante</i>rules for the resolution of failed banks and the third is liability insurance for banks, in particular, for small retail deposits.  All that has been achieved in Europe is the first of these components, namely, centralised supervision of, I believe, 123 listed banks.  The European Banking Authority, which is an offshoot of the European Central Bank, did an asset quality review of these banks last year and this review was followed by stress tests and so forth.  The Senator is correct that nearly all the banks passed the stress tests, including the Greek banks.  What we have seen in recent weeks in this so-called banking union is the ECB refusing to act as lender of last resort in the face of a deposit run, thereby closing down four banks that it supervised and to which it gave a clean bill of health last year.  These banks recapitalised themselves to the tune of &euro;8.5 billion last year.<br/><br/>While it is very hard to make me feel sympathy for banks, I have sympathy for the four Greek banks because the lender of last resort ran away when it saw a deposit run against them.  Central banks were invented in numerous countries in the last century and even later in the United States - I mean the 19th century.  I apologise for repeatedly referring to the 19th century as the last century despite having 15 years to get used to the change.  The reason for the creation of central banks was largely to create a public good, namely, the ability to stop depositor runs against banks that were solvent.  The actions of the European Central Bank in recent weeks will feature in the textbooks in the years ahead because the ECB helped to accelerate a run against banks which it had deemed to be solvent and had supervised.  It did so by pulling its liquidity support on 28 June last in what was an extraordinary sequence of events. <br/><br/>As for bank resolution, one of the reasons the Greek banks were not deemed to have been insolvent was that to have deemed them insolvent would have triggered their recapitalisation by the European Stability Mechanism and no one wanted to do that.  Members will recall the famous proposal for retrospective recapitalisation of the Irish banks which was declined and did not take place.  Klaus Regling and others stated this could not be done because the European Stability Mechanism was to fund future bank insolvencies and would not be used for retrospective recapitalisation.  If it is now believed that the Greek banks are bust, ESM recapitalisation, if it effective, should be triggered because the present is what was then the future.<br/><br/>It is simply not the case that a banking union has been agreed to, the reason being that several member states do not want a banking union.  What has been undertaken is centralised supervision.  Supervision has never prevented bank busts, however.  For example, there were big bank busts recently in the United Kingdom, which has had national bank supervision in place for a couple of hundred years and still does not seem to have got the hang of it.  There will always be bank busts because banks are fragile institutions.  Centralised supervision is an improvement, particularly in countries which are bad at doing supervision, as Ireland was, but it is nuts to believe that supervision will prevent future bank busts.</p><p>What would prevent them from creating mayhem is a properly funded bank resolution system and a properly funded deposit insurance system for retail customers of banks who have been queueing outside banks in Greece for the past six months.  We do not have those things.  They have not moved to a banking union; they have made some steps in that direction, but it is not complete.</p></speech>

Does he accept that the Irish bailout programme has worked for any number of reasons and not because of austerity?  </p> <p>  I refer to Mr. McCarthy's interesting point about Greece.  He has said that when people see no light at the end of the tunnel, they will eventually vote for a more radical solution.  We are talking about the politics of the crisis.  He makes the point that the Greek people had lost confidence in their own institutions as much as anything else and that Syriza was, in effect, the plan B about which Deputy Richard Boyd Barrett talked.  They were looking for a more radical solution, which seems to have failed miserably, in so far as they are concerned.</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy has referred to our interest payments and profiling the money we borrowed.  We seem to fail to explain that most of the money we have borrowed - a 120% debt-to-GDP ratio - was borrowed to maintain public services; it was not borrowed to manage the banks and it was not a bank bailout.  Profiling means repayments are pushed to be made in the future when it will almost not matter and the repayments are to cover the interest, which is the big one.  For example, we are paying 3.1% of GDP in interest payments.  If I remember correctly, at the beginning of the year Greece's repayments were something like 3.4% or 3.5% of GDP.  The profile of repayments being made by Greece was not far off ours and many of the measures it has taken such as reducing budget deficits are similar to what we did, yet the level of expenditure on pensions in Greece is still at 17.5% of GDP versus 12% in our case.  Considering the state of the Greek economy at the beginning of the year, it could have worked through it over a couple of years in the same way as we did, yet the Greek people chose a solution that has landed them in an incredible disaster zone.  Does responsibility lie with the Greek institutions or the Greece people?  There is an element of delinquency or a refusal to accept that they were living beyond their means.  I am only saying this because much of the conversation this afternoon has focused on the criticisms of the institutions in Europe and individual countries.  Like Senator Aideen Hayden, in travelling around Europe I have not noted huge sympathy for the Greeks because many countries have endured their own cutbacks and changes in how they manage their public services, just as we have.  The picture Mr. McCarthy paints, in which the Greeks have made huge sacrifices, has not been painted very well outside Greece.  The commentary on the situation in Greece is still very poor and even the Greeks did not help with some of the comments being made by Syriza since it was elected.</p></speech>

On the pensions system, the Chairman is correct that the percentage of overall public spending on pensions is very high, but it has a very poor unemployment insurance system.  For example, many public officials were let go.  It is not true that the Greek Government did nothing post-2010.  It had a very bloated public service-----</p></speech>

However, instead of being put on the dole, many were included in the pensions system.  Therefore, the Greek pensions system provides for a lot of the income distribution which in other European countries is provided for by routine social expenditure.  These cross-national comparisons of public expenditure ratios are very treacherous, unless one knows the details of what each country does.</p> <p>  On the broader question, one must be clear on what was the objective in Ireland when the so-called bailout began at the end of 2010.  The Government was two years into a fiscal consolidation programme at the time.  That programme started in July 2008 before the bank bust.  The then Government made a series of expenditure reductions in the middle of the year.  There was an emergency budget in October 2008, another budget in the spring of 2009, followed by another in the autumn of that year.  During all this time the Government was able to borrow.  We were not driven out of the bond markets because our initial public debt was very low.  We also had a bunch of international equities held in the National Pensions Reserve Fund which was not a pension fund but rather a kind of hedge fund.  It included short bonds and long equities, which sounds like a hedge fund to me.  When push came to shove, these assets could be flogged, which we did and the markets knew that we could flog them.  The full extent of the losses in the banking system was not realised.  It came to be realised a little more through 2010.  Therefore, the objective position on the public finances was completely different.  </p> <p>  The Greeks were bust; in March or April 2010 the Greek public finances were shot, whereas ours were not.  When we eventually had to have a programme, it was in the context of another run on the banks here.  People will remember the famous radio interview given by the Governor of the Central Bank, which, it was believed, impelled the Government into a rescue package.  He was conscious that there was a run on the banks and that it would accelerate and he believed there was nothing else he could have done.  However, the circumstances were completely different.  As Professor Barry outlined, the negative impact, the deflationary impact of the tax increases and expenditure cuts on aggregate demand here, was much less than in Greece because of the openness of the economy and the broader export base.  We were also lucky that our big trading partners were Britain and the United States which were not doing great, but they were doing less badly than many continental European countries.  Therefore, we had a little luck, which is not to say our programme had been perfectly designed or executed.  The IMF will also stress that the Irish programme was owned by the Irish authorities, that the Irish authorities had embarked on a medium-term programme which involved austerity and cuts in spending and increases in taxes.  However, they embarked on it and had authored it.  The programme in Greece was imposed and there was little or no ownership of it there.</p> <p>  The IMF is very big on the question of ownership; if there has to be a difficult macro-economic adjustment, one must show people the exit and persuade them that it will only last for a few years, that everything necessary will be done, including hair cuts for creditors, that the people will have a reasonable chance of getting out inside three years and that those concerned can design the programme.  Both rules were broken in Greece.</p></speech>

I refer not only to the current Greek Government but also to earlier ones.  At a famous meeting with Ms Merkel and Mr. Sarkozy in Cannes a former Greek Prime Minister, Mr. George Papandreou, suggested the holding of a referendum and was shuffled out of office.  His government was replaced with a technocratic one.  Although one could argue that the Greeks have not handled their negotiations and diplomacy with their European partners very well since the very beginning, the official lenders really ought to have a soul above this and say that since they are dealing with a small European country that does not have enormous policy-making resources, allowances have to be made, instead of complaining about poor diplomacy.</p></speech>

Money is obviously generated by those at the core.  As those at the core need somewhere to deliver the money, credit is created to be accessed by those at the periphery.  The inherent imbalance within the system will repeat itself because, as Mr. McCarthy stated, the eurozone does not have the transfer mechanism that is available in an actual currency union such as the United States.</p></speech>

The Deputy did not say it, but he is hinting that a monetary union will work only if each component is comparable in terms of productivity, living standards, etc.  That is not really true.  The United States is an example.  There are states in the union in which real incomes are half those in the better off states.  Italy was a monetary union using the lira until 1999, but real living standards in Lombardy were two and half or three times what they were in the south.  That is probably still true.  That there are considerable differences in living standards is, therefore, not the point.  Whether monetary union is a smart idea is a different issue.  It will be durable, however, provided there is full banking union and a proper central bank that acts as a lender of last resort.</p></speech>

The amount transferred through the federal budget in the United States is less than is typically transferred in this part of the world.  If we had separate statistics for the various counties of Ireland, we would discover Dublin has a very large budget surplus and that most of the rural counties, especially in the west, have large deficits.  Technically, it is feasible to have a durable monetary union including geographical regions with very different levels of economic development.  Whether it is politically a good idea is another story.  There are examples in history.  The Soviet Union was an example, as was the rouble zone.  They can have high or low levels of transfers.  The technical problem with the design of the eurozone is that it is not a banking union.</p> <p>  Let me give the Deputy another graphic example.  The state of California nearly went bust three or four years ago.  It ended up paying people with bits of paper, IOUs, because the budget deficit of the state was enormous.  However, nobody started withdrawing bank deposits from bank branches in California because there was no link between the solvency of banks in the state and the public finances of the state.  In other words, the United States is a monetary union with full banking union.  What we have seen in Greece, again in the past few weeks, has illuminated some of the original design flaws in the eurozone.  People started hefting money out of Greek banks for fear of redenomination risk and what had happened in Cyprus where bank accounts had been frozen.  What is now happening in Greece is extraordinary.  People cannot pay bills to Greek people across the road.  It is not that they cannot transfer the money out of the country into dollars or to Switzerland, for example.  A businessman in Athens who owes money to a firm in Thessalon&iacute;ki cannot pay that firm even if he has the cash.  All of the newspapers have been on about pensioners trying to withdraw &euro;50 per day from the ATM.  The SME sector is typically cash positive in the banking system, contrary to what one would expect based on reading the newspapers.  The transactions balances are immobilised.  That does not suggest a monetary union.  It cannot happen in the United States; there would be no chance of it happening.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#B00300"><p>I am pleased to attend the committee to discuss the nomination of Judge Mary Ellen Ring for appointment by the President to the position of chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  I believe that Ms Justice Ring will be an excellent chairperson of GSOC.  The Government is proposing Ms Ring to fill the vacancy of chairperson of the ombudsman commission arising from the resignation of the previous Chairman, Mr. Simon O&rsquo;Brien, at the end of January.  Mr. O'Brien resigned to take up an appointment as chief executive of the Pensions Ombudsman Service in the UK.  He had been appointed chairperson of GSOC with effect from 13 December 2011, together with Ms Carmel Foley and Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, as members for a period of five years.</p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was set up under the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, to provide a system for receiving complaints and dealing with allegations of misconduct by garda&iacute;.  The ombudsman is required to carry out its investigations in a manner that is efficient, effective and fair to all concerned and to promote public confidence in the process for resolving these complaints.  Independence is the cornerstone of GSOC&rsquo;s existence and is statutorily guaranteed.  Consequently, its investigators are given similar powers to those given to Garda members, including the power to arrest, detain and question.  In addition to investigating complaints against Garda members, GSOC may also initiate investigations in the public interest, including in situations where no complaints have been made.</p> <p>  I recently laid the GSOC annual report for 2014 before both Houses of the Oireachtas.  The year 2014 was a particularly challenging year for GSOC in which it was the subject of much political and media commentary and some controversy.  Notwithstanding these pressures, 2014 was also a busy year for GSOC.  The annual report states that GSOC received 11% more complaints in 2014 over 2013 and concluded 8% more cases in 2014, compared with 2013.  I have discussed on previous occasions with the Opposition spokespersons the question of the co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC.  I was particularly pleased to note that there was a marked improvement in efficiency, in dialogue and co-operation with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This would suggest that the revised 2013 protocols between GSOC and the Garda Commissioner are working.  While there may be room for further improvements in the turnaround of investigations, I have every confidence that this is now a shared objective of both organisations.  The powers of GSOC have been reformed and further reforms are included in the Policing Authority Bill.  Section 65 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, provides that appointments to the ombudsman commission are made by the President on the nomination of the Government and the passage of resolutions by D&aacute;il and Seanad &Eacute;ireann recommending the appointments.  The section also states that a judge of the High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court, may be appointed as chairperson.  The section further provides that where a judge is appointed to this role, he or she will not be required to carry out his or her judicial functions while chairperson of the commission.</p> <p>  The Government, at its meeting of 30 June, 2015, decided to nominate Judge Mary Ellen Ring to be chairperson of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission following her nomination for appointment to the High Court.  Ms Justice Ring was appointed a judge of the High Court by the President on Thursday, 9 July 2015.  Her swearing-in ceremony before the Supreme Court took place on Monday, 13 July 2015.  Ms Justice Ring has extensive experience as a practising barrister and as a judge of the Circuit Court which experience makes her very well qualified for the position of chairperson of the ombudsman commission.  She has also served in positions on the National Crime Council between 1999 and 2005 and as chair of the Irish Women Lawyers Association in 2008.  She has been a member of the Irish Penal Reform Trust and the Irish Council for Civil Liberties.  I reiterate that I believe she will make an excellent chairperson of GSOC and I have no hesitation in recommending her accordingly.  Ms Justice Ring will work alongside the other members of the commission, Ms Carmel Foley and Mr Kieran Fitzgerald.  I believe that the combination of the skills and experience of the three commissioners will provide the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission with strong and effective leadership. </p> <p>  Society looks to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the guardians of the peace, to create and maintain an environment where people can go about their daily lives free from threats of criminality.  Where such criminality arises, we look to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to investigate and bring the perpetrators to justice.  This is an onerous task and to carry it out, citizens give powers to the members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which are in some cases extensive powers, to carry out those tasks, including powers of arrest and detention.  However, these powers, although used in challenging and often dangerous circumstances, must be exercised in a lawful and proportionate manner.  Where there is a question about whether members have used those powers properly, they must be held to account.  Therefore, it is vital that we fully address allegations of Garda misconduct or wrongdoing in the interest of maintaining public confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and in protecting the professional standing of the overwhelming majority of dedicated and conscientious members of the force.  It is equally important that the public need to have confidence in the system of oversight of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  That is the fundamental challenge for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission which is a vital part of our policing infrastructure.  It must secure and maintain the trust and confidence of the public and of the force.  To do this it needs to be led by a team of skilled and competent commissioners.  I believe that Ms Justice Ring will bring the appropriate level of leadership and skill and, together with her fellow commissioners, will ensure that the ombudsman commission will carry out its work effectively.  On behalf of the Government I recommend Ms Justice Ring for appointment as chairperson of GSOC.</p></speech>

I offer my strong support to her comments that we all want a professional Garda force and that confidence and trust are key issues.  I agree that independence is the cornerstone of the commission.  This must be part of the deal, otherwise trust and confidence will not be achieved.</p> <p>  The Minister said that GSOC received 11% more complaints in 2014 over 2013 and concluded 8% more cases in 2014 compared with 2013.  Does this not indicate that the situation is getting worse?  </p></speech>

One of the issues I have been pursuing with both An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, is whether a mechanism could be developed - which both sides would like to see - but we have not come up with a mechanism yet.  Every complaint is serious but I have raised with the representative associations a proposal for a more informal resolution process of some of the less serious complaints.  I think it is recognised both nationally and internationally, that some complaints will turn into formal complaints that could be dealt with in a more procedural way at an earlier stage.  We do not have that process in place.  There has been some discussion with both sides as to how it might be developed.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na point of view is that it is very keen to preserve the integrity of the process and that members will not be asked to resolve something informally where there might be a question of the garda's behaviour.  They would not wish an informal process to cast doubt on the integrity of a garda or his or her behaviour.  GSOC is very keen to have this process as the commission believes it would be a much more efficient and effective way of managing complaints.  This remains under discussion.  In reply to Deputy McGrath, it is a good sign that the public is aware that GSOC exists.</p><p>Equally, there might be quite a number of complaints that would be capable of perhaps more informal resolution.  That is a matter that I will be pursuing.</p></speech>

Some of the complaints that end up with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, GSOC, should be handled elsewhere as they are not on the serious side of the spectrum.</p> <p>  Is the Minister confident that there will be better dialogue and co-operation with the Garda?  I have heard many garda&iacute; giving out about GSOC and having major issues with it.  I do not think it is good for the Garda force or for its relationship with the people and GSOC.  I am hearing a different view on the ground to the Minister&rsquo;s.  Is she aware that there is a rift between GSOC and the average garda on the ground?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1536" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#C00300"><p>One would not expect the relationship between an oversight body like GSOC and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to be without tension.  I would expect tensions in that relationship.  It is, after all, the body to which one makes a complaint and which subsequently investigates that complaint, calling people to account.  It follows a tough and analytical procedure in which people and events are investigated.</p> <p>  Having said that, many garda&iacute; will raise with me how time-consuming these complaints can be.  That is why I made the point earlier about informal resolution.  Complaints consume resources and take away from day-to-day and community policing.</p> <p>  The term &ldquo;efficiency&rdquo; was taken from GSOC itself.  The timeframe between a complaint being made to GSOC and information coming from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has shortened considerably.  Co-operation between the two bodies is there.  There is work to be done on both sides, however.  The bottom line is that the public needs to have confidence in GSOC and we need to have confidence in our Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1537" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1057" speakername="Niall Collins" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#C00400"><p>I thank the Minister for her introduction of the nomination of Judge Mary Ellen Ring as chairperson of GSOC.  I want to express my thanks to the outgoing GSOC chairperson, Mr. Simon O&rsquo;Brien.  We always read that GSOC is fraught with difficulties.  It is an organisation that has a difficult task.  In fairness, if there were not working tensions between it and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, there would be something wrong.  If one surveyed police oversight agencies across the world, one would find that GSOC is not too dissimilar to some of its counterparts elsewhere.  I suggest that the committee write a note of thanks to Mr. O&rsquo;Brien.</p> <p>  I support the appointment of Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring, who will be a positive addition to GSOC.  She has an impressive curriculum vitae, having spent 27 years as a barrister and judge in the Circuit Court, as well as being involved with the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, the National Crime Prevention Council, the Irish Penal Reform Trust and many other organisations.  What was the process used to headhunt Ms Justice Mary Ellen Ring and what criteria were followed?  I do not have a problem with it, but there is the small anomaly that she was a judge of the Circuit Court and was only appointed to the High Court last week.  This just about qualifies her for the appointment.  Does the process leave itself open to criticism or a challenge because of this?  Has she taken any High Court cases over the past week?  Does she now formally retire as a judge or does she take leave of absence?  She is serving out the remainder of Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s term, which is until December 2016.  Why does she not get her own term of appointment?  What remuneration does she receive?  Does she receive remuneration as chairperson of GSOC or does she also receive a High Court judge&rsquo;s salary?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1538" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1009" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#C00500"><p>The reply to many of the Deputy&rsquo;s questions is actually what is laid down in the legislation.  I am following the same procedure that was followed very successfully in 2006 by a previous Government.  Then, a Circuit Court judge, the late Kevin Haugh, was appointed and, as is allowed under the Act, became a judge of the High Court.  Everyone will agree he that did an excellent job as chair of GSOC.</p> <p>  Ms Justice Ellen Ring&rsquo;s remuneration is that of a High Court judge.  The legislation allows me to appoint her only for the remainder of Simon O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s term.  Obviously, we will have a new recruitment process after that point.  Clearly, at that point, the judge would be eligible to express her interest in the same way as anybody else.  I am precluded from appointing her for a full five years under the Act.  She can only serve the time that is left.  She also gets leave of absence from the High Court.</p></speech>

There is no doubt that she is assuming a challenging role.  It is very important that members of the public have confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as Deputies McFadden and Anne Ferris noted.  It is equally important that members of the public and the Garda have confidence in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and that it operates a fair, rigorous and efficient system.</p> <p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na implemented a new administrative system in 2013 whereby requests for documentation from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission were to be challenged through a dedicated e-mail address.  The team responsible would ensure that responses were provided within the maximum time limit of 30 days, as agreed in the protocols between the two organisations.  Last year was the first full year that GSOC was able to analyse this approach, which has contributed to greater efficiency.  The median times for criminal investigations declined from 155 days in 2013 to 112 in 2014, and we expect further improvement in 2015.  I expect the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to co-operate with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and, likewise, I expect GSOC to investigate complaints in a fair and rigorous manner.</p></speech>

This section, which had not been used previously, permits a Minister to order an investigation.  It could potentially be used for the investigation of serious matters.  If concerns were to arise about the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, members of the public would probably avail of a variety of mechanisms for making a complaint, including contacting the joint committee, the Minister or the Garda Commissioner.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is an independent body and the question arises as to what routes people use in respect of independent bodies.  Very often, people will take the court route.</p></speech>

I understand briefing materials have been circulated to members.  On behalf of the joint committee, I welcome Ms Eileen O'Brien, project director, Mr. Paul O'Donnell, deputy project director, and Sr. Jo McCarthy, board member.  I thank the witnesses for giving their time and expertise.

This visit had its beginnings in the visit Deputy David Stanton made to the project a number of weeks ago.  He was quite impressed by what he saw and especially by what he heard from the lads whom he met and who spoke freely to him.</p> <p>  We work with ex-offenders, ex-prisoners and people on the edges of the criminal justice system.  The men who present to us were, at one stage, small boys who were hurt and had to manage very difficult situations in their home environments and communities.  The journey to where they are now was quite difficult.  When we speak about ex-prisoners and ex-offenders, we conjure up a mental picture of what somebody like that looks like, but, from our experience, that mental picture is not the whole truth.  They started out in their families and with parents just as we started out in ours and their parents had hopes and dreams for their children like we have for ours.  The men in question had links across many Departments and agencies from a very young age and even their mothers and fathers were clients of the Department of Social Protection.  They had an involvement with the HSE and the Department of Justice and Equality and, very early in their lives, were already on the edges of the education system.  In terms of social disadvantage, they are a targeted group.  A lot of transgenerational issues come into play in the lives of these men and we work in a very creative way to address some of these needs and issues.  A core part of our work is to cut across these difficulties.</p> <p>  Addiction plays a big part in underpinning mid-range crime.  It is a lonely, isolated and vulnerable place, even though it is not always seen on the outside.  In the work we do we see the underbelly of addiction.  Recovery is very tough, often lonely and very challenging and all of the men in our project are either recovering from addiction or making steps towards recovery.  We, the footsoldiers on the ground, meet the raw reality of their lives.  We look into their eyes and see the results of the difficulties in their lives.  We are in direct contact with their struggle as they try to stay clean, sober up and stay out of trouble in order that they can manage themselves and their families.  Many of them are fathers.</p> <p>  We work from a relationship model based on the Servol model piloted in the West Indies and brought to us through the congregations that are our trustees.  We do not try to tell these guys how to be or what to do but support them to be self-reflective and self-determining and seek their own answers.  We try to bring them into contact with their own goodness and potential.  In the future we hope to continue to be resourced to do more of this work in an holistic way.  One of the things we hope for from the meeting is that the committee will support new ways of working in this field.  We believe what we do works really well and that there is a lot of evidence to show this.  There is great potential for the model to be used in other areas because the difficulties we are meeting in Cork city are to be found in all communities across the country.  We have met various challenges along the way and if any member of the committee wishes to ask questions about how we have overcome and met these challenges, we would be more than willing to answer.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1565" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul O'Donnell" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#E00300"><p>I will speak about social enterprise at Churchfield Community Trust and about the garden caf&eacute; which is widely regarded as Cork's greenest caf&eacute;.  It is situated on the grounds of Cork Foyer in Blackpool and located in a beautiful Victorian glasshouse which is open to the public Monday to Friday each week, 12 months a year, providing morning coffee, freshly baked scones and home baking.  An exciting lunch menu is on offer daily using the finest seasonal produce sourced from our community allotment and local producers.  It is important to note that this is a non-profit initiative.  The social enterprise came about because of a difficulty in sourcing work experience and employment opportunities when the economic downturn was at its peak.  Funding has been sourced from a number of organisations to which we are grateful, including the statutory and non-statutory funders which are shown on page 9 of the document.  A full detailed breakdown is given on page 10 and a further breakdown is available on request.</p> <p>  At first glance, our caf&eacute; aspires to the highest standards of many other restaurants.  However, there is a wider picture which focuses on the promotion of social reintegration through formal and informal training in several contexts.  Participants receive experiential on-site training, while also receiving formal training in electronic point of sale training, food hygiene which is HACCP certified, food preparation, customer service and communication skills and basic bookkeeping skills.  Our staff team comprises a team leader who is employed through the JobsPlus initiative of the Department of Social Protection and two part-time staff members sourced from the local community.  We have one JobBridge intern who has completed her nine-month placement and one part-time jobs incentive scheme staff member working up to 23 hours per week.  A staff member who was formerly participating in a community employment initiative works on a casual basis and we have two community employment scheme special category substance misuse support placements.  We also have one community service placement who works the complete hours in co-operation with us and the Probation Service.</p> <p>  The continued development of the garden caf&eacute; initiative is, in no small way, attributable to a partnership approach involving the Churchfield Community Trust, Cork City Council which provides the garden caf&eacute; glasshouse under a licence agreement, the Department of Social Protection initiatives, the Cork City Education and Training Board, local businesses which provide experiential training and other businesses which provide sponsorship for the new website we recently developed.  The continuing success of the initiative can be attributed to the unique community spirit and goodwill in Blackpool which is in the heart of Cork city.  It is essentially about bringing out the best in people and helping them to realise their true potential.</p> <p>  I draw the committee's attention to our successful record in terms of progression to further training and employment, including the full-time employment of a team leader, a catering assistant who has now gained employment in a nursing home, a former trainee who is now training as a chef at Cork Institute of Technology and a catering assistant who is now completing a catering course at Cork College of Commerce.</p><p>We have facilitated temporary release from Loughan House of somebody who is interested in catering.  We also facilitate work placements on requests.</p><p> I would also like to speak about new initiatives.  At our workshop which is based at Churchfield, a range of bespoke early-era furniture and garden products are currently being developed by our workshop manager and team.  The craftsmanship is of an extremely high standard.  We would also draw attention to the co-operation with local businesses, such as Akzo Nobel, where we received a contract for Bloom, which involved the assembly and painting in an assortment of colours of picnic tables and also the designing, construction and finishing of garden benches, which took place in June of this year.</p><p> The committee may be interested to know the following about our outreach initiative.  Over a period of time, it became evident that there was an emerging need locally to give support to persons in the areas of substance misuse and offending behaviour.  This cohort could not access community employment or, indeed, our garden caf&eacute; initiative due to limited availability of places.  I would refer the committee to the briefing document which depicts a list of issues and challenges that need addressing for clients in our outreach category.  These include accommodation, addiction, mental health, methadone involvement, finance and debt, literacy, low self-esteem, difficult life experiences, unemployment and education deficits.</p><p> This initiative includes the continuous development of a programme which includes horticulture, stonework and landscaping.  It also would include one-to-one key working.  This aspect of our service is not fully resourced and ongoing efforts are made to secure sustainable funding.</p><p> Networking with external agencies is of vital importance.  I acknowledge the support of the HSE through the health action zone through suicide awareness training which would include SafeTALK, Cork Simon, Ables literacy support and the Society of St. Vincent de Paul.</p><p> As an organisation, we remain flexible to new Irish Prison Service sentence management approaches.  While engaging with persons in both pre-release and post-release contexts, through a relationship model Churchfield Community Trust facilitates a shift in attitudes, values and beliefs sustained by new social and economic opportunities.  Referral sources re potential outreach participants include self-referrals, the Probation Service, the Irish Association for the Social Integration of Offenders through Cork Prison, Portlaoise Prison and the Midlands Prison, IASIO, training and employment officer, the Cork Alliance Centre and addiction services.</p><p> We respond to challenges which present through engaging with the person in a respectful way while empowering decision-making through collaborative practice.  This process is active, participatory, mutual, respectful and transparent.  This places the individual at the centre of the change process rather than programmes or procedures.</p><p> Our outreach programme acts as a signposting service for other services, such as addiction services, Money Advice and Budgeting Service, counselling, addiction counselling, the training and employment office I mentioned previously, the alcohol and offending behaviour programme which will be piloted on 27 July, and literacy support in terms of filling out applications and general forms.</p><p> In the five-year period between 2008 and 2014 Churchfield Community Trust worked with a total of 168 clients referred through the Probation Service, the Irish Prison Service, IASIO and other agencies.  Some 2.49% of clients re-offended while engaging with Churchfield Community Trust.  In 2014, 66 persons engaged re support.  The breakdown here would include: 13 community employment places, 16 outreach placements, 19 brief interventions, four persons who did not engage, two community service persons who would have completed community service hours, one person who we redirected, one JobBridge intern who I mentioned previously and a part-time job incentive scheme person who I also mentioned previously.  I would also mention our nine garden caf&eacute; team.  The referral agency statistics for 2014-15 show we had 25 probation referrals, 16 IASIO referrals, seven self-referrals and nine other agency referrals.</p></speech>

The presentation and the document they sent makes for interesting reading.  I did not realise that the Churchfield Community Trust provided such a tremendous service.  I thank the Chairman for inviting them along today.  He must have been impressed when he visited them.</p> <p>  I am looking for information on the success rate of their programmes following engagement with offenders, for example, the percentage who have entered permanent stable employment after completing the programmes, the percentage who have come through the programmes successfully, the percentage who have required further programmes because at the conclusion of a programme the staff might have felt the person required to be on a further programme, and the percentage who have re-offended after completion of the programme.  I am not sure whether they would have any idea of those figures.</p></speech>

We are not resourced to do any sort of tracking once they leave us.  It is something we certainly feel is important, in terms of the sustainability of the work and how they have integrated what they have learned as they move on and go into work.  Anecdotally, we hear constantly about the lads who are doing well as it is a small community in Cork but we would not have hard evidence.  It is something on which we hope to link with UCC and perhaps get a PhD student to take on that piece of work for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1570" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1105" speakername="Anne Ferris" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#F00500"><p>It would be interesting to conduct a follow-up, even on an unofficial basis for the trust's use, to see the success rate of them and how they are getting on.  In addition, perhaps the participants themselves would appreciate a reminder, not to be checked up on but as a follow-up to ensure they are okay at a support level.  It would be good.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Donnell mentioned the 12 issues that need addressing for clients in the outreach category.  It is important to put them on the record again as there are so many of them and they are all diverse.  The list is accommodation, addiction, mental health, methadone involvement, relationship issues, anger management, finance and debt, literacy, low self-esteem, difficult early life experiences, unemployment and education deficits.  In trying to get an idea of those 12 issues, would there be some more prevalent than others in participants of the programme?  Would any of those 12 issues with which they would present be more serious than the others or would they present with a bit of all of them?  To what extent do any of those issues impede persons going on the programme?  These are all serious difficulties and one, in itself, would be a problem.  If they are experiencing a lot of these issues, it must be really tough.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1571" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#F00600"><p>It certainly is.  When one thinks about the early difficulties, there are a lot of developmental deficits, even between age nought and age 5, and in middle childhood and into the teens the educational deficits play a part.  If I was say what presents across the board, addiction is what brings them to the door.  In recent years, because of the polydrug use, there are associated mental health difficulties because the cocktails of chemicals cause various mental disturbances.  Therefore, mental health issues are very much to the fore as well.</p><p>It can be taken that there are some levels of literacy difficulties, especially with guys in their 30s.  The younger lads are benefiting from some of the early interventions that have been in place in the educational system in the past 15 years or so.  However, before that those interventions were not available so we come across lads in their 30s with numeracy and literacy difficulties.  The low self-esteem is par for the course.</p><p> In recent times accommodation is becoming more of an issue.  Young men on their own are way down the priority for housing.  We sometimes get support from Cork Simon Community or perhaps from other supported living situations where, following treatment, sometimes there is a phase two treatment where they might get accommodation for three or four months.  The Simon Community has some independent houses - dry houses - and the lads can stay there for up to six months.</p><p> Mr. O'Donnell might like to add to that.</p></speech>

It also gives them the opportunity to realise the potential we believe these people have.  They have the same potential as the next person.  The outcomes I mentioned previously are real outcomes.  It is heartening to see people going to college or learning a trade and going back into the workplace and keeping a job.  It is important for these men, their families and their children.</p></speech>

We think of one as being a huge problem, but it is worse if they are all put together.  As the witnesses have said, addiction leads on to the other problems such as loss of accommodation, mental illness and issues with anger management.  There is a domino effect.  I appreciate the presentation and I thank the witnesses.</p></speech>

I am unclear about the Servol model and I ask the witnesses to give me a synopsis of it.  I understand the idea behind it and that it is to support clients to be self-determining.</p> <p>  I am not doing very well on questions today.  This is my second time to ask questions that have already been asked.  I am obviously not quick enough off the mark.  How many clients does Churchfield Community Trust have?  Do they carry out a programme?  Does it last for a certain length of time?  Do they come in from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.?  I would be interested to hear about the items other than the garden caf&eacute;.  Obviously the things mentioned are not just Cork problems, but apply nationwide.  We have a stepping out programme in Athlone.  I wonder how similar it is.</p> <p>  Deputy Anne Ferris asked for information about what happens to clients after they leave.  How difficult is it for them to get employment if they have a criminal record?  Does Churchfield Community Trust assist them with getting employment and how difficult is that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1580" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#G00900"><p>We have considerable difficulty.  We seek what we tend to call sympathetic employers, but they are very few and far between.  Our lads will always be at the end of the list in terms of qualifications and readiness for work.  They also have gaps in their careers.  It is hard for a person who has been inside for three or four years to account for that in a CV.</p> <p>  As Mr. O'Donnell mentioned, we opened the garden caf&eacute; in response to the lack of opportunities in employment for our lads as they were leaving.  Especially during the downturn there was no hope of placements or getting work.  As we had to respond in some way, we created our own opportunities for employment.  We sometimes get together with other community employment schemes.  We might take a placement from another scheme and that service would take a placement from us.  Some placements are worked through networking and whom one knows.  However, getting jobs is difficult.  We have a few lads who are driving and delivering pizzas, but it is really difficult.  That is why we want to progress the social enterprise.</p> <p>  We have a very good skill base.  We have an excellent workshop that was funded through the Probation Service.  We are making really good furniture and we have some good ideas about doing some work with the Department of Social Protection so that instead of a lad going back on the dole, with some seed capital and some conversations we might be able to set up a more work-orientated workshop where they could be employed and generate income.</p> <p>  A core part of progression and integration into mainstream life is for these men to actually work.  Men need to work.  It brings an additional set of feel-good factors to be able to provide for one's family.  I am not saying it is not important for women too, but for the man in the house it is really important to have regained his ground in the house and be able to work.  It has a big impact on the children and the whole family.  We struggle equally with trying to find employment.</p> <p>  As Mr. O'Donnell mentioned we would really like to see something happening with apprenticeships.  Coming from the lower levels of the academic system, many of these lads would have learnt woodwork and mechanical drawing.  In their own families they are good with their hands and they do not struggle as much in those sorts of settings.  We hope to set something up with the Construction Industry Federation to try to help them in that way.</p></speech>

We find them to be very effective.  They provide particular support to our participants in returning to education or progression to the workplace.</p> <p>  I highlight the importance of networking in the absence of infinite funding.  We network with many other organisations in Cork in terms of the resources we may have and the resources they may have.  I cannot understate the importance of the IASIO training employment officers to our participants.</p> <p>  We have a community employment scheme on our full-time programme that runs for participants in recovery from addiction through a community employment model for 19.5 hours a week.  These are special category substance misuse community employment placements.  Participants engage in education, training, work experience, therapeutic massage, acupuncture, personal development and group work.  We have a therapeutic masseuse who attends once a week and an acupuncturist who attends twice a week.  We have general group work that we would set up, as I mentioned previously, through the health action zone, including suicide awareness training.</p> <p>  I refer members to page 6 of the briefing document which gives a breakdown of other programme areas.</p><p>These comprise occupational first aid, preparation for work, food and nutrition, food and cookery, information technology, woodcraft, personal and interpersonal skills, horticulture - seeding and propagation, and horticulture - vegetable growing, which we would link in directly to providing seasonal produce for the caf&eacute;.  It is possible to run this programme because we have an excellent team.  They are a dedicated bunch.</p></speech>

They are very welcome to this committee.  I join my colleagues in commending their work, because it is a very valuable and sensible community response to a major issue with prisoners and addiction, whether it is drugs or alcohol.  It is important in a modern society that we look at sensible solutions to some of the problems that exist.  Before I became a Deputy, I worked in a very disadvantaged area and listening to many of the issues that were mentioned reminds me of my previous day job.  My first question goes back to Mr. O'Donnell's remarks that 85% of post-release clients have positive outcomes.  When he uses the phrase "moved on" or "moved on to other services", what kind of services would they move on to?</p></speech>

We would maintain a relationship with these people, having established trust, and would work with them first in our outreach and then in community employment.  Some opportunities may arise in the garden caf&eacute;, as we spoke about previously.  We are looking at expanding our horticulture initiative.  We are taking on contracts at present for maintenance of various projects and we hope to implement phase 3 of our enterprise initiative.  In terms of progression, I referred previously to training and employment officers.  Returning to college may be an option for some persons or, ideally, returning to work.  However, the options for returning to work for people with a low skills base are minimal.</p></speech>

Recently, we visited Portugal where we looked at different options relating to this issue.  Part of the system there involves alternative sanctions for drug possession where they go down the health route rather than the criminal justice route.  How much benefit would the removal of criminal sanctions, such as criminal records, have on those who pass the trust's programmes?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1586" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#H00500"><p>The whole area needs to be looked at with discernment.  Many of our lads would be in and out of prison.  They would often be caught with stuff for their own use and they might be just at the point of moving on when the charge comes up and they are back in court and back inside and it seems that cycle can continue for quite a while.  If we were to look at the Portuguese model and apply it here, it would have a positive impact, especially on the young men who have decided to look at themselves and their relationship with substances and have begun turning the corner and heading towards recovery rather than staying involved in that addiction loop. At times, they are just out of treatment or have just completed a day programme and they are put back into prison.  It can often set them back for another year or more.  Sometimes the sentence needs to stand, but there might be some discernment in order that when they go into prison, they may have the option of being in a drug-free unit or a setting where their recovery could be supported in a more holistic way.  Unfortunately, some of the prisons cannot offer that option but it is worth exploring.  Much of the time, it is treatment these lads need rather than another sentence, or at least a facility where they are in a space where they can reflect and assess themselves rather than just being given the custodial sentence.</p></speech>

The issue of early school leaving came up in respect of getting involved in drug culture.  My big concern is that sometimes we get at these young men too late.  Do the witnesses see the need for further intervention services before they end up with the trust or before they end up in prison?  Years ago, we used to say that if we had not got them by ten, they were gone.  They were on the way to Mountjoy.  That was the saying we had.  If we had not saved those kids who came from the dysfunctional families, drugs families or those where there was domestic violence, they were already on their way to Mountjoy.  Most garda&iacute; and social workers would have said that about particular parts of Dublin city.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of positive work being done by GAA clubs and scouting organisations, for example, in every town in the country.  If young people are involved and mentored at an early age, it can have a significant impact.</p></speech>

Another group of children from those families that are often forgotten about are those who do not play football, soccer, Gaelic football or hurling.  They are the other 15%, as we used to call them, who are not into that kind of stuff.  They are left hanging around disadvantaged areas or blocks of flats where they are totally exposed.  My point is that we need to get in there early with creative services to nab those kids before it is too late.</p></speech>

In the report, there was mention of an independent evaluation in 2003, 2008 and 2010.  I am asking this question because sections of society or politics will take the stuff we are talking about today with a grain of salt and will not necessarily agree with it.  They will just take the approach of locking them up and throwing away the key.  Who conducted this independent evaluation and was it a complete outside independent evaluation of the project?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1594" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Eileen O'Brien" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2015071500002#H01300"><p>It was carried out by Clarity consultants.  It was completely independent.  It was prior to us receiving funding from the Dormant Accounts Fund, before we built our workshop and the trustees purchased the house next door, and it was at a significant time in the development of the project.  The cost does not come to mind straight away, but I remember her saying to us that it might not be cheap, but it was certainly effective.  At the time, we only had space for six people.</p><p>We only had very small facilities.  Since then we have expanded threefold, despite the downturn and reductions in funding.</p><p> What has kept us so focused is the model we are using, which underpins our success.  Deputy McFadden asked a little while ago about the Servol model.  Servol came from two words, "serve" and "all".  It was pioneered in the West Indies by the Presentation Brothers, I think.  There are three main components to the method.  The first is attentive listening.  Unless I truly listen to someone's experience, I cannot really respond.  The second is a philosophy of ignorance.  I do not know what it is like to put my head down in a prison cell or to be at the raw end of life, homeless, addicted and all that.  I am ignorant about those experiences.  The third is that I have to be really aware of my cultural arrogance.  As a professional, I can come into any disadvantaged area and put myself on higher ground by saying I know the answer to your problems.  It is such a subtle relationship and requires subtle judgement sometimes.  When we meet the lads, we see them as other human beings.  We do not judge them for what they have done.  They are so used to being judged, they have their antennae up and out like stalks.  They will know in a flash.  It is non-verbal and that is how a lot of stuff is communicated.  It is so important that we do not judge.</p><p> There also has to be respectful intervention.  It is all about respect and acceptance, accepting where people are at and starting from there.  The Servol model underpins the work.  Even with the garden cafe, we could not run it like a commercial enterprise.  It is a beautiful place but we have to keep the clients in the centre of the picture all the time - their needs, their journey.  We are here to serve, and for us, it is a service to them rather than some sort of profit-making idea.  If there is ego involved, we are on the wrong page.  That might give a bigger understanding of the approach.  Sometimes it is difficult to stay loyal to one's approach because one can be led in other directions with certain funding criteria and other influences.  We have tried to stay loyal to the model.</p></speech>

That is the kind of funding that is very valuable for these projects.</p> <p>  On working with disadvantaged communities, in the 1980s, during the heroin epidemic on the north side of Dublin, teachers, garda&iacute;, social workers or juvenile liaison officers did not come into certain communities and demand or get respect.  We had to go in and earn it.  Once we had the respect of the community, we got massive support from families and extended families.</p> <p>  Going back to the addiction issue, the witnesses' report says the common denominator to all mid-range crime by 18 to 30 year olds is addiction.  My fundamental question is how we reduce that.  They are the same young people who are causing havoc as well.</p></speech>

I have training and a lot of experience in family systems, looking at systemic and trans-generational issues.  The fact that the cycle has gone on for three generations does not mean we cannot break it.</p> <p>  Sometimes, when we are working with these men, we say it is their children who will be the first beneficiaries.  For every day at our project that a lad is clean and sober, if he is going home to a family, his family is benefiting and so is his community.  While it is complex and complicated, it is not unattainable.  We keep trying and looking.  We keep up our reflective practice, asking ourselves how we might do it differently or better.  We involve the people we are working with, their experiences, and apply what is learned.</p> <p>  We are working in a systematic way with our lads.  They are looking at their families and joining the dots of their experiences.  They are not feeling so ashamed by what has been going on in their lives because they are getting more understanding and insight.  There are very good reasons all these men end up defensive and angry.  They have had really difficult lives and, to manage them, have taken on extreme defensive behaviours.  Sometimes I feel they cannot be any other way.  If they could, they would.  Not one of our lads wants to be as he is.  There is an inherent goodness in all of them if we can manage to peel back the layers.  It takes time and resources, and therapeutic interventions are necessary all along the way.  I am not sure if I am answering Deputy McGrath's question but I feel we have to keep on trying.  We are making headway.</p></speech>

Are they being sucked back in?  We have a major problem in Dublin city.  We have had 12 gang related deaths over the past 12 months.  Many of them were ex-prisoners or ex-addicts who were told to shoot a person who owed the big gangland boss &euro; 3,000 &euro;5,000 or &euro;7,000.  We call them gang debt killings.  These are totally dysfunctional people doing crazy things and regretting it for the rest of their lives.</p></speech>

It is important to provide safety for them when that relapse occurs.  At times, participants may relapse and we continue to provide intervention.  I also feel that although people may go to prison, we need to keep the connection there when they are serving a sentence.  It is important to continue to engage with them pre-release and post-release with a view to reintegration back into the community once the sentence is served. The link must be maintained.</p> <p>  In terms of younger participants, I see restorative justice initiatives as important.  There was a specific participant who offended and participated in a restorative justice practice.</p><p>I would say he was able to maintain his employment and move beyond the issue.  I know I have not answered Deputy McGrath's question directly but I would say it is important to continue to engage with people when they reoffend and relapse.</p></speech>

We do not have that.  Clearly there are groups of people working together in Cork, but it has not come to the fore.  In our experience it does not present as an issue.  I think the lads are often lured back into the world of addiction, perhaps not necessarily gangland crime.  Once they are back in the world of addiction, they are at risk of all that goes with it.</p> <p>  We encourage almost an alternative community.  Once one goes into recovery, one says goodbye to what one did before, and who one was with and where one went before.  Addiction will always hold lads in that risky and at-risk category.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/998" speakername="P&aacute;draig MacLochlainn" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015071500002#D00200"><p>I apologise to our guests for the slight delay in starting.  It is the last meeting of the joint committee before recess and we had a number of issues to deal with in private session.  I thank our guests for their patience.</p><p>The items for today is No. P00072/2012 from Dr. Edward Horgan and others relating to the landings at Shannon Airport and a discussion of Ireland's neutrality and the difference between Irish neutrality and political neutrality.  I ask people to be careful with their mobile phones as they interfere with the reception here and broadcasting.  It is frustrating for people watching.  </p><p>We are pleased to welcome Dr. Karen Devine, lecturer in international relations at the school of law and government at Dublin City University.  Following a Fulbright scholarship at Columbia University in New York from 2012 to 2013, Dr. Devine's current research is a book on the impact of patriotism on public attitudes to foreign policy in the US and Ireland.  We also welcome Mr. Paddy Smyth, foreign policy editor at <i>The Irish Times</i>.  Mr. Smyth is the former foreign correspondent at the newspaper, having served as both Washington and European correspondent.  Since his return from the US in 2002, he has been opinion editor and foreign policy editor.  He is currently working as a leader writer in the editor's office and co-ordinates the newspaper's Century project - the coverage of the 1912-1922 decade of centenaries.</p><p>The invitation to address the committee arose as a result of ongoing investigations by the committee relating to No. P00072/2012 regarding US military and CIA use of Shannon Airport and Irish airspace.  The petitioner is Dr. Edward Horgan.  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for forwarding their presentations. </p><p>I will now read the standard information regarding parliamentary privilege.  We will then have a scene-setter, setting the context for the witnesses' contributions.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>We will talk about some of the work we have done to set the scene.  The witnesses will probably be familiar with it but I will provide it for people viewing today and to have it on the record.  I will recap our work to date on this petition for members and the witnesses.  We have had public hearings with the petitioner and completed a visit to Shannon Airport where a delegation met the Shannon Group, which was formerly the Shannon Airport Authority.  We met Ms Rose Hynes, chairman; Mr. Neil Pakey, CEO; Mr. Niall Maloney, head of operations; and Ms Mary Considine, company secretary at the Shannon Group.  The delegation met members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, including Chief Superintendent John Kerin, Superintendent Derek Smart and Inspector Tom Kennedy.  Finally, the delegation met with the petitioner, Dr. Edward Horgan, in Shannon Airport.  </p><p>During the visit to Shannon Airport, members were advised that there are three types of landings.  They are civilian charter flights with transport military personnel who may have personal weapons or side arms which are maintained on board under lock and require prior approval from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  The second type is military aircraft which require a diplomatic note commonly referred to as a dip note.  It is standard on the dip note that such aircraft do not carry any weapons or ordnance.  The third type is other military aircraft where a sovereign state seeks permission to land or over fly Irish airspace where the aircraft is transport for a head of state visiting Ireland or stopping <i>en route</i>to another destination.  Granting the right to land or over fly Irish airspace is vested in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The procedure is that the relevant authorities of a sovereign state apply to the relevant Irish authority, which is the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, for permission to land or over fly.  An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has no role in the granting of the dip note.  This is under the sole authority of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The dip notes do not allow weapons on board the aircraft and aircraft with dip notes have the same status as an embassy.  It was a very useful series of clarifications around the respective roles of the persons we met.  </p><p>As a follow-up to the visit to Shannon Airport and to gain a greater understanding of the dip note or prior approval system, members invited Mr. Niall Burgess, Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport; and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade to address the committee.  These public hearings were important in giving a focus to what members consider to be a key issue, namely, what is Irish neutrality.</p><p>Today's hearing is the final one in the series.  When it is completed, we will conclude our deliberations.  The witnesses' contributions are very important in terms of their perspectives on neutrality.  I have read some of their perspectives delivered in the past.  Former Senator Maurice Hayes wrote the foreword to the conference papers presented at a conference on 8 and 9 May 2009 entitled &quot;Neutrality: Irish Experience, European Experience&quot; organised by the Irish School of Ecumenics and the Dublin Monthly Meeting Quakers Peace Committee and edited by Iain Atack and Se&aacute;n McCrum.  I was not present at the conference but I have read the transcripts.  It was a really excellent and though-provoking series of engagements.  Dr. Devine and Mr. Smyth were present at the conference and would have presented to it.  The next issue is important in setting the scene for our discussion.</p><p>In his foreword, Maurice Hayes stated:<blockquote><br /><br />Neutrality has for so long been a given in Irish foreign policy and has taken such a firm hold on the Irish imagination that it has come to be regarded almost as a constitutional imperative - which is far from the case.  The Constitution merely reserves the right to wage war to the government of the day with the approval of the D&aacute;il, and this has been further restricted by the requirement of Oireachtas consent and Security Council approval &ndash; the famous &quot;triple lock&quot; of the Nice Treaty endorsement.  <br /><br />How and why such a policy developed is lost in the mists of time &ndash; linked as it has been at various times to an anxiety not to get involved in World War II, to partition, to a preference for peace-keeping and conflict resolution, and at others to reservations about a European Common Security and Defence Policy.<br /><br />The question arises therefore whether neutrality, as professed and practised, is pragmatism masquerading as moral principle, ideology which is not fully explained, or a well-thought-out ethical position which has not yet found the language and methodology for practical application.<br /><br />There does, it seems, need to be a serious attempt to define neutrality, to spell out what it means in modern circumstances, especially since other traditionally neutral countries in Europe seem to be changing their stances in response to changed realities and relationships and new perceptions of threat and national interest. The changes in global political alignments too, where old enemies become, if not friends, at least partners in a new struggle against emerging common threats, make it all more difficult, and a less than Manichean differentiation of good and evil raises the question of which side, if any, we should be on.<br /><br />There must be a question too whether real neutrality implies a capacity for self-defence, and whether there is any half-way house between neutrality in this sense and having no defence at all; whether neutrality is a negative concept, or whether a more positive formulation can be found within the structures of international treaties by which the Irish polity has bound itself.<br /><br />There are, indeed, two views of the status of the neutral state: that of the state declaring its neutrality (which has little relevance except in time of war) and that of other states who may be potentially belligerent. These perspectives may not necessarily be the same, and it is hard to see what guarantees can be assumed by a small and isolated state which is not part of some larger arrangement for mutual assurance and protection &ndash; which in itself carries the implication of some sort of premium being required for membership.<br /><br />This brings into the debate the implications of membership of the European Union, and the degree of commitment required to a common security and defence policy, whether this can be limited in practice (or indeed in conscience) as current Irish policy requires.<br /><br />Questions then, more than answers at this stage. There may well not be clear answers which will satisfy everyone in a field redolent of fudge and ambiguity at the best of times even for the most self-confident of states. This is an area in which accommodation needs to be found by examining cases and their implications, by honestly facing up to difficulties, and by openly debating the issues.</blockquote>That was the foreword or scene setter for the transcript and we thought it would be useful to reiterate it today.  I invite Mr. Smyth to make his presentation.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for the invitation to address it on the issue of Dr Horgan's petition and specifically on the question of Irish neutrality.  I am currently the foreign policy editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>and what limited expertise I have on the subject comes from years of reporting and commenting on issues around neutrality and most specifically this State&rsquo;s engagement with the idea and the institutions of the emerging European defence union.  I am not a lawyer.  My reflections will be mainly on the doctrine and political assumptions underlying the State&rsquo;s foreign and security policy.<br/><br/>The committee's Chairman has on a number of occasions sought legal and political definitions of neutrality from its witnesses, somewhat unsuccessfully I suspect.  Both the Secretary General of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Niall Burgess, and the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, have argued that definitions of neutrality in international law relate specifically to &ldquo;time of war&rdquo;, and that Ireland&rsquo;s own operational, not legal, peacetime definition consists straightforwardly in &ldquo;non-participation in military alliances&rdquo;.  It arises from political aspirations and only from the most general of constitutional commitments to peace and peacekeeping.<br/><br/>In the context of Ireland&rsquo;s EU membership, the State&rsquo;s neutrality, its &ldquo;non-participation in military alliances&rdquo;, is taken to mean more precisely a refusal to become involved in any North Atlantic Treaty Organization, NATO, Article 5-like &ldquo;one for all, all for one&rdquo; promises, that is, promises automatically to come to the defence of any member state that is attacked or threatened. <br/><br/>That the EU in many respects is becoming what most people would see as a military alliance is beyond doubt &ndash; it does peace-enforcing, humanitarian missions, pursues international criminals, confronts pirates, shares arms purchasing and research and, increasingly, in ways that, like the proverbial walking duck, walks and talks like an alliance.  Unlike NATO, it does not do territorial collective defence.  It is not, yet anyway, a &ldquo;defence union&rdquo;.  Ireland&rsquo;s &ldquo;neutrality&rdquo; remains inviolate. <br/><br/>The Seville Declarations on the Treaty of Nice and subsequent declarations acknowledge and accommodate Ireland's &quot;traditional policy of military neutrality&rdquo;, whatever that may mean.  The principle of not signing up to &ldquo;common defence&rdquo; is constitutionally enshrined, following both Nice and Lisbon treaties, in Article 29.4. 9&deg;.  It has to be said, however, that given Ireland&rsquo;s political commitment to the EU and its integrity, it seems to me inconceivable that Ireland would not voluntarily join in the defence of any member under attack, just as it has seen the extension of loans to a bankrupt Greece as an essential imperative arising from the solidarity on which the union is based and from which this country too has benefitted.<br/><br/>The idea of military neutrality so-defined, Mr Burgess and Deputy Charles Flanagan argued, and I agree, is not in any way incompatible with a political and legal commitment to the primacy of multilateral collective security cooperation under the auspices of the United Nations which is seen, as Mr Burgess put it as &quot;primarily responsible for international peace ... We support actions of the UN Security Council in accordance with the UN Charter&quot;.  That may, and has, involved Ireland in recent years in peace-enforcing missions that are far more robust than traditional peacekeeping.  It has also involved Irish troops in small numbers in the UN operation in Afghanistan.  It has involved Ireland in what might be described as UN-mandated operations regionally subcontracted, under the aegis of NATO.<br/><br/>Clearly, Irish neutrality does not mean in principle eschewing the use of force, or assistance in its use, at the behest of the UN or in UN-sanctioned operations.  Chapter 7 of the Charter, Article 43.1, requires that &ldquo;All Members of the United Nations, in order to contribute to the maintenance of international peace and security, undertake to make available to the Security Council, on its call and in accordance with a special agreement or agreements, armed forces, assistance, and facilities, including rights of passage, necessary for the purpose of maintaining international peace and security&quot;.<br/><br/>Dr. Horgan&rsquo;s insistence that &ldquo;it is clearly in breach of international law to allow a planeload of troops on the way to a military operation or on its way to war to pass through Shannon Airport or a neutral country&rdquo; would appear in this light to make Ireland&rsquo;s membership of the UN incompatible with its neutrality.  That is not, I would suggest, his intention.  What matters , however, is the nature of the military operation and its political and legal standing. <br/><br/>Arguably, Ireland&rsquo;s UN commitment, this State&rsquo;s central strategic security doctrine, makes its facilitation of Shannon&rsquo;s use in UN-mandated operations not only compatible with its security doctrine but <i>prima facie</i>appears to require it, politically as well as legally, although the Charter does provide a case by case opt-out opportunity.  The specific mandates with which we are concerned are for the United States, US, roles in Afghanistan and Iraq.  The former is pretty straightforward, a unanimous resolution of the UN Security Council, 1368, and Ireland was a member at the time, was agreed in the immediate aftermath of terrorist attacks in the US on 11 September 2001 and which concluded with the council expressing its readiness to take &ldquo;all necessary steps&rdquo; to respond to the attacks and combat all forms of terrorism in accordance with the Charter.  In December 2001 the Security Council unanimously adopted a resolution authorising a peacekeeping force in Afghanistan under Chapter 7 of the Charter.  In late 2001, the Security Council authorised the US to overthrow the Taliban government.<br/><br/>Iraq is considerably more problematic.  Ireland in November 2002 voted yes to Resolution 1441 which threatened &quot;serious consequences&quot; if Iraq did not comply with weapons inspectors.  When the US insisted Iraq was in material breach of the resolution and the invasion went ahead in 2003, unsanctioned by the UN, Ireland refused to support it, although the D&aacute;il agreed to a Government proposal that Shannon could be used by coalition planes.</p><p>The ambiguous UN mandate was later repudiated clearly by the then Secretary General, Kofi Annan, when he said, in 2004, regarding the invasion:<blockquote><br /><br />I have indicated it was not in conformity with the UN Charter.  From our point of view, from the charter point of view, it was illegal.</blockquote>Permission to use Shannon for the Iraq operation seems, therefore, not to have been a UN-based imperative, although the D&aacute;il vote certainly gave it a degree of democratic legitimacy.  While facilitating both the Afghan-related and Iraq-related troop-transporting flights seems to be consistent politically and legally with the spirit both of our neutrality and our commitment to multilateral security through the UN, whatever we may think about the wisdom of both operations, the same cannot be said of facilitating rendition flights, if it happened.  Rendition flights are clearly illegal in international law, and clear evidence of their existence must put an extra onus on Ireland routinely to inspect flights, however diplomatically embarrassing that may prove.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1621" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karen Devine" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015071500002#F00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for the invitation to appear before the committee to discuss Ireland's neutrality and, in particular, the differences between the concepts of political neutrality and military neutrality.  At the outset, I thank Dr. Edward Horgan, author of public petition No. P00072/12, and his peace activist colleagues, Dr. John Lannon and Ms Margaretta D'Arcy, for their work in bringing the attention of the Oireachtas to this vital aspect of Irish foreign policy.<br/><br/>By way of background, I hold a bachelor of arts degree in politics and Spanish from UCD, a masters of arts in European integration from the University of Limerick, a postgraduate diploma in statistics from the University of Dublin, Trinity College, and a PhD in political science from Trinity.  I wrote my PhD dissertation on public opinion and Irish neutrality.  I am a lecturer in international relations at Dublin City University, where I teach Irish foreign policy, European Union policy and politics, and international relations and political science theories and research methodologies at bachelor, master and doctoral levels.  My scholarship on Irish foreign policy, neutrality in Europe and public opinion on foreign policy is published in the top-ranked Institute for Scientific Information journals in the world, including Cooperation and Conflict, which is ranked 21st in the world for international relations scholarship, and regularly features in those journals' most-read and most-cited indexes.  Despite the fact that Ireland is seen as one small state among the 193 in the world and its neutrality is a foreign policy orientation that is not a focus of attention in the global foreign policy realm, I manage to publish on the subject of Irish foreign policy in the top 100 scholarly journals in the world because I use innovative theories such as critical constructivism, elite socialisation, Europeanisation and the rational public hypothesis to analyse our foreign policy.  I enhance the relative importance of Irish foreign policy by drawing comparisons with other states' foreign policies.<br/><br/>I do not mean to bore members with these seemingly mundane details.  I am saying all this to highlight that my work is double-blind peer reviewed by the best scholars in the world, frequently undergoes an additional round of special &quot;hostile&quot; peer review and is subject to a further final round of editorial review.  That is to say, it has been interrogated in minute detail and found to have met the highest scholarly standards of quality and academic credibility.  The rigour and veracity of my research on Irish foreign policy is also seen through my receipt of several prestigious national and international scholarships, including a Chevening scholarship, funding from the Irish Research Council and Fulbright awards.  The scholarly work I will present today is different in many ways from that published by think tanks funded by the European Union or the Government for political purposes.  I will return to this point at the end of my presentation.<br/><br/>I am honoured to address the question of the difference between political neutrality and military neutrality.  As members can see, I have focused in my paper on three main themes or points.  The first concerns the fact that there are two concepts of neutrality in the debate on and formulation of Irish foreign policy, namely, neutrality and military neutrality.  However, only the first of these concepts exists in international law, has been practised by states over centuries and is recognised as a bona fide foreign policy norm.  There are no adjectives or prefixes associated with the term; it is simply &quot;neutrality&quot;.<br/><br/>The second point is that Irish people support the concept of neutrality, not the concept of &quot;military neutrality&quot;.  In a democracy, any Irish Government is obliged to implement this preferred neutrality policy in the international sphere as Irish foreign policy.  The third point is do with the domestic and European environment in which neutrality exists, which is dominated by EU-funded agents that are quite hostile to the truths about neutrality.  The Irish people have a right to have full transparency in regard to the moneys received by those agents, which enable them to achieve dominance of anti-neutrality discourses in the media in Ireland.<br/><br/>I will now deal in more detail with the concept of military neutrality, a concept that does not exist in international law.  It is not a recognised practice of states and is not considered a traditional foreign policy norm in the international system.  &quot;Military neutrality&quot; is a term created by governments of neutral states which sought membership of the EEC-EU as a way to agree at the EU level to the progressive framing of a common defence policy leading to a collective EU defence and the eradication of neutrality while, at the same time, telling their electorates at home that the neutrality of the state is retained.  The definition of the term has changed over time.  For example, on <font color="#2F2F2F">11 March 1981</font>, as main Opposition finance spokesperson, Garret FitzGerald referred to it as meaning non-participation in a military alliance and not being a member of NATO, the Western European Union or any other alliance.<br/><br/>Various Ministers and leaders have proffered different definitions since then, reflecting the variation in responses to developments in EU security and defence policy ambitions.  On 18 January 2003, the then Minister for Defence, Michael Smith, stated, &quot;There is no such thing as, if you like, complete military neutrality.&quot;  That same year, the then Minister for Foreign Affairs, Brian Cowen, defined military neutrality as &quot;non-membership of military alliance, and specifically, non-membership of an alliance with a mutual defence commitment&quot;.  In 2004, then Government adviser, Martin Mansergh, stated that military neutrality is defined as non-membership of &quot;pre-existing military alliances with mutual automatic obligations&quot;, and asserted that Ireland's foreign policy tradition is only &quot;partly described as neutrality&quot;.  The Irish Government, post-Lisbon treaty ratification, effectively redefined the concepts of &quot;military neutrality&quot; and &quot;non-participation in military alliances&quot; to mean, first, Irish membership of the WEU military alliance through the back door of a merger with the EU and, second, Ireland's assumption of the WEU's Article V mutual defence clause.  In figure 1 of my paper, I have mapped the EU mutual clause and the changes in regard to that clause over time versus the Government's concepts of military neutrality.<br/><br/>Scholars have concluded that the term &quot;military non-alliance&quot; has been defined in such a way as to have &quot;close to no meaning at all&quot;.  The decision to aid belligerents in war is against neutrality-based foreign policy and incompatible with Article 2 of the Fifth Hague Convention on the Rights and Duties of Neutral Powers and Persons in Case of War on Land of October 1907.  The Irish Government's decision to permit the transit of hundreds of thousands of US soldiers through Shannon Airport on their way to the Iraq war from 2003 onward violated the international law on neutrality and set this State apart from other European neutrals, which refused such permission.  Mr. Cowen insisted at the time that &quot;Irish neutrality is a policy choice and is not defined exclusively on the basis of international legal instruments such as the Hague Convention of 1907&quot;.  Mr. Cowen maintained, moreover, that the Government had to &quot;define neutrality in a very complex set of circumstances, the value of international friendships and the expectations that come with those friendships&quot;.  He reiterated the new mantra that &quot;neutrality policy has also been informed by the view that military neutrality on its own is not sufficient to maintain conditions of peace and security internationally.&quot;<br/><br/>I move now to the second point examined in my paper, which is to do with Irish public opinion and neutrality.  The first point to make is that the Irish public does not define neutrality as non-membership of a military alliance.  The assertion by Irish Government elites that their narrow definition of &quot;military neutrality&quot; is likewise held by the Irish public is wrong.  That elite view is reflected in the claim by the then Minister for State, Tom Kitt, in 2003 that &quot;the central and defining characteristic of Irish people in this area ... is our non-participation in military alliances&quot;.  On the contrary, surveys conducted in the 1980s, 1990s and 2000s show that an average of just 2.5% of Irish people define neutrality as staying out of NATO or non-membership of military alliances.  The Irish public's concept of neutrality is clear-cut and broadly consistent over time, with the top three substantive elements being &quot;not getting involved in war&quot;, &quot;independence or staying independent&quot; and &quot;not taking sides in wars, that is, impartiality&quot;.  Table 1 in my paper sets out the rank order of neutrality definitions offered by the Irish public and the percentage of people who adhere to the concept of miliary neutrality.</p><p>The public concept accords with neutrality in international law and the most strongly supported public concepts closely resemble the wider, &ldquo;active&rdquo; concept of neutrality that embodies characteristics such as peace promotion,<font color="#FF0000"></font>non-aggression, the primacy of the UN, and the confinement of State military activity to UN peacekeeping, not being involved in wars, and maintaining Ireland&rsquo;s independence, identity, and independent foreign policy decision-making, especially in the context of &ldquo;big power&rdquo; pressure.  This is from the 2001-2002 Irish Social and Political Attitudes Survey, ISPAS.  The results of 13 surveys from 1981 to 2013 show that Irish public attitudes towards neutrality are also consistent over time.  Depending on the question wording and response options available, between roughly two in three and four in five people support neutrality and one in five rejects it.  Table 2 in my paper shows these data in detail, grouped by question type.  Contrary to the mistaken claims of academics, which are due to the misinterpretation of data, public concepts of neutrality are neither &ldquo;inconsistent&rdquo; nor &ldquo;limited&rdquo;.<br/><br/>Public opinion on neutrality is based on values of independence and patriotism.  The results of a structural equation model analysing ISPAS data, shown in table 3 in my paper, indicate that the more an individual values Irish independence and the prouder an individual is to be Irish, the more that person favours the maintenance of Irish neutrality.  The relationship between independence and patriotism is symbiotic.  As historian Ronan Fanning surmises, &ldquo;by the end of the Second World War neutrality had become what it largely remains in the popular mind until today: the hallmark of independence, a badge of patriotic honour inextricably linked with the popular perception of Irish national identity&rdquo;.  Table 3 shows the regression weights of a structural equation model showing the results of this.<br/><br/>Normative democratic theory supports the view that citizens are a wise source of foreign policy, preventing foreign policy designed solely in the interests of elites and even restraining leaders&rsquo; war-making proclivities.  Gaps between the policy preferences of leaders and citizens are seen as problematic and reflecting different values and interests rather than levels of attention or information.  Where public opinion is structured and informed, democratic theory calls for responsiveness by policy-makers.  In other words, the Irish Government needs to heed public opinion on neutrality because it is coherent, consistent and based on important and relevant political values and identity.<br/><br/>The third part of my presentation concerns the domestic and international environment in which neutrality is discussed and defined.  Irish public opinion on foreign policy is extremely politicised because treaties that extend the scope of the objectives of the European Community, EC, or European Union, EU, are subject to a ratification device of a binding referendum in Ireland.  Opinion polls have shown that Irish neutrality is the top substantive policy reason given by Irish people who voted against the Single European Act and the Maastricht, Amsterdam and Nice treaties in referendums.  As the gap between the &quot;yes&quot; and &quot;no&quot; votes has narrowed in parallel with the expansion of EU foreign, security and defence policy, referendum campaigns in Ireland have become increasingly contentious and fraught because a ratification failure in one or more EU member states means the treaty in question cannot come into force.<br/><br/>In June 2008, the Irish people rejected the Lisbon treaty by a substantial margin of 53.4% against, 46.6% in favour, based on a healthy turnout of 53.1%, and another phase of European integration was brought to a grinding halt.  Neutrality was the most divisive issue in the Lisbon treaty referendum campaign.  Research showed that &ldquo;strengthening neutrality&rdquo; was a major driver of people&rsquo;s decision to vote &quot;no&quot;.  Irish voters who rejected the Lisbon treaty to safeguard neutrality were correct because neutrality is incompatible with the European Union's defence provisions enacted through the Lisbon treaty.  Table 4 in my paper compares the various elements of neutrality with the EU's common security and defence policy, CSDP.  I will not go into detail on that, because it will be made available in the paper.<br/><br/>On the power structure of discourses on Irish and European neutrality, there is evident bias in the research and reporting of public attitudes to neutrality and other European security and defence options.  Irish scholars have criticised the &quot;sizeable body of feeling, innuendo and unargued comment in the writings of some politicians, journalists and historians who are clearly unhappy with Ireland&rsquo;s ambiguous position&quot;.  One of the many financial instruments at the disposal of the EU is its external relations budget for information programmes, amounting to &euro;10.7 million in 2008.  These moneys are expended on &quot;the organisation of visits for groups of journalists&rdquo; and &ldquo;support for the information activities of opinion leaders that are consistent with the European Union&rsquo;s priorities&rdquo;.  These journalist &quot;opinion leaders&quot; dominating the discourses on the EU and neutrality in Irish newspapers and broadcast media shows co-ordinate their positions with the EU's specially funded &quot;academics&quot;, the so-called &quot;Jean Monnet&quot; lecturers.<br/><br/>Officially, Jean Monnet chairs are teaching posts with a specialisation in European integration studies.  Unofficially, these posts, co-financed by the EU up to a level of 75%, are to encourage &ldquo;associations of professors and researchers to communicate, teach and [I emphasise] promote European Integration Process&rdquo;.  The public are largely unaware of the extent to which the seemingly objective academics dominating the media discourses in Ireland are, in fact, on the EU's payroll and tasked with promoting the EU's CSDP and concomitant hostile discourses on neutrality.  Such agents also dominate board positions in bona fide academic institutions such as the Royal Irish Academy, RIA.<br/><br/>These EU-sponsored journalists and so-called Jean Monnet academics also benefit from further financial resources through EU-funded think tanks such as the Institute of International and European Affairs in Ireland.  I am given to understand the European Commission also finances the State broadcaster's European correspondent position based in Brussels.  The list goes on.  Suffice to say that the truly academic and objective voices on neutrality and EU CSDP are rarely heard and actively suppressed by these agents.  The media have a responsibility to ask contributors to declare their affiliations with the EU and the amount of funding they have received over the years for their work on behalf of the EU.<br/><br/>In this final section of my presentation, I highlight some portraits of public preferences that are clearly coloured by the political and policy preferences of the authors who are part of the EU-funded elite.  Examples include the omission of key public preferences in the realm of foreign policy from Eurobarometer surveys, and inaccurate reporting of Eurobarometer-type questions by academics in the media.  Rabin argues that <blockquote>... the Eurobarometer has truly become an instrument of governance, as they say nowadays ... it is a tool that, I believe, researchers trust ... The Eurobarometer has now become a tool that we can describe as practical, indispensable and incontestable.</blockquote>Eurobarometer can only be considered a tool of governance if it does indeed capture the true policy preferences and foreign policy concepts of the publics in the EU.  Does it?  In a review of EC polling from 1962 to 1982, I found evidence that the balance between the Eurobarometer functions of evaluating public opinion and acting as a tool of politics is skewed towards the latter, evinced through the generalisation of claims as to the truth of &quot;European&quot; peoples&rsquo; preferences based on the omission of several cases of populations, in particular Ireland, and the universalisation of claims to knowledge of public foreign policy preferences based on a seemingly politically motivated omission of evinced preferences from the list of options presented to respondents.  For example, Richard Eichenberg claims that &ldquo;the 'neutralist option', so enthusiastically researched by the pollsters, never exceeded 20% in any country&rdquo; but it is clear from the data I present in table 5 that neutrality was favoured by a majority of 31% in France, sizeable minorities of 29% each in Italy and Belgium, and in figures that greatly exceeded 20%.  Anton DePorte volunteered that &ldquo;reports of neutralism and pacificism in European public opinion&rdquo; were of concern to elites that feared that &ldquo;the domestic base of support for the Alliance had been eroded&rdquo;.  Unsurprisingly, given EC's horror at the support for neutrality among NATO member state populations, the neutrality response option was dropped from the questionnaire wording in Eurobarometer surveys conducted after 1979.<br/><br/>Another classic case drawn from media discourse in Ireland involves a pseudo-academic analysis of an <i>Irish Times</i>poll carried out by TNS-MRBI in an article entitled &quot;Poll Reveals a Canny Electorate&quot;.  The author of the piece, a Jean Monnet, stated that &ldquo;68 percent of us are quite happy for Ireland to join some form of a common European defence&rdquo;.  In fact, the question asked people to consider the statement, &ldquo;Ireland should consider joining a future European Union common defence&rdquo;.</p><p>The question definitively did not ask people whether they would have Ireland join a European Union common defence.  Instead the respondents of the survey were asked to consider a statement about considering this idea and 68% replied that they would be okay if Ireland considered such a hypothetical scenario.</p><p> These EU agents define neutrality in purely negative terms, that is, "notions of pacifism and isolationism", or deny the content of the concept altogether and demand the erasure of neutrality from all discourses, for example, "Neutrality is not a foreign policy and does not even give content or orientation to a foreign policy ... There is no correlation between a position of military neutrality and the content and substance of a foreign policy" and "the content of Irish foreign policy has nothing whatsoever to do with neutrality".  Thus "we must, as individuals, stop using the word 'neutrality', which has nothing to do with our foreign policy".  These agents could not be more wrong.  Despite the EU demands for its removal and the fact that political parties have placed neutrality in a zone of meaningful silence in political discourse, from Wolfe Tone's clearly stated manifesto for Irish neutrality in 1790 up to the present day, the Irish people have consistently advocated a legally correct and normatively vital concept of neutrality and associated it with signifiers of independence, self-determination, global cosmopolitanism, anti-colonisation and anti-imperialism.</p><p> I suspect that the names of the three petitioners lobbying the committee today will be added to the list of those luminaries known for advocating the same approach to Irish international relations, following, as they do, in the wake of Daniel O'Connell, Se&aacute;n Lester, P&aacute;draig Pearse, James Connolly, Frank Aiken and Eamon de Valera.  The Irish and Iraqi people owe them a debt of gratitude.</p></speech>

I thank the two contributors for their extremely interesting presentations.</p> <p>  First, I overwhelmingly subscribe to what Dr. Devine said regarding the people's understanding of neutrality.  Let us be clear - the people's understanding is that we do not get involved in wars and we do not wish to be involved in military alliances.  That is not from a parochial basis but from the opposite basis.  It is from the basis of being good internationalists who wish to side with people who may be subject to the bullying of big powers.  That is really the people's understanding of neutrality and why, for example, the facilitation of the war in Iraq flies in the face of the notion the people of this country have of neutrality.  That was clearly demonstrated in opinion polls that were carried out on the matter by the Peace and Neutrality Alliance, PANA, and in the massive mobilisations against that war.  One of the major reasons that people voted against the various EU treaties was precisely on this basis.</p> <p>  Dr. Devine agrees on that but what does Mr. Smyth think about it?  If we wish to have a notion of neutrality that is in line with the opinions of the people, is that not the opinion of the people in the first place?  Linked to that, is the refusal of the Government to define neutrality due to the fact that it knows that is what the people believe neutrality to be and it does not want it pinned down because it knows what the answer is?</p></speech>

I have a sense that, in some ways, as part of the political culture of the State, it is like being against sin.  It is a good thing and we have always been like that.  Therefore, it is necessary to dig into that to see what it means in practice.  That is why I placed much emphasis in my contribution on the positive security doctrine of the State, which is to see that international conflict would be resolved through the UN.  That necessarily means, perhaps, getting involved in wars, which necessarily involves the use of military force, and an automatic commitment by us to support and assist UN-mandated operations, regardless of whether we like them.  I believe our public understanding of neutrality is more sophisticated than just saying that we want to be on the side of the good guys and that we are anti-imperialist and anti-colonialist.  It involves an understanding of, and pride in, our UN commitment.  There is a slight contradiction then in terms of what their attitude is to the use of military force, because they recognise and support-----</p></speech>

Does he honestly believe that is the case?</p></speech>

It involves neutrality on the one hand and it involves a strong commitment to the UN and its role in maintaining the peace.  There was a reference in one phrase to neutralism and pacifism.  I believe there is a confusion.  Certain sections of the Irish neutrality lobby definitely try to associate neutralism with military pacifism, but that is not our foreign policy position.</p> <p>  To get back to how the Government defines it, the Government has a precise definition of military neutrality.  It is non-involvement in Article 5 type commitments.  Anything going towards that, such as involvement in the EU's increasing role as a military alliance, is acceptable in terms of the Government's definition.  The point I was making is that there does not appear to be any inconsistency there.</p> <p>  In terms of defining political neutrality, Governments over time have said that Ireland has never been politically neutral.  We did not join the Non-Aligned Movement, for example, when that was a big deal in the 1960s.  Like it or not, and I do not necessarily like it, we sided politically with the West against the Soviet Union over the years.  We are politically sympathetic to the values of western democracy.  One cannot apply the term "neutral" in that context.</p></speech>

However, is that type of pragmatic, political, somewhat <i>&agrave; la carte</i>view of neutrality which the political elites in this country have, particularly when it came to the Iraq war, in line with the sentiment of the people on these matters?  I do not believe it is.  The people are much more consistent and, frankly, more principled in their understanding of neutrality.  In so far as they are, the people's view of neutrality accords better with a meaningful definition of neutrality as set out in, for example, the Hague Convention.</p></speech>

I would ask the Deputy about his appreciation of the people's attitude to the Afghan war, for example.  It seems to me that in terms of legitimacy internationally, the Afghan war was quite clear-cut.</p><p>I was reporting in America after 9/11 and there was no significant force in America arguing against the intervention in Afghanistan.  There was unanimity in the Security Council, and in Ireland there was no serious objection to sending forces, including Irish forces, to Afghanistan.  If one compares that with Iraq, one will find a significant difference in public attitudes, but it does not take away from the fundamental point about the nature of attitudes to neutrality.</p></speech>

I was looking at the definition of neutrality at one stage and I know that it depends on one's political view.  In essence, however, it is not supporting or helping either side in a conflict or disagreement.  It also means a state not offering a preferred view on that conflict.  I would imagine that would be a concise and reasonable definition of neutrality.  I recall speaking some months ago at a meeting of either this committee or the Joint Committee on European Affairs, and I aligned it with what is happening in Shannon.  For instance, if two states are at war and one of their planes with armed troops lands at a third state to refuel before attacking the other state, the third state is in essence helping one side in that conflict.  We appear to have helped America, which has been complicit in the violation of human rights and proven torture, with the hundreds of thousands of troops that have landed in Shannon and then flown on to Iraq and Afghanistan.  To me, it is a decisive breach of neutrality.  I would like to have the witnesses' views on that.</p></speech>

Deputy Halligan's definition of neutrality begs the central question I have tried to raise in my paper, that is, when one is not talking about a conventional war but about an operation which is mandated by the UN Security Council, to talk about being neutral between the UN and the Afghans does not make sense because that is not what this is about.  This is about how the international community tries to regulate security on an international level.  I completely accept Deputy Boyd Barrett's arguments about Iraq, that there are considerable complexities in that issue.  It is not as simple as having a UN mandate.</p> <p>  To answer Deputy Halligan's question about what neutrality means, that it is not taking a side in a war, what is going on in Afghanistan?  Is it a war?  What is going on in other operations where we have been involved in peace enforcing, which is taking one side and policing a situation on behalf of the international community very robustly?  At the moment, our troops in Golan are engaged in peace enforcing missions which involve taking a decided position against ISIS-linked forces in Golan who are threatening our troops and those of other UN countries.</p></speech>

There are so many definitions of neutrality under international law that it becomes irrelevant in the sense that a country defines its own neutrality by how the people choose.  As Deputy Boyd Barrett has said, there was overwhelming opposition to the Iraq war, yet we are complicit in assisting one country to bomb parts of Iraq, or send troops and weapons there.</p> <p>  I think Dr. Devine said either that neutrality cannot be defined under international law or that it is not accepted.  I do not know but I would imagine that neutrality is self-defined within the nation that wants to become neutral and not take part in a conflict.</p> <p>  I want to come back to Mr. Smyth.  There is an absolute difference between a peace initiative and taking part in preventing conflict, and taking part in a conflict or helping that conflict by supplying weapons or rhetoric.  The Irish people are quite clear if they decide, believe and agree with Irish troops being sent as peacekeepers to some area where the confrontation may have stopped for a period.  They are there to see that it does not recur.</p> <p>  All of this essentially comes back to how we participate, and have participated, in helping the Americans both in Iraq and Afghanistan.  Regardless of whether we like it, it is inconceivable to think that many troops that flew from Ireland to Afghanistan and Iraq have not taken part in some sort of war effort, either by firing their weapons or bombing.</p> <p>  It comes back to my point about two countries at war with one in the middle.  If one of the ones at war asks to fly into the country in the middle because it wants to bomb the other country, that country is not neutral if it allows that.  That is my opinion and the opinion of many hundreds of thousands of people.</p></speech>

I will be brief.  We have to be very careful when D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann votes on something that it is the democratic view of the Irish people.  It is the democratic view of the Irish people to elect those who make the call in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann.  One can say that 56% of people do not want to pay their water rates, yet those charges have been introduced.  I would imagine that if one took an opinion poll - perhaps Mr. Smyth has done so - the vast majority of Irish people would probably still have no truck with anything to do with Iraq.</p> <p>  I have spoken at meetings throughout the country, including my own constituency, and have met support groups in Shannon.  People may not use the word "complicit" in helping the Americans, but they certainly do not see it as any form of neutrality that we allow all these troops and arms to pass through Shannon.  In 2013, a Hercules aircraft armed with cannons, was photographed there.  It was flying out to Iraq or Afghanistan, so we are anything but neutral in that sense.</p></speech>

I agree that refuelling planes and the transit of US troops through Shannon on their way to a theatre of war does breach the international law of neutrality.  It means we are not neutral.  When the Government agreed to do that, it broke the law on neutrality.  Given that neutrality is not in the Irish Constitution, there is nothing anyone can do about that.  It is a government decision.  Dr. Horgan did take a case against the State for these actions, claiming it was a breach of international law.  The judge agreed that it was a breach of the customary international neutrality but, because it is not in the Constitution, as a judge his hands were tied.  Dr. Horgan was right.  Allowing the transit of troops is specifically prohibited in the Hague Convention of 1907, the international law on neutrality.</p> <p>  It is important to differentiate.  There is a lot of talk about the United Nations and Ireland's participation in it.  Transit of troops through Shannon has nothing to do with a United Nations mandate.  It is a bilateral agreement between the Irish and US Governments.  Talking about the UN is a red herring in that respect.  The UN does not force states to provide troops or get involved in wars.  The point of the UN is to regulate the use of force.  The UN does not mandate a war; it mandates a response to a threat of war or a war that has broken out.</p> <p>  Mr. Smyth is right in saying that Ireland is moving towards participation in peace enforcement missions, which are very distinct from peacekeeping missions.  Peacekeeping is when we are asked by parties who are in conflict to come in and maintain a truce.  The parties involved in the conflict want our presence to keep the peace so that negotiations can continue and the conflict can be resolved.  There are very important, though subtle, differences between this and peace enforcement.</p> <p>  One could say that the International Security Assistance Force, ISAF, to which Ireland contributes about five troops, is basically a way for the Government to fly the flag.  Once one member of the Defence Forces is involved in an operation, our flag gets hoisted and we are considered to be present in that mission.  The ISAF peace enforcement mission in Afghanistan does not involve Irish soldiers in actual peace enforcement activities.   Irish soldiers are carrying out bomb disposal there.  There is also an administrative individual in the operation's headquarters.  Ireland has never been involved in actual peace enforcement in practice.  That is a distinction that should be made.</p> <p>  I may have gotten it wrong or been unclear in terms of what Deputy Halligan picked up from what I was saying.  As a scholar who has been studying neutrality for 20 years, to me, what neutrality means is very clear cut.  It means not participating in wars, maintaining independence so as to be able to resist any great power pressure to get involved in wars, and being impartial in respect of the sides involved in a war.  This is an established norm in international law.  The Irish public's concept of neutrality correlates very well with this international legal concept and its associated rights, duties and obligations.  The Irish people clearly did not want the Government to sanction the transit of troops through Shannon.  In that respect, neutrality is a way for the people to try to limit the behaviour of the Government.  I hope that answers the Deputies' questions.</p></speech>

It is somewhat academic.</p> <p>  Dr. Devine has a point that the decision by the D&aacute;il to support the illegal operation in Iraq was a violation of Irish neutrality.  Whatever about the legal definition, the concept of Irish neutrality was violated.  However, the D&aacute;il has a right to do that.  It is the voice of the people, whether one thinks it is imperfect or otherwise.  That is a reality.  It is also a reality that our foreign policy, like that of every state in the world, is not necessarily consistent or entirely coherent.  I think our attitude to neutrality is a bit incoherent.</p></speech>

In Chad, the Irish troops were patrolling the areas around refugee camps to ensure that rebels did not try to attack the aid workers or the refugees.  It was not necessarily the case that they were involved in what would be - there are degrees of military intensity, if I may put it that way.  There is a low degree of military intensity and a high degree of military intensity.  The high degree was not present in those missions and that is the distinction.  It is definitely not academic.

It was not illegal to make the resolution.  However, the Government is then speaking out of both sides of its mouth, saying that we are neutral but also saying we are sanctioning something within a legal framework, which people would not see as being neutral.</p> <p>  An issue which we have not really touched on, which Mr. Smyth mentioned, is the matter of rendition flights.  Mr. Smyth said that he does not believe the same can be said of facilitating rendition flights if that has been done.  We should consider the role of a neutral country, particularly in a space like Shannon, in the policing of planes coming through.  It was clear from the Ministers who spoke to us that there is an understanding or gentlemen's agreement between ourselves and the US.  If they tell us everything is hunky dory and there is no rendition happening on a plane, we do not touch the plane or check it out.  The Garda was clear that it cannot go anywhere near a plane unless it gets sanction from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade to do so.</p> <p>  How consistent is that policy of taking the Americans' word for it with other neutral countries whose position of neutrality is enshrined in their legal frameworks?  Is there an argument that a fully neutral state should police the likes of the planes coming through Shannon to ensure that everything is as it should be?  Should we just take the word of our US counterparts that it is not happening?  How do we fit in internationally in this respect?</p></speech>

It has got to do with the rule of law, and the obligation is on all states when there is clear evidence that rendition has been taking place.  That the American authorities, and other countries, were involved in illegal renditions changes the onus on a state through which planes are passing, and it seems to me there is then an assumption that they should presume that searches will happen.  It is fair to say that we trust these people because they have never lied to us before, but it is clear these people have been lying internationally, and that is the issue.  It is about the rule of law, not neutrality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1667" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karen Devine" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015071500002#L00200"><p>It is an interesting question.  I agree with Mr. Smyth in that it is certainly not in the Hague conventions.  Rendition was not a concept that existed in the early 1900s.  However, the question must be asked whether rendition is part of the war effort or something that just happens because individuals in a government do not like particular individuals or that they discriminate against or are racist towards particular individuals, and that they are violating their human rights.</p> <p>  Mr. Smyth is right.  Rendition violates a number of international laws in terms of the rights of individuals.  However, in terms of it being argued as being part of the war effort, George Bush was explicit in saying that the use of what effectively amounted to torture until just before organ failure in Guantanamo was the basis of the methods they were using in Guantanamo.  If those individuals are being renditioned because it is part of the war on terrorism, as such, and part of the illegal war against Iraq, then it could be considered that there is an obligation to ensure that a country is not aiding that particular aspect of the war effort, if it is considered part of the war effort.</p> <p>  It is very rare that war is declared in the modern world.  Very few people declare that they are going to war against state X or Y.  George Bush's war was a war on terrorism, so it was a war on a concept.  It was not a war against specific states, even though he invaded the states of Iraq and Afghanistan.  </p> <p>  For me, neutrality is an inter-state type of concept that exists in international law.  However, it is also a normative concept and there are moral considerations involved in states that do not want to get involved in war.  It is not just about survival.  It is primarily about security and survival, which is what Irish neutrality was about during the Second World War, but it has become increasingly informed by a normative dimension because of the development of arms and technology.  The military power of certain super states in the international system has meant that it is difficult for ordinary, non-super states to be able to resist some of the war making proclivities of the larger powers in the system.  If it is the case that Ireland is considered a neutral state and that there is a normative dimension to that, Ireland would have an obligation to search those planes to make sure that rendition is not happening, if it is considered part of the war effort.  We should bear in mind that George Bush declared war in Iraq in March 2003 and declared the war had ended in May 2003, but it continued for at least ten years after that.  The official declaration of war is one aspect but what we consider warfare, in terms of the killing of civilians and soldiers, is another.</p></speech>

Does he find US planes carrying military personnel stopping over in those states?</p> <p>  To return to the point about the rendition flights, there are international organisations that have said they can trace planes that have travelled through Shannon and people who have ended up being water boarded in Guantanamo.  They say there is enough circumstantial evidence to argue that some of the planes coming through Shannon should be stopped and checked.  I am trying to put Ireland on a league table internationally of other countries which would have a high standing as being neutral.  Would they consider a Shannon stopover a breach of their neutrality or not?</p></speech>

However, in the context of the European Union, the Partnership for Peace, PfP, programme involves close co-operation between the military forces of the neutrals - Austria, Sweden and Finland - and NATO forces.  In that context, NATO planes would visit the PfP countries and would use the facilities, not to specifically transport military personnel.  Nevertheless, they would be the planes of a military alliance.</p></speech>

They would have been prohibited and that is what a neutral state is supposed to do.  The Government has been disingenuous in two aspects.  First, once the war broke out in 2003, when the US invaded Iraq, the Government kept referring to the fact that it had always allowed US planes to refuel at Shannon.  It did not distinguish between the fact that there was a war going on and it was allowing planes to assist a war effort by facilitating these landings, whereas previously there was not a war going on, and the law on neutrality comes into effect once war is declared.  That is one aspect about which the Government was disingenuous.  The second aspect has slipped my mind.</p></speech>

In terms of setting the scene, and the exchange so far has been excellent, I read former Senator Maurice Hayes's forward to the transcript of the conference held over six years ago.  We were looking at Sean McCrum, who had tried to frame some questions, but looking at them now, Dr. Devine is very clear about the framework of neutrality as it is internationally understood, and that what Ireland has done by facilitating the flights in Shannon is not in line with the international definition of neutrality.  Mr. Smyth's perspective is that it is a more fluid concept than that defined in international law.  I will not go into that because both witnesses have given their perspectives but should we have a referendum on enshrining neutrality in the Constitution?  The case was taken by the petitioner, Dr. Horgan, but it could not be successful because there is not a clear legal definition in this State that represents what has been the stated political imperative for decades.  What is the opinion of the witnesses?  Would it be helpful to have a clear legal definition of neutrality to clear up the confusion?  Should we just leave it to the interpretation by a government in a given period or do we put it to the people and allow them decide?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-15a.1675" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Karen Devine" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2015071500002#M00100"><p>I repeat that there is a very clear legal concept of neutrality.  States do not get to make up what they think neutrality is.  It is a legal concept that is enshrined in the Hague Convention.  The manner in which states have actually put it into practice has generally accorded with these international laws.  If the behaviour of a state did not accord with international law, the concept would lose its significance and there would be no point in having an international law on neutrality.  International laws are in place to regulate the behaviour of states and set expectations regarding their behaviour, particularly in matters of war and peace that are so vital.<br/><br/>The question of whether neutrality should be enshrined in the Constitution is an interesting one.  I have written a paper on the matter which was published in <i>Irish Political Studies</i>in 2009.  I have e-mailed six or seven of my articles to the members of the joint committee.  In my 2009 article I looked at the positions of Irish political parties on neutrality and European Security and Defence Policy in successive decades from the 1960s through to the 2000s.  One of the things that struck me was how the political parties had moved across a matrix from being in favour of and supporting active neutrality - the legal concept of neutrality and the normative values about what I have spoken - towards a maximum EU defence policy involving signing up to the mutual defence clause, which is what we did when we ratified the Lisbon treaty.  Interestingly, I found that as the decades progressed, the Labour Party which had stated neutrality should be enshrined in the Constitution and made a number of interventions in the Houses of the Oireachtas to propose a Bill to that end had joined Fine Gael and Fianna F&aacute;il in leaving real, active or positive neutrality aside and moving to the minimalist concept of not being a member of a military alliance.  The Labour Party knew that it would eventually agree to maximum EU defence.  The mantle then transferred from the Labour Party to the Green Party.  In the 1990s the Green Party stated we should have neutrality enshrined in the Constitution.  When it formed a coalition with Fianna F&aacute;il, it changed its stance on neutrality and went the way of the Labour Party.  I concluded that in the 2000s Sinn F&eacute;in had adopted the idea of including neutrality in the Constitution.  It is interesting how the idea of including it in the Constitution has been transferred over the decades through the political parties.<br/><br/>The Government is not in favour of holding a referendum on this issue because it would then be constrained by international law on neutrality.  In other words, if neutrality were to be enshrined in the Constitution, Edward Horgan would have won his case because the judge would have found that the Government had violated the constitutional provisions on neutrality.  As I have said, neutrality is clearly defined in the Hague Conventions.  It is a legal concept.  There is no fuzziness about what it requires.  There is a debate around it because many of the political parties - certainly, the mainstream political parties and the parties of the right - want all member states of the European Union to eventually become member states of NATO, to be involved in collective defence arrangements and to sign up to mutual defence clauses.  That is why it is claimed that the concept of neutrality is somehow fuzzy.  As I have argued, it is not.  Saying it is fuzzy is a political device or strategy used by the Government to continue to do what it wants to do.  In the case we are discussing it wants to facilitate US warplanes landing at Shannon Airport en route to a theatre of war.</p></speech>

That enrages me and people start to think I must be really pro-neutrality.  It is just a case of having an academic interest in the matter.  I am concerned with the truth.</p></speech>

It should happen from the point of view of democracy because it is very clear that four out of five Irish people support neutrality and would probably, therefore, be in favour of including it in the Constitution.  It would also create severe problems for the Government because we have signed up to the mutual defence clause in Article 42.7 of the Treaty on European Union.  This should not be confused with Article 222 of a completely different treaty - the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union - which contains a solidarity clause.  They are two completely different things.  It is a Government discursive strategy to confuse and conflate the two in order that it can state it has not signed up to a collective defence commitment.</p></speech>

What people express in an opinion poll will not necessarily represent the final outcome.  The only true way to assess the people's will on a given matter, in terms of primary legislation, is to give them an opportunity to vote in a referendum.  All we can do is say this was the view of the people at a given moment.  Dr. Devine mentioned in her presentation that the last time a poll had been conducted on the issue was in 2013 - as I recall, it was conducted by Red C - before which there was a ten-year gap.</p></speech>

That does not, unfortunately, make it the law.</p></speech>

They no longer ask Swedish people whether they want to retain the concept of neutrality, or if they are in favour of it.  They simply ask them whether they want to join a military alliance.  As I have said, military neutrality has nothing whatsoever to do with real neutrality.</p></speech>

I have to respond to the point made by Dr. Devine on the idea that we have already signed up to the Article 5 commitments.  The Lisbon and Nice treaties both refer specifically to respecting Ireland's traditional policy of military neutrality.  Article 29.4.9&deg; of the Constitution specifically states the State will not sign up to a common defence policy.  It is very clear to me that we do not regard ourselves as committed to a common defence policy.  The overall treaty certainly contains clauses on a defence union, but we are clearly exempt from these clauses by virtue of the Constitution and the wording of the treaties I have mentioned.</p> <p>  The point has been made that the Hague Convention refers to neutrality in times of war.  We need an operational definition of times of peace, but this is much more complicated.  Although I believe in neutrality in the sense that we should not join any military alliance, I do not believe holding a referendum would be a good idea.  We have had bad experience with referendums.  I do not believe they are the best way of ascertaining the people's will or inserting something into the Constitution.  We end up amending amendments and amendments to amendments.  We are now discussing amending the article on abortion.</p></speech>

If Irish soldiers are protecting a refugee camp and it is attacked, should they open fire, essentially taking military action against the country?  Although in nine out of ten situations it is peacekeeping rather than peace enforcement, there is a grey area in which it is unclear whether we would be breaching our neutrality.</p> <p>  Does Dr. Devine think the difficulty with enshrining anything in the Constitution regarding neutrality is not that it would be constrained by EU laws but by international events?  There is a view that Ireland should not have stayed neutral during the Second World War.  Does she think the view is that we have a right to remain neutral in the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan?  It appears to be the Government's view and that of countries that have not enshrined their neutrality in law that we cannot foretell what will happen internationally and that there could be some horrific case which the people of the country might say they cannot tolerate and must deal with such as the Second World War.  Perhaps we need to concentrate on it.  I would value Dr. Devine's view.</p> <p>  The United States was technically at war with the Government of Afghanistan which it had accused of orchestrating terrorist acts against it.  Does Dr. Devine agree that we are in breach of neutrality if we take an Afghan citizen and fly him into Ireland on his way to America?  We have taken an alleged combatant on an American aircraft that landed at Shannon Airport on the way to America or Guantanamo Bay.</p></speech>

While clearly we disagree, the weight of international legal and academic opinion is on my side.  In 2011 I published a paper in a journal entitled, Cooperation and Conflict, in which I recounted in minute detail how Ireland had acceded to the Western European Union, WEU, military alliances Article 5 guarantee because the European Union had decided it wanted to subsume and absorb the WEU military alliance from approximately the 1950s.  When we reached the stage of the Maastricht treaty and the Treaty on the European Union which allowed for an eventual common defence policy, it was going to be based on absorbing the WEU into the European Union.  The merger was due to happen and there is documentation that shows it.</p> <p>  In December 1999 in Helsinki a European Council meeting was held which authorised the merger.  The merger was completed once the Article 5 guarantee was inserted into an EU treaty.  At the time it was being inserted into the constitution which was being drafted from 2002 to 2004 the Irish Government tried to stop the Article 5 guarantee being cut and pasted wholesale into the constitution which became the Lisbon treaty which amended the two previous treaties, the Treaty on European Union and the EC treaties.  Brian Cowen, in a letter to Franco Frattini, Vice President of the European Union at the time, said we could not agree to it.  Germany and France had previously tried to have it inserted into the Amsterdam treaty and were foiled because Britain was not in favour.  However, by 2002, it was in favour and the three big powers got in a room and discussed what they were going to do about letters from Brian Cowen and the Foreign Ministers of the other neutral states, namely, Austria, Finland and Sweden.  The big three powers said the move had always been in the plans and was the completion of the European common defence policy and that they would not allow any dilution of it.</p> <p>  The Article 5 guarantee was transplanted in wholesale.  We have signed and ratified the treaty and are obliged under it to provide aid and assistance by all means in our power.  The words "military and other" were deleted in order to demilitarise the clause.  The line is that we are not obliged, given that there is a further statement in the treaty clause that it does not prejudice the "specific character of the security and defence policy of certain member states".  However, the treaty goes on to talk about how NATO member states' desire for NATO primacy is protected, but it does not refer to neutral states.  If it were supposed to protect neutral states and neutrality, it would have.  The Constitution has no prohibition that protects neutrality and does not mention neutrality.  The Seville Declaration, a political statement, states military neutrality is not affected.  As I outlined in my presentation, "military neutrality" is whatever the Government decides it means on any given morning.  While it used to mean non-membership of a military alliance, now it effectively means membership of a military alliance.  It has no legal standing and is just a political and discursive device invented by governments.  It does not apply in international relations as a foreign policy phenomenon and Mr. Smyth and I disagree on it.</p> <p>  We should hold a referendum on including neutrality in the Constitution, given that it has been part of so many political parties' agendas and the fact that the Government is violating the law on neutrality through the facilitation of US troops through Shannon Airport on the way to a theatre of war.  It would help us to get a better understanding of what neutrality means to the people.  As an academic, I can see very clearly through successive opinion polls what it means to them.  While there is no question about it, a referendum might help to clarify it.  Generally, the Government will not be in favour of it and I do not think it will happen.  I can speculate that if Sinn F&eacute;in got into government, perhaps it might happen.  We will see.  </p> <p>  The Chairman has said we have already covered the question of the grey area between peace enforcement and peacekeeping.</p></speech>

Countries such as Finland, Latvia and Lithuania feel extraordinarily vulnerable owing to muscle flexing by President Putin and the Russians.  Understandably, they hope that if he invades, threatens or attacks them, their European partners will come to their defence.  While NATO would defend them, I do not know whether we would.  Given that we are part of a community, the question of whether we have obligations to them presents an interesting moral dilemma.  I would be keen not to cut off the possibility of having a discussion on the issue.</p> <p>  I do not recognise the media conspiracy to which Dr. Devine referred and the journalists and academics who are, apparently, in the pay of Brussels.  I do not accept that there is such a conspiracy.  It is a flight of fantasy.  From the point of view of my newspaper, there is no question of people accepting the shilling of Brussels in the way Dr. Devine has suggested.</p></speech>

In fairness, Dr. Devine put it extensively in her presentation and Mr. Smyth has responded.  That is enough for now.</p> <p>  I cannot thank both witnesses enough.  It was a vigorous and balanced debate because we wanted to have two different perspectives on the subject.  It was thought-provoking and helpful to the committee's deliberations.  I thank them for coming here, giving so much of their time and the amount of preparation and thought they put into their presentations.  It was immensely helpful.</p></speech>
