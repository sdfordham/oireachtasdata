From the Equality Budgeting Campaign I welcome Ms Louise Bayliss, Mr. Richard Keane, Ms Emer Delaney, and Ms Louise Riordan.  One person from each group will make a presentation initially.  When it comes to answering questions other witnesses may respond as appropriate.</p><p>  Before starting the discussion I wish to advise witnesses of privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if a witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in regard to a particular matter and continues to do so, the witness is entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his or her evidence.  Witnesses are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The presentations that witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website after this meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  </p><p>  I now invite Mr. Shanahan to make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014012900003#D00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting Forf&aacute;s here today to discuss our report, Social Enterprise in Ireland, Sectoral Opportunities and Policy Issues.  A detailed briefing note of my presentation has been circulated to members.  With the Chairman's permission I will take that as read and will draw out some of the key points from the presentation.</p><p>  Before beginning I will introduce my colleagues, Declan Hughes, divisional manager with responsibility for enterprise and trade policy and Marie Burke with responsibility for education and skills policy.  We are also joined by Dr. Jonathan Healy and Laura Watts who are policy advisers and were involved in drafting the report under discussion.  Forf&aacute;s is the national policy advisory board on enterprise, trade, science, technology and innovation.  We work closely with our sister agencies, IDA Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, and Enterprise Ireland in the development of enterprise policy.  We provide advice on a diverse range of policy areas which impact on enterprise, whether that is enterprise development, research and innovation, competitiveness, research and development, economic infrastructure and so on.  We also have a role in the development of the Action Plan for Jobs and identifying sectoral opportunities and opportunities to create jobs.  The report we are discussing fits into that area of our work.</p><p>  Social enterprise in its broadest form is not a new concept in Ireland.  In every community there are examples that were established because individuals grouped together to meet a need that was not being met by the State or by commercial businesses.  In all aspects of Irish life community and voluntary organisations such as the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, Muintir na T&iacute;re, the Irish Countrywomen's Association, ICA, agricultural cooperatives and credit unions have been the backbone of the social fabric.  All of these organisations share a self-help ethos and philosophy and place themselves at the centre of their communities.</p><p>  For our report a social enterprise is defined as an enterprise that trades for a social purpose; in which at least part of its income is earned from its trading activity; is separate from government; and in which the surplus is primarily re-invested in a social objective.  Income from trading is an important distinction, as organisations such as pure charities may derive their income solely from philanthropy, grants or donations.  In commercial enterprises, profit is divided among owners and shareholders, but in a social enterprise the profit, or the surplus, is generally re-invested in the social objective.</p><p>  The Forf&aacute;s report identified four main types of social enterprise in Ireland, those with commercial opportunities that are established to create a social return, for example, a restaurant whose profits or surpluses are used to fund a disability organisation; those creating employment opportunities for marginalised groups, such as employment centres for ex-offenders; economic and community development organisations, for example, community-run enterprise centres; and those that deliver services, such as community cr&egrave;ches or rural transport groups.  These goals often overlap or the social enterprises have multiple objectives. </p><p>  There is limited data available on the size and operation of social enterprises in Ireland.  We have used statistics from 2009 to demonstrate the scale.  Approximately 1,420 social enterprises employing over 25,000, with a total income of approximately &euro;1.4 billion existed in 2009.  This is equivalent to just under 1% of enterprises in the economy and over 1% of total employment.  Social enterprises are labour intensive, with payroll estimated to account for 64% of total expenditure.  This group of 25,000 that we have identified is a subset of a wider not-for-profit sector which employs over 100,000 people.  Our report concentrates on the social enterprises at the commercial end of the not-for-profit spectrum.</p> <p>Our report concluded that the sector has the capacity to double employment with the creation of an additional 25,000 jobs.  We arrived at this conclusion having examined the levels of social enterprise in other jurisdictions and the averages across the European Union.  </p><p> The Forf&aacute;s report makes a number of recommendations to contribute to developing a vibrant social enterprise sector to support jobs in communities across Ireland.  While a number of these recommendations are specific to social enterprises, many are recommendations that impact on all small and medium-sized enterprises from across all sectors of the economy.</p><p> The recommendations centre on six themes.  There is a need to develop a policy for the social enterprise sector.  There is also a need for an over-arching policy for social enterprise development to include adopting the definition of social enterprise as outlined, developing a co-ordinated approach to the sector across government and increasing our understanding of the sector, including the collection of appropriate data and metrics.  A number of Departments are currently engaged with the sector, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the Department of Social Protection, the Department of Health, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine and the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p> The second set of recommendations relates to capacity-building and business skills development, including the promotion and replication of existing business support models and working towards ensuring that social enterprise is mainstreamed in all business courses to help in further developing the sector.  The third set of recommendations deals with procurement, including supporting social enterprises in the same way as conventional SMEs can be supported by Government.  This is to enable access to tendering processes.  Social enterprises face many of the same challenges in this regard as commercial small and medium-sized enterprises.  There is also an opportunity to influence social outcomes through procurement.</p><p> Funding and finance are dealt with, including assisting social enterprises in building capacity for business plan development to make access to finance easier so that they can take out loans on a commercial basis.  There are multiple potential streams of income including philanthropy, grant-aid and commercial income.  Many social enterprises derive their income from a mix of these sources.  The sector wishes to achieve a greater level of income from commercial trading.</p><p> The remaining themes include developing leaders and harnessing community support and expertise and the theme of governance.  A broad range of potential governance models exist and it is important that social enterprises choose a model which best supports their business activity.</p><p> The recommendations were developed by examining existing international policies and evidence, literature review and a wide range of engagement with stakeholders in Ireland. <b><font color="#602162"></font></b>Since the publication of the report an interdepartmental group has been established and chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Se&aacute;n Sherlock with a secretariat provided by the Department of Environment, Community and Local Government.  The group is currently examining the recommendations of the Forf&aacute;s report and is establishing a timetable for implementation. </p><p> Social enterprise is a growing enterprise sector that can bring further job gains and deliver economic potential as part of Ireland&rsquo;s economic recovery and growth for the future.  Like other SMEs, social enterprises have the benefit of being geographically spread throughout Ireland.  They are set at the heart of rural and urban communities.  Very often they employ those who are most marginalised and who find it most difficult to access employment opportunities.  They tend to provide local services and so jobs are created in local communities.  As well as multiplier effects from the direct jobs in the sector, further indirect jobs are created either by enabling the development of other enterprises, for example, by social enterprises that assist economic and community development, or by providing services that attract people to a community such as local festivals or community-run hostels.</p><p> The Forf&aacute;s report sets out a list of recommendations to help ensure a supportive and enabling environment for a vibrant and growing sector of Irish enterprise.  I welcome any questions from members.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.11" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Bayliss" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014012900004#E00300"><p>The equality budgeting campaign is a broad organisation made up of civil society and including groups such as the Irish Feminist Network, the National Women's Council of Ireland, trade unions SIPTU and UNITE the Union, Migrant Rights Centre Ireland, SPARK and the Union of Students of Ireland.</p><p>  Equality budgeting is an approach to economic policy-making and planning that places equality at the centre of decisions concerning public expenditure and income.  Through equality audits and impact assessments, equality budgeting provides information on how different sections of society are impacted by specific economic policy measures.  The objective of equality budgeting lies in ensuring this information is used to reduce inequalities and to achieve the best equality outcomes for specific disadvantaged groups, but also for society at large.</p><p>  Equality budgeting goes beyond traditional approaches to policy-making and planning by assessing the impact of expenditure and resources on different sections of society; by assessing who does or does not benefit, by integrating equality as a driving principle; by increasing transparency in the budgetary process.  The benefits of equality budgeting include increased levels of information, disaggregated data, impact assessment and increased levels of equality, such as knowledge of who is disproportionately impacted and evidence-based policy design.  There are increased levels of transparency which will make it easier for the public to accept the budgetary process.   Equality budgeting originated in the 1980s in the form of gender budgeting pioneered in Australia.  Over 60 countries have implemented or have worked toward equality budgeting, including  Canada, South Africa, the United Kingdom, Tanzania and Uganda.  Some work was done in Ireland within the gender mainstreaming unit of the then Department of Justice, Equality and Law Reform.</p><p>  We have chosen the Scottish model because Scotland is a similar country with similar procedures.  In Scotland the equality and budget advisory group, made up of government and civil society representatives, works with the Scottish Government on devising the budget and the equality-proofing of economic policy measures.  A draft budget is published in September before being finalised in January.  An equality statement is published alongside the budget which highlights equality outcomes by theme, such as health and well-being or by equality characteristics, such as gender, race or age.  A full impact analysis is conducted.  In-depth research on the effects of the economic crisis and the minutes of the EBAG meeting is published on the Scottish Government website.</p><p>  Equality budgeting is very necessary, particularly as Ireland has a seat on the UN Human Rights Council.  It is essential to make good on promises regarding economic, social and cultural rights.  In January 2011, a UN expert, Magdalena Sep&uacute;lveda Carmona criticised Ireland for failure to respect economic, social and cultural rights during the period of the economic crisis.  Our groups is lobbying for equality budgeting to be introduced by means of setting up a unit with responsibility for integrating equality horizontally across all economic policy processes and planning, with particular reference to the nine grounds of the Equal Status Acts.  This unit should be given the power and resources to undertake or commission research on the impact of the economic crisis and to equality-proof existing and future economic policy measures.</p><p>  We argue there is a need for equality budgeting.  Budget 2012 was acknowledged to have had the most detrimental impact on lone parents.  According to the analysis undertaken by the Department of Social Protection this trend continued in budget 2013.  It stated that this budget had the most negative impact on working lone parents.  The 2011 EU-SILC report contains the most up to date information on poverty and deprivation.  It shows that 24.4% of the general population suffer two or more forms of deprivation, yet this rises to 56% in the case of lone parents and their children, 32.6% higher than the general population.  The rate of consistent poverty was 6.9% for the general population but 16.4% for lone parents.  I will give two examples to highlight decisions made on education and protection which would have an impact and which may not have been implemented if there had been equality budgeting analysis.</p> <p>Had the type of economic analysis we are advocating been done, it is possible that neither of these issues would have arisen.</p><p> The first example relates to the impact on the educational prospects of the children of lone parents arising out of changes to the one-parent family payment.  Ireland has an excellent education system.  The third level sector, in particular, should be applauded for its efforts to make further education accessible to all socioeconomic groups by way of grants and through the excellent higher education access route, HEAR, scheme.  A major difficulty arises, however, as a consequence of the cut in child benefit for all 18 year olds, which took no account of situations where dependants aged 18 might still be in school or where a parent is reliant on social welfare.  The child dependant rate is &euro;29.80, which is supplemented for under 18s by the &euro;30 per week child benefit payment.  That payment ceases once the child reaches 18 years of age.  Although no research has been carried out on this issue, we have heard anecdotally of children being forced to leave school early - children who a year later would have access to the HEAR scheme and the grant system through Student Universal Support Ireland.  That is one example of the type of inequality arising from decisions of the Government.</p><p> A related example is the prospect, in July 2015, of an estimated 63,000 lone parents losing their entitlement to the one-parent family allowance.  Now is the time for these parents to avail of training and education in order to be job-ready.  Under budget 2014, however, second payments to lone parents who avail of F&Aacute;S or education and training board courses were discontinued.  This measure effectively bars these lone parents from taking up training and education opportunities.  In both these cases, an impact assessment would have highlighted the issues arising and might have ensured these disadvantaged groups were not unfairly affected.</p></speech>

I will now take questions from members, beginning with Senator Averil Power.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1154" speakername="Averil Power" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014012900005#F00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Their point is well made in terms of the necessity for equality budgeting in the context of the broader social consequences of budgetary measures and, in particular, their longer-term impacts.  I was very strongly opposed to the proposal last year to take teachers out of DEIS schools, a decision that was subsequently and rightly overturned.  When we asked the departmental officials who came before the committee whether they had thought through the longer-term economic consequences of this proposal, not only for education but also in the areas of justice, social housing and so on, their answers were not reassuring.  There should be a requirement when decisions such as this are being made that consideration be given to the consequences across all sectors, particularly in the longer term, in order to ascertain whether the particular measure really does represent value for money.  There have been several cases, including cuts to drugs projects and so on, in which individual Departments took account only of their own budgets, with no consideration for the knock-on consequences on a broader scale.  That is a deeply dysfunctional approach.</p><p>  Reference was made to the Minister of State, Deputy Sean Sherlock, heading up a committee on social enterprise.  I do not have any information on how well that committee, which I understand was established in July 2013, is working and whether there have been any outcomes from its deliberations.  Has it indicated, for example, that it will accept all of the recommendations from Forf&aacute;s?  I accept it is early days in the committee's operation, but I am interested to hear what progress has been made.</p><p>  An interesting point was made about the need to ensure business students are educated about the non-profit sector and social enterprise.  How many of the colleges provide that type of training?  I am aware that Trinity College does, or certainly did in the past - in my final year there I did a course in managing voluntary organisations.  Only a small minority of students would have taken that course, but it was an excellent offering.  I do not know whether other business schools and faculties take a similar approach.  Some of the basic principles of business are the same across all sectors, but in the case of social enterprise the overall perspective is totally different.  It is important to ensure that all business graduates have at least some understanding of what is involved in working in the third sector.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014012900005#F00400"><p>I welcome the delegates.  I have followed the campaign for equality budgeting closely and listened carefully to previous presentations that were made to Oireachtas Members.  A delegation from the committee will travel to Scotland in the coming weeks to get the view of the authorities there on how equality budgeting has worked for them.  Although the situation in that jurisdiction is somewhat different in that its Parliament does not have the full powers enjoyed by the Oireachtas in terms of budgetary control, it is a country of similar size to Ireland and its experience will be instructive to us.  Has an evaluation been done of the effectiveness of the Australian model or any other model of equality budgeting?  Australia was one of the first countries to take action in this area, with Scotland being a more recent convert.  The delegates indicated that 60 countries are considering implementing some type of measure to take heed of how budgetary measures affect the public from the perspective of equality.  Can they expand on that?</p><p>  There is some confusion regarding the data on inequality in Ireland.  In a reply to a parliamentary question recently, the Minister indicated that Ireland now scores better on equality than it did in the past.  Other sources have claimed differently.  In the delegates' view, have recent budgets had a worse or better impact in terms of equality than previous budgets?  Has that analysis been undertaken?  The recent period of austerity followed fast on a period of perceived abundance.  It would be interesting to know whether the budgets delivered during those two distinct periods differed greatly in terms of their impact on inequality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1032" speakername="Joan Collins" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014012900005#F00500"><p>I thank the delegates for their presentations.  I do not have many questions for Mr. Shanahan because, in general, Forf&aacute;s is doing a good job.  He indicated that Forf&aacute;s steps into the breach where private companies are not delivering innovations in certain areas and where public bodies are not providing services.  Does it initiate particular programmes when it identifies a need?  Mr. Shanahan told us that Forf&aacute;s intends to create 25,000 jobs up to 2020.  Where does he see those jobs coming from?  The not-for-profit initiative is a good proposal because it will see resources going back into communities.  It is the right way to go.</p><p>  I am a strong advocate of equality budgeting.  The impression I am getting, however, from replies we have received from both the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is that the view from Government is that sufficient safeguards are already in place in this regard.  The new whole-of-year budgeting reform, we are told, functions as a checking mechanism, with each of the Oireachtas committees having a role to play in ensuring proposals are equality-proofed.  I am assuming the delegates would refute that position.  Have they undertaken any analysis to support their argument for the establishment of an equality budgeting advisory group to oversee equality checks and balances in the pre-budget process?  The Government's position seems to be that there is no need for such a body and that everything is already in place.  How might we go about devising a baseline to show there is a need for such a body and that there are still instances in which inequalities arise?  The question is how to find the resources to do something like that, given that it would require input from economists and other experts.  A group that might have been able to play a role in this regard came before the committee recently when its funding was withdrawn.  Do the delegates envisage undertaking that type of analysis and, if so, how might it be done?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014012900005#F00700"><p>I will begin with Senator Averil Power's question regarding the committee on social enterprise that is operating under the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p> <p>As the Senator correctly pointed out, the Minister of State for research and innovation, Deputy Sherlock, has assumed responsibility for this area.  He chairs an interdepartmental group which was first convened in October and which has met on three occasions since then.  At the first meeting of the group, Forf&aacute;s made a presentation in which it set out the actions it felt were required.  The same actions are set out in our report and we have just outlined them for this committee.  I understand the interdepartmental group is developing implementation and prioritisation mechanisms in respect of those actions.  It is also engaged with the sector in this regard.</p><p> On the extent to which this area is included within business courses, we consulted a number of educational institutions while the study was being compiled.  As a result, we are aware that UCC has a centre for co-operative studies and that DCU, TCD - to which the Senator referred - and UCD run some courses in this area.  These courses tend to be specifically related to the not-for-profit sector.  One of the points we make in our report is that it needs to be mainstreamed within other business programmes so that a wider audience can be reached.  There are other ways for business graduates to achieve exposure to and experience in this area.  The sector would benefit from the entry to it of such graduates, whether on a voluntary basis or through some of the schemes that exist within the public sector.</p><p> Deputy Joan Collins referred to our intention to create up to 5,000 jobs.  To clarify, Forf&aacute;s's role is to advise on areas of opportunity and indicate what should be done.  A number of Departments have direct responsibility in this area and they form the membership of the interdepartmental group to which I referred earlier.  I refer here to the Departments of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht, the Environment, Community and Local Government - which plays quite a significant role - Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation, Health and Social Protection.  All of these Departments run schemes which support and interact with the sector in different ways.  The potential for creating 25,000 jobs was identified by examining what is happening and the levels of social enterprise that have been achieved in other countries.  The average percentage of GDP in countries across Europe that is accounted for by social enterprise currently stands at 6%.  The EU has set a target of 9% in this regard.  If we were to achieve a figure of the order of 6%, employment in the sector would increase.  In fact, it would more than double.  We suggest that achieving what other countries are achieving is a reasonable target.  Spain, Italy and Scotland - which was mentioned in the context of the other presentation - are good examples in this regard.</p><p> The areas in which these jobs may be created vary greatly.  The one thing about social enterprise is that it is both varied and widely dispersed.  It is not concentrated around large urban areas and much of it is rural-based.  We are talking here about everything from community shops to post offices, tourism and heritage products, leisure and sports services, energy production, etc.  We have included a number of case studies in our report which provide a flavour of some of the more significant types of social enterprise involved.  We see jobs being created both through growth in these enterprises and through the arrival of new ones.</p></speech>

It has been shown to be increasing, and the gap between the richest and poorest in Ireland increased by 25% in 2010.  The ESRI analysis of budget 2013 showed that the latter was regressive in nature.  Other reports from 2011 and 2012 also indicate that successive budgets have been regressive.  Another point to highlight relates to the fact that decisions are being made in the absence of information.  At a time when they are particularly scarce, resources must be allocated to areas in which they are needed most.  Four days after the passage of the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013, the ESRI published a report showing that the bottom quintile had again incurred the greatest loss.  I do not believe very many Deputies would have voted for the legislation had this information been available to them.  We are seeking a very simple move whereby the information in question will be made available on the day of the budget in order that when decisions are being made, people will know that what they are voting in favour of is fair.</p><p>  Senator Power made the point that decisions are not being made on an interdepartmental basis and that this has a long-term impact.  That is absolutely true.  Decisions being made by the Department of Social Protection are not being followed through by the Department of Education and Skills.  This is giving rise not only to a social impact but also to an economic impact, which is not being considered.  There is a need for a more holistic approach.  If the information to which I refer were provided, it would lead to the adoption of such an approach.</p></speech>

If people can discuss economic inequality at Davos and if Paul Krugman can write about it in the Tuesday edition of <i>The Irish Times</i>, then surely members, as parliamentarians, could be given additional information in order that they might base the decisions they make on the budgetary process.  The World Bank rated Ireland 35th out of the 43 countries it assessed for financial scrutiny of legislation.  D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann does not have a parliamentary budgetary office.  Twelve OECD countries now have such offices.  Impact analysis is not provided with draft budgets or the legislation that accompanies them, such as the finance Bill, the local property tax Bill and the social welfare Bill.  Guillotines are regularly imposed in respect of critical budgetary legislation.  Amendments from Members of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann are almost never accepted during the legislative process.  Parliamentary oversight of Cabinet proposals seems to be minimal.</p><p>  There is a way of opening this process out in order that we will not be presented with budgets that appear to involve power plays between Departments.  Those who are affected most by budgets do not have access to well-oiled lobbying machines.  The various surveys that have been carried out indicate that those at the margins of society and in the lowest decile have been affected most by recent budgets.  We would like a more open and transparent process in respect of the budgetary cycle.  There are specialists who can be consulted.  I refer, for example, to the department of equality studies and the school of social justice in UCD and the Equality Trust in the United Kingdom.  <i>The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better</i>, by Wilkinson and Pickett, which was published two or three years ago, has been quite influential.  We propose that the ESRI and the Equality Authority might be best placed to conduct an equality analysis in this country as part of the annual budgetary cycle.</p></speech>

I wish to make a comment rather than ask a question.  What Mr. Keane is talking about is reform and that is what we are fighting for every day of the week.  The entire system needs to be reformed.  We are continually arguing about the need for reform, particularly in the Seanad.  We are not allowed to accept some very good legislation or amendments to Bills brought forward by the Opposition because we are governed by the Whip.  The entire system requires an overhaul.</p><p>  Mr. Keane is correct in the context of the need for joined-up thinking.  Last November, the Revenue Commissioners contacted people in order to discover the means by which they intended to pay the local property tax for this year.  I know a number of individuals who indicated that they intended to pay it out of their widow's pension.  That was grand, and when they went online, their request to pay in this way was accepted.</p> <p>All was well until last week when some of these widows got letters indicating that the Revenue could not take the money out of the widow's pension because the Department of Social Protection did not allow it.  This has occurred after they had all indicated that they intended to pay the tax in this way.  It is crazy that this was not done beforehand.  The reason the Department has given is ludicrous.  It stated that if a widow pays X amount a week towards the local property tax - &euro;4 a week or whatever - it would take her income below the threshold for the tax.  It is saying that one needs to pay one's local property tax but not on its watch - one must pay it somewhere else.  If the Department is determining that the widow cannot pay it because it would bring her payment below the threshold, how does it expect her to pay it?  We need joined-up thinking across Departments.</p><p> Ms Louise Bayliss spoke at length about child benefit and I agree with what she said.  She should not think for one minute that this issue has not been thrashed out.  We have had spent days thrashing out the different ways we should approach this issue.  We have had groups lobby us to means-test child benefit; others have lobbied us to tax it and others still have lobbied us to have vouchers for the children going to school.  There are varied opinions on how to tackle this issue.  If we were to means-test it, we would probably lose more than we would gain.  How would we means-test all the recipients throughout Ireland at this stage?  Perhaps it could be done with new applicants when they fill in the form.  How can we go about means-testing what is being paid out in child benefit?  I thought there was merit in the idea of giving vouchers to the parents which would be used in the schools to cover the cost of school books and school lunches and in that the funding would be used for the child.  People say it is a universal payment for children and it should not be taken away.  With child benefit, it is a case of "damned if you do and damned if you don't".  </p><p> The child dependant allowance has been a bugbear of mine because it is paid alongside all benefit payments.  A recipient of a short-term payment will not get the allowance if the child is over the age of 18 and going to school or college.  If one gets sick, it is as if one's children do not matter in that one will not receive payment in respect of the child over the age of 18 but will only get payment in respect of those children who are under age, so to speak.  If one is dependent on social welfare and has a child going to college, one will get a top-up payment for that child, the special rate of third level grant, which is great, but if that child came from Kerry and moved to Dublin, that payment would not even cover their accommodation costs.  One has to then supplement one's child in college out of one's social welfare payments.  It is crazy.  Not everyone passes their exams the first time around and they may have to repeat a year, but if a child has to do that, he or she will not get the grant.  It is very hard on parents who are totally dependent on social welfare to put their children through college.  Are we going to return to the days when it was only the rich who would go to college?  This is where equality comes into play.</p><p> I agree that we should have equality budgeting.  We have tried to get budgets, particularly the social welfare budget, in advance in order that we could scrutinise them, but unfortunately that does not happen.  It does not come us beforehand.  The Minister will come and tell us how much she has to take out of the budget, but we do not get the specifics until the day it is announced.  When one is working with the people on the ground, one knows the specifics of the budget that will hurt people and what will not and what is acceptable, but unfortunately we do not get the specifics of the budget until the day it is introduced and then we debate it afterwards.  It would be good if we could have the budgets in advance but we have not come around to that idea yet in this country.</p></speech>

My first question is to those from the social enterprise section of Forf&aacute;s.  There is huge potential for growth in the social enterprise sector, but it is not well understood in Ireland.  The witnesses are probably aware that  Leader has been quite good at funding projects in this area but it is now in abeyance until the next tranche of funding, which is likely to be in 2015.  I have read a number of very exciting reports with good projects that could be operationalised as social enterprise projects.  By and large, they are not for profit and many are recommended to be got up as charities or trusts.  I am conscious of the recent controversy around charities.  What is the witnesses' advice in this regard?  This will be a low-profit sector.  The profit made from a social enterprise projects is generally used to pay wages, and thereby employ people, and basically to cover costs.  The yield from it will not go towards a profit.  There is no fat there.  Getting buildings and capital projects completed involves a huge cost.  We have a lovely project ready to roll in Galway called the Galway Young Creators' Centre, which is to run in tandem with the second level system, providing after-school opportunities to explore young people's creativity, but the funding needed to get it off the ground is substantial.  Once it was off the ground it would cover itself.  Who is out there to help this type of project get off the ground?  Does Forf&aacute;s help social enterprise initiatives?  I think it is mainly focused on policy, from what I can glean.</p><p>  I want to say well done to the delegates from the Equality Budgeting Campaign.  There has been a good amount of evidence for a long time that the more equal a society we have the better it is for everyone.  Mr. Keane referenced the book <i>The Spirit Level: Why More Equal Societies Almost Always Do Better</i>, which is very interesting.  It is an area that is not well understood.  I am struck by the fact that he said that such analysis should be done.  Have the witnesses met with the Department of Finance?</p></speech>

I can assure her it is not as interesting as this.</p><p>  My first question is to Mr. Shanahan from Forf&aacute;s. The 2012 report is an excellent one.  I ask him to take the following comment in the spirit in which it is meant.  The report's recommendations are a bit fluffy.  That is not the fault of Forf&aacute;s.  They are fluffy because Forf&aacute;s is trying to advise and it is up to the Minister or the Government to put real meat on the bone.  Whenever I hear the phrase "interdepartmental committee", I cringe.  What is happening on the ground?  It is fantastic that the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock, has been appointed to this group.  Has anything started to happen, specifically in terms of money, resources and legislation?  I would like to know the answer to that.  </p><p>  My second question is on the microenterprise fund.  I have spoken to some of the people co-ordinating social enterprise in Ireland  One of the points they made is that the social entrepreneurs cannot or will not access the microfinance fund, even though there is a good deal of money there.</p> <p>My understanding is that it has not been drawn down.  I cannot remember the specific technicality, but it had something to do with having to be a director of the social enterprise and opening up someone to personal liability.  It was a constraint around the microenterprise fund.  Does Ms Bayliss know anything about this or if that is changing?</p><p> I have a third question.  According to Ms Bayliss's data, we are at less than half of the European average in terms of social enterprise, which to me was a surprising finding because, as she rightly said, this country has an extraordinary tradition of volunteering and huge social cohesion.  It is astonishing that Ireland is at less than half the European average, given our heritage, tradition of volunteering and social cohesion.  Will Ms Bayliss give one or two reasons she believes we are way behind in that regard?</p><p> Equality budgeting is something I strongly support.  I co-authored the submission to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin.  The most striking aspect for me was that Oireachtas Deputies and Senators received the ESRI report on income distribution in the budget four days after the Finance Bill had been signed into law.  One of the main requests of the Equality Budgeting Campaign is for Members of the Oireachtas to have that type of analysis on budget day.  I have had a direct response from the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, which states he was not doing it.  I have not heard yet from the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, but if he also says "No", I am willing to bet that they are the only two Members of the Oireachtas who do not believe Members of the Oireachtas should have the right information.  Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in support equality budgeting.  I would say vast majority of Independents support it and will hazard a guess that most Labour Party Members support it.  Regardless of one's perspective on whether there should be greater equality, I am guessing that the two Ministers are the only two of the 226 Members who are publicly stating we should not be given the information on what the budget we are voting into law will do.  I find this extraordinary and it is fantastic that this committee is taking up the issue.  It could be the conduit in applying some pressure from the D&aacute;il.  The response the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, has given is that they are not willing to do it because Members already receive the information.  I have a view on the quality of that information, but as a member of the Equality Budgeting Campaign, does Ms Bayliss believe the information provided for Oireachtas Members on budget day in the budget "deck", to which the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, is referring, is sufficient and does it qualify as useful and substantive quality analysis?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1010" speakername="Joanna Tuffy" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014012900008#J00200"><p>As I am the last questioner, I will ask my questions before Ms Bayliss replies.  I am very much in favour of equality budgeting, but I do not necessarily agree with all of the views of Ms Bayliss's group.  For example, I am not sure that basing it on the nine grounds mentioned would be the right approach because the bottom line for me is income equality.  We can divide people into sectors and omit many others.  The latest Central Statistics Office income and living survey has found that throughout the country there are couples with children, people who are single, lone parents and so on who are insolvent and struggling to pay mortgages.  That kind of model would not take this into account.  The bottom line should be income equality.</p><p>  To give an alternative view on some of the issues the delegates have raised, the SILC survey carried out by the ESRI offers a flawed model because it does not include capital taxes.  Many wealth taxes were brought in.  Capital gains tax, DIRT and so on have been increased, but that is not taken into account.  Other taxes were increased also.  There is a story in <i>The Irish Times</i> today based on a parliamentary question I asked.  In 2011 the Government implemented a proposal of the previous Government, whereby an effective tax rate of 90% was imposed on bonuses above &euro;20,000 for bankers.  Some &euro;1.3 million was collected in 2011 and there were no bonuses above that amount in 2012.  In the same year the threshold for the universal social charge was increased and last year it was increased for wealthier people over 65 years.  So far, the CSO income living survey has not shown a widening of the gaps in income.  The latest survey was carried out in 2011 and the next one could show such a widening; I do not know.  I would not prejudge it, but I am simply saying there is other information available.  The OECD states it has the most progressive income tax system in Europe and we have the third most progressive income tax system in the world.  That is because of recent changes, largely implemented by the previous Government towards the end of its term.  The delegates are putting one side of the argument, but others can be made.

That is factual.</p><p>  On some of the other points raised, I take on board what the Chairman said about income equality.  That is one of our biggest concerns, but there are other issues, including access to public services.  However, I agree with the Chairman that income inequality is affecting people in every sector in their day to day living.  As the Chairman rightly pointed out, a two-parent family with a mortgage could be equally as poor as a lone parent and dividing it like that can sometimes be blunt.  What we are trying to achieve is income equality.</p></speech>

We should pay a study visit to, say, Scotland.  We should have some know-how from the School of Social Justice or the ESRI.  There are many people who have the skills and know-how required.</p><p>  To address the question from Senator Fidelma Healy Eames, we have been fortunate that Dr. Clara Fischer has been working with us.  She is a research fellow at the London School of Economics.  We began this journey two years ago.  Members, as parliamentarians, will know from addressing the needs of their constituents that there are people who do not have power or a voice in the decision-making process.  If they are to make better decisions, de-segregated data, more information, a more open and transparent process, a longer lead-in time to the budget would be a win-win for everybody.</p></speech>

Decisions are not being made with the benefit of information.  It is easy to criticise people for voting a certain way, but they might not have had the information to hand.  We believe members, as parliamentarians, are representing a sector and they should have the required information when they are making decisions.  If the information was to hand, the position might improve.  We are not expecting everybody to take on board our views on equality, but we expect members, as parliamentarians, to have the information to hand when they make decisions on policies.</p></speech>

I invite Mr. Shanahan to respond to the points that were raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.65" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Martin Shanahan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014012900009#K00500"><p>I have a few comments.  First, on the points made by Senator Healy Eames, as for it being a little understood sector, clearly the purpose of the report was to try to shed greater light on the sector.  Obviously, it was not about producing a report at the end but was about bringing together the sector to discuss these matters.  The process probably is as important as the final output in that regard, because the stakeholders had a lot of opportunities to engage with one another and with Forf&aacute;s through this process.  As for the question on governance models, a number of governance models are used in the sector.  However, based on other work, we estimate that more than 80% of social enterprises are established as limited companies.  In many cases, they have charitable status in addition to being limited companies.  The co-operative model obviously is another that exists.  Our advice is that social enterprises should look at what model best suits its business activity, in that one size does not fit all in this regard.  As the Senator will be aware of the recent announcements regarding the charities regulator and what will happen with in that sector, I do not propose to go into that.</p><p>  Perhaps I will couple the Senator's other comments together with questions Deputy Donnelly has asked regarding what is happening in the sector.  As I noted in my presentation, more than 1,400 social enterprises are currently being supported.  They draw funding from various sources, some of them trade commercially and there is activity happening on the ground.  This is not new and there is activity.  At present, they are supported by a range of different initiatives, primarily through the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Leader programme to which the Senator referred under the local community and development programme.  The Senator obviously is also correct in stating that the aforementioned programme ran until 2013 and that proposals are now being developed for a further iteration of it.  Other supports are available under the Department of Social Protection and again, it depends on the type of proposal that is being put forward as to which of these fits best with the model that has been proposed.  Finally, on the implementation, as I already have noted, the Minister and the interdepartmental committee are currently setting out an implementation plan.  As the Deputy will understand, I cannot pre-empt what that is but there is a commitment to take this forward.</p><p>  On the microenterprise loan fund, I am not in a position to answer the Deputy but will be happy to revert to him separately and establish what is happening in that regard.  On the Deputy's further question as to the reason Ireland is so far below the European average, as measured by percentage of GDP, we are currently at 2.5% relative to the 6% average.  I do not believe there is any easy answer to give to the Deputy.  He referred to the ethos and the nature of volunteering that exists in Ireland.  Some of it may relate to capacity building within the sector and there are a lot of examples of small social enterprises that may have the ability to scale but have not done so due to their internal capacity.  This was an area to which Forf&aacute;s referred in the report, namely, the need to build this business capability, largely within those enterprises, to enable them to bring forward business plans and to manage things on a more commercial basis.  However, I do not have an easy answer to that question.</p></speech>

One problem is having too many agencies that are interested in the sector.  For example, in addition to the Equality Budgeting Campaign, there are organisations such as Social Justice Ireland, the Conference of Religious of Ireland, CORI, and so on.  It would be really useful, were all these organisations to get together and to have a single dedicated function because the Government always will play one off against the other.  It will state it already has that information, just as it is telling the Equality Budgeting Campaign.  Do the witnesses follow me?</p></speech>

For example, the ESRI and the CSO have huge credibility, but while everything being done by the Equality Budgeting Campaign merits credibility, it will not be heard for as long as the message is so disparate.</p></speech>

Moreover, we had an equality infrastructure but it has been dismantled in recent years.  While we have a very narrow focus, it is not that our work is not complementary to that of Social Justice Ireland or other actors in society.</p></speech>

Approximately 60 different civil society groups met in the Mansion House to come together as a united front.  We have agreed to work in solidarity, rather than as competing civil groups.</p></speech>

In general, he gives the figures in respect of the cuts.  However, another report will vary on something else and people can hide behind that.  Given the Whip system, I do not know whether this would make a huge impact when it comes to budget time but, at the least, those who make these decisions should have the requisite information literally under their noses, to demonstrate what it is they are doing and how it will have an impact on people, as well as in respect of accountability and so on.  An example was given of someone living in a home who is insolvent but that is a different argument than the argument about equality budgeting.  Ultimately, that is an argument about a fair society.  If one refers to the case of a family that got a mortgage of &euro;300,000 when two people were working, who then had two kids and were no longer in work, as well as the banking crisis and so on, one is making a different argument really.  I believe the issue of equality budgeting is very important and members should be pushing for it.  Ms Bayliss referred to the time when all the groups got together in the Mansion House.  They should be preparing now for the next budget by getting together all that information and then shoving it under the noses of the politicians to say this is the story.</p></speech>

To follow on what the Chairman stated earlier, it is true that poverty traps arise.  Perhaps they do not fit into the architecture we have, when we think of the equality status grounds.  However, were we at least to begin a process and if we were blinkered in one way, at least there could be reform of or amendments to the process.</p></speech>

I have seen people who have no income and who, despite having salaries and so on, literally have no income left to pay for the basics in their house.  The point I am making is that income inequality is bigger than just the pay packet.  I should note I am an absolute fan of equality budgeting, which would be great.</p> <p>There is a consensus that we should have it and the information should be available.  From a Government backbencher&rsquo;s point of view, one must weigh up the pros and cons and then make a decision; it is not as simple as it may seem.  The budget is a package and one cannot just pick and choose bits of it.  That could be reform also but, overall, I would be very favourable towards the measure.</p></speech>

On 18 December 2013 the D&aacute;il ordered the following Revised Estimate for public services to be referred to this committee for consideration: Vote 13 - Office of Public Works.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brian Hayes, and his officials.  The purpose of the meeting is to consider the Revised Estimate and the supplementary performance information on the outputs and impacts on programme expenditure.  A draft timetable for the meeting has been circulated.  Is it agreed to?  Agreed.  I invite the Minister of State to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.98" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22014012900002#A00250"><p>Property is the second highest administrative cost in the public service after pay and pensions.  My office has been given the considerable task by the Government of rationalising the State's property portfolio so as to reduce that cost, as well as reflect the substantial fall in staffing numbers in the public service.  The publication of the property asset management delivery plan, Accommodating Change &ndash; Measuring Success, in July last year was the culmination of the work led by the chairman of the Office of Public Works, OPW, Ms Clare McGrath, as the senior responsible owner in this area of property-related reform.  I will shortly receive a report on the capacity of the OPW to deal with the new mandate given to it by the Government.  What we are doing in the property space is genuinely reforming and new.  By getting this right, big savings can be obtained for the taxpayer.  This plan will challenge the silo mentality that has built up over many years.  This new approach presents real opportunities for real savings by sharing assets, expertise and information across the public service.</p><p>  From the State's perspective, we know office accommodation is one area where significant savings can be made.  Ministers have already given their full commitment to ensuring their Departments and agencies co-operate fully.  The plan will include setting targets for space allocation per full-time equivalent employee to be achieved by Departments.  The drive to optimise office space will be enhanced and facilitated by statistical evidence setting out the full cost of accommodation borne by the State.  The evidence will derive from the key performance indicators arising from the application of a standardised approach to facilities management to be adopted by public property managers.  This will provide a basis on which to assess building performance and identify where improvements in space and energy efficiency can be achieved.  In addition, a web-based mapping register of all State property is being developed for use by the public service as an information tool that will facilitate strategic decision-making.</p><p>  On becoming Minister of State with responsibility for the OPW, a primary target of mine was to reduce rental payments for Civil Service accommodation below &euro;100 million by 2015.  I am glad to be able to inform the sub-committee that we are two years ahead of target, as last year the rent bill stood at &euro;97.5 million.  From a peak of &euro;131 million in 2008 to a low of &euro;97.5 million last year, progress is being made, as we are now back at 2002 levels of expenditure.  Further progress can be made by adopting a whole-of-government approach.  For the information of the sub-committee, of the 155 closed Garda stations, 40 are being sold, eight are being utilised by other State sector users and 13 have been handed over by way of a licence to community groups.  This is an example of using surplus properties in a different way.</p><p>  In the area of property maintenance, the OPW has assumed greater responsibility for the provision of this shared service for Departments.  The funding and works relating to building maintenance of State property to the value of almost &euro;20 million transferred to the OPW in 2013 and are now managed and performed by it.  For the first time, this allows the OPW to prioritise funding on a whole-of-government basis.  It also allows it to initiate a planned preventive maintenance works programme which in the medium term will produce savings and, more importantly, better care for the fabric of the State's buildings and an enhanced working environment.</p> <p>As a result of centralising this service, an estimated 100 staff in various Departments who were previously looking after maintenance transactions are now freed up for other duties in their specific Departments.  In 2013, &euro;19.5 million was expended on this work and the committee will see that a similar amount is available in 2014, of which &euro;2 million is ring-fenced to accelerate a preventive maintenance works programme on State-owned buildings.</p><p> While these reform measures have been ongoing, it is worth stating staffing levels in the OPW have reduced dramatically, from an authorised number of 2,208 in 2008 to 1,620 in 2014, a reduction of 588 staff or about 25% over a six year period.  We have fewer staff and a vastly reduced capital budget but have taken on new roles, as set out in my presentation, enhancing the existing shared service function traditionally performed by the OPW.   It is also worth highlighting to the committee the scale of the reduction in our capital budget over the same six year period.  When the unitary payment for the National Convention Centre is taken out, our total capital budget across all subheads is &euro;80 million, down from &euro;400 million in 2008, which is quite a reduction. </p><p> In difficult times, the OPW continues to demonstrate its commitment to training and work placement programmes.  The graduate architect and engineer programmes enhance the professional development of graduates while making a significant contribution to the work of the office.  In addition, placements under the JobBridge scheme are providing practical skills for participants to enhance their future employment prospects.  I am pleased to inform the committee that after an absence of some years, this year the OPW will reintroduce the apprenticeship programme.  Some 20 places will be offered on the programme in areas such as stonemasonry and craft carpentry.</p><p> On the last occasion Ireland held the EU Presidency in 2004, the total was &euro;110 million.  I am pleased to inform the committee that the total cost for last year came to &euro;42 million.  It is clear that the Government's decision to centralise all conferences and events, some 245 in total, made a big difference in reducing costs.  Dublin Castle and other historic properties under the care of the OPW, allied with the centralised event management service directed by the OPW, greatly helped in organising a very cost effective Presidency last year.  The new state-of-the-art conference facility in Dublin Castle is a tremendous asset for future events and conferences that the State needs.</p><p> In respect of the 2014 Estimates before the committee, the OPW has responsibility for two main programmes within Vote 13 - flood risk management and estate portfolio management.  The National Procurement Service has been transferred to the Office of Government Procurement andalready been reviewed by the committee under Vote 41.  </p><p> In respect of flood risk management, one of the areas to which I have not yet referred is crucial to the life of the country.  I would like to address briefly the matter of the severe storms in the Christmas and New Year period and the resulting serious damage caused to public infrastructure.  Initial estimates of the cost of the clean-up and the repair and restoration of public infrastructure were provided for the Government and are of the order of &euro;65 million. Some &euro;41 million, almost two thirds of the total estimate of &euro;65 million, arises in the case of two counties, Clare and Galway, reflecting the severe impact of the storms along the west coast.  Local co-ordination and delivery of clean-up and restoration works are being led by the local authorities.  All Members of the Oireachtas owe a great debt of gratitude to our colleagues in local authorities who have been through a very difficult number of weeks given the scale of the storms, particularly in the west.  We also owe a debt of gratitude to the emergency services and all those working day and night in very difficult circumstances.  The OPW has responsibility for flood relief and written to every local authority to state we will receive applications for funding to assist them in their work to repair the damage to coastal flood protection structures.  </p><p> Since 2009, the OPW has provided &euro;23.8 million in funding for local authorities to carry out minor work schemes - schemes under &euro;500,000.  The partnerships established with the local authorities and the funding provided for them are a key element in maximising the capacity of the overall programme, with approximately 1,230 projects having been completed to date under the scheme.  </p><p> Expenditure on capital flood relief works has been increased in recent years and we are now reaping the benefit of that investment in Dublin and towns such as Clonmel, Kilkenny, Mallow and Fermoy where schemes have been or are being carried out.  Nine major flood relief schemes were completed in the past two years under the major capital programme in places such as Carlow, Clonmel, Mallow, Tullamore and Dublin on the River Dodder, a tidal scheme.  This year will see the commencement of a further six major schemes at Templemore, Claregalway, Bandon, Skibbereen, Bray and south Dublin, with scheme completions at Fermoy, Ennis, Waterford and on the River Wad.  Almost &euro;370 million has been invested from 1995 to date in flood risk management measures which have protected 10,500 properties and delivered benefits estimated at over &euro;1 billion in terms of damage and losses avoided.  This is a very significant achievement by any measure.  </p><p> The Government has committed &euro;45 million per annum for flood risk management and mitigation measures for the period 2012-16 under its medium-term capital investment programme.  Despite the fall-off in capital expenditure elsewhere, the OPW has prioritised this area of spending and an amount in the order of  &euro;100 million has been spent in 2012 and 2013, with the use of other savings achieved under the OPW Vote.  A total of &euro;45 million in capital expenditure has again been allocated in 2014.  We have to prioritise our spending to make sure that on cost benefit grounds, the funding solves the problem for the greatest number of people, communities and businesses up and down the country.</p><p> On coastal erosion, an issue that has been brought to attention by many colleagues recently, we have to take a much more holistic view.  Coastal erosion is a natural occurrence and we have to make sure in our planning and development that we do not repeat the mistakes made in the past and allow development in areas at risk of erosion.  It is also worth noting that, in tandem with the management of flood risk, this investment programme is heavily labour-intensive and the investment will continue in future years to sustain significant employment numbers.  Based on a Department of Finance report on labour intensity and infrastructure investment, it is estimated that the amount of money expended on flood relief activities has sustained up to 700 direct jobs and 300 indirect jobs in the past two years.  These are all private sector jobs because the contracts are tendered for by the local authorities in the case of the minor works scheme.  </p><p> The estate portfolio management programme is the other big aspect of the Vote and the largest of the two programmes, with an allocation of &euro;312 million.  This programmes has many distinct parts, including &euro;98 million for rental payments and &euro;50 million for the  maintenance spend to which I have referred.  </p><p> Another significant part of the programme is heritage services involving the management of 760 national monuments and 30 national historic properties, with a combined provision of 70 visitor facilities.  We need to do things differently in the heritage space.  Since taking office, I have got a communities initiative scheme up and running.  While 20 projects have community involvement, there is potential for many more.  The First Free Wednesday of the Month initiative which I launched two years ago has helped to open up more of our great historical sites to the public and visitor numbers are up 6% year on year.  I recently looked for interest in the private sector to see if we could enter partnerships on our existing sites which might improve footfall, while increasing employment opportunities.  We received over 42 expressions of interest, with 13 serious proposals which are being considered by the OPW.  I will soon launch a new scheme to allow members of the public to use designated historical sites for civil ceremonies.  I secured agreement with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to reinvest additional receipts generated by the heritage services in the OPW.  As an initial step, an additional &euro;348,000 was generated in 2013 and provisionally allocated to the OPW in the Revised Estimates for 2014 to allow it to be reinvested in the heritage portfolio.</p> <p>This money will go to areas in most need and, importantly, where capacity has been identified to generate increased business and receipts.  The direct reinvestment of surplus receipts will create a strong incentive to increase activity at heritage sites and improve business opportunities.</p><p> Before I take questions, I remind members that the OPW also manages a range of services not funded directly from Vote 13.  In 2013 it incurred expenditure on behalf of other Departments and State agencies amounting to &euro;68 million.  The main areas of expenditure were the urgent provision of schools for the Department of Education and Skills, the Irish Youth Justice Service facilities in Oberstown, the delivery of the Intreo programme for the Department of Social Protection and the leasing of accommodation on a repayment basis for numerous clients.  As an organisation, we provide building, procurement and project management advice and assistance for Departments and State agencies.   </p><p> I hope I have given a fair summation of our work.  I am happy to take questions from members of the committee.</p></speech>

The estimate for damage is in the region of &euro;65 million, with counties Clare and Galway accounting for the bulk of the cost, at &euro;41 million.  I understand the remedial process is being led by the local authorities and the Minister of State was right to acknowledge their efforts in difficult circumstances.  How will the &euro;65 million be provided?</p><p>  In the course of his response I ask the Minister of State to refer to an old chestnut of mine, namely, insurance for houses in Dublin and elsewhere across the country which previously have been flooded.  Many parts of my constituency such as East Wall have experienced flooding on numerous occasions and residents in these areas now find it impossible to insure their homes.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.107" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/958" speakername="Brian Hayes" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22014012900004#C00800"><p>The &euro;65 million figure is the assessment by local authorities of the cost of the damage.  This is an initial assessment which the Government obtained two weeks ago.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, the lead Department, subsequently asked the local authorities to provide a clearer indication of what they might need, Department by Department.  The OPW is one of the players in this matter, with the Departments of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Social Protection and Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We aim to get a fuller picture of the scale of damage in respect of the &euro;65 million figure.</p><p>  In respect of flooding, we have responsibility for a capital allocation of &euro;45 million for major and minor schemes.  My officials have written to local authority managers to provide more flexible arrangements for the minor works scheme.  We have also given a commitment that we will prioritise applications from the worst affected counties.  I visited County Clare last week to inspect works being carried out by the local authority.  We are telling the local authorities to get on with the work and that we will recoup the money they spend afterwards in order to avoid bureaucratic slowness in getting money to the front line.  To be frank, we will need more money and I indicated as much when I saw the severity of the storm damage.  We will only be able to assess how much more we need once we have accurate information from the local authorities.  It was encouraging to see that work had already started in County Clare when I visited last week.  The priority is to repair flood defences that have been breached in case they are struck by further storms in the near future.</p><p>  I have replied to the Deputy's questions on flood insurance on a number of occasions.  I have prioritised this issue and hope to be in a position shortly to put before members a new memorandum of understanding between us and the Irish Insurance Federation, with which we have been in dialogue for the guts of one and a half years.  I regret that it has taken so long to agree the memorandum which will represent an agreement between us and the federation based on where we determine capital should be invested and whether we achieve the 100 year standard.  The 100 year standard is the basis on which insurers will reinsure communities.  In the area to which the Deputy referred, there is no reason insurance should not be forthcoming.  We have invested heavily in the area which managed to withstand the most recent storms.  It is an example to the insurance industry of where the State has made the necessary investment and insurers should continue to reinsure people living there.  I hope we will get the memorandum over the line at the earliest opportunity.  It is not for the lack of trying that it has not yet been agreed.  If we do get it over the line, it will represent a clear exchange of information on what we have done and the standard of engineering we have brought to the table.  The federation will have an assurance that the work we have done is of a type that will allow them to offer insurance.</p></speech>

This issue arose during our discussion of last year's Estimate in terms of the daft situation where the OPW was spending massive amounts of money on remedial works but the insurance companies were using a geozoning process to assess risk.  People living on Cathedral Road in Cork city, which is tens, if not hundreds, of feet above sea level, are unable to obtain flood insurance because they are geozoned.  I suggested last year this matter be included in the targets.  It is not currently listed, but it is a necessary target because it offers the added value of allowing households and businesses to obtain insurance.  I recommend that it be an output target for 2014.</p></speech>

In 2002, &euro;60 million worth of damage was caused in Dublin as a consequence of flooding.  We have since initiated two major schemes.  Other than along the seafront in Clontarf, Dublin suffered limited damage in the most recent storms.  Our investment has saved a considerable amount of money in flood repairs.  We have similar plans for Cork, but these projects take time.  We have to find a hydrological solution that will work.  People often believe they can simply throw money at a solution, but it is no good unless it solves the problem.  Community and local authority support is as crucial in Cork as it was in Dublin.</p> <p>We need the same in Cork.  We have a very major scheme we hope to get going very shortly.</p></speech>

As we discovered, in Douglas two years ago a particular type of sluice gate was installed but was not monitored, so when it got jammed it flooded the whole village.  The insurance companies are right to say it is not good enough to do the work.  One needs to oversee that they are operating.  That needs to be a key performance indicator, that we put the works in but ensure the certainty it gives home owners, businesses and the industry is maintained by supervision.</p></speech>

If the State puts significant money into projects that change flood risk to a 100 year probability of flooding, as has been mentioned, there are areas, certainly on the north side of Cork city, which, if they flood, means the rest of the city will be affected.  Dublin Hill and Cathedral Road cannot get insurance.  That is already an issue.  On the memorandum of understanding, will it be zones, will there be compulsion and will individuals have some right to engage, either through public representatives or some other forum?  Who will be able to interact with the memorandum of understanding?  Will individual citizens be able to say what happens when Dublin Hill floods?  How will it work in practice?</p></speech>

In our memorandum of understanding we hope that where we have done the work and put in the investment, for example, in Mallow, Kilkenny and Dublin, there is an understanding in the industry that a standard has been obtained.  That has not happened thus far.  An exchange of information between us and them will be the key in giving them the confidence to offer reinsurance in that area.  The problem is, where we have not spent the money, it is difficult to hold out the hope that insurance will follow.  That is why we have the catchment flood risk assessment and management, CFRAM, process, which is the wider scheme under which we are examining the flooding maps across the country and assessing on a river catchment area what needs to be done and how long it will take.</p><p>  When I first came to the OPW and met engineers in Trim, I was told in very blunt terms that there were approximately 250 so-called hot spots throughout the country where tomorrow we could have very significant flooding damage.  That has been fed into the CFRAM process, which we will present to Europe by the end of 2015.  Then, for the first time ever, we will have an overview of how we will tackle this problem.  If I had &euro;3 billion tomorrow, we would get all the 250 hot spots done now, but I do not.  We must prioritise, with the resources Government has given us on the capital side, to maximise effect.  There are also examples where we are not waiting for CFRAM.  We have examples where we have brought schemes forward because of the intensity of the situation that faces those communities.  That is the case in Cork as well.</p></speech>

The Minister of State has indicated that we need to spend some money on the damage that occurred at Christmas time.  He is hoping to be on his way to Europe to learn about the European solidarity fund, and I wish him the best of luck with that.  In the meantime, have we made an application to the European solidarity fund for places such as Kerry, particularly in light of the fact that a great deal of the coastline is, as it were, soft coastline, candidate special areas of conservation or sand dunes which have been damaged in the storms?  Have we made an application and should that alleviate some of our funding problems after the storm damage?</p></speech>

Given that the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is the lead Department, it will make the application on behalf of the Government given the scale of the storm.  After the last major storm event only &euro;13 million was drawn down out of a scale of damages worth more than &euro;150 million to &euro;200 million.  It is difficult to obtain this because one of the factors that militates against a bigger drawdown is the total level of economic damage that was caused within the framework of the solidarity fund.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is examining that and when the full detail of the scale is known by the local authorities, they will decide that.</p><p>  Last year, there were 58 minor flood works.  I will get the Deputy the Kerry list later.  A minor flood work application is up to &euro;500,000.  The local authority applies to us.  It is a small-scale piece of work.  We turn it around quickly.  We have a cost-benefit model and if the benefit is merited, we grant it and the local authority contracts the work locally.  We will get the breakdown of the &euro;65 million.  I think it may have been &euro;23 million.</p></speech>

Those are the broad headings from the initial assessment.  I was in Sligo recently looking at the coastal erosion caused.  Whole beaches were removed by the storm.  We must take a holistic approach to this.  In some cases the engineers tell me a beach or a whole sand dune moves from one area to another, but over a period of years it comes back again.  This is a rapidly changing area.  The key responsibility we have is identifying the key public infrastructure that must be protected.  These things will happen again.</p><p>  Despite the level of funding which has come up in recent years, we have not put in the funding in the way other small countries with similar coastlines have done.  We need to ramp up public expenditure and capital funding in this area.  Our priorities are people, homes and businesses.  While sand dunes are important, especially where there is rock armoury in place, we must prioritise those projects which can give maximum benefit.  This is a very difficult issue for coastal communities where whole stretches of beach and coastal areas have been affected, but our key priorities must be people, homes and businesses, and we will continue with that.</p></speech>

I was at a different committee.  Arklow suffered much damage and the people there are asking for rock armour.  Is there a list of the places?  Is there somewhere I can go to find out if Arklow is included?  If not, is it possible there might be another round of funding in the year to cover beaches that have not been chosen?</p></speech>

The funds are allocated by way of the applications the local authorities make to us.  If Arklow thinks it has a viable application and it is under &euro;500,000, it will apply to us.</p> <p>We will then turn it around under the minor works scheme.  Before the Deputy came in, I made the point to the committee that we changed the terms this year to make it easier for the local authorities to draw down those funds, especially following the storms.</p><p> The Deputy mentioned Arklow.  I have visited the town and there is a bigger issue.  A major scheme is required there.  We are looking at that as part of the CFRAM.  The issue in Arklow is tidal and fluvial.  A high tide and very substantial rainfall at the same time cause significant difficulties for Arklow because the bridge capacity cannot produce the outflow.  As the applications come in from Wicklow County Council, we will turn them around.</p></speech>

A whole new set of flooding issues have arisen this year that I presume would not have been taken into account when the first Estimate was given in October.  It would not have been possible.  How much of this is allocated to projects and how much is available for new flooding?  How much of the damage from the recent flooding pertains to areas under the OPW's remit and how much pertains to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and so on?  Coastal fences are normally the responsibility of the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine or have been in most cases.  Where is the dividing line here?  What will the OPW be funding to address the recent damage?</p></speech>

Many of these big schemes would be carried out over a two to three year window.  The drawdown would very much depend on how the contract is governed.  In my speech I set out the major capital programmes where we will see progress this year.  It is a rolling programme and, as the Deputy knows from his time in government, some of these projects can take some years.  Some &euro;33 million of the &euro;45 million is contractually committed.  We will need to wait and see if that is the amount actually drawn down on each of those schemes.</p><p>  The Deputy asked the fundamental question of where our responsibility lies.  Under the Arterial Drainage Act 1945 we are responsible for all arterial drainage schemes.  That is our responsibility.  I was in County Clare and saw a scheme in the Shannon Estuary which we had been maintaining.  Because they had been maintained by us, the lands for the farmers were of a very good quality.  In the areas that fell under the Land Commission, however, as the Deputy would know, there had been significant breaches.  That water is still there and making it impossible for the farmers to get any kind of yield.  I understand that more than 200 km of Land Commission embankments throughout the country - especially in the west - are funded by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I understand there is still a Land Commission and I believe its funding for maintenance is quite low.  If tomorrow morning the Minister, Deputy Howlin, gave me funding of &euro;220 million, we could resolve all those problems at one level, but we would have to maintain them, so it is a wider responsibility.</p><p>  Technically, we are only responsible for the arterial drainage schemes and, of course, where we have made a major capital investment in recent years, we would take responsibility for maintaining those.  They include the bigger ones in Kilkenny, Clonmel and other parts of the country.</p><p>  What was the Deputy's third question?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.137" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1044" speakername="&Eacute;amon &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FI22014012900006#E00900"><p>Most of the flooding in 2009 was inland in places such as Claregalway and Clonmel - all the usual suspects.  That is clearly the responsibility of the OPW.  I compliment the Office of Public Works on the fantastic work done in Claregalway.  More work remains to be done and I believe it is part of the contract.  From what I have seen on the ground, the OPW seems to have relatively little to do to address the damage caused by the recent storms because it is mostly along the coast and not in rivers.  Much of it relates to sea walls, the tail end of roads, piers, etc.  Would I be right in thinking that funding to address that damage will not come from the OPW budget but from the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government and so on?</p></speech>

The initial estimate from the worst affected counties is that &euro;65 million is the scale of the damage.  That breaks down as follows: &euro;20 million for roads under the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, &euro;35 million on coastal, and &euro;10 million on tourism.  Within the coastal a large proportion would be marine and harbour related which we do not fund.  We have responsibility for flood defences.  In answer to a question from Deputy McDonald, I outlined that we would need more money.  However, that is across Government and especially in the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  We cannot be specific on the total extra amount because we do not have the detailed assessment at this stage.</p></speech>

From the previous experience of this happening, money will be needed.  For example the OPW is still working on preventative measures arising from the 2009 events.  The most urgent thing is to provide the money upfront and quickly.  By the time tenders are processed and the work done, much of the cost will not fall into this financial year but into next year.  With marine works in particular, by the time the tender process is complete and contractors are on site, we could be into 2015.  We need to get the process in place and moving fast.  I hope that money would be put on the table.  I would rather see modest money now to get this year's work done than waiting forever for a huge deluxe plan that will take years to do and, in the meantime, people find it difficult to access basic services, including houses.  There is a danger of further erosion occurring that could be much more expensive.  The stitch in time saves nine principle applies, and we have already lost a month.</p></speech>

Last week I saw in Quilty, County Clare, that the local authority is getting on with the task.  We have advised it to do the work and that we would reimburse the funding.  If local authorities put in funds, there is no reason they cannot get on with the task of doing the work, patching up the stuff that needs to be patched up as soon as possible and we will refund them as the applications come through.</p></speech>

I was in Foynes last week.  The Shannon Foynes Port Company spent more than &euro;100,000 in the past two weeks to address a serious situation that arose there.  Private companies, the OPW and local authorities all have responsibility.  A lot is happening and I do not want people to have the perception that the Government is in any way slowing down.  We need to see the works taking place as soon as possible.</p> <p>I have already stated it is my view that we will need more funding in this area, but we do not want to see slowness in making these decisions.</p></speech>

It is pure nosiness on my part and I am asking because I do not know and it caught my attention on the list.</p><p>  I understand responsibility for Garda stations was transferred to the OPW last year.  Will the Minister of State provide an update on the process for their prospective sale and the position on the return of stations for community use?</p><p>  There is controversy - one of many - in Balbriggan about the library.  There is a proposal to move the library to Gallen Mills to make way for the opening of an Intreo office.  Has Fingal County Council been in touch with the OPW in that regard?  Local people are agitated about the issue.</p></speech>

There is a good deal of controversy locally surrounding the library.  Often I describe the Department as the classic shared service facility across government.  The Deputy is correct in saying the OPW does not get the praise it deserves.  I suspect this is because it is not represented around the Cabinet table.  In this key piece of work, a key part of the labour activation measures to establish 53 or 54 Intreo offices by the end of the year, we have been doing a lot of work for the Department of Social Protection in ensuring we will have these new spaces with modern offices to help people in the provision of social protection and dealing with labour activation issues.</p><p>  The case to which the Deputy refers in Balbriggan has been brought to my attention.  I have spoken to Deputies Ryan and Farrell, as well as the Minister for Health, about the issue, and we are working to find a solution.  We have also been in touch with Fingal County Council and I think we have an alternative site which will allow the library to remain in place.  This is important for people to hear.  It is an old Carnegie library to which they are attached and we are looking to see whether we can resolve the issue with the local authority by finding an alternative site.  I think we can do this, while keeping to the programme and ensuring Balbriggan will have its new Intreo office.  I congratulate colleagues on the project management side on the work done in the provision of Intreo offices.  We stated we would have 42 open by 31 December last year and we accomplished this.  Great credit is due to the team within the OPW for doing that piece of work.</p><p>  On the consultancy side, my understanding is the total sum last year was &euro;13,315 for two pieces of work -  one was the provision of internal audit services within the organisation, while the other was in respect of ISO architectural services.  They cost approximately &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000, respectively.  Consultancy services that are of a professional or technical nature form an integral part of an infrastructural scheme works programme or project on the construction side.  Out of the total budget last year, &euro;13,000 was the spend on consultancy services.</p></speech>

The Deputy will be aware that the Government asked us to lead on the property management aspect of the public sector reform plan and we launched our proposals last July.  It is under the auspices of the OPW.  As I mentioned, we are carrying out a review of capacity within the OPW.  We will have the report shortly and it will obviously fall part of this year's Estimate.  The review is being undertaken by an outside group which is looking at the organisation to identify whether we have all the necessary staff in place to achieve a whole-of-government approach to property management.  It is a big undertaking.  From the savings I have identified, we can see the big potential benefit.  As I stated, this is the second biggest cost outside pay and pensions and we must get it right.  The total cost of that piece of work will be over &euro;100,000.</p></speech>

We take responsibility in maintaining the Garda stations and for the capital budget concerned.  Since the Government took the decision on the 155 stations, eight have been retained for alternative State use.  The HSE, in one case, and the Ambulance Service, in another, have taken them over and are reconfiguring them to meet their needs.  A total of 40 are up for disposal on the open market because they are assets and of some value which we will try to extract for the State.  A total of 13 have been assigned for community use.  The other day I visited Cliffony, County Sligo, where I was able to hand over the Garda station to a local community group for community use.  This is something I have led.  There is much potential to assign for further use where a station is of good quality.  One does not want to hand over old decrepit buildings which communities would have to maintain.  A total of 94 others are under consideration for future use.  The more we can get into community hands the better because it reduces the cost to the State of maintenance and security of the buildings.  We have seen some innovative proposals coming from communities to take on these stations and the more applications, the better.  In some cases, communities applied to us, but then when they realised the obligations they would be taking on in terms of the lease, stepped back from it.  There is, however, potential for further growth.</p></speech>

One often hears an argument that real savings are obtained by providing deep retrofit systems in buildings, but the evidence shows that many of the minor works schemes which involve changing attitudes and behaviour lead to the making of big savings.  The annual energy saving targets for the scheme are: 8% in year one, 13% in year two and 18% in year three.  The OPW will lead the campaign.  Much of the work will be done by private sector tenderers, but the funding is coming from the Minister, Deputy Pat Rabbitte's Department in respect of buildings over which we have control.  We are trying to ensure greater oversight of other public buildings.  We are trying to become involved in hospitals to extend the work we have been doing in this regard.</p> <p> The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform recently provided funding of &euro;9 million over three years from the carbon levy fund for the optimising power at work scheme.  The full roll-out of this successful programme is targeted at buildings in the wider public sector.  We will spend &euro;2.5 million under the scheme this year and members can expect an announcement in this regard very shortly.</p></speech>

Expenditure in this regard would in the past have come under our Vote, particularly on the staffing side.

We are now working with the Department of Education and Skills in procuring sites for schools.  Another example is that previously every Department looked after its own maintenance.  We have been asked to take on that &euro;20 million budget and do the work ourselves, which has released more than 100 people back into Departments because they are no longer engaged in transactions with us.  Another benefit is that it allows us greater control in terms of prioritisation.  A Department might have been happy, for instance, to buy carpets and wallpaper, but we are more interested in roofs and windows.  As I outlined, the largest saving this year is in the rent bill.  We are two years ahead of budget in getting it under &euro;100 million - it is now &euro;97.5 million where previously it was &euro;135 million.  This was achieved by getting out of leases, making sure we moved people up in the bed in terms of requirements in respect of public buildings and that where we were using these facilities, we were getting maximum use out of the space available.  These are some of the savings that have been achieved as a result of the actions we took in the past year.</p></speech>

I have been informed by various garda&iacute;, sergeants in particular, around the country that they are very frustrated at the prices they are being forced to pay by the OPW, as they claim, for the upgrade of stations.  I do not have data in this regard; it is all anecdotal evidence.  To give an example, one sergeant told me that when he needed to have a room in the barracks painted, the OPW stated the price would be &euro;700 or so, whereas it could be done locally for &euro;150.  Is it the case that Garda sergeants, or whoever is in control of local budgets, are not allowed to tender locally?</p></speech>

Talk is cheap in our system and I have heard all types of story.  By centralising the system, we can extract substantial savings and ensure funding is prioritised in accordance with the allocation we receive.  We are spending &euro;19.5 million this year on maintenance, which includes Garda stations.</p><p>  On the capital side, there is an impression that the decision on which Garda stations are rebuilt, extended and so on is a matter for the OPW.  In fact, that list comes from the Garda Commissioner and is drawn up by his property and maintenance people.  They prioritise what they want to do; we allow them to make the decisions and then do the work for them.  We do not have a huge cohort of staff involved in this work.  We have contractor lists and a lot of the money is spent in the real economy.  Many of the jobs involved are small.  Contractors on the list tender for work and we cannot just pick and choose the winners.  Where there is a piece of work that is any way substantial in nature, we want people to tender for it.  If there is a specific case the Deputy would like to bring to my attention, I will be happy to look into it.</p></speech>

The office is a silent winner, quietly and methodically going about its work.  It has a huge impact on citizens' daily lives but does not get the recognition it deserves.  I take the opportunity to thank the Minister of State and his staff and wish them well for the future.</p> <p> I have two questions.  The Minister of State may have already answered the first of them in so far as a report may be forthcoming.  However, will he indicate the number of empty buildings that are either owned by the OPW or being leased or rented by it?  What is the cost relating to these buildings and what are the plans to sell those in the ownership of the OPW, repurpose or transfer them to various Departments or State agencies for their use?</p><p> My second question relates to subhead B.11 and the additional &euro;348,000 derived from revenues from heritage sites last year which is to be spent this year.  That money is extremely welcome.  I wish to be parochial.  The Minister of State referred to investing in order to increase activity and improve business opportunities.  I ask him to give specific consideration to the Hill of Tara in this regard.  The interpretative and visitor centre at the site is closed for more months each year than it is open, which is a terrible shame.  Some 800 people visited the site on New Year's Eve, a day on which it is supposed to be closed.  There was nobody present to talk to these individuals and the church and interpretative and visitor centre were closed.  As a result, they could not watch the video that is usually shown at the church, which is a crying shame.  It would cost very little to open the site more often.  The facilities are already in place and all that would be necessary is an investment in staff.  In the context of one of the largest and most cherished heritage sites in the country, will the Minister of State consider extending the period for which the interpretative and visitor centre opens during the year?</p></speech>

Obviously, the site is the responsibility of the OPW.  An audio-visual system has been put in place by it in the church on the Hill of Tara.  The Deputy makes a fair point in that the site is not open to the public for many months of the year.  The coffee shop on the site which is run by a gentleman whom I met some years ago does substantial business.</p></speech>

I can revisit that matter.  The Deputy makes a fair point, namely, that the money we invest must be used.  We spent a substantial sum of money on restoring the ramparts at Elizabeth Fort in the Chairman's constituency.</p></speech>

That was crazy and I, therefore, took the decision in the light of the excellent work it did to hand over the site to Cork City Council in order that it might make a go of it.  The OPW no longer has sufficient staff to allow it to operate all of these sites throughout the country.  We must consider innovative approaches.  In that context, I have an open mind when it comes to allowing private sector companies as external service providers to run heritage sites.  If the State does not have the money to run these sites and good protocols are put in place, there is no reason such companies cannot become involved.  We will re-examine the position on the site at Tara.  I discussed this matter with colleagues some years ago and I am sorry that progress has not been made.</p><p>  The OPW does not have any vacant leased property on its books.  That is largely because we are getting out of this sector and trying to ensure the public buildings we do own will be utilised in a much better way.  A completely new attitude will be required in this regard.  We have already got rid of 48 State agencies and there are a further 15 to go.  The remaining agencies do not all need their own buildings.  We must be much more creative in how we use space.  As I demonstrated, there are major savings to be made by withdrawing from the property sector.  As far as I am concerned, we will not be taking out long-term leases in the future, rather we will use our existing space in a different and better way.</p></speech>

I understand the programme allowed for extremely expensive leases in Dublin to be surrendered in favour of much cheaper for either loaned or rented buildings in locations outside the capital.  What was the total saving resulting from the programme which, as the Minister of State rightly points out, was introduced by the previous Government?</p></speech>

We disposed of a substantial number of properties in Dublin as part of the decentralisation programme.  The difficulty was not so much that this property was disposed of at the top of the market but rather that announcements were made on the towns and cities to which Departments and offices were going to be decentralised and, as a result, the price of property in these locations increased exponentially.  If one is going to buy something, one does not broadcast one's intentions before doing so because that would not make sense.  That was the critical policy error made during the era in question.  The Government has changed the policy.</p></speech>

I intend to present a brief overview of the licensed moneylending sector and how the Central Bank regulates it.  I would also like to share what I see as some of the issues in the sector and our views on them.</p><p>  Moneylending, as defined in legislation, is the practice of providing credit to customers on foot of a moneylending agreement which is, in essence, where the total cost of credit is in excess of an annual percentage rate, APR, of 23% or the agreement is concluded away from the business premises of the moneylender.  The credit usually takes the form of a cash loan, but may also involve the provision of goods on credit from a retailer, the purchase of goods from a catalogue company or the purchase of vouchers.</p><p>  There are 40 licensed moneylending firms in Ireland, a decrease from 52 in 2003 when we took over regulation of the sector.  The business models operated by these firms fall broadly into three categories, with some firms operating in more than one category.  There are 31 firms providing a home collection service to approximately 130,000 customers.  Most firms in the home collection category have between 100 and 1,000 customers, which is a relatively small number.  There are three catalogue firms, whereby consumers can select goods from an online or paper-based catalogue, with customer numbers representing approximately 50% of the moneylending market.  The category of other firms covers retail firms which sell goods on credit such as electrical appliances and remote firms to which payment must be made other than by means of home collection, such as direct debit.</p><p>  Customer numbers in the sector have increased from 300,000 in 2005 to approximately 360,000 today and outstanding loan amounts are approximately &euro;200 million.  Moneylender loans are generally short-term in nature and their cost can be very high when compared to other forms of credit.  In addition to the actual cost of credit, the APR is heavily influenced by the term of the loan as well as any collection charge included.  The maximum APR charged in respect of specific loans ranges from 23% to 188.45%, excluding collection charges, and up to 287.72% when collection charges are included.  The cost of credit for this loan is &euro;30 for every &euro;100 borrowed over a 20 week term.  These rates have remained largely unchanged since 2003.</p><p>  Anyone wishing to engage in the business of moneylending requires a licence from the Central Bank in accordance with the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and this licence must be renewed every year.  These firms are subject to the requirements of the Consumer Credit Act and also subsequent European legislation in the form of consumer credit regulations.  The Central Bank supervises firms in this sector through annual reviews of their activities as part of the annual licensing process, firm-specific and sectoral inspections, the application of a fitness and probity regime, the carrying out of consumer research, and monitoring trends, including complaints made to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  The sector is closely monitored and follow-up regulatory action is taken when necessary.</p><p>  Our statutory role in respect of the annual licensing of a firm is to assess each individual application, which includes an assessment of whether, in the context of the application, the cost of credit to be charged is excessive or any of the terms or conditions are unfair.  In terms of cost of credit, we examine the specifics of the firm&rsquo;s proposals, and requests for increases to the maximum permitted APR of specific loans in the sector have, in the main, been rejected.</p><p>  One of the challenges we face in considering rates charged by moneylenders on specific loans is finding a balance between the availability of credit for people who do not have access to legitimate credit elsewhere or who do not use other regulated credit providers and the provision of short-term unsecured loans at what can be a high cost.  There has been some public discussion in this regard about introducing an industry-wide cap on the rates moneylenders can charge.  Lower interest rate ceilings could be ineffective and counterproductive in this regard and may result in excluding low income households that have repayment capacity, even at the high rates charged by licensed moneylenders.  We would have some concerns therefore about the imposition of an industry-wide interest rate cap without there having been a full assessment of its impact on consumers.</p><p>  There has been some media attention about so-called payday lenders.  These lenders typically offer very short-term loans to tide borrowers over until their next pay day.  The advertised representative APR associated with these loans can be as high as 4,000% to 5,000%.  Although a number of firms have expressed an interest in offering payday loans in the Irish market, I can confirm that no such business model has been licensed by the Central Bank of Ireland.</p><p>  The number of firms in the sector continues to decline, with some smaller firms either closing or transferring their business to other licensed firms.  The number of people who use moneylenders has risen since we published our previous research in 2007, with larger firms, including catalogue companies and other specialist firms, seeing an increase in the number of customers and smaller traditional door-to-door lenders seeing a decline.  This changing profile of the sector, which now has fewer but larger firms, will inform our future regulatory approach.</p><p>  There is no doubt that when compared with other credit providers such as banks or credit unions the cost of loans from some moneylenders is high irrespective of loan size or length.  This is particularly so when this form of lending is used on an ongoing basis.  Through our assessment of individual applications, maximum permitted APRs have not increased overall in recent years.  We have sought, through engaging with potential new entrants, to keep the practice of moneylenders offering very short-term loans at excessive APRs out of the market and we will continue to pursue this policy.  Our focus has also been on improving the transparency of these costs and increasing consumer awareness by way of requirements such as the need to warn consumers about the high-cost nature of the loans and to disclose all the fees, costs and interest in a clear manner prior to entering into an agreement.  We also set up a register of moneylenders on our website which sets out product details, such as the maximum APR, the maximum cost of credit and the collection charge, if any.  Recent research found that 65% of customers surveyed reported knowing the rate of interest they were charged on their most recent loan, in contrast to findings in 2007 that 71% of customers did not know this rate.</p><p>  According to the research findings, 31% of customers surveyed had borrowings other than mortgages from other institutions, including banks and credit unions.  However, only one in five considered alternative credit providers before taking out a loan with a moneylender, with over half of these considering a credit union.  Approximately one quarter of customers also reported being refused credit by a bank, building society or credit union.  This figure was originally reported to us incorrectly by the research company and we are revising this and a small number of other items in the published research findings following further detailed analysis of the data the research company reported to us.  Clearly, what the figures show is that a significant number of customers who use moneylenders do not consider alternative sources of credit, including credit unions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.234" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Bernard Sheridan" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014012900004#D00300"><p>All of my references are to licensed moneylenders.</p><p>  Other factors relevant to this issue are the robustness of the creditworthiness assessments carried out by moneylenders, a topic on which we have given firms feedback previously, and the continued availability of credit for existing customers.  It is especially important in such a high-cost sector, where over a quarter of borrowers surveyed cite ease of availability of moneylender credit as a key factor in their choice of a moneylender over another type of credit provider, that lenders have effective systems in place to assess the ability of the borrower to repay.  This is all the more important in a context in which a quarter of those surveyed had found it difficult to make moneylender repayments in the previous 18 months, and this overall figure will be higher in some moneylender sectors.</p><p>  The research found that more customers hold longer-standing loan arrangements of five years or more with a moneylender.  While there may be circumstances in which a customer needs an additional loan, we would be concerned a new loan is simply a way of extending an existing loan whereby the credit becomes longer-term in nature but is charged on the basis that it is short-term.  It may also become more difficult for the borrower to consider alternative sources of credit.  Concerns have also arisen through our supervisory work as well as from the research that some moneylenders may make credit available but reduce the amount of a new loan made available to the customer in order to repay an existing loan.  This is an issue we will examine further.</p><p>  I thank the committee for its invitation to discuss this important topic.  In regulating licensed moneylenders the Central Bank&rsquo;s focus is on the protection of borrowers&rsquo; interests.  While we believe we achieve this through the regulatory framework we have put in place and our ongoing monitoring of the sector, we continue to be vigilant to the sector&rsquo;s trends and will develop our supervisory approach accordingly.  I am happy to take any questions.</p></speech>

We will rotate in rounds of 12 minutes for questions and answers.  I thank Mr. Sheridan and his officials for coming before the committee.  The report makes for very interesting reading.

Are the 360,000 people borrowing at present from licensed moneylenders borrowing from them only and not from credit unions or banks?</p></speech>

It is an astronomical figure.  Ireland entered the troika bailout programme because we could not get money cheaply, namely, below 8.5%.  The affordability level of these interest rates indicates a worrying return.  Of the 360,000 loans, what percentage have been completed in full?  Have almost all of them been repaid?</p></speech>

If one operates on the basis that risk in lending is determined by the interest rate and that 80% of loans are performing, why is the Central Bank allowing such a high interest rate to operate in the market?</p></speech>

When people fall behind in their repayments, the lender is prohibited under the legislation from imposing additional charges or costs upon the borrower other than legal costs owing to legal actions.  Generally, the term of repayment is extended and no other action is taken.</p></speech>

The types of loan that we are discussing range across the variety of providers.  For example, there are traditional door-to-door lenders, which charge APRs in the higher bracket.  This is partly related to the high cost of credit as well as to the terms of the loans, which drive up the quoted APRs.</p><p>  We have undertaken this research and followed up on the 2007 research to determine the impact, how borrowers are coping and why they are engaging with the sector in question.  In general, people are satisfied because they can get small loans relatively easily.  It seems to suit many people despite the fact that we have tried to emphasise the high-cost nature of these loans.  People use moneylenders at these rates because of ease of access.  An issue for us is whether moneylenders are making it too easy.</p></speech>

According to the report, people are satisfied with the service, but I would like to know what question was asked.  It is certainly easier to get a loan from a licensed moneylender than from a bank or credit union.  With some moneylenders, one can almost get loans online.  However, quality of service and access to money are separate matters.  There is a significant financial penalty or additional cost in taking this route.  Is it within the Central Bank's power to reduce the interest rates?  Does it set the limits?</p></speech>

We took over this role in the market in 2003, since which time the rates, types and terms of loans have not changed.</p></speech>

Perhaps I am wrong, but the interest rate applied to a loan is based on risk - that is, whether the borrower will repay the money.  As Ireland discovered in the international monetary markets before we entered the bailout programme, we could not get affordable money because the interest rate increased.  That was 8.5%, but we are discussing 287%.  How is that an affordable interest rate, particularly given the fact that 80% plus of the market is performing?  It does not equate.</p></speech>

We are discussing specific types of loan.  We have undertaken research to determine the impact on the market.  One of our concerns relates to interventions in the market.  Where will people go if this type of credit is not available?  We tread carefully when considering reductions in the market rate, but we certainly would not like to see further increases.</p></speech>

As part of that process, there is a meeting between the firm and the Central Bank.  During recent years a handful of firms from different jurisdictions have communicated with us in regard to setting up that business model here.  Applying the policy that we have set, we have been able to refuse them entry to the market.  While initially these firms only provide loans which are critical to people in terms of getting them out of a hole, they subsequently turn into firms providing easy access to credit.</p></speech>

There is a great deal of secrecy in this area, including by licensed companies.  Moneylenders generally do not display the name of the company over the door.  In many cases, the names do not suggest that the business is that of moneylending.  A couple come to mind but I will not mention them now.  However, in my view this adds to the secrecy of the whole operation.  Three different premises come to mind that display no information which would suggest that the businesses therein are moneylenders.  Perhaps there is a need for amendment of the regulation in this area.  A person who opens an accountancy or solicitor's practice is required to display their name on the business premises.  If this provision were to apply across the board, it could help to open up the market in terms of the supply of information to consumers.  What is the difference to the consumer between a licensed company which does not display its name above the door of its premises and an unlicensed company which does likewise?  I am not sure there is much, if any, difference.  This issue needs to be addressed.</p><p>  The Consumer Credit Act provides for the taking of a case to the Circuit Court in respect of the excessive interest rate charges, with the Circuit Court having the authority to vary interest rates in credit agreements, including moneylending agreements.  Are any such cases ever taken?  Would such cases be taken by the borrower or the Central Bank on behalf of the borrower?</p></speech>

I advocated a couple of years ago that people avail of that provision in relation to interest rates on mortgages.  However, it does not apply to mortgages.  Is there any role for the Central Bank in terms of use of that provision for issues that arise outside of annual renewal time in respect of moneylending agreements or other credit agreements?</p></speech>

It is the responsibility of the Central Bank in the context of annual licensing to address the issue of excessive interest rate charges.  The issue is addressed case by case.  Whether this should be provided for in law is a separate issue.  In my view, it is too much to expect borrowers to take on a provider of credit to them.</p><p>  In regard to the Senator's comment around secrecy in regard to whether one is dealing with a moneylender, the Central Bank requires companies to display their licences.  Also, under law it must be clear from a credit agreement that such is a moneylending agreement.  We have tried to improve transparency through making the registers available and being more upfront about the types of products on offer.  We do not necessarily want to promote one sector over another, particularly the moneylending sector.  We try to strike a balance.  However, there may be something to what is suggested by the Senator in terms of people being entitled to know when entering a premises that they are dealing with a moneylender.</p></speech>

I am not suggesting there is anything wrong with any of the companies of which I am aware.  As far as I am aware, they are licensed companies, some of which are operating from plush offices.  The fact that no name is displayed over the door undergrounds the business, whether licensed or unlicensed.  The names of such companies also needs to be looked into.  In some cases, the names suggest they are property companies and so on.  I am not sure of the extent of this particular problem.  A practising solicitor must state the purpose of his or her business on headed paper and on a plaque displayed outside the business premises.  If moneylending businesses were required by law to do likewise, it would be helpful.  It would also be of advantage to the licensed operations and would remove the perception that a particular business is dodgy and so on.</p><p>  Why are moneylending businesses closing?  I note some of them merging.  Is that because moneylending has now become big business?</p></speech>

A number of the smaller companies are struggling to make profits and they are reacting to this in different ways.  One reaction is to increase rates.  These companies need to be of a minimum size in order to make the business worth their while.  Many of them are relatively small and as such are not viable.  Another issue for them is the regulatory burden, including the annual licensing process with the Central Bank.  When we come across issues, we put them through the hoop.  For some companies, it is not worth their while.</p></speech>

I will cut to the chase.  The figures provided are disturbing.</p> <p>Mr. Sheridan stated:<blockquote><br />There has been some public discussion in this regard about introducing an industry-wide cap on the rates moneylenders can charge.  Lower interest rate ceilings could be ineffective and counterproductive in this regard and may result in excluding low income households that have repayment capacity, even at the high rates charged by licensed moneylenders.</blockquote>From what I can see, this is the poor man's bank with exorbitant interest rates.  To cut to the chase, people may have little choice other than to use it.  The annual percentage rate mentioned was between 23% and 188%, which is an incredible difference of 165%.  It goes up to 287%, which would leave 264% of a differential, which is even more incredible.</p><p> Has consideration been given to the cost of funding to these moneylenders and how they formulate their APR?  Typically, what would be the relevant APR for money borrowed from a credit union or other typical lenders?  I note in the survey with regard to the licensing process that moneylenders are effectively nationwide.  Of the 40 operators, 27 operate in all 25 districts.  Are they operating a cartel?</p></speech>

How could a moneylender charge nearly 300% in interest on a loan?  Mr. Sheridan has indicated that, in effect, all loans are repaid and many moneylenders are giving out cash reserves rather than money which they have borrowed.  How can some of these not make a profit?  If a model is to be built to lend money to people who cannot access it elsewhere by looking to make a profit, would it not be better to close the moneylenders and change the market in order that people can access money from institutions like credit unions or others where consumers would not pay crazy money?  It is a valid question.</p></speech>

Is this model flawed?  How can it be justified that these moneylenders - which for all intents and purposes are now the poor man's bank - charge up to 300% APR, when typical APR for a loan is between 7% and 10%?  Even credit cards charge approximately 19%.  The Central Bank is the custodian of this area so how is this allowed to happen?</p></speech>

They are offering new loans to people and, in a minority of cases, to people with existing loans.  Our concern is whether the loan is offered to keep the relationship going and the debt in place.  We are considering how to intervene more strongly in that area.</p></speech>

There is a perception that this is almost an underground activity, although it is licensed.  The fact that there are 360,000 clients means that this is a real phenomenon, and the numbers for market share would make a high street bank proud.  Mr. Sheridan is in the dock on this issue and my colleague has correctly prosecuted a number of issues.  The people who should really be in the dock today are in the credit union sector, as they have strayed far from the original purpose of their establishment.  Ms Nora Herlihy, a founder of the credit union from my constituency, would turn in her grave at what she would see today as the legitimate purpose of credit unions and how far they have moved from being the poor man's bank.  Moneylenders are the poor man's bank by default.  Regrettably, one credit union was bankrolling developers, and this happened the length and breadth of the country-----</p></speech>

If the Central Bank must account for its role in respect of licensing, it would be fair game to have the credit union movement representatives in here.  People need, in the sense of financial services, to get back to knitting, and this is what the credit union's core business was about.  It was about knowing their communities and providing credit where people could not get it elsewhere.  It was the poor man's bank.  Now the poor man's bank is being licensed by the Central Bank, charging 188% APR.  It is bordering on criminal, and the Central Bank is rightly in the dock in that regard because it is facilitating the process.  The people who are equally culpable are in the credit union movement.</p></speech>

I agree with his point about the credit unions being a real alternative.  To be fair to the credit unions, the most growth has taken place in the catalogue companies.  It is more difficult for credit unions to compete with that type of lending but I am not saying they could not do so.  Potential exists in the sector and research has shown, for example, that if a moneylender ceased to do business then 43% of people have said that they would approach a credit union.  Many people who use moneylenders already have relationships with credit unions and banks so there is a potential for credit unions to build on that situation.  The credit unions must examine their products and assess whether they can compete with the products offered by moneylenders.</p></speech>

The current legislation allows moneylenders to give top-up loans on existing debt where there are default payments but credit unions are exclusively precluded from doing so.  Is there a legislative difficulty in terms of regulations?  Can we make it easier for the credit union movement to compete in a realistic fashion in this business?</p></speech>

Moneylenders are prohibited from offering a new loan to a person and must give the full amount of the loan to the person.  They cannot reduce the amount by offsetting it against a loan already held by the person.  Moneylenders are not allowed to do so under law.  Whether they actually do it or not is an area of concern for us.</p></speech>

I wish to point out to members that if they believed that these extortionate rates bordered on criminality then they had the option to do something about it when I drafted legislation on behalf of Sinn F&eacute;in, when it was debated in the House and called for a cap to be put on interest rates.  A member of the committee has now blamed the credit union movement union but he and other Members decided not to impose a cap on moneylenders and have allowed for the practice of 287.72% APR to continue.  If one wants to point fingers then they should start by looking in the mirror and examine the role they play and the power they have, as Members of the Parliament, to do something about the matter.</p><p>  I shall now turn to the issue of a cap on moneylenders' rates.  As I have stated, my party is very clear on the issue.</p></speech>

Some 13 out of 27 EU member states have placed caps on moneylenders.  The only legal cap that exists at present has been placed on the credit union movement which has a cap of 12.68% APR.  Clearly, the credit union movement cannot compete with the other type of loans because it cannot offer APRs in excess of that rate.  If one wants riskier loans to be taken up by the credit union movement then the Central Bank must deal with the APR cap.</p><p>  Can Mr. Sheridan confirm there is no cap at this point in time and that it can only be done at the discretion of the Central Bank?  This time next year the Central Bank could approach us to inform us that it has a licensed moneylender operating at 400% APR.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The Central Bank has no statutory power to impose a market-wide cap on rates.  We examine, on a case-by-case basis, whether the rates are excessive or not but that is open to challenge.  That is our policy and the way that we apply it.</p></speech>

I argued that it should be set at 40%.  I know that is a lot higher than what the credit union movement suggested to the Minister for Finance three years ago.  Has the Minister for Finance or the Central Bank decided to carry out a proper analysis on the introduction of a statutory cap on moneylenders?  This is not fairytale stuff because it has happened in nearly half of all EU member states.  Is such an analysis being considered?  The arguments put forward by the Central Bank have been very light, to say the least.</p></speech>

I am not aware that progress has been made but we are open to assisting it by giving our expertise.</p><p>  In my opening statement I expressed concern about adopting a simple one cap fits all approach.  We believe that the approach that we are taking, in terms of assessing whether rates are excessive and applying that to different types of loans, terms, APRs and costs of credit, may be a better approach.  We are concerned about the impact a simple market-wide cap could have because it would be irreversible in terms of where people could go which brings us back to the point made about alternatives.</p></speech>

We should examine the legal cap on credit unions.  They could involve themselves more with the 360,000 customer base that moneylenders have at their disposal.  Does Mr. Sheridan view it as a dual approach strategy?</p></speech>

Even if one charges a very small amount of cost for credit, the APR could still be very high.  It depends on the term of the loan.  That factor would have to be taken into account.</p></speech>

Mr. Sheridan gave us a figure for the number of customers.  Therefore, I assume that there have been over 500,000 moneylender loans in the State over the past 12 months.  I have made that assumption based on the fact that Mr. Sheridan has said that there are 360,000 customers, 26% of whom are currently paying off at least two loans, and 6% have more than two loans.  That takes the figure up to about 500,000 loans by moneylenders in the past 12 months.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I am not talking about 360,000 loans but 360,000 customers and I shall return to the matter later.</p><p>  One of the largest moneylenders in the State is Provident.  The moneylenders are all listed and rates shown.  Mr. Sheridan mentioned that the highest APR rate licensed by the Central Bank has been granted to Provident.  He said that the maximum APR charged, including collection charges, is 287.72%.  A person can secure a loan of &euro;500 on the Internet within a couple of minutes.  If the loan is for the duration of a year he or she will pay as much as &euro;466.60 in costs for such credit.  If it is for half a year - which is a more likely term with Provident - the loan will cost &euro;228.75.  How can the Central Bank justify this situation?  We know from the survey the type of social class from which the majority of people who use these companies come.  The Central Bank has licensed one of the largest moneylenders in the State and left it with an ability to charge a person who borrows &euro;500 for a term of 12 months, the total sum of &euro;966.60.  How can the Central Bank justify such action?</p></speech>

There is no doubt that when one uses these loans, for a longer term, they are very costly.  We have tried to get a handle on the type of people who borrow from the likes of the firms mentioned by the Deputy.  We have tried to find out what the borrowers use the money for and its impact.  We have published the findings.  Some of the findings have surprised but that is what the consumers have told us.</p></speech>

We have graphs showing that 47% of people have loans for one to five years from the moneylender and that 38% are in hock to the moneylender for over five years.  These are not new revelations and it is clear that moneylenders licensed by the Central Bank to provide short-term money have these customers in their grip for a long period.  The Central Bank survey is not new; the one completed in 2007 showed similar patterns.  Nevertheless, the rate that allows the moneylender to have a profit of &euro;228.75 on a &euro;500 loan is unacceptable.</p></speech>

One of the focuses was on the issue of loans being so expensive.  To some extent, that is bearing fruit in that people who responded to the survey were generally aware that these were high-cost loans and they were aware of the cost they were paying.  It is not as if we have done nothing in dealing with these issues.  The process moneylenders are following in rolling over loans is one we are examining.</p></speech>

It has not reduced the rate through which moneylenders are screwing customers and it knows, through the most recent data, that moneylenders continue to have a grip on these individuals, with 38% having loans for over five years.</p><p>  Section 99 of the Consumer Credit Act is supposed to ban top-up loans.  It is very clear from the Central Bank survey that top-up loans continue to be given and that multiple loans to the same individual continue to be given.  Some 22% of people have more than one loan, some with the same financial provider.  How many investigations are ongoing into moneylenders and how many prosecutions have been taken against moneylenders in the past three years?</p></speech>

With regard to prosecutions, we have applied our role through either refusals of a renewal of a licence or taking action against individuals.  We have had a number of cases in which we managed to do this.</p></speech>

Today, the Central Bank confirmed the figure was 25%.  It is quite a big difference and I am surprised at the information.  I am glad that it has been corrected, but the written report should also be corrected.</p><p>  During the debate on Committee Stage of the Credit Reporting Bill I was pushing to have moneylenders come under the terms of the Credit Reporting Bill, but it has not happened.  In the Central Bank documents some 95% of moneylenders do not have access to the external credit history database to check the credit history of applicants.  The report states, "Regulation 11 of the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreements) Regulations 2010 requires a creditor to assess a customers&rsquo; creditworthiness on the basis of sufficient information, where appropriate obtained from the customer and, where necessary, on the basis of consultation of the relevant database".  Moneylenders are completely in breach of the spirit of the regulation and it is clear from the evidence in the report that only 5% are accessing the credit history database, with the rest having conversations with people on the doorstep.  Half of the people concerned are not asked for documentary proof that they are in employment or proof of their financial position.  With the deepest of respect to Mr. Sheridan, with whom I have engaged on moneylending practices and whistleblowers, the Central Bank has approached this sector with kid gloves.  This part of the report is evidence of that.</p></speech>

I am not here to defend the industry, but in determining whether something is excessive, we look at the cost of credit.  For these loans which are relatively small, borrowers look at how much they will have to pay in total, how much they will have to pay per &euro;100 borrowed.  They believe they can afford to repay it.  In those terms, we can understand why people use moneylenders.</p></speech>

I assume he talked to the MABS which has done a lot of work with the Traveller community on the reasons moneylending becomes a problem in that community.  Surely he has some appreciation of the reasons people need short-term loans and, at difficult times in their lives, they are wide open to being exploited by some of these guys.</p></speech>

To go back to the issue of those who need short-term loans, the suggestion from the witnesses is that they would resist an interest rate cap.  Surely anybody listening to this conversation or studying these figures would say that any interest rate that creeps up to 287% has to be challenged, controlled and driven down.  People are only going to engage with a regulated industry that they can trust and that they fundamentally believe will not exploit them.  I do not think the argument about the potential for driving people into the underground market holds much water.  Do the witnesses believe there is room for manoeuvre on this?  The legislative body of which we are all Members has a responsibility to help the witnesses out and we must take that responsibility seriously.  However, we are not in the business of allowing people to be exploited.  What we are doing here essentially is saying that it is very sad that Mrs. Murphy is being charged over 200% for a loan to get her through a devastating period in her life but, hey, that is just the way it is.  That seems to be the general consensus from the body politic and the Central Bank.</p></speech>

However, the point I am making is that there is potential for people to go to the illegal sector and that is why we are careful about how we regulate the sector.  Access must be a concern too.  I agree with the Deputy about the rates.  Would we like the rates to be lower?  Measured by APR purely, there is no doubt that they are high.  However, in terms of the role we play under the Act, the issue is whether they are excessive, and we do not believe they are.  We are not hanging too much on the findings from the research in terms of our approach to the sector.  What we are focusing on are issues such as why people are using moneylenders in a more long-term manner.  Using moneylenders for short-term loans or for emergency purposes is acceptable, but if people continue to use them at such high rates of interest, we need to find out what is going on there.  That is an area of concern for us.</p></speech>

The report is very comprehensive and I note that the researchers interviewed 508 people in order to get an understanding of the customer's point of view.  It would appear from the report that the typical person who borrows from a moneylender is likely to be a female with children who has her own house.  The amount of money that is typically borrowed is &euro;350 at a rate of 125%, which ends up costing &euro;580 after nine months.  That is written in black and white.  I have found that many of the people I deal with do not comprehend how money works when it comes to loans.  All they know is that they have a need for basic goods in their house, for which they borrow in a hand-to-mouth fashion.</p><p>  The report suggests that the overriding catalyst for borrowing money from moneylenders is convenience.  It is repugnant that as a society we permit people to go knocking on doors offering money.  It is licensed because it is something that is potentially damaging.  I believe in governance, institutions and the capacity to regulate people's lives at some level.  If the notion was floated that off-licence owners could call to people's houses offering them drink, there would be uproar.  </p><p>  The use of moneylenders by those in local authority houses has decreased since 2007.  Since the economic collapse, however, moneylenders have increased their business among those living in private housing.</p></speech>

The Government must clean up its act in this regard.  It is not fair that 360,000 people have borrowed from moneylenders, 78% of whom have missed payments and are subjected to people calling to their doors looking for money from them.  The critical point in the report is that 31% of people reported that they did not receive any rebate or refund for early repayment.  However, the report goes on to point out that "the right of withdrawal from a moneylending contract, the right to repay a loan early, the right to a reduction in the total cost of credit in the event of early repayment and the moneylender's obligation to assess creditworthiness" are enforced under the Consumer Credit Act of 1995 and also the European Communities (Consumer Credit Agreement) Regulations of 2010.  If borrowers are entitled to a break, how come 31% of them did not get a break?</p><p>  Banking institutions typically have access to credit ratings data.  A moneylender can call to a person's door and even if that person is under enormous financial pressure already, to the extent that he or she should not get any more loans, the moneylender can provide a loan.  Why is it that moneylenders can give out loans without checking an individual's creditworthiness?  If a person is already in hock to a moneylender and that same person goes to the local credit union looking for a car loan, how come the credit rating of that person does not reflect his or her true credit status?</p></speech>

As the Deputy has said, moneylenders are using relatively informal means to assess creditworthiness, but even within the scope of that they could be doing better in terms of assessing people's ability to repay and so forth.  The issue of people saying that they do not recall receiving a rebate is a real concern.  As the Deputy has said, there is a statutory right for a person who repays early to receive a rebate, and that is something that we want to look into further.</p></speech>

While the report is a great first step and includes a large number of conclusions on the sector, it does not make recommendations.  I am slightly confused by some aspects of the report.  For example, I do not understand how anyone who has any choice would ever borrow from a licensed moneylender.  It is barking mad to borrow money at an interest rate of 280% instead of 10%.  The report appears to make conflicting statements.  On page 9 we learn that 5% of the interviewees cited being refused credit elsewhere as a reason for contacting a moneylender.  On page 21, however, we read that the majority of the sample stated they had been refused credit.  Similarly, 84% of interviewees indicated they understood the costs.  Perhaps the Central Bank will follow up on this finding because while I believe that was the finding, I do not for one moment believe 84% of borrowers understood the costs, particularly relative to alternative sources of loans.  Moreover, as Deputy Pearse Doherty noted, the majority of the loans are not for short periods as 85% of respondents indicated they had been borrowing for more than one year.  What is the Central Bank's top two or three recommendations, especially for Members of the Oireachtas?  Based on the evidence available to it, why are people using licensed moneylenders when they have other options?  Is the reason they do not understand the costs?</p></speech>

What the research has found and what we have seen elsewhere is that they do so through family and tradition.  Why would somebody ever use a moneylender?  If one's family has a tradition of doing so or one's neighbours have been borrowing from moneylenders, that partially explains the reason.  One of the findings was also that people found moneylenders convenient when looking for money to purchase goods.  As to whether I agree with that or why they do not borrow from credit unions, these are issues for us to consider.</p><p>  We should not get carried away and conclude that everybody understands the costs associated with licensed moneylenders.  While people report that they understand the costs, that is different from really understanding them.  This issue is connected to the length of time people have been using moneylenders.  It is not only the case that the loans are longer term but that the relationship is longer term and could involve a series of shorter-term loans, rather than everyone taking out longer term loans.  We are following up on this issue. </p><p>  To address the Deputy's question on recommendations, the question as to whether the cost of these loans is excessive is the biggest issue for the Central Bank.  We have been up-front and taken a position on the matter, although people will take a different view.  If the issue is being looked at, we will need to consider its implications, particularly in terms of the need to avoid upsetting financial inclusion and ensuring alternatives are available.  While the word "recommendation" may be too strong in this regard, the Central Bank is looking at issues such as the continued use of loans and the issue of whether creditworthiness assessments are sufficiently robust to avoid circumstances in which a person cannot afford the repayments.</p></speech>

Moneylenders cause considerable concern in communities.  My experience of them differs somewhat from the experience suggested by the report.  I have met many people who took out loans from moneylenders and the only information they received was the figure for the weekly repayment.  They did not understand the interest rate or the consequences of non-payment or building up arrears on their loans.  For this reason, they repeatedly top up their loans.  I am concerned by the figures showing that 62% of borrowers are females and most are from the lowest socioeconomic group as these suggest borrowers are trying to provide for their families.  Sometimes desperate people do desperate things and sign up to things they do not understand.</p><p>  The report states 50% of customers did not recall the moneylender assessing their ability to repay, 6% could not remember and of those who were assessed, 41% indicated the assessment took the form of a discussion.  This shows that no real effort is being made to obtain evidence to show the borrowers can afford the loans.  This is a serious problem.  What steps is the Central Bank taking to address the issue?  Moneylenders should have a duty of care to their customers and should satisfy themselves that the loans are affordable.  I am familiar with many cases of loans being provided for people who could not afford them.</p><p>  From listening to the delegates, some people may conclude that the Central Bank is taking a softly-softly approach to moneylenders.  Is there anything in current legislation that is preventing the Central Bank from doing its job properly?</p><p>  Having worked in a credit union, I can attest that credit unions have been engaging in an information campaign for many years under the slogan "Keep the Wolves from the Door".  The campaign was specifically targeted at moneylenders.  The problem credit unions have is that Central Bank regulatory restrictions prevent them from lending to those who are being driven into the hands of moneylenders.  They cannot provide top-up loans or loans for people who are in arrears.  This results in people deciding to borrow from moneylenders.  Credit unions must turn away people they want to help and serve.</p><p>  Of the 360,000 customers of moneylending services, how many are members of a credit union?  It would be interesting to discover how many of them were refused loans by their credit unions on account of the restrictions imposed by the Central Bank on credit unions.  This issue needs to be addressed by the Registrar of Credit Unions and the Central Bank.  If they were to act, it may not be necessary to change the legislation.  The inability of many credit union customers to obtain top-up loans is a major issue which needs to be addressed.  If credit unions were allowed to do what they want to do, the world would be a different place.</p></speech>

The legislation requires an annual licensing process.  While this is definitely a burden in terms of cost, it also imposes discipline on the sector.  In terms of the powers of the Central Bank to intervene, we have used our powers to refuse licences.  Firms are free to challenge such decisions through an appeals tribunal and some are doing so.  The powers the Central Bank requires to impose discipline in the sector are, therefore, available.</p><p>  In terms of restrictions on credit unions, it is a concern for us, in the context of the moneylender sector, that credit union loans are not available, if one likes, to borrowers.  However, the Registrar of Credit Unions spoke as recently as last weekend on the issue of restrictions on credit unions.  She is conscious of the issue.  The restrictions are largely applied in the area of commercial lending, although I am aware of other restrictions on individual credit unions.</p></speech>

A borrower who is in arrears will not be given a top-up loan and if a loan is restructured, the borrower will not be given another loan for perhaps one year.  People cannot borrow to pay for everyday emergencies, for example, a funeral or vehicle repairs.  The credit unions are being prevented from lending money in many of these circumstances and that must change.</p></speech>

I am looking at the 360,000 people.  That is almost the population of County Cork and a significant number of the population.  Leading on from what Deputy Donnelly said, the report has provided some data in this area.  I do not believe the 360,000 people can all be put into one silo, as it were, because they fall into different categories and have different needs and presentations.  Some may be informed of the interest rates and some may not but the fact is that 360,000 citizens are availing of a credit route which is the most expensive and penalising and presents the greatest risk of perpetual debt.  The Central Bank has carried out a report which provides a certain level of insight and the some of the questions here give us a certain level of insight as well.  What action will be taken by Mr. Sheridan and his department on foot of this report and what he has found out?  I am not talking about recommendations or findings but the action that will be taken.  We have established this afternoon that the interest rate parameters are set by the Central Bank.  The licensed institutions may be like football teams but the Central Bank is like FIFA or UEFA.  It sets the rules and decides when they are offside and onside.  What specific actions will the Central Bank take on foot of its own report?</p></speech>

We are interpreting the legislation in a way that allows us to do that and we intend to continue to do that.  We will also be alert to whether any of these providers are trying to come into the market without obtaining a licence in the first place.</p><p>  The creditworthiness assessment issue has been raised a few times today. That is an issue on which we have followed up with the industry, but it strays into the area of the credit register and such areas.  We would be conscious of that.</p><p>  In terms of other issues, we will investigate the practice of offering loans to people who have an existing loan in order to offset some of their existing loan.  That brings in a few issues such as keeping the person tied up with the moneylender and making them less likely to go somewhere else if these loans become longer-term.  That is one issue we will investigate.  We have started that process and it is probably a priority for us.</p></speech>

I agree with him that one has to find an alternative.  The credit union model is structured, community-based and has the skill set.  The problem with the structure of that model is the restrictions on it.  It would be very informative if the Central Bank, working with the registrar, would commit to carrying out a review, taking into account the moneylending area, because it could be restructured in a way that would end the way the credit unions function.  Clearly, people are being driven into a situation where they have to go to moneylenders.  If a person has no alternative but to go to a moneylender and he or she is being charged nearly 300% interest, that is exploitation in any man's language.  Will Mr. Sheridan commit to looking at that issue?</p></speech>

There are some very simple things.  When a person makes repayments on borrowings, a certain amount goes into savings every week.  I do it myself as a credit union member.  Those two sums have to be separate in two different accounts.  There are many positive suggestions coming from the regulator's office.  Is there a possibility that some of what is coming from that office is creating the difficulties we are discussing and, if so, should some dialogue take place between the credit unions?  Maybe that regulation has to be put in place.</p></speech>

I will definitely speak to the registrar.  Obviously, I cannot commit on her behalf as to what we might do.  To reiterate, I have discussed with her the restrictions being imposed.  I am aware the committee has raised a more specific point about people in arrears who are with a credit union and cannot get additional loans.  The restrictions have been targeted at the higher value loans so that they are not hitting the smaller value loans.  At least in theory the registrar is trying to ensure that is not causing problems in terms of moving for people who are with moneylenders.  That is one of the objectives. The specific issue raised today is another angle to that, and I will discuss it with her in terms of what we can do.</p></speech>

For example, the insolvency service is keen that people have access to what Deputy Heather Humphreys referred to as emergency credit for a funeral, a car or whatever.  That is fine if one is in the big game and one is in the insolvency service, but if one is broke and living on subsistence or from pay cheque to pay cheque, one is in difficulty all the time.  When an emergency pops up, there has to be some route.  Credit union managers are saying to me they need a degree of flexibility where they can give Mr. and Mrs. O'Sullivan &euro;1,000 to change the buggy or whatever, that they can step out of the regulation, as it were, in some structured environment that recognises such people still have debts to pay.  This is an emergency facility and should not just be available to the insolvency service.</p></speech>

Frightening figures of indebtedness are being created by people through gambling.</p> <p>I wish to impress a point upon the delegation and I think they should look at it.  The convenience factor is the overarching element that I do not agree with.  That is why people often decide to use moneylenders rather than go to the credit unions.  As everyone at the table would agree, we should always beware of people pressing their wares and coming to doors, because they do not always live up to their undertakings.  Can the Central Bank stop or prohibit lenders from calling to people's houses and providing access to money under the Consumer Credit Act?  If we could go down that route, it would be a starting point.  The deputation can be assured of a commitment from myself and some of my colleagues in the committee who are of the same opinion that we need to examine this and get the convenience element sorted as well as the cap on interest rates.</p></speech>

One additional measure relates to unsolicited contacts and people calling to doors.  Lenders are precluded.  A moneylender is not allowed to call to someone's door out of the blue.  The question arose earlier about how people are going to moneylenders.  The issue is that it is through referrals, for example, a family member suggesting to a person that he should give so-and-so a shout.  Then, they must identify that they have been referred from someone else.</p></speech>

The people Deputy Humphreys is talking about are being destroyed.  We see from the data that the amounts add up to a great deal, it could be 85% of a loan over a year.  This is potentially a major area.</p><p>  I offer one thought that is halfway between where we are now and introducing a maximum cap on a given annual percentage rate of charge, APR.  My suggestion is to introduce a cap on the total amount that can be paid back.  Let us consider an example where a person borrows &euro;500 and there is an APR of 100%.  Perhaps that is fine or perhaps it is not.  The people who get caught are the people who end up paying &euro;500 every year and who never pay the capital down.</p><p>  I call on the deputation to take away for consideration the idea of introducing a cap on that scenario to the effect that a moneylender may be able to charge 150% APR on a loan up to &euro;400, whatever that is.  Then, once the borrowers have paid back the moneylender 300%, regardless of whether the moneylender has got any of its capital back, that is it and the moneylender has got its sizeable return.  If we could introduce such a cap, it would satisfy some of the people who would argue - I do not agree with them - around liberal markets, that people should be able to borrow money if they wish and for social inclusion and so on.  It would end the problem Deputy Humphreys talked about because they would lose interest.  If a person was in arrears and only paying half the interest, once a person has paid back 300% of the capital, for example, then the moneylender could be gone and would not get any more.  By tomorrow morning that would stop people being trapped and clearly many people are trapped.  I call on the deputation to take that away for consideration.</p></speech>

With a moneylending loan, the moneylender can only ever recover the total cost of credit from the outset, no matter how long it takes a borrower to repay.  If a borrower falls into arrears, he or she does not keep paying interest on an overall sum.  The borrower will only ever have to repay the amount of money that he or she contracted to pay at the start of the contract.</p></speech>

In other words, there is 100% interest and a one-year loan.  If, at the end of year 1, all I have paid back is &euro;500, is Mr. Murphy suggesting I need not pay any more interest on that loan?  There is no chance of that.</p></speech>

We are discussing a cap.  The problem is that it still will not work.  The initial rate is exorbitant and therein lies the weakness.  The problem is that ordinary people are chasing down money and taking money that they simply cannot afford, but they have no alternative.  The main point that arose was made by Mr. Sheridan, namely, it is well and good and we must adjudicate what is before us, but the issue is the alternatives.  That is the challenge.</p></speech>

It is 287%.  That is the existing cap.  People are suggesting there should be a cap put in place but at present the cap is 287%.  The question is whether that is acceptable.</p><p>  I thank Mr. Sheridan, Mr. Murphy and Mr. Kincaid for appearing before the committee and for the briefing and the discussion.  Certainly, it was very informative and, I imagine, a topic we will be returning to again.</p></speech>

Again, it was in the same minutes and related to the suspension of the committee.  I am not asking for any decision or discussion now but the Chairman might give some consideration to the committee continuing.  It continues if the Senators leave so it should continue if Deputies leave or there could be a pairing arrangement.  There might be instances where you could not continue it because of the nature of the topic but there are times when we could continue and the Chairman should look at that because it is a bit discourteous to people who attend the meetings at their own time and expense to have to wait around for half an hour while votes are taking place.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that sometimes, we are caught with the T&aacute;naiste's itinerary and the time at which he is available so that is why we have to push back meetings to 3.30 p.m. or 4.30 p.m. and it then clashes with our own parliamentary party meeting.

I know we were previously given the response by the T&aacute;naiste which is, of course, welcome but what I was looking for were the actual reports sent by the centre to our consulate and those sent by our consulate to Dublin.  Given the fact that we give it $260,000, we are entitled to find out what went wrong in that incident that was so publicised and what has been done to rectify the situation so that it would not arise again.</p></speech>

I am delighted that we are joined by Mr. Joseph Nugent, director of passport services at the Passport Office, and his colleagues, Ms Fiona Penollar and Ms Siobhan Watters.  We are fast approaching spring and people are beginning to think about their summer holidays.  Those who intend to travel abroad obviously require passports and members will no doubt have experience of being approached by constituents at the last minute before their planned departure to seek assistance with problems they have encountered with their passport applications.  As the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade discussed the Estimates for the Passport Office at last week's meeting of the Select Committee on Foreign Affairs, it is a subject with which we are familiar.  We are aware of the pressure which the office faces during the summer period, when it has to process thousands of passports per week.  We appeal to people to consider renewing their passports during January and February, which is a quiet time of the year.  I commend the office on its new arrangement whereby appointments can be made to deal with non-emergency passport applications.  That system is working very well for most people and we are not encountering as many problems as we did in the past.  I compliment the staff of the office for the work they do.</p><p>  The committee visited Balbriggan two years ago to see at first hand how the new passports are processed.  A passport is a valuable document and it is complicated to produce.  The passport has been improved with new painted pictures as a security measure.  I am delighted that the passports include a picture of the world famous Cliffs of Moher.</p></speech>

I am joined by my colleagues Fiona Penollar, who heads the Molesworth Street office, and Siobhan Walters, who also works in the Molesworth Street office.</p><p>  The environment in which Irish passports issue has changed enormously over the past decade.  In 1995 the passport service issued approximately 250,000 passports.  This number doubled over the next five years to just over 500,000 and by a further 20% to 600,000 in 2010.  In 2013, over 631,000 passports issued to Irish citizens around the world.  The same period has witnessed major developments in the legislative landscape.  The Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 changed the nature of citizenship rights, while the Passport Act 2008 is the first primary legislation governing the issuance of Irish passports.</p><p>  The period has also seen the proliferation in the use of passports over and above the travel document arena.  The Irish passport has taken the position as the trusted national identity document and is used in all aspects of life, from school registration to matters of probate, and from access to bars to supporting applications to open bank accounts.  As a result the passport service has had to balance measures to protect against identity theft and child abduction on one hand, with easy to use application procedures on the other.</p> <p>The application processes have therefore been designed to protect our customers.  At the same time the passport service has met the fiscal challenges of the period.  Last year, in comparison to 2009, the passport service issued 60,000 more passports with over 10% fewer staff and a 90% lower overtime bill.  I would like to publicly acknowledge today that this has been achieved by the dedication of my colleagues to deliver a first class service to Irish citizens.</p><p> I am also pleased to state that the international reputation of the Irish passport and issuance processes remains high.  Ireland was recently ranked joint sixth of countries whose citizens are affected the least by visa restrictions.  We probably all remember the long queues experienced by citizens at certain embassies in Dublin when visas were required.  Visa-free travel is something we can never take for granted and something we must seek to protect for the sake of all Irish citizens.</p><p> Last year, the passport service was in the position to assist over 631,000 citizens in obtaining an Irish passport.  As a result, the passport service is one of the biggest providers of public services across the Civil Service, and is certainly the largest direct contact point between the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and Irish citizens, most particularly the primary interaction between the State and Irish citizens resident off the island.  More passports have issued in the last two years than at any other time in the history of the State.</p><p> The passport service is a demand-driven organisation with major seasonal variations.  Almost 50% of all passport applications are received in the four months April to July.  We seek to meet this seasonal demand through the recruitment of additional temporary staff, most taken from the live register.  This year 160 temporary clerical officers will be engaged, with the first commencing work in a couple of weeks' time.  Notwithstanding the best efforts to plan in advance for seasonal pressures, spikes in demand can still occur.  Last year, May and July saw such spikes with approximately 10,000 additional applications received in each month over previous years.  Inevitably this can result in some short delays in passport turnaround.  As a result, we continue to advise that citizens apply well in advance of travel.</p><p> Almost 90% of all passport applications within the State are now made through the Passport Express service.  This service is available at over 1,000 post offices around the country.  From the start of July last year, it was decided that passport applications submitted through the ordinary post channel would no longer be accepted, with customers referred to the Passport Express service.  This decision was made reflecting that over 90% of passport applications submitted through the ordinary post channel were either inaccurate or incomplete on arrival.  In comparison, only 10% of Passport Express applications posed similar difficulties.  Regarding applications from citizens resident overseas, approximately 40,000 passports are issued by the Irish Passport Office in London to citizens resident in the UK, with a further 40,000 passports issued by all other overseas missions.  Over the past five years the highest issuing Irish missions have been New York, Canberra, San Francisco, Sydney and Pretoria.  Ottawa is sixth on that list.</p><p> Almost 250,000 passports issued to minors last year.  The changes in citizenship law resultant from the enactment of the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004 have made the processing of these applications much more complicated in many cases.  Furthermore, the legal obligations on the passport service to recognise the rights of all guardians is not often appreciated or understood by citizens.  Last year we received on average two new parental objections to the issuance of a passport to a child per week.  We are currently managing almost 2,500 open cases of parental objection.</p><p> The annualised cost of an Irish passport for an adult is &euro;8.  This fee has remained unchanged since 2009.  The fee compares with approximately &euro;8.60 in the UK, &euro;8.15 in the USA, &euro;8.55 in New Zealand, &euro;11.50 in Canada, &euro;8.80 in France and &euro;8 in Germany.  In June 2013 the Passport Office in Molesworth Street moved to a service whereby customers book, via a simple web based system, guaranteed time slots before travelling to the office.  The Chairman mentioned this change.  The public have responded very well to this new arrangement.  Customers are now in and out having lodged their application in approximately ten minutes. The change has removed the necessity to queue for many hours, of unknown duration, and early in the morning outside, often in inclement weather.  The introduction of this service has allowed the office to extended the public opening hours of the office from 9.30 a.m. to 4.30 p.m. to 9.00 a.m. to 5 p.m.</p><p> Priority in the system is given to those with urgent travel needs, travelling in three to ten days, with the majority of appointments available to those who fit into this category.  Over 200 people per day availed of this service through the height of the summer in 2013.  It is intended the service will operate in the Cork office later this year.  The passport service continues to provide the service of turning around applications on the same day in cases where a passport is required for travel necessitated by an emergency such as the death or illness of a family member.  However, at his appearance before the committee last week the T&aacute;naiste invited members to consider and propose options whereby this service could extend to others who have found that their passport has expired and they must travel at very short notice.</p><p> We are committed to identifying a suitable option in this regard, but I would not like to underestimate the challenges to deliver on this commitment.  On a number of days in summer 2012, over 600 people visited the Molesworth Street office looking for passports to travel at very short notice.  Changes resultant from the introduction of the appointment service have already allowed 200 people per day to avail of this express arrangement.  However, I am very conscious that there remains a gap in service provision and some people do find themselves in difficulty, needing a passport within hours.  Extending the service must recognise the necessity to protect against identity theft and child abduction, including abduction by a parent, and must also maintain the integrity of the issuance process.  It will be necessary to recognise the resource implications of any new proposals.  Additionally, it is vital to find a mechanism whereby the applications of those who have applied in good time are not, as a consequence, delayed.  I look forward to hearing the views from the committee in this regard.</p><p> A high point for the passport service in 2013 was the launch of a new passport book design with enhanced security features.  The images used are representative of aspects of the Irish landscape and Irish culture.  Over 100,000 of these new books are already in circulation and there has been a very warm reaction to the design, especially from Irish citizens resident overseas.  The book was designed and produced in Ireland, won through a competitive tendering process by a consortium of Irish companies with design work delivered by a number of young Irish designers.</p><p> I have tried to cover some of the major issues for passport issuance in Ireland.  I thank the Chairman and the committee for taking such an interest in passport issuance.  The visit of the committee to the Balbriggan facility was very much appreciated.  I welcome the opportunity the answer any questions you may have.</p></speech>

When I first became a Deputy I went to the Passport Office.  People were frustrated, and the staff were being abused.  I felt sorry for the people behind the glass windows there because the arrangements were different then.  It takes time to process a passport application, as Mr. Nugent said, particularly to prevent fraud and false identities.  We thank Mr. Nugent for bringing in those new arrangements.  Obviously they are working well.  The passport service is still trying to deal with the situation where a person requires a non-emergency passport at short notice, particularly those going on holidays.  We all have to come up with a solution there.  If the passport service receives 600 such applications per day that is very difficult to deal with in peak season.  I will take questions from members.  Could members ask questions rather than make statements?</p></speech>

I have read it and it is very clear and paints a positive picture of the Passport Office, which I am glad to obtain because I have been a critic of it in the past, particularly of what went on at one stage during a campaign against Government policy.  It is good to see what Mr. Nugent has here.  I have some questions.  First, I understand there was an operating surplus for 2012 of &euro;6.55 million.  Could Mr. Nugent tell us the total revenue and expenditure of the Passport Office?  The cost of producing a passport is &euro;52.64 and the average revenue is &euro;63.  That &euro;63 struck me as low.  Could Mr. Nugent explain it?  There is an &euro;80 fee for Passport Express, while other fees are &euro;93.  Maybe it is because 40% of applicants are children and there is a lower fee for them.  Could Mr. Nugent clarify that?</p><p>  My second question is on the numbers employed.  Mr. Nugent said that in 1995 250,000 passports were issued, that doubled over the next five years and it is now 631,000.  It seems high considering our population level.  Maybe there was a rush and it is a blip, I do not know.  Could Mr. Nugent tell us how the numbers went?  He said he has 10% fewer staff in recent years.  Could he please tell us the staff numbers between 1995, 2000 and the present, if he has that?</p> <p>I appreciate that Mr. Nugent might not have that information today.</p><p> It is very interesting that the passport is now being used as a national identity.  I was in recently a country where it was a prerequisite to present a passport in order to get a ballot paper when voting.</p><p> I welcome that overtime has been reduced by 90% since 2009 even though demand has increased.  How was this achieved?  Is it a product of better controls within the Passport Service?  Is there a lesson there for the rest of the public service where there is an issue regarding the overall cost of overtime.  Some people attribute it to a lack of good management within certain sectors.  The overtime reduction is an indication that things may have significantly improved.</p><p> I welcome the flexibility the Passport Service has shown in dealing with demand by recruiting temporary staff.  Has any consideration been given to contracting out the service particularly in the peak period leading up to the summer?  If so what was the result of any assessment in that regard?  Could any savings be effected by doing so?</p><p> Regarding passports for children, I note Mr. Nugent's comments on the Irish Nationality and Citizenship Act 2004.  I fully appreciate the safeguards that are required.  He said that it is more complicated as a result of the provisions of the Act, which might be necessary.  From his experience, would Mr. Nugent like to see changes in any aspect of that legislation in order to simplify the passport application process without in any way diminishing the very safeguards that need to be in place in order to protect children?  In replying, Mr. Nugent might outline what some of those safeguards are.</p><p> I join the Chairman in welcoming the guaranteed appointment times for people travelling to the Passport Office.  It shows customer-service awareness on the office's part, which is good.</p><p> Regarding the backlog that builds up at certain times of the year, is there any advertising campaign in order to encourage people to spread their passport applications more evenly across the year.  That would have the benefit of bringing in additional revenue from people who have not thought about getting a passport and might do so as a matter of practice.  It might also even out the workload, which would benefit the Passport Service.</p><p> Mr. Nugent has invited us to give comments on the emergency passport facility, which is a very good facility.  The Chairman has also commented on it.  Apart from emergencies for bereavement or whatever, there are cases where a businessperson needs a passport urgently or perhaps a person might have flights booked and for whatever reason cannot find his or her passport.  That was something one could tap into from the Oireachtas.  On one occasion somebody rang me on a Saturday night and by 7 a.m. on Sunday that person had a passport, which was an exceptional service.  In the past Oireachtas Members had access to fast-tracking in cases such as the one I mentioned, a facility which I believe no longer exists.  That was changed a number of years ago and I believe it is a mistake.  The public have a right to look to people, who are elected to Parliament, to resolve difficulties and we should have the capacity to do that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.594" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014012900005#D00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses.  Some of my questions may seem silly to the witnesses, but I am asking them because I do not know the system.  In my first term as a Deputy, the system for Oireachtas Members was in place and it was helpful.  One problem is that in the majority of cases people are coming to us as the last resort.  They believe we have a magic phone number and can ring somebody to get it all sorted.  As I am my party's foreign affairs spokesperson, they believe I have even more such phone numbers and that I have the ear of the T&aacute;naiste, etc.  It would be helpful if there was some sort of direct line or someone we could contact directly.  While I accept it was abused in the past, it should be looked at again as part of this review.</p><p>  People often ask Members to sign a passport application form.  One of the stipulations is that it needs to be stamped.  In some cases people do not need to stamp it, but in some cases people have rung back to say it was not legitimate because it was not stamped.  I have also had this with MLAs in the North.  As anybody could get a stamp made in this day and age, I wonder if it is really necessary.  There is also a difficulty with the requirement to insert a telephone number.  The best number on which to get me is my mobile phone number, which is probably true for the majority of people.  I can insert the office number but I can only be contacted during office hours.  In some cases officials have rung me back to say using a mobile number is not permissible.</p><p>  People the North praise the passport express service, which I believe is available in 15 places in the North.  However, there is no such service in Dungannon, which is a big town, and the people there would like to have it.  Given that the Passport Service knows the areas where there is demand for passports, would it be possible to expand to other locations in the North.</p><p>  Many people want to use the Irish form of their name and there seem to be difficulties with that in the North and also in the South.  It is necessary to prove the applicant uses the Irish form of his or her name but there are difficulties in that regard.  Historically in the North there would have been difficulties with people using the Irish form of the name.  They would not have had it on other documentation, but perhaps for security reasons or colloquially they are known by such names.  Perhaps Mr. Nugent might be able to address the matter.</p><p>  Mr. Nugent has referred to people living outside Ireland in places such as London.  However, for those living in Britain the further a person is from London the more difficult it is particularly in emergency situations.  For those living in Liverpool, Birmingham or Scotland that contact is harder.  Is there any equivalent to the passport express facility available in Britain or are there discussions on introducing such a facility?</p><p>  Certain individuals may require a certified copy of a passport.  I know of a person who was advised that only a solicitor could authorise a certified passport.  He was told he could not get it from the Department directly because the Department was not in a position to declare it was a genuine document even though the document came directly from the Department.  He had to get a solicitor to authorise it and go back to the Department, and it ended up costing him &euro;120 for three copies.  That may be somewhat unusual but it is still a problem.</p><p>  There is difficulty in accessing services outside normal business hours, particularly at the weekends.  In some cases Deputies might contact the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade number, particularly in emergency situations.  Sometimes we find ourselves in a queue and there is no direct number.  It is always at the wrong time - when people are off or on a bank holiday.  Can anything be done in that regard?</p><p>  Mr. Nugent spoke about the design of the passport, incorporating a quotation from James Orr, but there are no images from the North.</p> <p>Why is the PPS number not on the passport?  It is a person's identifier.  Commentators say that whereas one's name is important to oneself, in the case of one's passport it is becoming less important than one's generic number, biometrics, etc.  Could there be greater flexibility in that regard?  This also refers to the Irish matters.</p></speech>

I must get a lesson from Senator Walsh as to how to go about this because he was more successful that I was.  Somebody I knew had a passport stolen on a Saturday.  It would have been on the system that the passport was not out of date and there would have been an immediate police report when it was discovered lost.  The person was due to travel on the Monday and there was no accommodation forthcoming from the Passport Service.  Mr. Nugent stated that there are 600 cases that do not come under emergencies and I wonder has he identified what some of those 600 are.  I accept Deputy Crowe's point that there have been abuses with TDs in the past when there was a direct line, but there are genuine cases.  The case I mentioned was one.  The flight fare was lost, as was the hotel accommodation because it was too soon to get any sort of refund on it.  It cost quite an amount.  If there had been some way to have even paid a nominal fee to have got a passport quickly, in this case which I knew was genuine, where the passport was stolen and it was reported immediately, the details would have been there.  I wonder how Mr. Nugent will look at those cases.</p></speech>

It is much better in that Mr. Nugent will not have to answer questions twice.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.598" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014012900006#E00400"><p>I thank the visitors for their presentations.</p><p>  There has been a considerable improvement in the administration of passports over the past number of years.  I note the demand is greater and it is where a member of the public finds himself or herself in an emergency that we must plan for to a greater extent that we have.</p><p>  Occasionally, a constituent, when everything else is ready for the holiday, will seek assistance with a lost or out-of-date passport for their youngest child and will be asked why they did not think of that beforehand.  That is not the issue.  The issue is that it is not there now.  That is how we must try to look at how to deal with it.  Generally speaking, it has been possible to do a certain amount.  There may be a case, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned, where it could be done better.  That is not a criticism of the staff.  It is a criticism of the system.</p><p>  A couple of years ago, I had a situation where somebody arrived in this country to attend a funeral and their passport went out of date when they were here.  They did not have time to do anything when they arrived.  They had an Irish passport but they live in the United Kingdom.  We tried everything and failed to get them a passport.  They travelled over on the ferry and got the passport in the embassy in the United Kingdom in time for their flight which could not have been done otherwise.  My point is it should be possible to unravel the wires to such an extent that it would be possible to meet the person's requirements.  We did all that needed to be done in the case of an emergency and bereavement, and it did not happen.  The system has improved since then and that is to be acknowledged.</p><p>  Another matter I wanted to mention quickly is that of children's passports.  This relates in most cases to immigrants or non-nationals.  There are a quite a number of cases where the child has a passport and the parents do not and the determination of the parents' eligibility for naturalisation is still pending where the passports have been withdrawn.  The grounds on which the passports are withdrawn are that the parent at the time of issue of the child's passport did not have an entitlement to residency in the State.  The problem is that this causes confusion.  The passport is already in place and it is there.  I do not know why this still happens.  There have been quite a number of such cases.  I am not objecting to the granting of the passport to the children.  The parents may have been here for ten years and for various reasons, they have not been naturalised.  Ten years is a long time and one may have three or four children in that period.  A number of the children in a family could have an Irish passport and the others not.  That is the part that causes the problem for the parent, both from the point of view both of identification and from the point of view of travelling to see their grandparents, parents or whatever the case may be.</p><p>  My last question is one I have raised previously.  In a diplomatic passport, for some unknown reason the description of profession in all other cases is correct.  If one is a Senator, it is clear enough, "Seanad&oacute;ir".  I am not sure whether they call one a Senator or Seanad&oacute;ir in the English version.  My point is that English, French and Irish are the three languages covered.  In the Irish version, it states "Teachta D&aacute;la" or "Seanad&oacute;ir".  In the French version, it states the correct version, "Member of Parliament", "Senator", whatever the case may be.  In the English version, as far as I can recall, it states "Teachta D&aacute;la" for a Deputy and, as far as I can recall, "Seanad&oacute;ir" for a Senator - it is a while since I was in the Seanad.  It certainly states, "Teachta D&aacute;la".  I cannot understand how the English version should be, "Teachta D&aacute;la".  It should be, "Member of Parliament", because the French version states, "Member of Parliament" - that is the translation.  Either it is in French or it is not.</p></speech>

Nobody kicks up a row about it, but I cannot understand it.  I have been inquiring about this for years.  On one occasion somebody cynically asked was I wishing to change it, and "Yes" is the answer.

If I included the previous year again, we would be up to nearly the number of the population.  Surely everybody in Ireland does not possess a passport.  For a country of 4.5 million, and, say, the few in Northern Ireland who would wish to carry an Irish passport as against a British passport, how could there be so many acquiring passports in one year?  These seem remarkably large numbers.</p><p>  My second question, and the route I want to go, may not be relevant to the Passport Service.  It may be relevant to the Department of Justice and Equality, but Mr. Nugent might comment.  We have been assaulted in verbal terms by politicians in Latvia who suggested that we were facilitating Latvian women in getting married here and obtaining Irish passports for in the main Pakistani partners, as against lovers, for the day.  I understand from reading newspaper reports that there will be a revision of the methodology used for the recognition of marriages that are occurring, apparently, amongst other places, in embassies in Ireland, and the question of marriages of convenience for money or whatever.</p> <p> On that issue, have the Latvians a case to be complaining about Ireland?  Given the supremacy of the document and given that the Irish passport is the most valuable document any citizen can carry and the integrity of that person and the State is recognised in this piece of paper, can Mr. Nugent, as the head of the Passport Service, guarantee that there have been no further abuses or passports issued illegally to false claimants?</p><p> It seems that in the past our passport was easy to duplicate or obtain fraudulently in so far as the security services of Israel and the United States of America used forged Irish passports in carrying out assassinations on political opponents throughout the world.  Can Mr. Nugent tell me now that our biometric system is almost incapable of being subject to forgery in so far as anything can be 100% foolproof?</p><p> This Government prides itself on having created 60,000 new citizens of the State in the past three years mainly comprising former immigrants or former refugees from 120 countries.  Is Mr. Nugent happy that the systems are robust enough that those who are recognised for passport eligibility are fully vetted and is it the Garda National Immigration Bureau which ratifies the authenticity of a person of non-Irish nationality when he or she applies for a passport?</p></speech>

I do not have the figure to hand but I will revert with it in due course.  As I stated, the average revenue received per passport in 2012 was &euro;63.  That has increased, from &euro;59.85 in 2011, &euro;54.65 in 2010 and &euro;55.32 in 2009.  There has been a gradual increase in the average revenue per book produced, but I will revert with the total figure.</p><p>  As regards an explanation for the &euro;63 figure, the Senator himself answered the question in that the balance between children's passports and adult passports, and other revenue, such as the additional charge for lodging an application at the counter, for example, emergency fees, have an impact on the total amount.  However, it is primarily related to the balance and mix of adult and child passports in that area.  That is why the figure is not on the higher side.  I guess, if we are charging &euro;26.50 for a child passport and &euro;80 for an adult, one can see the numbers that are there.  We issue, as I stated, approximately 0.25 million passports to children during the year and it is through that difference that the revenue figure occurs.</p><p>  In terms of staffing levels in the period, in 2009 the total staffing complement of permanent staff was in the order of 340, with a further 140 temporary staff taken on at that time.  Last year the figure of permanent staff had reduced, from those 340 to 280, and we would have taken on approximately 140 temporary staff as well.  In essence, there was a reduction of 60 permanent staff members over that five-year period.</p><p>  On achievement of overtime savings, we have streamlined a lot of the existing processes of passport issuance.  A lot of time was taken up in dealing with large numbers appearing at the public counters.  This is one example of how we addressed this.  That, in itself, consumes a considerable amount of time.  Equally, there was the level of rejection of applications through the ordinary post service where over 90% of such passport applications presented problems.  By switching applicants into the more effective streamlined systems of Passport Express, we have managed to achieve efficiencies in that area.</p><p>  We have also looked at streaming out and breaking out applications into what we call twin lanes.  In essence, this is looking to see are there applications that can be approved more easily than some of the more complex applications and get large numbers of those, from a throughput point of view, and spend less time having to do it.  There are efficiencies around our general processes and looking to see how the organisation is run.</p><p>  Probably, the biggest significant change has been the use of the temporary staff for seasonal demand.  Previously, much of the overtime would have been spent in dealing with the extreme peaks during the summer period.  By taking on our temporary staff that little bit earlier, we have been in a position to achieve a greater level of understanding amongst the temporary staff and let them respond more during the summer peak.  That, in itself, has generated enormous saving.</p><p>  The reduction of the permanent staffing numbers reflects the approach we have taken to the way in which the staffing model of the organisation operates.  Rather than having large numbers of staff who have less work to do during the winter months, it is much better to have them productive year round and then have more staff come in to supplement the temporary seasonal demand that is required.</p><p>  Senator Walsh asked about contracting out the service during the summer peak.  There are complexities involved, most particularly with the standards body in the area of passport issuance, the International Civil Aviation Organisation.  It is their view, and their recommended best practice, that the State should retain under direct control, not contracted out, the entitlement processes.  One can understand that, that the State has ownership of who, as Deputy Eric Byrne referred to it, has this important significant document of identity for the Irish State.  There are limits to what can be achieved around that space but it is not something that we would dismiss out of hand.  It is something we keep under review.</p><p>  On amendments made to the Act in relation to children, Deputies Durkan and Eric Byrne referred to some of the complexities associated with this process.  On the residency issue, the reckonable residency calculation is extremely complex and whereas that is not primarily an issue for the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade - it is an issue for the Department of Justice and Equality - it nonetheless is the area that consumes a significant proportion of our time.  The documentation requirements associated with establishing what is reckonable residency are not easy by any means.  Deputy Durkan certainly has been in contact with the office around such problems that have emerged.  Most particularly, one can get into situations where, as the Deputy referred, one has some children who are entitled to a passport and a brother or sister suddenly finds himself or herself that he or she is not by factor of birth.  That will become less of an issue in the future but, particularly for those children who were born around the period associated with 2005, there are more of those anomalies that we see.  Especially, as they become older and are getting into the space of travelling, it probably emerges more than might have been the case up to that point.</p><p>  On a campaign of advertising, I am pleased to say that last weekend the passport service took a stand at Holiday World.  It is the second year in a row that we have taken that.  As a result of that campaign at the weekend, there are approximately 3,000 additional citizens who took the opportunity to register on our expiry reminder service.  That is one small example of how advertising can have a positive impact for the organisation.  I encourage members to refer to citizens who are in touch with them that we have a simple reminder service.  It takes 30 seconds to register to remind yourself of when your passport is due to expire.  It is a service well worth using.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe raised a number of operational and logistical questions around the use of stamps, phones, etc.  I take on board much of what he said.  We need, as I stated in my opening remarks, to balance some of these demands that often are seen as not ideal against what we think are reasonable measures to protect against identity theft and fraud.  I hear what he is saying about the stamp.  It is something we have considered.</p> <p>We are looking to see how we can overcome those issues.  That is something we will take away and look at further.  I agree that the concept of using a paper stamp in this day and age is far from the most secure method, but it is better than not having a stamp. That is all I would say for the moment.  </p><p> Certainly the witnessing element that is required most particularly for those people who are not resident in the State is very different.  Most people who apply for a passport are obviously applying within the State and their interaction is directly through the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I thank the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for the work they do in providing that witnessing service.  It is very important from our perspective.  Clearly, outside the State there is a particular challenge, but we will see where we can go with that.  </p><p> In relation to certainty, mobile phones are clearly a problem.  The traditional view has been that by establishing a physical relationship with somebody's place through a landline telephone, one has a greater level of certainty that the person one is talking to on the telephone is who they say they are.  Obviously, as time moves on,  there are fewer fixed landlines in place and people rely far more on mobile phones.  It is a problem we are aware of and I do not know if we have a particular answer to it.  </p><p> The Deputy asked about the level of availability of the Passport Express service in Northern Ireland.  I think there are about 15 post offices that provide the service.  I accept there are a number of places where the service is not as available as it should be.  Coincidentally, I am meeting with the Post Office in London next month to talk through some of the issues associated with the availability of that service to establish whether a greater use of the post office network, most particularly in England, Scotland and Wales, could be provided.  At present, the service is available only in the main post office in Liverpool and Glasgow.  Clearly, that is not the spread one would expect in a country of that size.  I was speaking to Ms Assumpta Griffin, who runs our office in London, about this particular issue today and it is an issue we will take up with them.</p><p> The service was introduced at a particular point in time.  It recognised the effect of the Anglo Irish Agreement and the importance of making passports more readily accessible, particularly in Northern Ireland.  It was put in place at that point.  It is timely to reassess how that service is operating to ascertain if we can achieve greater use of it, particularly in Britain.  I am conscious that 40,000 applicants in England, Scotland and Wales apply for passports each year.  To provide a service that is more accessible to those applicants would be in all our interests and it is certainly an issue we will be exploring further with the Post Office.</p><p> The Deputy asked about names in Irish.  It is something that has caused concern for many people.  I used to write back and say that our concern is not about the name that somebody uses; it is about the establishment of two identities.  There have been many cases in which individuals have been using and seeking to use alternate names - I am not talking about Irish names <i>per se.</i> One may be trying to find an alternative name to establish a second identity for whatever purpose.  In that context the Passport Act has set out the framework in which the name should be used.  The Act provides that the name that appears on one's passport should either be the name on one's previous passport or the name used on one's birth certificate, whether that was in English or in Irish, but the idea of establishing the Irish form of one's name is not provided for specifically.  It relates to the name with which one was registered or the name used on one's previous passport.  However, people have a genuine and reasonable need to change those names on occasion.  The Act makes provision for changes of name in relation to, for example, marriage.  We look for usage of the name in some way.  We accept completely that the usage of the name as Gaeilge in Northern Ireland is clearly a much more sensitive issue than elsewhere.  Therefore, when we come across circumstances in which that arises we try to work with the applicant to see what can be done.  There are alternative approaches we can take to assist in that regard.  One way we have tried to resolve this matter is by providing people with the observation on page 3 of the passport to say something on the lines of &quot;Known in English and in Irish as...&quot;.   There is some work we can do to enable a person to establish the necessary proofs that the name he or she is using is valid and is not an attempt to set up a second identity.  I would be more than happy to speak to the Deputy specifically about that issue.  If there are individual issues or if there are MLAs who are coming across problems with that, it is something we would be more than willing to discuss further.  </p><p> The Deputy talked about a certified copy of the passport.  May I clarify whether the Deputy was talking about obtaining a certified copy of an Irish passport?</p></speech>

Maybe it was something that occurred at a weekend when there was not availability of access to our systems.  I do not know.  Certainly it is a service that is provided - I would not say on a daily basis, but is a usual and normal service that is provided.  Again, if that type of situation occurs, please let us know because something may have fallen between stools.</p><p>  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan raised some questions around the issue of lost passports.  There is no easy answer to this.  I understand it is an area that concerns many citizens who seek to travel at short notice.  It is when they do not have their passports that particular challenges are created.  To put the issue in context, we receive reports of 30,000 lost or stolen passports per year, the vast majority of which are lost.  If I do a maths exercise - it may not be as good as Deputy Eric Byrne's - that equates to roughly 120 passports per day.  This is a big issue for Ireland as a society.  I thank Deputy Eric Byrne for his comments on how important and how critical the document is.  We need to get the message out to Irish citizens that a passport is not like a bus ticket or a plane ticket.  This is a document that has a value over and above what one might automatically say.  Therefore, the care we give to passports is critically important.  The fact that there are losses of that scale suggests that we have not quite got into that.  We are looking to see if there are things we can do around that.  Considerable numbers of passports are handed in to us after music festivals.  Following music festivals in Deputy Bernard Durkan's constituency area, to which people travel from all over the country, we might get a box of passports returned to us on a given weekend.  I am sure they are not from Kildare.  They are from people from all over the country.  It reflects the fact that travelling around with a document that is as bulky as a passport book is in itself not ideal.</p></speech>

That is the biggest problem with regard to this issue.  Notwithstanding that, in the case of people who have lost passports and who seek to travel at short notice, it does not give us much time to verify a person's identity.  That is the reason that although express services are provided, they are not provided for people who have lost passports.  Such a system is not uncommon around the world.  It is a question of balance between ensuring that fraudsters are not using the opportunity to steal somebody's identity and allowing people to travel in circumstances in which not a huge amount of time is available.  The T&aacute;naiste said last week that he wanted to seek ways in which we can expand the emergency service.  We are committed to doing something about that.  I have not worked out exactly how we will do it, but the T&aacute;naiste, the Department and I have made a commitment that we will do something about this, and we will try to do something in advance of the summer peak.  How expansive or extensive that service will be has to be measured against a range of conflicting priorities.  We do not want to introduce a service that facilitates somebody in stealing another person's identity or equally provides somebody with an opportunity to abduct a child and take him or her outside the State.</p> <p>I know they are extreme examples but they occur, unfortunately, and we need to protect against them.  Equally, we do not want to discommode individuals who are in the system.  It becomes a cycle if some are prioritised and others who are pushed back suddenly need to be brought further up the queue.  We know there is a gap in that service and it is something we are committed to try to address.</p><p> I was interested in Deputy Durkan's comments concerning Teachta D&aacute;la.

In some ways it is a really interesting question.  The average number of passports that have been issued over the past nine years has been in the order of 600,000.  We have seen a gradual increase in that over the years.  To answer Deputy Byrne's question in so far as I can, clearly we are not just talking about people who are resident in the State.  We also have to factor in the 40,000 people who are resident in Northern Ireland, the 40,000 who applied through our office in London, and the 40,000 who applied through our embassies overseas.  That is 120,000 out of the 630,000.  If one considers that children are applying for three or five year passports, as the case may be, they are occurring more frequently than the standard adult passport.  Lastly, if one factors in lost or stolen passports on top of that, it is roughly another 30,000.  The last figure I saw for the number of live passports was a little less than 5 million.  When one thinks of the population of Irish citizens around the world, that does not seem to be completely out of the ordinary.  It reflects an increasing demand for individuals to change their passports as well.  We have quite a number of repeat customers who, for whatever reason, seek to change their passports.

Let me tell the story.  A sports personality who changed their hairstyle wanted a new passport to reflect the photograph.

The Chairman has referred the matter to the Department of Social Protection and the work of the General Register Office in that area.  The Passport Act outlines the circumstances in which somebody can apply for a passport.  It is primarily that they are an Irish citizen.  We apply those laws rigorously to ensure only people who are Irish citizens can get an Irish passport.  Without trying to pass the buck on this issue, it is not an area on which I feel I can talk with competence.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne also referred to guarantees concerning false applicants, but I cannot provide such guarantees.  However, a significant number of people try to get access to an Irish passport.  The passport service does everything it can to put in place mechanisms to protect against false applications and theft.  Unfortunately, however, there are individuals who have successfully obtained false Irish passports.  This is a moving target for us and something we continue to work on vigorously to ensure we put in place reasonable systems for the majority of Irish citizens, while protecting their identities.</p></speech>

We have a range of security features that are not used by any other passports in use around the world at the moment.  We are most definitely at the upper end of the security element.  The process for forging the passport is much more difficult.  The Deputy referred to some high profile instances of this internationally.  The documents that were used were very old, going back three versions of that document for forging purposes.  We have moved on considerably in that area.</p><p>  The biometric element is the shape of a person's face and personal information which is protected using encryption and technology beyond my understanding.  It is encrypted on the document itself.  The range of physical security measures makes it difficult to photocopy or forge.  I am happy to give a guarantee that, in so far as we can, we have moved the passport document into a different space. </p><p>  We have some general leaflets which we used at the holiday world show.  I will leave them with the committee to provide a sample or flavour of some of the images that would apply.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe asked why there were no images on the book that are North of the Border.  The issue for the Irish passport was more about citizenship and heritage rather than territorial issues.  It definitely recognises that the right to an Irish passport does not stop at the Border.  There are a number of images that reflect the all-Ireland dimension of the book itself.  There is a map of Ireland prominently inside the front cover.  It is there proudly to reflect that somebody who is an Irish citizen comes from this island.  That was an important element for it.  It also includes a range of other matters, including the text of Article 2 of the Constitution, which deals with a person's entitlement to Irish citizenship related to being part of the island of Ireland, and which is on the document itself.  That appears both in Irish and English through the book.  The crests of the four provinces appear inside the back cover.  A range of river gods of Ireland are also referenced, including the Bann and the Lagan.  There are a series of images that reflect that all-island dimension.  Much of our cultural heritage is reflected in the book.  The Deputy referred to the poetry of James Orr but, equally, there are cross-Border and all-island sports that are referenced such as Gaelic games and our musical heritage.  We have moved the book into a place that tries to express that broad issue of entitlement.</p><p>  I apologise if I have missed somebody's question, but I think I have answered most of them.  I was asked why the PPS number is not included on the passport.  I cannot remember who asked that question.  The standard concerning the production of the passport book is laid down through international standards.  Therefore, producing a person's PPS number on the book is a challenge.  We have spoken to the Department of Social Protection about that issue and we will see if there are mechanisms to facilitate individuals in that regard.  However, it is not something that can be done simply.  The actual format and layout of the book is governed by international standards and we clearly want to ensure the Irish passport stays within those parameters.</p></speech>

I welcome our visitors and compliment Mr. Nugent on the significant progress that has been made in recent years.  There has been a significant improvement in the service to the public.</p> <p>On the issue of turning passport applications around quickly in emergencies such as bereavements or serious illness, would it be possible to extend that to people who need to travel urgently?  I assume the office would hope to extend that facility at a future date.</p><p> There is an issue with the major spike in demand for applications during the two summer months.  I presume one way of addressing this would be if a system were in place that would notify people in advance when their passport was due for renewal, in the same way a person gets notified about motor tax.

Is that it still a problem?  There is a view that the garda will only know the person if he is a criminal.  That is the answer most people give.  Is that a difficulty?  How can we address that?</p><p>  There is an issue with photographs on passports.  We have heard about people changing their hair.  One reason for rejection which arose regularly was that a person's face was too near the lens.  I have had cases in which the photographs were rejected.  However, garda&iacute; were passing them.  I wonder about the training.</p><p>  My last question is about forms.  A person working in England lost her passport and sent the new application form home.  The father went to the office but the form could not be processed because it was the wrong one.  Is there any way of sorting that out?  The difficulty was the girl in question could not come home to put the application through in Dublin because she did not have identification.</p></speech>

We have moved from a monocultural to a multicultural society in a short period and this has brought complexities such as the use of names by African, Arabian or Muslim people.  We have always used the traditional Christian name and surname.  Still to this day, many people think their first name is their Christian name, but if a person is a Muslim then he is not a Christian.  How is the office managing that?  It is not only a matter of the composition of the names because there are differences in the cultural application of a name in various nations.  There is also the written format, which I imagine is completely alien to many of the staff at the Passport Office.  How is the office managing the significant diversity of citizens from the wide and wonderful world?</p></speech>

How does the office handle those situations?</p><p>  Reference was made to the surplus that is being generated.  The State does not have a great record of reducing prices.  Invariably, we increase them.  Is the approximate &euro;10 difference between the &euro;63 and &euro;52-odd in the cost of producing passports a sustainable difference?

The Chairman asked about the link with the Department of Justice and Equality.  Deputy Crowe referred to our relationship with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the applicant experience of dealing with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is important to thank and recognise the members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, who provide invaluable assistance to us in many ways, not least through the witnessing process.  I imagine in the list of things they have to do, this represents an extraordinary pressure.  As a society, we are benefiting from the result of their assistance and involvement in the process.  Deputy Crowe is absolutely correct that in many instances an individual may not be so well known with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, but it has not emerged as a major problem for us.  Where circumstances arise in which a person is in that category, we have processes around assisting individuals in establishing their identity.  If people come forward to us in that area, it is something we can do.  In general terms, it is fair to say it has not proved a major difficulty for us.</p><p>  Notwithstanding that, I will pick up on Deputy Byrne's comments on fraudulent passports and the attempts at abusing passports.  I pay thanks in particular to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the security service for their ongoing assistance in this area.  This is done behind the scenes, for obvious reasons.  We have close, productive and almost daily, if not weekly, meetings with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on matters that emerge.  The relationship is very positive and productive in this area.</p><p>  The question of witnessing in Britain is certainly causing challenges.  This week, extensions will be offered relating to the range of witnesses who may provide witnessing services in Britain.  This is reflective of the increasing challenges and the slight differences in the way we approach passport witnessing here and overseas.  In Ireland, we expect that the person is stating that he is satisfied as to his identity.  In Britain, there is a different approach.  It is a good deal more formal there and a person must be personally known to the witness.  Certainly, we have encountered circumstances in which categories of individuals have found it difficult to get a witness in a range of sectors.  We have done something to try to improve the process and help to make the issue more easily accessible for Irish residents in Britain.  The availability of a passport express-type service in more locations throughout the country and a greater familiarity locally around the Irish passport issuing process will help in this regard.  There will be a good deal more local awareness.</p><p>  Since the process is rather centralised around our London operation, much of the work tends to be for people who are travelling distances.  They come to our office in London, then realise they must get the form witnessed and then they run into difficulty in engaging with people who clearly will not be known.  Those people are certainly rather cautious about witnessing.  This is something we recognise and that we will try to address and deal with.</p><p>  Deputy Byrne referred to the issue of names.  It is most definitely a challenge.  We have seen circumstances which we have managed to overcome with our colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality involving someone who comes through the naturalisation process and perhaps whose first and second names have been switched or are in the wrong position.  We have worked with people in those situations.  What we try to do is maintain a link with the name by which the person was previously known.  Therefore, people provide birth certificates from their country of birth or the passport from their country of residence to establish who they are.  In those circumstances the problems tend not to arise.</p><p>  I am also aware there are variations in spelling, especially around Arab names, if that is the politically correct phrase to use.  There are names for which a slight subtlety in variation of spelling can cause a challenge or issue.  Our primary responsibility is to ensure people are not trying to establish a second identity.  If we can achieve that in partnership and by working with the individuals concerned, it is of great use to us.</p><p>  The head scarf issue was raised.  It is something we have dealt with in the application guides for those who apply.  There are a set of guidelines on photographs.  The level of rejects of passports for photograph reasons has reduced substantially in the past ten years.</p> <p>Photographs became a serious issue in 2004 for the first time.  In 2006 the introduction of the chip on the passport brought about a significant level of failure in passport applications because of photograph problems.  That is not the biggest problem today.  Most people who use the services of pharmacies have got used to setting up the photographs correctly.  There are challenges in the international differences in the standard of photograph required.  Passport photograph standards vary and a photograph that is accepted in one country for an online visa may not be accepted in another for a passport.  The international community needs to do a little more work to overcome that problem.  We will contribute to that process. </p></speech>

The many Irish passports used in Dubai at the time of the assassination in 2010 never turned up.  One assumes they were destroyed immediately after the people using them exited the country.</p><p>  I thank the Deputy for raising the question.  The physical copies of the passport images were published on the Internet and several commercial con men have been using and trying to sell reproductions of those images and identities to the unsuspecting.  In a couple of cases individuals have turned up in banks or other places with something that has some of those identity pieces.  The message needs to get out that there are official ways to apply for a passport and if one engages with con men one will be conned.</p><p>  Senator Mullins raised several questions and it might be useful to repeat the points.  There is a passport reminder service available on our website, <i>passport.ie</i>.  It is very simple.  The individual puts in the expiry date of the passport and receives an e-mail from us three months or so in advance of the expiry date.  We might bring that reminder date forward.  The service is not well known and we need to do a little more work on that.</p><p>  Last weekend we had a stand at Holiday World as part of a general campaign to remind people about passport issues.  We asked people at the stand three questions, and we continue to ask them: Do you know where your passport is?  Do you know when it will expire?  Do you know when your childrens&rsquo; passports will expire?  If we can get those questions out from here and elsewhere it will make our lives easier but more important, it will reduce the stress that people suffer before they travel.  The Minister said last week that we are committed to putting in place something to address some of the problems around urgent travel.  I caution that we will not be in a position to provide the service to the 600 people who demanded that type of service two years ago.  We will have to find something that is balanced.  If a person finds himself or herself in genuine difficulty, unbeknownst to himself or herself, and if there is a mechanism we can use to do something about that we will try to put something in place before the summer peak.  If there are issues that the members feel are relevant we will be more than willing to take them on board.</p></speech>

Schedule A includes COM (2013) 0812 - CEPOL 16378/13.  Given that this proposal is subject to the procedure outlined in Protocol 21 TEU TFEU and that it may be referred to the committee for its consideration prior to opt-in motions being considered by the Houses, it is proposed that it warrants further scrutiny and that the committee consider it, if it is so referred.</p><p>  COM (2013) 821, COM (2013) 822 and COM (2013) 824, three proposals for directives, are subject to the procedure outlined in Protocol 21 TEU TFEU.  As one or more of the proposals may be referred to the committee for its consideration prior to opt-in motions being considered by the Houses, it is proposed that the proposals warrant further scrutiny.  Some concerns about subsidiarity have been expressed by another national parliament about one of these proposals, namely, COM (2013) 821.  I propose, therefore, that more information be sought on the nature of these objections and that committee consider the three proposals again next week.  I also propose that we ask the Department for further information on the two recommendations made.</p><p>  Schedule B includes COM (2013) 580; COM (2013) 853; COM (2013) 862; COM (2013) 870; COM (2013) 872; COM (2013) 873; COM (2013) 875; COM (2013) 876; COM (2013) 877; and COM (2013) 878.  It is proposed that these proposals require no further scrutiny.</p></speech>

Members will recall that the committee invited written submissions on this topic.  The format of the meeting is that each group will be invited to make an opening statement which will be followed by questions from members.  I welcome the Lord Mayor of Dublin, the first citizen of Dublin, and thank him for his attendance.  I am also very pleased to welcome Mr. Julius Lang from the Center for Court Innovation in New York who has come a long way to be with us today.  I thank him for his attendance.  I welcome Mr. Philip Bowen from the UK Centre for Justice Innovation; Mr. Justice Michael Reilly who chaired a committee on this topic a number of years ago; Mr. David Brennan, Dublin City Business Association; Mr. Tony McGillicuddy from the Bar Council of Ireland; Mr. Ken Murphy, an old friend of ours, from the Law Society of Ireland; and Ms Maura Butler, chairperson of the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development, ACJRD.  I expect the Minister to arrive shortly, as he wishes to listen to the proceedings.</p><p>  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I ask that all mobile phones be switched off completely, as they interfere with the sound system.  I invite Mr. Lang to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I am representing the Center for Court Innovation in New York and accompanied by my colleague, Mr. Phil Bowen, from our UK-based affiliate, the Center for Justice Innovation.  Ours is a non-governmental and not-for-profit organisation.  If we had a tagline, it would be "research and development for justice reform".  In practice, our work falls into three categories, the first of which is demonstration projects such as community courts which are created in our role as the external research and development arm of the New York state court system.  The second category is research.  We have 15 social scientists on our staff who support our demonstration projects with action research and study the impact of other justice interventions in the United States and internationally.</p> <p>The third area of our work is technical assistance, both in the United States and internationally.  This is the part of the organisation in which Mr. Bowen and I are chiefly involved.</p><p> In the time we have been allotted, I will speak about our experience with New York's longest-running community court, while Mr. Bowen will cover replication of the original model and evaluation of results.  In New York, community courts have endured and, in fact, thrived since the first one was created in Times Square in 1993.  I was reminded of the Midtown Community Court's staying power just a few weeks ago as our newest mayor was preparing to take office.  The court was planned and opened under Mayor David Dinkins, who was followed by Mayors Giuliani and Bloomberg.  While those three mayors had differing positions on many issues, each was enthusiastically supportive of the community court.  Twenty years after the court opened its doors, our newest mayor, Bill de Blasio, has also embraced the community courts model.  In fact, he chose the Red Hook Community Justice Center, a Brooklyn-based replication of the Midtown model, as the location to announce his appointment of the new police commissioner, Bill Bratton, in December.</p><p> The fundamental idea behind the Red Hook Community Justice Center's work, as Mayor de Blasio explained, is that the way to fight crime is with the community.  That idea has been epitomised to great effect in New York, and it is an idea that animates my entire view of public safety and how we can move forward as a city.  The incoming mayor called the justice centre an "extraordinary institution" that "epitomizes what I believe in terms of a progressive approach to public safety".  The Midtown Community Court was opened under the then New York State Chief Judge, Judith Kaye, and has been just as strongly supported by her successor, Chief Judge Jonathan Lippman, through good economic times and bad.</p><p> The bottom line is that crime, although it can be politicised, is not really a political issue.  More often, except in the case of career criminals, it is a combination of complex social, economic, health and other issues and, as such, it defies easy solutions.  The crime problem facing Times Square back in 1993 is a problem that afflicts many urban centres.  It was a type of crime that did its damage through an accumulation of relatively small but constant insults to the social fabric.  Times Square had gone slowly but surely from a jewel of the city - home to theatres and fine dining and one of New York's two central business districts, along with the Wall Street area - to a mecca for the small and ugly, including street prostitution, open-air drug dealing, drunken brawling, assaults, shoplifting, and illegal street trading.  Many offences were relatively small but their collective impact was to ruin the quality of the experiences of workers, tourists, residents and everyone who passed through the neighbourhood.</p><p> New York's traditional response to this kind of lower-level offending had become something of a treadmill or, in an oft-used clich&eacute;, a "revolving door".  The police officer would issue a ticket or make an arrest, the accused would go downtown to a massive anonymous courthouse where all cases, large and small, were heard, and would typically get a short-term jail sentence, a release without conditions - known in New York as a "walk" - or a fine that was rarely paid.  In the words of the frustrated supervising judge of the time, sentencers had only two choices, namely, brain surgery, meaning prison, or a band aid, meaning the other options.  The problem was that many of those cycling through the system were habitual offenders with very complicated lives, facing minimal accountability while the neighbourhood continued to be victimised.</p><p> In setting up the Midtown Community Court, the justice system was proposing something different, a way of administering punishments that were meaningful and might actually serve as a disincentive to further offending while also being proportionate to the crime.  It was also about helping offenders get on a better life track.  Thus, what we call the community court model was born - a court with a geographic focus which would harness the power of the justice system to work with the community to solve local problems.  Instead of an overnight in jail, the Midtown Community Court's typical punishment consists of a combination of a community restitution assignment and mandated social services.  These responses are delivered quickly, not days or weeks after the fact, often on the same day or next day after sentencing.</p><p> Research has shown that swift and certain responses make more of an impact on re-offending than the severity of the sanction itself.  A day of community restitution might consist of a team, under the supervision of a court staffer or partner agency, going out into the neighbourhood to paint over graffiti, clean a local park or even stuff envelopes for a non-governmental organisation.  Key social services are housed on-site.  Drug and mental health counselling, even job training and fatherhood classes, take place on the sixth floor of the building, a few flights above the courtroom.  These sanctions are meaningful because, unlike a fine or a night in jail, they seek to address factors associated with underlying behaviour.</p><p> The local nature of the response is important.  Community courts are usually, although not always, based in the neighbourhood they serve.  The Midtown Community Court is on West 54th Street, a few blocks from Times Square and right in the middle of its catchment, which is actually slightly larger than Times Square.  Its location makes it easier for members of the local business, residential, faith and academic communities to come in and volunteer.  They can serve on advisory boards, work with court participants and can even access the same services as the court's clients.  In other words, the court also serves the law-abiding members of the community.  That is the Midtown Community Court in a nutshell.  I thank members for their time and will be glad to answer any questions they might have.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Bowen" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014012900004#H00300"><p>Thank you, Chairman.  It is a great honour to address the committee.  I will take up where Mr. Lang left off by dealing with two important issues, namely, replication of the community court model outside of midtown Manhattan and, second, what we know about results.</p><p>  On replication, one of the key features of the community court model is flexibility.  Community courts have "community" in their name for a reason: because they put community first.  They are all about local concerns, local stakeholders and local collaborators, and because of their emphasis on the local, the model has been adaptable in all kinds of settings.  We now find community courts in some 40 jurisdictions throughout the United States and in a number of international locations, including Canada, Australia and England.  Each replication is unique, but all share a strong commitment to community engagement, collaboration between agencies and problem-solving.</p><p>  What do we know about results?  In New York, independent evaluators have found that the Red Hook Community Justice Center in Brooklyn reduced the use of jail sentences by 35% and issued alternative sanctions to 78% of offenders, compared with 22% in the comparison group at the centralised courthouse.  Compliance with court mandates at the Midtown Community Court has remained at or above 75%, the highest in the city.  Evaluators concluded that, in conjunction with police initiatives and local economic development, Midtown Community Court can be credited with a 56% decrease in prostitution and a 24% decrease in illegal street trading.  At Red Hook, a recent evaluation found a 10% reduction in re-offending among adults and a 20% reduction for juvenile offenders.  Finally, a key finding of the Red Hook evaluation was a saving of some $4,756 per defendant through avoided victimisation costs.  The conclusion was that the overall savings outweigh costs by nearly 2:1.</p><p>  While an evaluation report on Vancouver's Downtown Community Court's impact on re-offending is still pending release, we do have results to share from an independent evaluation of Melbourne's Neighbourhood Justice Centre.  Among key findings, researchers found an increase in compliance with community-based orders from 65% to 75%, and an average completion rate of 105 hours of unpaid work compared with a statewide average of 68 hours.  In addition, the evaluation found a decrease in re-offending of 7%.  Significantly for policy makers, benefit-cost modelling showed that for every $1 invested in the community court, the expected return would range between $1.09 and $2.23.</p><p>  However, not all evaluations have been so positive.  In the case of the North Liverpool Community Justice Centre, for example, the results were mixed.  On the one hand, researchers found that the community court processed cases more quickly and was more likely to respond to non-compliance.  So far so good.  On the other hand, evaluators were unable to conclude that the project reduced re-offending at any greater rate than the United Kingdom average.  The justice system recently announced plans to transfer the justice centre's practices to the centralised magistrates' court because of a low caseload.</p> <p>While Liverpool is the outlier among community court evaluations, it serves as a cautionary tale for us all that good results do not automatically come with the adaptation of the community court model.  That is why Mr. Lang and I put such strong emphasis on good planning and implementation.</p><p> I mentioned the importance of the word "community" in the phrase "community court".  It would be remiss of me not to stress what we might call the model's surname, "court".  As one of the most prominent community court judges in the United States is fond of saying, "The constitution comes first and problem-solving comes second.  Period."  This means that the constitutional rights of the accused - not to mention the independence of the judiciary - are sacred concepts in a democracy.  However, as expressed so well by that judge, community courts believe that while the constitution certainly does come first, it is definitely reconcilable with a strong dedication to solving individual and community problems.</p><p> I again thank the committee for giving me the opportunity to address it.</p></speech>

First, I congratulate the Chairman on taking such an avid interest in this matter.  I also pay tribute to the Minister who, when publishing the last of my reports, on the D&oacute;chas Centre, made significant comments on his desire to see change.  I have no doubt that there is such a desire.</p><p>  I would like to share with the committee my experiences in the criminal justice system over more than 45 years, first, as a solicitor, then, from 1982 to 2008, as a judge and for the past six years as Inspector of Prisons.  I will then try to place in context community courts in 2014 in the criminal justice system.  </p><p>  The Minister knows as well as I do, if not better, that for countless generations the criminal justice system stood still.  Judges had very few options, but they did not need them because they could imprison or fine people or let them off with a caution.  In other words, they could apply the Probation Act.  In the mid-1980s the concept of community service was introduced.  This was the first time in this jurisdiction that offenders were obliged to make some form of reparation and it worked.  As a result, judges had a further sentencing option.  Even in the 1980s there was a clear distinction between acceptable and unacceptable behaviour.  What was unacceptable was criminal behaviour, in respect of which the forces of law and order could bring offenders before the courts to be dealt with.  At the time the criminal justice system was adequately equipped to deal with whatever came before it as a result of the limited range of options available.  While they were limited, they were adequate.</p><p>  Towards the end of the 1990s Ireland, in common with other countries, experienced a huge change that had been brought about by the abuse of drugs and the consumption of alcohol and nobody knew what to do about it.  As judges, we were seeking guidance because it was obvious that the criminal justice with which I, among others, had grown up was ill-equipped to deal with certain of the new challenges in the aftermath of the advent of drugs.  At that point the drugs court was established.  This was a modern, innovative approach to endeavour to deal with the drugs issue.  Those who established and operated the court deserve great credit.  However, it could only deal with one aspect of the problem.  The drugs scourge brought all sorts of other problems with it.</p><p>  It has been apparent to me, as I am sure it has to all of society, that the scale of the drugs problem has brought with it other difficulties.  I refer to people shoplifting and petty thieving in order to fund the purchase of drugs.  In addition, there is begging on the streets.  I am aware, however, that not all begging is drug-related.  There is also anti-social behaviour on the streets which comes from a culture of drug taking and impacts on the quality of life of ordinary people.  Then there is the homelessness associated with this chaotic life.  I could go on in this regard.  </p><p>  What do we do?  We could introduce severe penalties and mandatory sentences, build extra prisons and increase the strength of the Garda in order to ensure all of the people whom society believes to be a nuisance could be brought to court and taken out of circulation by being imprisoned.  That might be easy were it not for the fact that 99.9% of people who are imprisoned leave prison at some stage.  Most of them leave after quite a short time and the entire cycle begins again.  When these unfortunate individuals come to court, the judge will be told of their sad history and background.  On numerous occasions I have been asked to direct that a psychiatric or psychological report or assessment be produced of an individual before imposing sentence.  One must then ask from where such a report or assessment should be procured.  If someone's doctor wants to obtain an expert opinion, he or she will send him or her to the relevant expert, probably in a hospital.  However, we do not find them there.  Therefore, what do we do?  What option do I, as a judge, have?  My only option is to send the person to prison.  Why would one send a person to prison in order to obtain a doctor's report?  Would it not be better to ask an expert who is available to the court to produce such a report?  In every single case in which I requisitioned a report, it recommended options.  However, the option of prison was never recommended.  Why then should the individual involved have been sent to prison in the first instance?  Similarly, if a person has an addiction to drugs or alcohol, as a judge I may want to know what options are open to me.  I know what I can do, namely, send the individual to prison and he or she will receive certain help there.  If he or she has underlying problems, however, the three or six-month sentence I hand down might not be sufficient to allow him or her to address them in prison.  If I seek advice, I doubt that it would be recommended that the person involved be sent to prison.</p><p>  This is where the concept of community courts first came into my mind and I have been reading about it.  It is a new concept, but it could quite easily sit side by side with the existing system.  I have seen these courts in operation in Red Hook in Brooklyn, Midtown Manhattan, Philadelphia and Liverpool.  As members are probably aware, I chaired a sub-committee of the National Crime Council which examined community courts in an Irish context.  Its report which dates from 2007 is freely available.  As Inspector of Prisons, I have also seen at first hand the plight of those with mental disorders, addiction, family and housing problems.  These individuals, as a result of their difficulties, have ended up in prison.  If they had received help and judges had options, they might not have been imprisoned.  It is probably fair to say that if people in society need help and receive it, a high proportion accept that help and usually change as a result.  We know this from everyday life.  A community court-type system would be a place in which that change could start.  I have listened to many people who have talked about this complex issue.  It is one that needs a great deal of consideration.  </p><p>  There are many players who are important in this matter.  These players range from the Judiciary to the ordinary person who really has no qualification but who may be a helper in the court and befriends an individual who comes before it.  Community courts will involve an element of community service work, but that is something of which we are all aware.</p> <p> It will take a reforming mindset to take the step of looking again at the concept of community courts.  As there are so many necessary elements and so many necessary players in this, it would be wrong for any one of those players to decide they were the most important.  It must be a collaborative approach among everybody.  In that regard, I welcome the initiative taken by Dublin City Business Association in starting the discussion in the open.  I can elaborate on any of this at a later stage.</p></speech>

In business, perception is reality.  In reality, here in Dublin we have had considerable media coverage of quality of life and anti-social crime in the city centre.  The perception of the streets of Dublin is not what it should be.  Low level offences such as vandalism, anti-social behaviour, being drunk in public, criminal damage, drug use and drug dealing, assault, threatening and abusive behaviour and theft erode the quality of life for the inhabitants of our city.  This creates an atmosphere in which serious crime flourishes.  We have a situation where we continually have drug-addicted people on the streets of Dublin.  These unfortunate individuals, in the main, no longer take any interest in society at large and behave in a manner that disturbs and intimidates many passing citizens, not to mention tourists.  Workers and shoppers alike pass comment regularly on how unpleasant this makes the city centre.</p><p>  We have one of the safest capital cities in the world.  This is borne out by the actual crime statistics.  The perception, however, is that our city is violent, which is not based on the facts. </p><p>  The Dublin City Business Association, DCBA, is a not-for-profit voluntary association which has worked tirelessly for just under 40 years for the restoration, development and promotion of Dublin City.  The majority of business people in Dublin will spend a large portion of their lives within the city centre.  The DCBA engages daily with the authorities of the city, Dublin City Council and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We interact on the streets of Dublin with our members and are involved with many committees that concern themselves with the good running of the city.</p><p>  In 2004, the DCBA set about creating a new entity for Dublin, namely, the Dublin business improvement district structure.  On our site visits to the USA we took a keen interest in the concept of community courts.  I have been asked why a business organisation would take the considerable time and effort in promoting the community courts concept.  The DCBA as a business organisation accepts its moral responsibility to partake in the good governance of Dublin.  The aim of the association has not changed in that we seek a system of law that manages the individual and not the process.  We wish to see community courts established in the State that would have problem solving judges and that would be problem solving courts that work more closely with the community, that deliver and develop a collaborative problem solving approach to quality-of-life offences such as shoplifting, vandalism, street level drug possession, and so on, that provide quick acting justice and visible justice in the area where the crime took place, that can be seen by the community at large to be working, that are well planned, well thought-out and well researched, and that actively work to guide and assist defendants back into a meaningful role for them in society.</p><p>  In regard to those who have substance abuse problems and many family and personal problems, we look for a court that actively works to guide and assist these people to deal with their problems and the underlying reasons for re-offending.  The goal of community courts is to address the multiple problems and needs that contribute to anti-social behaviour.  Both criminal justice officials and the community share a deep frustration about the criminal courts processing low level offences and the high level of repeat offenders.  The community courts, through their structure, could address offences such as those I mentioned.</p><p>  Some years ago, in 2001, we had a far-seeing initiative with the setting up of a drug court in Dublin.  Following the work done by the drug court, the DCBA would see the community courts as a natural progression in dealing with low level offences and anti-social behaviour on our streets.</p><p>  The city requires a perception that encourages citizens and businesses to grow and prosper.  We need active change on the streets.  Tourism is vital as it brings new, extra money to the State.  The offering of our city and the reality of our streets impinges directly on tourists and on their essential wish to revisit Ireland.  Thankfully, we had an increase of 7.2% last year in the number of tourists coming to Ireland.  While that is great news, we need to build strong annual increases in the tourism sector to bring new money into our city.  Community courts are a very real tool to give us a better city with better streetscapes.  This will affect the ordinary person in the street going about his or her daily life.  It will improve the environment of the streets which in turn will engender increased and improved business and this will bring jobs to our city.</p><p>  Every capital city has similar problems to the ones we have in Dublin.  The DCBA seeks to improve the way we deal with quality-of-life crimes.  We support the view that minor crimes should not necessarily draw a defendant into the majesty of the adversarial criminal justice system.  We believe a speedy system that is firm with low level repeat offenders but seeks to help the individual promises much to our society.  As Albert Einstein said, we cannot solve the problems of today using the same thoughts that created the problem in the first place.  Community courts have been established in jurisdictions other than the USA, where the initiative started in 1993, for more than ten years.  They have grown, have been developed and have adjusted to the need in the society in which they operate.</p><p>  The DCBA asks that we in Dublin would look at a system that has successfully reduced crime in countries that operate community courts, as this would be of great importance.  Community courts have substantially reduced the rate of re-offending.  While reducing the crime, it has also helped defendants regain parts of their lives.  These two factors, over time, will benefit our society.  While we believe it may help the State in fiscal terms, we strongly believe it will help the agencies of the State that deal with these problems to operate more effectively.</p><p>  In a court where the defendant pleads guilty the resources of the court are put to better and more practical use.  The citizens see swift justice at work and the community service working in their area.  The services of the State that deal with abuse and housing see their resources employed to better effect and more returns with positive results for their spend.  If community courts are planned and implemented properly, I believe there is a win-win for all - a win for the citizen going about his or her affairs in our capital, a win for business that will see job potential and new opportunities, a win for those who have lost control of their lives, and a win for the Exchequer in that the systems will operate better.  We need change and we in the DCBA believe that setting up a community courts system in Dublin will bring about that change.  As George Bernard Shaw said, some people say, "Why", and I say: "Why not?"</p></speech>

As Lord Mayor of Dublin, I receive correspondence from those who visit our city and they recount their experiences, both good and bad.  One of the common negative experiences surrounds anti-social behaviour which affects the quality of life for those living and working in the city.  Issues such as drug use and drug dealing on our streets, theft, alcohol related crimes and graffiti are ones which some may perceive as relatively minor in comparison with other major crimes.  However, these have a huge impact on the lives of those living and working in the city and they can also give a negative perception of the city.  A perception of the city not being safe can undo all the good work done by organisations such as Dublin City Council, the Garda, business associations and tourism groups.  In addition to caring for the quality of life of all our citizens, Dublin is the capital city and the economic driver of Ireland.  It is in all our interests for Dublin to do well and to be seen as the ideal location to set up business or to come to visit.</p><p>  As Lord Mayor, I chair the Dublin city local business policing forum which addresses issues within the city centre from a business and-or policing point of view.</p> <p> One of the main topics raised is the low level crimes described.  Numerous possible solutions have been discussed, one being community courts.  The Dublin City Business Association, DCBA, has outlined to us examples of how the system works in the United States and the United Kingdom.  The option of having an instant reaction to a crime and an integrated approach to addressing both the crime committed and the issues of the person who has carried out the act is one which is of great interest to the forum.  In some cities in the United States this has led to a reduction of 82% in the number of repeat crimes, as defendants are referred to the services they require and start to turn their lives around.  Their sentences are also ones which assist the community, leading to those in the relevant areas seeing swift justice.</p><p> The Dublin city local business policing forum has recently commenced an outreach team initiative between the city council, the Garda and the Ana Liffey drug project.  The aim of the initiative is to tackle the problem of anti-social behaviour on the streets of central Dublin on a practical case by case basis.  The pilot phase of the initiative was carried out in late 2013 and initial reports indicate a co-ordinated approach by the Garda and Dublin City Council, including homeless services and the drugs centre, would be beneficial to provide a speedy response for those in need.  With different agencies supporting the initiative, it would be possible to provide advice and support in areas such as housing and drug addiction at the same time.  An additional function of the outreach team in time could be to attend and assist community courts to give quick support to those in need.</p><p> A former Lord Mayor, Mr. Andrew Montague, produced a report by a commission on anti-social behaviour during his term of office in 2011 to 2012.  Representatives from a wide range of stakeholders took part in the commission, including elected members of Dublin City Council, the Garda, the Department of Justice and Equality, the Probation Service, the HSE and drug treatment centres.  One of the main themes was the speed of the criminal justice system.  All crime statistics show that where crime is dealt with swiftly, it has a longer lasting effect on the perpetrator.  The use of community courts would mean that fewer people who have committed low level crimes in the city would have to go through the District Court and prison system.  The benefits would include a collaborative approach by relevant authorities; the courts and prison systems being used for more serious offenders; and citizens seeing community service in action in their neighbourhood.  In addition, by supporting the defendants at that point it would assist them in turning their lives around and reduce the ongoing legal and criminal costs to the State.</p><p> We already have clear recommendations for the establishment of community courts in Ireland from the National Crime Council in its 2007 report, Problem Solving: Justice &ndash; the Case for Community Courts in Ireland.  It gives an outline of community courts, including research from community courts in the United States and the United Kingdom.  One of its recommendations is that a community court be established in the inner city of Dublin to deal with quality-of-life offences committed in the Store Street and Pearse Street Garda stations catchment areas and that when convincing evidence of their success emerges, community courts be extended to other centres, subject to necessary refinements.</p><p> The city centre would be an ideal pilot area for community courts.  In the Store Street and Pearse Street catchment areas we have the main shopping, tourism and transport centres of the city.  A huge volume of people pass through the city centre every day.  Last year 27 million people passed through O&rsquo;Connell Street and only 16 minor assaults were reported to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na up to the end of November.  However, this is not what the perception of the O&rsquo;Connell Street area would lead one to believe.  A community court in the city centre would ensure the visible targeting of low level crime in the city centre and lead to multiple benefits for the city in terms of quality of life for those living in the city, satisfaction in the business community and an increase in the number of tourists.  </p><p> I call on the Government to consider establishing a working committee to set up a pilot scheme for community courts in the capital.  I would be happy to assist in any way I could.</p></speech>

I very much appreciate his presence and contribution.  I now invite Ms Butler to make her opening remarks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.697" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Maura Butler" time="15:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014012900007#L00300"><p>I thank the Chairman for the invitation.  I also wish the Minister, the Lord Mayor and everyone else a good evening.</p><p>  The Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development, ACJRD, is an organisation which has been involved in research and collaboration with members of the criminal justice community for quite a long time.  We are in regular communication with more than 700 individuals who include staff from the main criminal justice agencies, related Departments, academics, students, members of the legal community and community and youth service providers whose work intersects with that of the criminal justice system.  More than 250 of the people concerned are our members.  It is important to say, however, that even though we have all of these Government agencies among our membership, the views expressed in our submission and today are those of the ACJRD in its independent capacity, not those of the ACJRD member organisations or their employers.  It is my privilege to be the voluntary chairperson of the group.</p><p>  In making our submission we made 25 recommendations.  I am sure those present will be delighted to hear I will not attempt to go through all of them.  It has been difficult to extrapolate those on which it would be best to focus.  Suffice it to say we support what has been said.  We have very much taken on board the 2007 research cionducted by the National Crime Council and cited it in our submission.  Similarly, we have made reference to the Midtown Community Court experience and that in north Liverpool.  We see a lot that can be learned within the Irish jurisdiction on that basis.</p><p>  The ACJRD has undertaken quite an amount of research on the Children Court and women ex-prisoners and runs conferences on various matters.  The most recent conference was very much apropos of this discussion and the results will be launched this month.  It was entitled, Preventable Harm: Criminal Justice, Communities and Civil Society.  We have been having discussions since last October with the organisations involved and various working groups have expertise in various areas, including mental health, one of the areas we cited in the context of the submission.  For purposes of this meeting, however, I will distil the information and say the expertise we have honed and presented in the context of the concept of restorative justice is extremely important given the community aspect of the proposed community courts.  As an aside, if we go back to the 7th century in Ireland, the Brehon laws offered a community solution for community problems where everyone in the area came together and ensured restitution, as mentioned.</p><p>  The collaboration within the membership of the ACJRD pulls together all of the agencies involved in the criminal justice system.  We have found such collaboration to be an extraordinarily rich resource and would see the community court system as almost like an analogous implementation of that type of collaboration.  As has been pointed out by my colleague from the United Kingdom, we must learn from the Liverpool experience.  It is very important that we do so.  I will focus on that point first.  It is really important to ensure the aims and objectives of a community court are specifically laid out and that there is not too disparate a purpose given to the community court.  I am open to correction, but in the Liverpool example I understand the judge was dealing with both summary and indictable matters, with both the trial process and sentencing.  That is far too much and the community court system really ought to be focused on sentencing.</p><p>  I do not have a citation, but it can be found.  The generally accepted statistics are that when it comes to District Court business in Ireland, approximately 80% of those who come before it plead guilty.  One would not think this when one hears media reports on the really bad cases.  That being the case, potentially that amount of people could, in theory, be dealt with within a community court structure.  The attractiveness of the structure would be that one would have all of the necessary services available.  In an ideal world it would be great to have them all on the same premises in order that an accused person who has been dealt with could knock on the door of the mental health service and the Probation Service, for example, in the same building.  Having them in close proximity might be more realistic from a resource perspective.  Having a sentencing court only would be our recommendation.</p><p>  It is obvious to state it is necessary to have legal representation available to anybody who comes before a community court.  Such legal representation should not necessarily be confined to the actual process within the court but should be available to somebody who chooses to plead guilty for the purposes of going into the sentencing court.  All the usual due process principles in the criminal justice system ought to apply.  It is fair to say the criminal court system operates efficiently and is very advanced in some of the facilities available and that applies to the service provided, in particular, within the Irish Prison Service but also by the Probation Service.</p><p>  The mental health aspect is very important.  Research that the ACJRD has undertaken and conferences we have held indicate that a huge proportion of people who come before the criminal courts have a mental health difficulty.</p> <p>That is a welfare issue.  The issue of people being dealt with in a criminal justice context when they should be in a health care context must be the primary focus in any research done in preparing for this type of court case.  Also, a person does not cease to be mentally unwell once a sentence has expired; therefore, some provision must be made for ongoing health services in circumstances in which the only reason the person is coming before the court is a breach.</p><p> We recommend that the community court be stand-alone and a pilot programme.  We believe the goals of the community court should be cohesively designed and clearly stated.  The design of an Irish community court should have a legislative provision mandating a review of the operation of the community court within a specific time period.  Provision should be made for appropriate data collection for the review, having regard to the goals of the court.  Steps should be taken to ensure that this data collection is implemented appropriately, if necessary requiring early commissioning of the review or consultation with the evaluators involved in that process.  Notwithstanding the stand-alone nature of the court, when this review is carried out it should have regard to whether the community court experience can inform practices that are generally applicable in the District Court system.  Community court business should be limited to sentencing only, and the community court should only hear the sentence matters which do not merit the imposition of an immediate custodial sentence.</p><p> Regarding support services, we indicate in our submission that these should include alcohol and drug addiction assessment and counselling.  By way of an aside, alcohol addiction tends to have much more impact within a criminal justice context than is often recognised.  When we discovered that we had a huge drug problem within our criminal justice system in the mid-1980s, the eye came off the ball in regard to alcohol addiction and how that can impact on many people who end up in court.</p><p> Other services could include education and literacy courses, pre-employment and other training programmes, family housing and other social services, parenting programmes, anger management courses and so on.  Those people skills could possibly be given by the community in a mentor capacity.</p><p> Depending on where this development goes, the Association for Criminal Justice Research and Development, ACJRD, would be more than happy to facilitate any of the necessary research, collaboration or meetings process that might be necessary to assist the process.  I thank the Chairman for the opportunity.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.700" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ken Murphy" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014012900008#M00300"><p>Chairman, members of the committee, Minister, Lord Mayor, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, the Law Society of Ireland welcomes the opportunity to submit its views regarding the possible introduction of a community courts initiative in Ireland.  The society commends the joint Oireachtas committee on its initiative in dusting down the 2007 report of the National Crime Council, Problem Solving Justice: The Case for Community Courts in Ireland.  The success of community courts in parts of the United States and in England and Wales justifies a serious examination of whether community courts could be successful in Ireland also.</p><p>  The society would welcome the opportunity to participate fully in an implementation group as recommended in chapter 5 of the National Crime Council&rsquo;s report.  Solicitors who practice in criminal law have valuable experience and insights which they would happily make available to such a group.</p><p>  While the welcome is genuine and warm, there are elements of caution that the society believes should be expressed also.  First, we believe that consideration of the community courts model should be based also on an analysis of the impact of any such changes on criminal procedure in Ireland and the avoidance of any potential weakening of the constitutional rights of the accused.  Echoing Mr. Bowen's comments about England and Wales, and his quotation from the United States, it is not just in the US that the constitutional rights come first.  Second, we also believe that the review should be on the basis of evidence-based research.  Third - this is a theme I fear has not been sufficiently emphasised in the discussion so far - such an initiative must be adequately resourced.</p><p>  On the model, I quote from the National Center for State Courts in the United States, which states: "Typically, a community court is a problem-solving court that addresses quality of life or 'nuisance' cases and takes a more proactive approach to public safety."  It further states that there are several different models for community courts, that all the courts are experimenting with different ways to provide appropriate services and sanctions, and that there is no simple model to be adopted and recommended in Ireland.</p><p>  We must recognise also that many elements in community courts are already known in the Irish justice system.  In the National Crime Council's description of the community courts concepts it states that the community courts evolved from the drugs courts in the United States, the first of which was established in 1989.  I had the experience of being a member of the working group in a courts commission chaired by the now Chief Justice, Mrs. Justice Susan Denham, in the late 1990s when we were getting presentations from the United States about the drug courts.  The drug courts concept is known in Ireland.  Also, there is the restorative justice initiative that is being followed in Ireland, in respect of which Judge Michael Reilly was a pioneer in Nenagh.  A further pilot project was introduced in Tallaght and has now transferred to the Courts of Criminal Justice in Dublin.</p><p>  Some of the themes of community courts are not entirely unknown in Ireland.  The concern solicitors have is that the resourcing of those initiatives has not been all that it could be.  Some would see that there may be elements of panacea in the adoption of a community courts initiative now, but we are certain that would not be the case.  The drugs courts, for example, by narrowing its focus to the treatment of drug problems and focusing on the problem that caused the criminal conduct, look to the underlying problem of which often the criminal conduct is only a symptom.  To address deep-rooted social problems of that kind, resources have to be put in place.</p><p>  Less than an hour ago I spoke to the chair of the criminal law committee of the Law Society, who said that in her view the Probation Service in Ireland is at breaking point.  If there are to be initiatives that will draw on further involvement of the Probation Service, the courts system or the health system in support of community courts, resources will have to be found to make them work.  Our major reservation and concern is that this model might be followed and an initiative put in place without adequate resources to ensure its success.  Undoubtedly, there is great value in the concept of community courts and we should seek to learn from the experience, which, as Mr. Bowen pointed out, has not all been positive in other jurisdictions.  He cited the north Liverpool experience. </p><p>  The concept of seeking to address the underlying problems of which the crime is often merely a symptom has to be followed.  The Law Society, the solicitors' profession and the practitioners in the criminal courts who are solicitors would be very happy to engage with and support a model of this kind, provided all the elements required to make it a success are present.</p></speech>

I call the last speaker, Mr. McGillicuddy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.702" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony McGillicuddy" time="15:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014012900008#M00500"><p>Chairman, members of the committee, Minister, Lord Mayor and other distinguished guests who have made presentations, what can I add to what has been said?  Many of the points have been covered but I will give the committee some of my thoughts.  To echo what previous speakers said, something that would be different about community courts - this is one of the reasons the Bar Council is generally supportive of the concept - is that instead of sanctioning people it would be a case of sanction plus remedies, not just remedies for society in general but also for the offender who is before the courts.  That person might be suffering from drug or alcohol addiction, mental health difficulties or undiagnosed educational disabilities.</p> <p>As someone who practices in criminal courts, it is not unusual to have clients on serious charges in the Circuit Criminal Court, where relevant reports are obtained and something that has lain undiagnosed throughout the person's life is diagnosed and can be seen as a root problem of criminal offending.  There are difficulties concerning homelessness, family difficulties including abusive relationships, and poverty difficulties that lead to prostitution or begging.  These are the matters on which offenders come before the courts.  At present, the system's only ability is to refer these people to the probation service and for the probation service, with its excellent staff who do work huge work in difficult circumstances and limited resources, to coordinate facilities and services to try to get these people off the basement and on their feet again.</p><p> In the context of the system we have, with recidivism and a cycle of offending, the chances of a breakdown for these people are very large and the chances of them succeeding are rather low.  The community court concept can provide remedies for them, which would be integrated, and deal with them on a sophisticated basis.  This is something the Bar Council supports.  In respect of sanctions, the Bar Council supports the community court, the sanction of restorative justice, working in the community and adapting the community service provision so that they apply in this context for people to work in the community from which they come.  This means there is community support.  Just as the community courts model should not be imposed without planning, it should not be imposed on the community in question without the community seeing something positive to be gained.  The offenders come from the same communities and if they can give something back they can gain an element of pride that they are doing something positive in their community.  The community can see itself as being supportive rather than seeing something imposed by people in the south side of this, or any other, city as some kind of solution without the community seeing something it can partake in.</p><p> The Bar Council and practitioners in the area, of which I am one, are supportive of the concept.  This means there is a wider remit of remedies, solutions and sanctions available to meet the ends of punishment and rehabilitation.  If the community court concept to is to be followed through on, it should be explained to the public at large so that it can fulfil both roles and so that it is not imposed without proper planning and communication with the community and the community at large.</p><p> In respect of how it operates in practice, I must echo the comments of Mr. Murphy about resourcing it.  I draw on the experience of practitioners and colleagues I have spoken to.  I sampled the knowledge about the drugs court, a court in which I only practised briefly.  Members of the committee may not be aware that solicitor firms engage barristers on a frequent basis to take cases in the District Court where they have clients and are dealing with cases in other courts.  Barristers in Dublin find themselves in the District Court, particularly in their younger years.  When it was in operation, the drugs court was one of those courts.  My sample of colleagues who participated, and my experience, is that there were uneven results in the drugs court for different reasons.  Part of it, which was touched upon by one of the speakers from New York, is that other services were not available in the building.  It was housed in the Richmond building.  If a judge said he wanted someone to access the probation service and access housing services and return at 2 p.m. to say that appointments had been made, the services were not on site for the person to access them directly.  We must look at it through the prism of someone who is homeless.  They may have an appointment with the probation service in Smithfield but it is easy for the person to lose a piece of paper or lose a phone.  If a service is on site, the person can queue up and meet someone that day.  The person can return to that building and does not have to go anywhere else.  If the person is not turning up for appointments, it is easy for the probation service to report it to the judge.  It means things are integrated.  This might seem like a building issue but we need things under one roof.  We need that for the person but also for the system to work.</p><p> Another thing that has an impact on the ability of the drugs court to work well was the changeover of staff.  Trained staff from different services, including education services, a psychiatrist who can give an initial assessment for mental health problems, and housing services, should be under one roof so that they are integrated.  People detected unevenness.  We also need positive partaking by the person in question.  Other speakers alluded to the importance of legal representation so that an accused person can make an informed decision to plead guilty or not guilty.  Secondly, the solicitor who has dealt with the person over a long period of time, or the barrister a solicitor has engaged to represent the person on that day, are the only friends the person has.  When we have our final dealing with clients being sentenced to a prison term, as barristers we say that we hope things will go well.  If we ask them what they will do when they come out, the answer is that they have nowhere to go when released after the sentence.  The Prison Service may give the persons a small sum of money to pay for the bus fare but they have nothing.  In that regard, the role of the lawyer is to advise on options and, if the person pleads guilty, it is important that the lawyer can advise that the community court is a good thing to engage in.  The lawyer is the only friend the person has.  Legal representation is important for the protection of the person's rights and to inform the person of options.  The legal representative is the only person who can do that at the start in a proper way.</p><p> Advanced planning, advanced education and advanced communication with communities in question and the public are vital.  There must be integrated services that are on site and well resourced.  The probation service, due to resource difficulties over the past number of years, cannot do drug testing.  Everyone is cognisant of the position the State is in.  People must be referred to a general practitioner.  The service must be well resourced, there must be legal representation and there must be community involvement.  We should look back at the drugs court initiative, look at the positive aspects and also see the problems that arose, where it fell down and learn from before the community courts concept is introduced.  We are generally supportive once there is an element of integration.  The Bar Council will play a positive role in any working groups with the committee, the Department or any other group required to work positively for the implementation of the idea.</p></speech>

We are only beginning the conversation and the debate on the issue today.  A number of speakers have made the point that it is important not to rush into it and to prepare and plan properly with further discussion and debate.  Someone mentioned that we had dusted down the earlier report.</p> <p>We have half an hour or thereabouts for questions and interaction with members.  Deputy Finian McGrath has indicated that he has a number of questions.  He might indicate who he wants to answer them.</p></speech>

I warmly welcome them and thank and commend them for their submissions.  They have offered some sensible suggestions and solutions to the crime problem as a social issue.  As somebody who represents the north side of Dublin, I reassure Mr. McGillicuddy that we are open to the community court proposal.</p><p>  Is the bottom line that all groups represented see community courts as saving money and reducing the level of reoffending by 15% to 20%?  In the 40 jurisdictions in the United States of America, Canada and Australia is that the bottom line, that they save money and reduce the level of reoffending?</p><p>  Mr. Lang has mentioned that the way to fight crime is with the community.  As somebody who represents a constituency that has many disadvantaged communities, I totally agree with him.  Yesterday, for example, I was at a community meeting in a part of my constituency where the community was in crisis.  The experience of the Garda and residents was that there was so much fear and intimidation in the community that victims would not even report crimes to the Garda.  How does one respond where a community is in crisis?</p><p>  We all know that crime is a complex social issue.  In my previous job I worked in a disadvantaged area on the north side of Dublin and always used to say one should not expect a five year old boy living a drug-fuelled house and experiencing major violence and intimidation to grow up to be normal.  Such a boy will either explode on society or damage himself; his self-esteem will diminish and he will end up either dead or commit suicide.  The reason I say this is before one even gets to a community court, surely the first part of the solution is to intervene early.  Early intervention has to be stage one of the process in that regard.</p><p>  We never hear that the law abiding citizen living in these communities that are in crisis often says nobody ever wants to help him or her.  That is what most Deputies will tell us.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.708" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Julius Lang" time="16:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014012900010#O00600"><p>A number of issues were raised by Deputy Finian McGrath, on all of which he was thoughtful.  We should be clear that there have been evaluations.  Every single community has not been independently evaluated, but there have been evaluations, including the ones to which Mr. Bowen referred, that have uniformly found cost savings, primarily through avoiding victimisation.  What one is doing is spending up-front in pushing resources to the front end of the system, with the goal of reducing the level of reoffending and costs, about which we heard from Mr. Justice Reilly, at the back end of the system, whether in prison or in increased crime rates.  To clarify, I would say a 10% reduction in offending was a more realistic expectation.</p><p>  Fear and intimidation are fundamental to what we call community justice, of which community courts area part, but so are community policing and other community movements.  I am reminded of a different project on which I work with a health foundation, the goal of which is to promote public health approaches to law enforcement.  The public health experts with whom I am put together in that context talk about how good health is not achieved in a hospital or doctor's office but in communities where people eat healthily, exercise, take preventive measures, live healthy lives and only using medical services when they need to use them when something breaks down.  The same is true in the case of public safety; it does not happen in police stations or prisons but in communities where informal social controls keep them safe.  When communities have a sense of crisis and these informal social controls have broken down, one of the notions of community justice is to ask the question what the formal justice system could do to help strengthen these informal social controls that at the end of the day keep a community safe.  By involving community members in community justice, the community court model is trying to address what Deputy Finian McGrath is talking about, in a case where the fabric of the community has been torn and the informal social controls are not keeping the community safe.  We do not have a lot of time and I do not want to go on, but I love that question.</p></speech>

I had a conversation with a member of the board, Ms Sylda Langford, who pointed out that what they had done was in the case of speech therapy was a good example in so far as they had gone into preschool environments and worked with children and they had seen amazing results through intervention at an early age by having the speech therapist in the school.  That is analogous to what we were recently talking about.</p><p>  There has also been some comprehensive research conducted through NUIG with CDI Tallaght which was sponsored by Atlantic Philanthropies.  Enormous work has been done in the Tallaght area on restorative practice.  For example, in schools children would ordinarily have engaged in fisticuffs if there was a dispute, but they have learned conflict resolution skills.  There are a lot of data which show how early intervention can be positive.  Obviously, one has to be in it for the long haul for it to work.</p><p>  On communities in crisis, that is as bad as it gets for anybody in the criminal justice system.  In a previous part of my career I was a criminal defence lawyer and can empathise with my colleague from the Bar on the tensions felt.  I was always struck by the fact that sometimes one just had to start a conversation.  No more than Mr. McGillicuddy being a friend for the client, sometimes clients will tell one that one showed them respect.  Respect is something a member of the committee and I accept as the norm, but in some parts of society that are damaged where no respect is ever given, by having that conversation and giving that respect, they can be the germ for the kind of collaboration which could ultimately lead to a community court context.</p></speech>

I have three questions and do not mind who has an input into the replies.</p><p>  If, for example, we were to establish a footprint or network of community courts across Dublin, has anybody worked out how many we would be talking about?  Would the goal be to cover the entire city or would it be envisaged that they would cover particular areas, hot spots or black spots?  How would they be identified?</p><p>   My understanding of how community courts operate and based on these presentations is that they predominantly deal with what we call low level crimes or - if this is the correct phrase - petty crimes.  What would be the threshold above which the community courts would not operate?</p><p>  I hear the comments on the probation service and the level at which it is operating.</p> <p>Could I have an example of the practicalities of dealing with an offender who pleads guilty and goes through a community court?  Is there a one-to-one arrangement whereby a member of staff from the probation and welfare service would accompany an offender to remove graffiti?  Who would supply the paint?  Is there a public liability consideration when an offender is on a mission he is required to undertake by a community court?  Could we have an example of what occurs in Liverpool and New York?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.714" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Justice Michael Reilly" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014012900011#P00300"><p>When I examined this issue in 2006 and 2007 when I chaired the committee, I knew very little about the practicalities of community courts.  The one point that came across forcibly was that community courts can work only in communities.  First, the communities must be asked what the issues are that annoy them.  In Southill in Limerick, for example, there might be a very different annoying matter than in inner-city Dublin.  In inner-city Dublin, one would have to canvass the views of the community, which comprises a large body of people.  I refer not only to the indigenous community but also to the business community and everybody else.  One must determine the low-level offences.  An offence might be shoplifting in one place, prostitution in another and low-level drug dealing somewhere else.  While there are models all over the world, each community court would be adapted to provide for the needs of its community.</p><p>  The next thing one has to have is the community court.  I agree absolutely with the two lawyers that the community court is a sort of one-stop shop.  Consider what would occur if I overindulged my son and he had too much money and got into trouble some night owing to having too much drink, for example.  Let us assume he has no underlying problems to deal with and has a good job.  He would plead guilty during the community court proceedings and his case would be dealt with on the day.  He would probably be doing community service the next day.  The response would be proportionate and his service would be in the area in which he would have been annoying people.</p><p>  Where a person has underlying problems, one must find out what they are.  Rather than giving the person a letter to go to the social welfare office or elsewhere, it is a question of having staff who can take a statement or history from the offender and evaluate and assess the underlying problems.  This can be done in the area in question.  I agree with what Mr. Ken Murphy said in this regard.  Alongside the arrangement I have just described, one must have facilities to help the offender.  There is no point in assessing a person as having a chronic drug problem and telling him he will have to go into rehabilitation on receiving a letter stating he has been accommodated because he will probably have changed house four or five times before the letter arrives, if it ever arrives.  There should be instantaneous help for such people.</p><p>  I was asked how many courts there should be in Dublin.  I would have believed the best approach would be to have a pilot project and evaluate how it works.  One would learn from the pilot arrangement.  One would learn from the failures in places such as Liverpool.  One learns from failures in addition to successes.  To have this conversation, one has to have all the main players on board.  It is good to see all the people around this table singing from the same hymn sheet, albeit with different concerns.  One must examine the feasibility first and then the practicalities of setting up the model.  There is no point in trying to set up a community court while sitting in Leinster House, the Department of Justice and Equality or the Law Society as one must take account of what is on the ground and know one will have the required services.  If the services are available, one is on the right kind of road.</p><p>  With regard to the crime threshold, the committee I chaired that brought out the report in 2007 went to great lengths to identify levels of crime and the type of crime in a geographic area of Dublin that could be considered as one that could be dealt with in community courts.  The list is not exhaustive but an indication of the types of crimes.  The types of crimes might change from year to year.  If one got rid of shoplifting &ndash; one probably never would &ndash; there would not be much point continuing to have it listed.  One could take on something else that might have become a serious matter for the community.</p><p>  There is no real top threshold.  Clearly one cannot have people who commit violent crime in the community court; it would not be appropriate to have them there.  One could have a changing system whereby a community court in one part of Dublin would have a specific remit and another court in another part of Dublin dealing with another type of crime.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.715" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Philip Bowen" time="16:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014012900011#P00400"><p>I will give the committee two examples that show the contrast between different jurisdictions.  In 2006 and 2007, I was working in the Bronx community court project that the Centre for Court Innovation runs in New York.  The threshold was such that people were generally facing jail sentences of between one and ten days.  The mandates people were getting involved a couple of days of social service or community service, or a combination of both.</p><p>  Having all the services on-site and having community service crews relatively close by, we found that it was a matter of ensuring proper compliance and getting people onto orders.  The thresholds of the cases were primarily well below the New York City probation threshold.  The authorities in the latter system were addressing much more serious offenders.  The sort of people we were seeing were responsible for the possession of small amounts of cannabis, low-level drug dealing and the sorts of quality-of-life crimes we heard about today.</p><p>  The community court in Plymouth, England, focuses primarily on low-level crime, such as street drinking.  It seeks to divert people who would otherwise get conditional discharges or fines that they would never pay.  Magistrates essentially said they were sick of these offenders coming straight through the courts time and again for the non-payment of fines issued a week previously.  The services are primarily to refer offenders to other services.  In some ways, it is like an information desk.  People are lost through attrition.</p><p>  In both examples, we see there can be a need for one-to-one work or group work.  In both cases, it is a question of liaison with probation services but not necessarily a question of taking up probation resources, which in England and Wales are geared towards the higher end of the caseload, as they seem to be here.  Therefore, I believe the point Mr. Justice Reilly made, which is absolutely right, is that if there are to be community courts in Dublin, they need to be geared to this jurisdiction and the sorts of cases that arise in the courts here.  They should be geared towards addressing the way in which cases flow around the system.  This requires testing and refining, which is why I endorse the idea of piloting the approach first.</p><p>  A point that is coming out strongly in the research is that while the modality of the services, sorts of services on offer and extent to which they are delivered well are important, community courts' ability to reduce the level of re-offending seems to be driven primarily by offenders' perception that they are being treated fairly.  I refer to the notion of procedural fairness.</p> <p>That suggests the process people go through in the community courts feels fairer to them than the process they go through in regular courts and that seems to be a powerful predictor of re-offending.  The reason I bring that up is that I think service delivery is incredibly important, as are the types of sentences people get and the types of services they get referred into.  We should not forget that one of the things community courts have done is to create a fairer and more respectful process, to which offenders feel they can relate, and that seems to have driven reductions in re-offending.</p></speech>

The debate has been stimulating and will help inform our deliberations on this matter.  I was interested to hear Mr. Lang speak about New York.  I visited New York as a teenager in the 1980s and I well recall the intimidating atmosphere there where petty crime effectively took place in front of one's face.  When I visited the city again in my 30s, I saw a city transformed.  It felt so safe.  I never experienced such a contrast in a relatively short period of time.  As Mr. Lang said, this would have been done in 1993 and it was some time later than that when I visited.  I would have high hopes for us achieving the same thing, in particular when one hears that the business community and the Lord Mayor of Dublin would like to achieve something similar in Dublin city and in other cities around the country.</p><p>  I am interested to hear why this succeeded in New York and about the type of resources, which were alluded to by Mr. McGillicuddy and Mr. Murphy, required for people who fall between the cracks.  Were additional resources put in in New York?  Where did that funding come from?  What type of investment was required?  </p><p>  In regard to what Mr. Bowen called the outlier in Liverpool, has detailed analysis been done on why that did not succeed?  Would it have had anything to do with what Mr. Justice Reilly referred to as the stakeholder consultation, or community consultation, and how important it is to get buy-in?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.718" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Julius Lang" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2014012900012#Q00300"><p>Ideally, in creating a community court, what we recommend to jurisdictions is to figure out the problems their client population have and document that, identify the providers in their jurisdictions which are available and make the case to them that this is an opportunity to deploy resources more smartly and to co-locate with other providers and with the justice system, which is giving a kind of extra push to link the staff to the clients they are intended to assist, and when there are gaps, to figure out a way to fill them.</p><p>  The Midtown community court was the very first project to take this approach.  Probation from the get-go said it could not deal with that level of stuff as it was so under-resourced.  Probation in the United States is always facing cuts.  The public finds it very hard to support the work of probation which, as we know, is so important.  Probation was not an option.  A number of other agencies were willing to come on board, such as the New York City education department which was willing to offer adult education classes for people who had dropped out of high school, and the health department, which was willing to send staff.  Different agencies were willing to listen to that argument about being able to co-locate.</p><p>  However, what was required was co-ordinating staff.  Somebody had to run it.  I acted as the co-ordinator for five years.  That needed to come from somewhere.  Community service supervisors were a combination of staff who had to be paid for as well as agencies that were co-operating.  Local agencies would contribute in kind by supervising participants doing community service.  There needed to be a handful of other case managers who could run groups and provide services on site when other agencies were not there.  In that particular instance, that ended up costing about $1.2 million per year to run.  </p><p>  During the pilot period, the sources for that - we are going back a long time here - were a combination of the court budget, the City of New York and a number of foundations and local businesses which chipped into help fill out the budget.  The only caveat I would mention is that people were very careful that private money was not going to fund the core court functions, such as paying for the judge or the clerks or anything like that.  It is important that any private money is used for non-traditional purposes.</p></speech>

Very few social innovations are total successes or total failures.  Even though it has shut, there were some notable successes.  The evaluation, which came out in 2012 from the Ministry of Justice, suggests that when the North Liverpool Community Justice Centre opened in 2005, there was a fall in crime in north Liverpool and it fell to a greater degree over that period than across England and Wales more generally and, indeed, over the whole of Liverpool.  We are not quite sure of the association between what the court was doing and the relationship that had to crime.  Although it shut, there were things around re-offending that did not quite work but there were other really positive results.</p><p>  The question is, why?  If I was to offer one observation as to why north Liverpool has not quite been able to translate into a sustainable court, it is that community courts require good thorough planning which understands the local make-up.  That can be hard to pull off when one has a national pilot being driven from Whitehall, London that is trying to make a difference to something in north Liverpool.  That is a very important part of the picture as to why north Liverpool is not currently running.</p><p>  When the Ministry of Justice set it up, it put within the courts relative high fixed costs but when one has a declining caseload, that makes every case look very expensive.  That was part of the model created in 2005 when times were slightly better.  When one moves to 2012 and court budgets are being cut by 37% over the next five years, I totally understand where the Courts Service is coming from when it has something which, in cash terms, is quite expensive.  What I would suggest, based on the other community courts in which I have been lucky to work and observe, is that they seem to have had a more sustainable financing model around their operations.</p><p>  For many reasons, north Liverpool remains the outlier.  The point made by somebody earlier was that learning lessons is not just something one does from total successes or total failures but also from things that have mixed messages. </p></speech>

I chair another Oireachtas committee and we had a clash of schedules.  However, I have had a chance to catch up on some of the presentations.  Our committee finalised a report last year on penal reform.  We made five key recommendations, most notably a de-carceration strategy within our prison system of one third over the next ten years and to look at community service alternatives for minor, non-violent offences.  There is some good news in that the fines legislation will mean that in the near future, people will not go to prison for the non-payment of fines.  Our committee is open to alternatives, in particular looking at the issue of recidivism.</p> <p>Recidivism has a corrosive impact on the community&rsquo;s faith in the criminal justice system.  Without being terribly presumptuous, the committee would be open to the proposal from the Lord Mayor on having a pilot project in Dublin city.</p><p> On community buy-in, the delegation spoke about a culture change.  What is the advice, as well as the lessons to be learned from New York and other places that have implemented these courts, to facilitate this move from one court culture to this new approach?  The Law Society raised the issue of people&rsquo;s rights under the Constitution to, for example, access to a lawyer.  How will this be dealt with to ensure the person is clearly aware of his or her rights before making a decision to plead guilty?</p><p> For these courts to be successful there is an issue around resources.  In Dublin city, there is one recovery bed for every 400 drug addicts.  We have a real problem with homelessness.  There are issues, as raised by figures such as Fr. McVerry, about supports for those coming out of prison.  Mr. Tony McGillicuddy pointed out the lack of supports for prisoners coming back into society.  To get community buy-in with this system, one in which I believe, we need to ensure resources and alternatives are there for dealing with probation, housing, drug addiction supports and counselling.  If we are to take these people away from a life of societal failure - God knows what they have gone through in their own lives - to a path of recovery which helps with community healing, then resources need to be in place.</p></speech>

It should be a high-maintenance relationship.  Just like in any kind of relationship, one does not get to coast after a certain period.  If one has the right to access a lawyer in the legal system, community courts do not change that because they are part of the system.</p><p>  In every jurisdiction with which we have worked over the years, they all began about how their resources were maxed out.  Nobody ever felt they had excess capacity.  However, we found there was a total lack of communication among the different agencies and services involved.  They truly operated in silos with no perfect information shared about capacity or what was happening with a particular client.  Sharing information and collaborating are free.  All it takes is someone to co-ordinate this, a co-ordinating hub.  The way to balance the challenges in resources is to sprinkle in information-sharing and collaboration to see what it does to the picture.</p></speech>

Such was the level of desperation, I had people saying they would contribute money to a solution.</p><p>  The value of such a scheme for Dublin is significant.  The Grow Dublin task force, on which I also sit, has projected that if we could grow tourism in Dublin by 7% for the next six years, it would be worth &euro;1.2 billion to the economy along with 20,000 jobs.  There is significant willingness to get behind this initiative.</p><p>  On resources, I echo Mr. Lang&rsquo;s point about co-operation.  Since October on the policing forum, we have started to co-operate with the outreach teams, homeless services and the Garda.  While it will report in February, the feedback already is that it is making a difference.  We are doing it small scale with one person at a time.  It frees up garda&iacute; if there is a trust between them and a homeless person so that they can say they do not want to arrest them but have them call into Tony Duffin the following day.  Co-operation can lead to extra efficiencies.</p></speech>

Three years ago a policing forum was set up by the then Garda assistant commissioner.  I have had a retail business in Dublin city centre from the 1970s.  Despite the media, I have not seen such an effective committee as the Lord Mayor&rsquo;s.  The reason it is effective, as mentioned by members, the Lord Mayor and other guests, is down to communication.</p><p>  We have a serious problem with communicating.  We tend to operate in silos.  The business community is under much pressure.  If one does not pay one&rsquo;s bills, one closes.  That is it; there is no fairy story.  Accordingly, businesspeople will look at a problem, go over the top of it, around its edges and straight through it.  If they do not, they fail.  Businesspeople, many who may not see eye to eye, regularly come together for the common good.  For some reason, we do not do this socially.  I do not understand why but I suggest we must all work together in a much better fashion because we have gone through five years of pretty hard stuff.  The retail sector has really had the stuffing kicked out of it.</p><p>  The point that has come up, particularly from Mr. Julius Lang, is that there were people doing a good day&rsquo;s work in this area but there were three other organisations doing the same job.  We need to communicate more.  I am extremely pleased that the Lord Mayor referred to the new initiative by the Garda assistant commissioner, John Twomey, and the assistant city manager, Brendan Kenny, because it is working.  It is the first time in my long years working in the city an initiative has actually worked.</p></speech>

I found the presentations very interesting.  Last year, I had the good fortune, along with the Chairman, to visit Midtown Community Court in New York, as well as meeting the directors and teachers of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.  One of the directors informed that when he googled my name, he found out we both went to the same primary school as he was also born and reared in Dublin.</p><p>  I saw the operation of the community court at first hand with people called by their docket number, appearing before the judge, hearing their crime and how they were dealt with.</p> <p>As Mr. McGillicuddy said earlier, they were not sent off to a probation officer with a phone number but were told to go up to the sixth floor straight away.  We visited there afterwards and met the people up there who are running the operation on the sixth floor where these people were queuing up.  We met the counsellors, the lawyers and probably some interns and heard about the community services that people are given.  I came away blown away with optimism about this system.  Deputy Niall Collins asked earlier where they get the paint from if somebody is sent to take graffiti off the wall as part of community service.  This is where the business community comes in.  We listened and talked to business people there who told me it had cleaned up huge areas.  Their businesses had blossomed, new businesses were coming in and it had rejuvenated the centre of the city.  It was absolutely wonderful.  I came back full of ideas.  </p><p> We are talking about restorative justice, fines, sentencing and mediation and how it can work.  I am sure Mr. Justice Reilly is sitting there saying "I've been saying this for the past 20 years and you're only listening now."  However, I think we have it in all strands now.  Everybody is on board.  The idea of the one-stop shop which I took away from the centre is the important thing.  People should feel they are not being sent out the front door and have to find somewhere else to go.  People should know that they will go somewhere else within the building, will be met and will sit down with people.  It relates to the person or people in respect of the crime they have committed.  It is absolutely fantastic in the courts system and I know the Minister is completely committed to doing this.  I am sure resources have to come from somewhere for it to be a success.  It involves the courts system, lawyers, the business community and local community, as the Lord Mayor has said, because local communities are often affected by the crime so they must be dealt with as well.</p><p> Outreach is another issue.  We received a very good submission from Tiglin in my constituency in County Wicklow about rehabilitation.  This is probably for more than just the quality-of-life crimes.  We are coming together and moving in the right direction and we have the Minister pushing it for us.  We are right behind him.</p></speech>

I apologise to members of the committee.  They were stuck with me from 9.30 a.m. until about 1.00 p.m. as we were dealing with the justice and defence Estimates.  I know the Chairman has very kindly asked me to deliver a short address during the course of the dinner we will have.  It is bad enough hearing me once without hearing me twice.  This is something I have a lot of excitement about.  I empathise with Mr. Brennan and Mr. Justice Reilly in particular because they have a record of looking for change in this area and have done very significant work.  Having the opportunity today to look at it from an international perspective helps to broaden the insights we may have as to how things work in practice and what works and does not work.  It is also very important for the committee to think through issues that need to be thought through.  I will say much more later but I wish to make two particular points.</p><p>  In advancing this project, we need to look at how we do this - obviously involving communities - and look at it in a manner that brings a slightly different perspective.  I would see an initial project in the city centre as a pilot project in which the Department of Justice and Equality, the Courts Service, Dublin City Council and other services engage in a partnership to progress what I think will be a very important development in conjunction with the local business community.  The local business community has a very important role to play.  I am very conscious that for this to work, which is something I firmly believe in, it must be a fully integrated project.  I was pleased to hear people saying this.  It does not work as a post box; it does not work where a judge with limited supports recommends that individuals go to a range of other agencies, none of which are part of the infrastructure of what is there.  We have seen this in microcosm in dealing with the district family court in the city centre, where the mediation service is in the same building and where people come in to possibly go to war on a child custody or access issue and are first given the opportunity to have a conversation about the possibilities of mediation.  That is working to deflect people from unnecessary litigation and to deal with matters in a less contentious atmosphere.  The one-stop shop concept is of huge importance.  We will come back to that.  I will come back to what I think is worth exploring in the context of the business community and how it may perceive this.  We were dealing with our Estimates earlier and I am very conscious as Minister that I have fewer and fewer resources each year, but we can use resources very wisely and effectively.  A partnership that includes the business community, which may assist in the provision of some of the services that are not normally associated with our traditional courts structure, will be of great value.</p><p>  I thank the Chairman in particular.  I know this initiative is very dear to his heart and is this feeling is one that we share.  This has been a really valuable afternoon.  It is great to sit here and not have questions thrown at me.  I should do this more often.  It is fantastic watching other people in the hot seat and I think they have done really well.  I know Mr. Murphy would be really disappointed if I did not mention him.  One of the difficulties associated with being Minister is that while I was listening a dozen other things were happening that I must deal with, and these were being communicated to me.</p><p>  I would not like the wrong impression to arise, and I appreciate the very constructive contributions made by Mr. Murphy on behalf of the Law Society and Mr. McGillicuddy on behalf of the Bar Council, but there was one thing Mr. Murphy said that I would not like to leave unchallenged.  He used the phrase "the Probation Service is broken".  I assure him that it is far from broken.  It is doing extraordinary work at the moment under the leadership of Vivian Geiran and is engaging in innovative projects.  For the first time in the history of the State, we have a joint strategic programme between the Prison Service and the Probation Service.  Rather than not being able to cope with the work coming to it, we are looking at how we expand that work, again in the context of using resources wisely.  The Probation Service is particularly engaged in a very innovative way now.  In the past, when we released people from prison, we sent them to see their probation officers if they needed to remain under supervision.  The Probation Service is now engaged within the prisons and deals with people in the period prior to their release, looking at the supports that are required and what the service can do to ensure there is less re-offending.  There is a lot of very important work being done in that area and in the context of community service projects.  The Probation Service is working not just in the context of community service orders made under the original 1983 Act as amended over the years but in dealing with early releases under the new programme within the Prison Service.</p> <p>Approximately 500 prisoners have now been released early under this programme than would have been usual, in circumstances where they have been assessed as posing no risk to the community, have been of good behaviour in prison and have agreed to do community service in return for early release.  This is proving to be a very important and beneficial project.  We are discovering that fewer of those who are released in these circumstances are returning to crime or reoffending in the short term because they are doing something instantly meaningful upon their release.  They are not left in a position whereby they are effectively unemployed.  In excess of 100 people are currently on release under this scheme and the probation service is doing extraordinary work.  I realise Mr. Murphy may have not meant the phrase in the way he put it but I would not like the word to go out that this is a problem.  Like every Minister, I would love to have more resources and more people working in the service but the people who currently work in the service are doing an extraordinary job.</p></speech>

I thank Mr. David Brennan and the Dublin City Business Association for the work they have been doing on this issue over a considerable period of time.  Mr. Brennan is to be commended for the passion he brings to his work.  Mr. Justice Reilly has been an advocate of this approach for quite some time.  Mr. Lang has come a long way to be with us, while Mr. Bowen has had a shorter journey.  I thank both of them for their contributions.  We have met our friends from the Law Society and the Bar Council on previous occasions and we know we will meet them again.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.746" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014012900002#A00800"><p>Thank you, Chairman, for the suggestion that none of us should be devious.  That is a positive start to the morning.</p><p>  I welcome the opportunity to meet with the committee as it considers the 2014 Revised Estimates for my Department&rsquo;s group of Votes, which were published in December.  My earlier than usual appearance before the committee in relation to the 2014 Estimates has come about due to the rationalisation of the budgetary arrangements which aims to ensure that the Estimates are published prior to the commencement of the financial year rather than within the year to which they refer.  This is following through on the Government&rsquo;s commitment to D&aacute;il reform and is also consistent with the timelines for the budgetary process in other EU member states.</p><p>  In summary, there has not been a significant difference to the budgetary figures published on budget day in October, other than the inclusion of an amount of &euro;23 million in the justice and equality Vote in respect of Magdalen-related payments; an increased provision of &euro;2 million in respect of the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission; and an increased capital allocation of &euro;2 million in the courts Vote for the establishment of the new court of appeal.</p><p>  I am particularly pleased that additional provision is being made for each of the three important areas in question and I will elaborate more when dealing with the individual Votes later.  I am pleased that a gross provision of more than &euro;2.184 billion is available to the five votes in the justice sector for 2014 and, as in previous years, this allocation will be managed to ensure that optimum value is obtained right across the sector and any necessary reprioritisation of resources will take place as the year unfolds.</p><p>  A gross allocation of &euro;380.5 million is available to the justice and equality Vote, broken down into six separate programmes.  The range of programmes includes services towards maintaining a secure Ireland, working for safe communities, organisations which facilitate the provision and administration of justice, the equality and integration area, representing Ireland&rsquo;s interests abroad and contributing to economic recovery.  Even within the programmes the range of subheads is very broad.</p><p>  If we take programme A as an example, the budget for areas such as INIS, the Criminal Assets Bureau and services administered by the youth justice service, including funding for Garda youth diversion projects and young persons&rsquo; probation projects, are all included in this particular programme.</p><p>  I am pleased that I have been able to maintain funding for the programmes administered by the youth justice service to provide a deterrent to young people getting involved in the insidious spiral of criminal activity.  In all, it is estimated that more than 5,000 young people will come in contact with Garda youth diversion projects in 2014.  It is important to point out that the projects continue to focus and engage high-risk young people with more intensive interventions.</p> <p>The reviews of the scheme continually point to their effectiveness and I am determined, in so far as it is possible, that I will continue to maintain current levels of funding in this area.</p><p> Facilitating the provision and administration of justice in Programme C contains a significant allocation of &euro;23 million for Magdalen related payments.  As I have said previously, one of my priorities since taking up office as Minister for Justice and Equality has been to address the hurt felt by women who were in Magdalen laundries.  As a result we have had the McAleese report documenting the facts about Magdalen laundries and the Quirke report on the establishment of an <i>ex gratia </i>scheme and a comprehensive range of supports for the women involved.  The provision of this quantum of funding for 2014 will ensure the lump sum payments can be made to the women in question as soon as possible.  A formal letter of offer of what they will receive under the scheme has issued to more than 270 women at this stage.  As soon as the offers are accepted, payment will follow at an early date.  By the end of this month, payments will actually have issued to more than 100 applicants totalling &euro;3.5 million.  In the meantime, processing and verification work on other applications will continue with a view to an assessment of what they will receive under the scheme being notified to each of the women as soon as possible.</p><p> Members may recollect from when I appeared before them on a technical supplementary estimate for the Department of Justice and Equality Vote in November that I reallocated an additional &euro;7.3 million to the subhead dealing with the payment of compensation awards for personal injuries criminally inflicted.  I am pleased to say that almost all this allocation was spent in 2013 and it has practically cleared the backlog in awards which had built up.  This situation arose mainly due to a number of significant awards of compensation that had been made in recent years and had placed great strain on the scheme.  While the allocation from this cash-limited scheme is back to standard levels for 2014 the fact we are going into the year with the backlog almost eliminated is a very positive development.</p><p> I am also particularly pleased there is an increase of &euro;2 million, which is 45%, in the grant-in-aid allocation for the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission in 2014.  This delivers a very specific commitment I made to ensure appropriate funding was allocated to the new body.  It is important to recognise the commission is not simply the sum of the two existing organisations.  The upcoming legislation underpinning the establishment of the organisation will give it a number of enhanced functions, which are designed, in accordance with Government policy, to deliver a world class human rights and equality service.  The additional funding demonstrates the Government&rsquo;s commitment in this area and will enable the new organisation to develop its remit in a structured and co-ordinated manner from the outset.</p><p> Before moving off the Department of Justice and Equality Vote it should be noted that practically all of the planned staffing resources and structures are now in place for the Insolvency Service, under the contribute to economic recovery subhead in Programme F, and it is very much open for business.  This is an outstanding achievement considering the relevant legislation was only enacted a little over a year ago and the service was only formally established last March.  I compliment those within the Insolvency Service of Ireland and in the wider Department who have facilitated the establishment of this office.  There was always going to be a lead-in time, before demand for the service ramped up to expected levels.  I am confident this service will play a very strong role in dealing with the legacy of considerable personal debt which has built up largely as a consequence of the economic crash and will act as a springboard to a better economic future for many hard-pressed individuals in our society.</p><p> The largest part of the budget for justice goes to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, at almost &euro;1.344 billion in gross terms in 2014.  The pay and superannuation component amounts to 87% of the gross allocation.  The Commissioner has approximately 13,100 members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na plus 1,165 Garda Reserve members available to him to provide a policing service.  An additional 99 men and women are in training for the Garda Reserve.  Approximately 2,100 civilian staff provide essential support services in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> The response to the recent Garda recruitment campaign has been very welcome.  The Public Appointments Service has commenced processing the applications so the successful candidates will be able to enter the Garda College as new recruits later this year.  Following the first 32 weeks of tuition, there will be a further 72 weeks of on the job experiential learning.  On conclusion of these two years of training, the Garda member will be awarded a BA in Applied Policing.  This development is particularly welcome as the last recruits entered the Garda College in Templemore in May 2009, after which the moratorium on public service recruitment was put in place.</p><p> All Garda Vote expenditure is accounted for under one programme, which is working with communities to protect and serve, and the various output targets for 2013 and 2014 reflect this goal.  Targets relating to safety in communities, through enhanced visibility, engagement and communication are not just aspirations; they are real objectives happening on the ground every day.  They complement other core objectives such as reductions in violent crime, increased detection rates and the targeting and disruption of organised crime groups.  Garda operations are structured to achieve these objectives.</p><p> Revised rostering arrangements now ensure garda&iacute; are on duty when needed most by the communities they serve.  The rationalisation of Garda stations means more garda&iacute; are freed up from routine administrative work and available and visible in the community at times of greatest need.</p><p> The most recently published CSO crime statistics for the end of the third quarter in 2013 reflect a continued reduction in most crime categories, and a total reduction of more than 17,500 crimes over the previous 12 month period.  These statistics underline the positive impact the Garda is having on crime and the success of the Commissioner's strategy to maximise the use of resources with intelligent and targeted deployment.  It is important and right I congratulate the Commissioner and the Garda on their achievements in this context.  It is regrettable they do not get wider publication.  I do not believe the public realises or understands the reduction in the instances of crime and the very substantial successes the Garda has achieved.  Unfortunately, media attention tends to be on other issues.  A reduction in crime providing greater safety in communities is of maximum importance and of very particular interest to all who reside throughout the country.</p><p> Recent operations such as Operation Stilts, which is an ongoing covert operation targeting anti-social behaviour and drug-related crime in Dublin city centre locations, is an example of such focused Garda activity which is making a difference.  In this context also, I am pleased to note that many of the crimes which affect quality of life in the community were also down in the latest figures, including public order offences, down 7,159 or 15.9%.</p><p> It is particularly noticeable that the targeted operations by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na throughout the country, such as Operation Fiacla, are particularly successful in tackling property crime.  At the end of December 2013, Operation Fiacla had led to the arrests of 7,610 persons, and to 4,342 persons being charged under the operation.  The continued impact of these and other Garda operations on burglary is reflected in a significant decrease of 10.4% in this category of offence, further accelerating the reductions seen since earlier this year.  Instances of robbery have decreased by 5.2% from 2,861 to 2,713.</p><p> I am also pleased that despite the continuing difficult financial backdrop to the Estimates I am able to maintain what I consider the very necessary investment in the Garda transport fleet.  Including the &euro;4 million provided for Garda transport purchases in 2014, there will have been &euro;18 million spent on the Garda fleet in the period from 2012 to 2014.  This means 651 vehicles will have been purchased in the period from 2012 to 2013 period with additional purchases to be made from the further &euro;4 million available for the fleet in 2014.  The corresponding figure for the previous three-year period from 2009 to 2011 was less than &euro;5 million with 217 vehicles purchased.</p><p> Turning now to prisons, a gross expenditure budget of &euro;324.5 million is being provided for the prisons Vote in 2014.  This expenditure is provided under one all-encompassing programme which encapsulates the essence of the Prison Service, which is to provide safe and secure custody, dignity of care and rehabilitation to prisoners for safer communities.</p><p> Members of the committee will be aware the contract to build a new modern prison on the site of the existing Cork Prison was recently signed.  It is expected that construction of the new prison in Cork will be completed by the end of 2015.  The refurbishment and modernisation work in Mountjoy Prison is continuing and on completion of the Mountjoy D wing refurbishment this year all cells in Mountjoy Prison will have in-cell sanitation services.  I can well remember a time when I was informed by one of my predecessors that to achieve this would be completely impossible.</p><p> Projects such as these are examples of the Government delivering on its commitment in the programme for Government for the modernisation of the prison estate and the elimination of slopping out.</p> <p>In all, the prisons building capital budget is &euro;28.5 million in 2014, including &euro;2.4 million in the carry-over of an unspent amount from 2013.  It is important to add that there is considerable economic benefit to expenditure of this scale in the broader community, particularly in the construction sector in the context of the creation of jobs and economic activity of an indirect nature that derives from those jobs in the areas in which construction work is taking place.</p><p> Needless to say, the building and refurbishment of prisons, while very necessary to provide a more humane environment for everyone in the service, is only part of the multifaceted approach to the reform and development of the service.  The community return programme has been a really positive development.  As well as allowing prisoners to complete their sentence by way of performing a service to the community, the programme has significantly helped these prisoners to successfully resettle in their communities.  The national roll-out of the programme saw the establishment of a new co-located unit based in the Probation Service headquarters, including an official from the Irish Prison Service.  This is a new departure for both services.  I believe this joined-up thinking and joined-up approach to be of particular importance.  This unit now manages the community return programme nationally and has taken on responsibility for the co-ordination of several local interagency projects in Dublin, Cork and Limerick.  This enhanced integration between both services is the realisation of the commitment in the programme for Government to ensure better co-ordination in order to create and integrate offender management programmes.</p><p> In addition to community return, the unlocking community alternatives scheme, UCAS, and the community support scheme have been set up in both Cork and Mountjoy prisons in an attempt to address the recidivism levels of those serving sentences of less than 12 months from those catchment areas.  The UCAS and community support scheme groups comprise a number of prison-based personnel representing the discipline grades and therapeutic services, as well as community support workers based in the community.  The groups engage with prisoners shortly after committal and seek to identify risk factors, make appropriate referrals and prepare a sentence management plan in each case.  The primary aim of these schemes is to reduce the current recidivism rates by arranging for additional support structures and provide for a more structured form of temporary release.  These are pilot schemes and will be reviewed in 12 months in order to assess whether they have had a positive impact on re-offending rates.  It is particularly important that we continually look at and examine what we are doing to ensure that, in the context of those who are serving prison sentences, there are positive steps taken to try to reduce the level of re-offending.  That is of benefit, particularly to the wider community as well as to those who have offended in the past.</p><p> The incentivised regimes policy provides for a differentiation of privileges between prisoners according to their level of engagement with services and quality of behaviour.  The objective is to provide tangible incentives to prisoners to participate in structured activities and to reinforce incentives for good behaviour, leading to a safer and more secure environment.  The indications are that the policy is working well.  Earlier this month, 59% of prisoners had earned the privilege of being on the enhanced regime, 38% were on the standard regime and 3% on the basic level.</p><p> The changes to the way in which the service operates have been brought about largely under the Irish Prison Service, IPS, transformation programme.  This has included the development and implementation of new working practices, together with a review of all tasks, posts, staffing levels and processes in the prisons, greater use of technology and greater interagency co-operation within the justice sector to deliver cross-agency efficiencies.  A vital step in the reform process is the introduction of a new grade to replace the current grade of prison clerk.  The clerks will be redeployed to positions more suitable to their skill sets and training and will be replaced by the new grade of prison administration and support officer, PASO.  I am informed that in the region of 108 PASO grades have commenced working in the IPS since late 2013.</p><p> There is some way to go in relation to improving the conditions in our prisons, but significant progress continues to be made.  Large infrastructural building projects are being complemented by improved processes and ways of operating, together with measures for more effective management of persons committed to prisons.  I want to pay tribute to the governors in each of our prisons for the jobs they are doing, to all of our prison staff and to the co-operation from the representative body of prison officers, which has always constructively engaged in seeking to facilitate and advance the reform projects that are being implemented.</p><p> The gross budget allocated to the courts Vote in 2014 is &euro;104.565 million.  There is also an appropriation-in-aid allocation of &euro;46.535 million, of which &euro;42.493 million relates to fees for various categories of courts transactions.  All expenditure in the courts Vote is directed towards one key programme, that is, managing the courts and supporting the Judiciary.</p><p> Despite the challenging budgetary environment and reduced staff numbers, I am pleased that there has been an increase in scheduled court sittings in each of the years 2012 and 2013.  The number of scheduled sittings has increased from 20,462 in 2011 to 23,700 in 2013.  Allied to this, various measures have been put in place to reduce waiting times.  These include initiatives taken by the President and judges of the High Court, including list management measures in Dublin and in respect of certain provincial personal injury lists in order to reduce the number of older cases in the lists and improve waiting times.  In addition, the President of the High Court arranged that judges were available during the month of September to hear actions in personal injury, family law and commercial list matters and common law motions.  A significant number of additional sittings were held in all court jurisdictions during 2013, with 20 additional sitting weeks in the High Court, 80 additional sitting weeks in the Circuit Court, over 500 special sittings of the District Court and September sittings in both the Supreme Court and the Court of Criminal Appeal.  These measures are particularly welcome and are contributing in no small way to the overall reform initiatives in place to bring about a more efficient Courts Service.</p><p> Various other reforms continue to be progressed, including the combined court office project, which effectively means that offices for all levels of courts have been combined in 23 counties, leading to a much more effective use of resources.  In fact, there are only two provincial offices, those being, Tralee and Wicklow, where administrative operations remain to be combined.  These will be completed in early 2014.</p><p> It is important also to acknowledge that the establishment of the Insolvency Service has had an impact on the Courts Service.  During 2013, the official assignee in bankruptcy and the staff of the office transferred from the Courts Service to the Insolvency Service of Ireland.  A number of other posts have been filled in the Courts Service to support the introduction of insolvency functions in the Circuit Court jurisdiction.</p><p> Preparations are already under way within the Courts Service for the establishment of the Court of Appeal following the constitutional referendum last autumn.  As previously mentioned, a sum of &euro;2 million is provided for the capital infrastructure necessary to get the court in place later this year.  Other related operational and staffing requirements are also being considered by the Courts Service.  I expect the new court will deal with most cases that are currently dealt with by the Supreme Court, thus reducing that court's workload and allowing it to focus on the development of the law.  The need for a Court of Appeal arises mainly from the ongoing significant backlog of cases before the Supreme Court and the consequent long delays in cases being dealt with by that court.  The impact of the establishment of the Court of Appeal should be obvious in terms of reductions in delays once it is established and becomes operational.</p><p> The Property Registration Authority, PRA, has a net budgetary provision of &euro;30.108 million in the current year.  Apart from payroll costs, the other main areas of expenditure include the maintenance of information technology and the development of new systems on which the PRA is heavily dependent for improved efficiency and quality customer service.  A total of &euro;1.545 million, being 5% of the gross allocation for 2014, has been provided for ICT-related expenditure.  A provision of &euro;3 million, being 10% of its allocation, is for payments to Ordnance Survey Ireland, the State mapping agency, for the supply, licensing and usage of mapping data.</p><p> Registration of applications for changes on existing registered titles is the main area of work for the PRA.  In 2013, in excess of 177,000 registrations were completed.  This level of activity resulted in over 500,000 changes being recorded on the Land Registry.  As a result of the investment in technology, the PRA has developed extensive online services, which are available immediately over the Internet via the <i>landdirect.ie</i>service.  During 2013, over 2 million searching and certification transactions were processed through the <i>landdirect.ie</i>portal.</p> <p>The modernisation programme engaged in by the PRA has provided a very detailed database of property ownership and related information.  This has been a powerful enabler in facilitating the organisation to assist other Departments and agencies in the delivery of Government policy in a value for money manner.  Thus, for example, the PRA is able to provide advanced spatial information for the National Roads Authority&rsquo;s national motorway programme, input for a number of the Environment Protection Agency&rsquo;s regulatory projects, and information to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government on the implementation of EU directives.  It is also working with the Office of Public Works in establishing a register of State property.</p><p> Members will appreciate there are many other activities in which the Department of Justice and Equality is engaged.  Were I to detail all of them and each item to which funding is allocated in this submission, I would still be speaking in two hours.  I have merely touched on some of the central issues of relevance.  However, I am happy to address any issues arising.</p><p> The total Estimate for the justice sector in 2014 is &euro;2.184 billion in gross terms and almost &euro;1.961 billion in net terms.  As I have set out, it covers five Votes and a broad range of areas within the justice and equality sector.</p></speech>

Also, is he aware of the ongoing commentary by the Garda Representative Association not only nationally but regionally?  In my county of Donegal, the GRA representative made very alarming statements recently in regard to the inability of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with crime in that region.  Has the Minister met recently with the GRA about its concerns in this regard? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.756" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014012900005#D00800"><p>I note what the Deputy says.  I find continually depressing claims made by the GRA regarding the incapacity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na to deal with issues of crime.  It would be appropriate for it to on some occasions acknowledge the enormous success of the force and its own members.  I have detailed some of those successes this morning.  As a representative body, the GRA has an important role to play.  However, it generates a misconception on the part of the public as to the capacity, expertise and successes of the force and contributes to public alarm by making people unnecessarily concerned about the capabilities of the force.</p><p>  For some time we have had a continuous stream of information, objectively provided by the Central Statistics Office and not subject to any political interference of any description and which could not be validly challenged by any Deputy, which indicates there has been a substantial reduction in crime.  The figure in this regard for the most recent 12 month period for which we have statistics is 17,500.  There have been reductions across 12 of the 14 categories, and where there have been increases, these have been very small.  I believe people should be responsible.  This applies to individuals and organisations when addressing this issue.  I have full confidence in the Garda Commissioner and his leadership and the steps being taken with regard to addressing issues of criminality, which requires a targeted approach as opposed to a generalised approach.  The targeted approach of the force with regard to identifying particular areas of crime, those who are suspected of engaging in crime, the prevention of crime and speedy arrest of individuals who have committed serious crimes is clear evidence of this.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.758" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="09:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014012900005#D01000"><p>I am coming to that.  The Deputy also asked about the GRA's commentary, which I think we need to address.  We all know that regardless of how many members of the force we have or how efficient the force, there will always be bad people who do bad things and who commit crime.  It is important we keep this in perspective because for an individual who is the victim of a crime, particularly a personalised crime such as a burglary or assault, it is a profound and terrifying event in their life.  It is important for the sake of the peace of mind of people in the general community that these crimes are not exaggerated.  In comparison with most other countries, our level of crime is very low.  We should not denigrate or in any way undermine or cause loss of public confidence in the capacity of the force.</p><p>  As I stated, the objective strength of the Garda force is 13,000.  I do not wish to see that strength fall below 13,000.  The Commissioner and I are at one in this regard.  I had hoped it would have proved possible to commence the recruitment campaign a little earlier than was the case.  I do not wish to engage with anybody here.  However, all Deputies are aware that issues arising on the public pay side and the negotiation of the arrangements now in place took a considerable period to work through during the first half of 2013.  Until the Haddington Road agreement was in place, I was not in a position to move forward on the issue of Garda recruitment.  Had the representative bodies taken a different approach and engaged at the time of Croke Park II - I do not want to fight an old battle because I welcome their engagement on the Haddington Road agreement - I would have been in a position to commence a recruitment campaign earlier.  I was not in a position to deal with that issue until the issue of where the State finances stood had been addressed and until my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Howlin, was in a position to sanction my proceeding with the recruitment campaign.  He was not in a position to do that.</p><p>  Deputies will note that shortly after the putting in place of the Haddington Road agreement, I announced the recruitment campaign.  We now have 13,100 garda&iacute; in the force.  I do not know how many members of the force may retire during the course of this year.  Various estimates in this regard have been provided.  However, estimates provided in the past have proved wrong.  We are proceeding as rapidly as we can with the recruitment campaign.  I expect the first batch of recruits to enter Templemore in July.  If the Public Appointments Service can deal more quickly with matters, they will enter a little earlier.  Some 25,000 applications were received.  This matter is being dealt with by a completely objective service in a considered and appropriate manner.  It has to work its way through a large volume of applications, and in that regard it has a process to go through.  I expect we will have a minimum of 300 new recruits entering Templemore in 2014.</p> <p> I expect they may enter in two different groupings, with an initial and a second group.  The second group will not wait for the graduation of the first group as the college is gearing up to be able to deal with matters in that way.  Those numbers may change and there could be a somewhat larger number.  I cannot say with certainty that the numbers within the force during the course of this year will not fall below the 13,000 figure because of the timeframe involved in processing recruitment and the 32-week course to be taken.  If it does fall below that figure, very rapidly in 2015 the figure should be restored.  With the new system, after the 32 weeks the trainee garda&iacute; get their badges and can engage in community policing and other policing duties.  They will still operate under supervision, and it is a better system than keeping them, in effect, in Templemore for a lengthy period.</p><p> If the issues I mentioned had been resolved earlier in 2013, we would have started a little earlier in Templemore.  That is the position.  I have the greatest confidence that the Garda can continue its focused work under the Garda Commissioner's leadership.</p></speech>

Will the ongoing recruitment campaign, which has seen in excess of 25,000 applications, have a panel?  How long will the panel remain in existence for people to be recruited?  The Minister indicated there will be 300 recruits for 2014 but what numbers are envisaged for 2015 and 2016?</p><p>  With regard to payroll, the estimate has dropped from &euro;948 million to &euro;863 million.  What is the underlying head count for that figure?  The Haddington Road agreement will have something to do with the reduction.  The Minister has indicated he does not know the projected number of retirements this year but how is that factored in?  We had this debate on the Supplementary Estimate at the end of last year and we examined how An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na does its manpower or resource planning while meeting objectives in the annual policing plan.  Will we return at the end of the year with a Supplementary Estimate for pay for serving members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

I keep reading newspaper reports that 25,000 people have applied and we are only recruiting 300 people, but that is not right.  There will be a panel arising from the applications made.  This is not a once-off and I hope we are getting to a position where we can stabilise matters.  As the Deputy knows, prior to 2009 it would have been the norm for a certain number to be recruited to the Garda every 12 or 18 months, with a panel existing for a period following advertisement.  It is envisaged that at the end of this process, apart from the recruits I hope will enter Templemore this year, a panel will be created.  It is my hope and intention that from that panel there will be further recruits entering Templemore in 2015.</p><p>  It is a little previous to speak about numbers in that context as the numbers given for recruitment this year are approximate; the numbers could vary because of a range of considerations that could arise.  As we come into the latter part of 2014 we will consider what may be necessary in the 2015 context.  I hope the perception generated that 25,000 people are applying for only 300 or 350 places has been counteracted.  That information is not correct and a panel will be created.</p><p>  The Deputy asked how long the panel will remain in existence.  We have not made a final decision on the period that the panel will exist.  We will make the decision at some point.  I am open to correction from my officials but my recollection is that panels were created without a particular announcement made on the length of life that a panel would have.  People would be recruited from the panel and after a certain period had elapsed and when it seemed reasonable, matters would be advertised for new applicants and a new panel would be created.  Being on the panel does not guarantee an individual that he or she would enter Templemore.  The chances would depend on the number of people on the panel and where the person featured.</p><p>  Financial figures are influenced by the Haddington Road agreement and the changes effected by it.  This is not an exact science and I do not have a crystal ball, so I cannot predict with certainty how many members of the force will retire this year, required overtime, special events that need special security arrangements or emergencies.  There is a range of issues that make this part of the Estimates a very inexact science.  We have set out where matters stand in the context of the Estimates.  I recall last year the Deputy and I had a exchange on the issue.  I do not know if it generated from this type of meeting or an exchange on Question Time but there were all kinds of interesting newspaper headlines to the effect that we would run out of money to pay the Garda by the autumn.  Even some of the Garda representative bodies were saying that.  There is no question of running out of money to pay the garda&iacute;.  We have Estimates and they are our best guess or assessment as to where we are.  There is a range of imponderable and unidentifiable circumstances that could arise and produce a variance.</p><p>  Should it be necessary to provide for a Supplementary Estimate, we can do so; the Deputy knows this as we did so recently, and a proportion of what was required came out of savings from other parts of my Department's Estimates.  I cannot predict this with absolute certainty but I hope we will not enter into another public exchange and that we will not find incorrect media headlines of an alarmist nature, suggesting that members of the force may towards the end of the year not get paid.  It is not an issue and there was never a question of that.  I hope what was said about that last year has established the untruth in that issue, and I hope we will not see it appear again on the horizon.</p></speech>

The work done by the administrative staff is now freeing up members of the force.  I do not have an immediate statistic for the Deputy of the number of other members of the force who could be freed if we recruited more civilian staff.  From my knowledge of visiting Garda stations I know there is still work done by members of the force that could be done by civilian staff if it were possible to recruit additional individuals to the civilian side.  There is no funding available to expand in that way.  In the years to come there would be benefits to be gained by bringing in additional civilian staff and freeing uniformed members to a greater extent.</p> <p>Substantial progress has been made in that context.  </p></speech>

I do know that in some communities there has been arrangements made for garda&iacute; to be available in local community centres in areas in which stations have been closed.  There was not a necessity for any specific subhead that comes under the general Garda Vote and is a matter of deployment of personnel which would come under the Garda Commissioner and those working under him.  Some of these issues, of course, will be addressed locally by the chief superintendent or superintendent in determining what are the local needs.</p></speech>

Is there a minimum or standard provision of transport in each Garda district or division?  I know that we need a fleet of vehicles.  Is there a fleet management policy?  Last week I was told that a district the size of County Louth in my constituency was down to one car.  It is the old chestnut that one cannot have a car at every crossroad and one cannot have garda&iacute; at every crossroads.  We all live in the real world in that regard.  In terms of a fleet management policy what is the minimum acceptable standard in terms of the provision of transport in each district?  I accept that one must differentiate between urban and rural districts.</p></speech>

I can tell the Deputy that there is no shortage of new vehicles.  If the Deputy had visited, I suspect, the Garda headquarters in Phoenix Park this morning he would have seen a number of vehicles waiting to go out.  A substantial number of vehicles were purchased towards the end of the year and they get fitted out for specific Garda requirements.  They are allocated based on operational need by the Commissioner.</p><p>  I cannot comment on the position in the district that the Deputy mentioned.  If there is a need for a new or additional vehicle there then I expect that is something that has been communicated by the chief superintendent to Garda headquarters.  There is a very substantial, now, number of new vehicles being distributed.  I think Deputy Finian McGrath was not here yet when we dealt with this matter.  I detailed the numbers of new vehicles that have been acquired, the additional &euro;4 million available this year for the purchase of new vehicles.  It is an unprecedented number in a very short period of time despite the financial difficulties that exist.  I would hope, Deputy Collins, that there is not a difficulty in the district he referenced.  It may well be the case that they are about to be the recipients of some of the vehicles that were acquired at the end of December this year.  I do not know the detail of that.</p></speech>

I do not think there is an overall plan that designates how many vehicles one must have per head of population or per number of garda&iacute; within an area.  I think it depends on the operational needs within the particular area and they are very carefully assessed.</p></speech>

Those vehicles are in the course of currently being fitted out and distributed to the various districts.  On top of that, there is a further &euro;4 million.</p><p>  I would have previously mentioned that there has been very substantial investment in the Garda fleet.  In effect there has been &euro;18 million, which is an unprecedented sum in a short period of time, spent on the Garda fleet in the period 2012 to the end of 2014.  That means that 651 vehicles have been purchased in the 2012-13 period.  There will be additional purchases to be made this year out of the &euro;4 million.  To give the Deputy an insight regarding the corresponding figure for the previous three years, the 2009-11 period.  Compared with the &euro;18 million that has been spent in this three year period, there was less than &euro;5 million spent and only 217 vehicles purchased.  The problem with the decrease in the number of vehicles derived from the very small numbers that were required during what was a period of financial difficulty.  I am not blaming a previous government but it was during a period of major financial difficulty.  When we came in we saw that there was these difficulties.  It was not something that I could start addressing until 2012.  I inherited my predecessor's 2011 budget.  There would be very substantial numbers of cars acquired.  They are currently, as I know, being allocated based on operational and during the course of this year there will be further vehicles required.</p></speech>

There is a budgetary roller coaster of hours and financial allocation.  I got the sense the helicopters are vital.  It was an education for me because I thought of it as concerning pursuit of vehicles.  We think of TV news images of the pursuit of a driver by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na but helicopters are critical to policing support.  Is the Minister looking at this area?  Has there been dialogue with the support unit?  Is there a need to provide more resources?  Has the Minister talked to the Garda Commissioner?  We get the sense that the service plays a critical role in the pursuit of criminals.  It can identify a person hidden in a hedge through heatseeking technology.</p></speech>

They play an important role.  It is a matter for the Garda Commissioner when to deploy that part of the service based on operational assessments.  There are occasions when it is required and other times when it is not.  It is a broader issue in the context of the overall policing strategy.  The question is how best to use the capabilities we have within the resources available.  That is a matter for the judgment of the Garda Commissioner.  I admire and appreciate the work the unit does.  I have visited it and I am aware of its capabilities and the backup and assistance it provides to members of the force on the ground.  It is ultimately a matter for the Garda Commissioner when to deploy the unit in terms of the type of activity required and the issues that arise.</p></speech>

Unless criminality and the pursuit of criminal gangs has reduced dramatically, it strikes me that the unit is not getting enough resources allocated as a vital backup.  It is a precious resource to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in combating criminality, particularly in dangerous pursuit situations.</p></speech>

The Deputy is looking at maintenance expenditure and a substantial amount of that expenditure is taken up on the defence side.  When we come to the defence Vote, some of it deals with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na helicopter service, although it may not be identified as such.  The Department of Defence and the Air Corps maintain the fixed wing aircraft.  Some additional maintenance arises.  There is connectivity between the two and there is not an issue of reducing the moneys available for maintenance so that the helicopters are used less frequently.  Safety is the predetermined and most important criterion and maintenance is crucial to the safety of those who are using the helicopter.</p><p>  This is not really an issue because the expertise in the defence side means joined-up thinking is going on.  Instead of being dealt with in a piecemeal fashion, with separate maintenance contracts, it is dealt with in a manner that is financially efficient.</p></speech>

Where are the figures for hours?  I have seen some data about the hours the helicopters are deployed.  There is no doubt there has been a reduction in the number of hours the helicopters are deployed.  Perhaps the Minister can examine the area and discuss it with the Commissioner and the unit.  It may be that, for operational reasons, it was genuinely not required and I am happy if that is the case but I have a concern that the decision is a budgetary rather than an operational one.  That would be unfortunate in terms of supporting the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the ground.</p></speech>

As the Minister knows, our committee worked very hard on putting forward proposals for penal reform, about which we are very proud.  We made five key recommendations.  The Chairman launched our report and the launch was very well attended.  If those recommendations were implemented, particularly with regard to de-carceration of one third over ten years and using community service alternatives to incarceration, it would greatly help.  It would be better for society, which is the most important point, but it would also very much help to reduce this budget.  I ask the Minister to give his opinion on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.830" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014012900009#H00400"><p>I have said it before but am happy to repeat again that I very much appreciate the work done by the committee in this area.  The report produced was excellent.  It followed along the route of the reforms that we want to implement.  Some of the issues I referenced earlier were also referenced in the committee's report and are ones which the committee was very anxious we address.  I appreciate the support of the committee for the community return programme that is in place.  I also appreciate the committee's support for the increased use of community service orders, which is very important.  The committee's report fed into work that is going on in my Department currently.  A departmental committee, with some outside representatives on it, is looking at the areas of punishment and re-offending and I expect it to report to me by Easter.  The original intention was that the committee would report by Christmas but there were some additional issues that the committee wanted to consider and I felt it was better that it had additional time and comprehensively covered every issue it wished to cover, rather than cutting the process short.  This committee's very excellent report fed into that process but that is not delaying what I describe as the reform process because as is clear from the outline I gave in my opening comments, there is a revolution going on with regard to the manner in which we are approaching and dealing with prison issues, offenders and recidivism.  There has been enormous change effected, not just in the context of the structure of our prisons, but also the manner in which prison officers are deployed; the extent to which we are trying to increase the number of organisations involved, on a communal basis, with former prisoners; the integrated plan which we now have between the prison and probation services, which did not exist previously; the engagement of the probation service with prisoners at an earlier stage, pending release; and the incentivised programme that I mentioned and that is improving behaviour within our prisons.  Under the latter programme, if prisoners behave well and participate in various programmes, they see an immediate benefit in terms of what is available to them within the prison service.  All of this is part of an overall major reform plan to completely change the manner in which we approach things.</p><p>  There are three issues that are of enormous importance to the public.  The first is that those who have committed serious crimes pay the penalty and fully serve their sentences.  The second is that the wider community feels that the penalties that can be imposed will have some deterrent impact.  The third is that once people have been punished, be that through the use of community service orders, incarceration or been given assistance, such as in tackling alcohol and drug addiction, that there is not a repeat of offences previously committed.  We have to reduce our level of recidivism in the interests of the broader community.  I very much appreciate the high level of support from this committee and across both Houses of the Oireachtas, from all sides, for this very constructive approach.  The committee's report was of great value and I will be very happy when we have the final work-out of what we will add to the new strategy, hopefully at the end of April, to make it available to the committee.  I look forward to hearing the committee's views on it.  Members will see that the work they did on their report has contributed very positively to it.  It will set an additional road-map for where we travel in the years to come.</p></speech>

The works required in D wing will be undertaken this year.  By the time we get to mid- or late 2014, there will be in-cell sanitation throughout the prison.  The work that the Deputy should have seen when he was there will transform the prison.  For completeness, I will also deal with Cork Prison.  I visited Cork Prison very soon after being appointed Minister.  The staff there, under the Governor, do extraordinary work in very difficult conditions.  Cork Prison is a poorly-constructed facility in which we cannot provide in-cell sanitation.  In my view, the facilities for education, training and re-training are also inadequate.  That is why we are going ahead with Cork Prison.  The construction on the prison should be complete by mid-2015.  I mentioned in my opening address that all works will be complete by the end of 2015.  Once the construction is complete, there will be a fitting out stage before it can be used.  Then we will have a prison in Cork with in-cell sanitation and the existing prison will cease to operate.  Thereafter, there will be fewer than 100 cells across the prison service which do not have in-cell sanitation, in Limerick and Portlaiose prisons.  It is my determination that we address those as well.  We have been transforming the prisons in the country since 2011 so that we will have a prison structure that is appropriate in the 21st century and not based on the 19th century, one that respects human rights and that ensures that those serving sentences are treated in an appropriate manner.  We are working to meet the standards which, as a State, we should adhere to.</p></speech>

This relates to prisoner catering, clothing, bedding, furniture, cleaning and laundry, gratuities, medical supplies, work training and recreation.  Do members wish to discuss matters arising under these headings?  We will proceed to subhead A5, a new subhead to identify separately fleet management and other operational costs, which were previously contained within other subheads in the Vote.  The Estimate is approximately &euro;3 million.  As far as I can see there is no change to the educational services Estimate from 2013 to 2014.  This provision covers expenditure on each occasion for equipment, appeals and fees, payments to libraries, in-service training,and services from external agencies.  Again there is no change in compensation paid to offenders while in custody.</p></speech>

We note there is a staff of 927 full-time equivalents at the end of the year in the Courts Service.</p><p>  There is no change in travel and subsistence, however there is a slight change in the Estimate for incidental expenses, training, juries, legal services.  There is no change in post and communication or office machinery and external IT services.  There is a slight reduction in the Estimate for office premises expenses.  Whereas there is no change in the Estimate for consultancy and services value for money policy reviews there is a slight increase in subhead A3 courthouse capital works.</p></speech>

People accompanied by children find themselves in a very stressful situation when preparing for family law courts.  The courthouse is like a cattle mart with different types of cases waiting to be heard and the people in civil law cases and others must wait for long periods.  In terms of design, are new court buildings being designed in anticipation of dedicated family courts sitting on separate days from the courts hearing civil cases?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.856" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014012900010#J00900"><p>The Deputy may be aware that under existing legislation going back to the Judicial Separation and Family Law Reform Act 1989, there is an obligation on the courts to ensure when hearing family cases, for example separation cases or cases in relation to children, that they sit on different days or at different times from other sittings.  This has applied from that time to separation cases.  Similar provisions were transposed into the Family Law (Divorce) Act 1996 and generally that applies across the board in the context of family law issues and a range of legislation.  We are looking at the creation of a unified system of family courts and considering how best to proceed in that context.  This gives rise to issues, a possible constitutional change, the need for legislation and the architecture of what those courts would look like.  At present there are fragmented jurisdictions where, for example, the Circuit and the District Court can deal with overlapping issues and the Circuit and the High Court can deal with other overlapping issues and some are exclusive to the High Court with the result that across the broad range of family law issues there is a multiplicity of different judges and different courts dealing with similar circumstances in respect of different people.  There is also the additional layer of dealing with child care cases.</p><p>  We are engaged actively in looking at how we proceed down this route.  It is likely that I will bring proposals to the Government during the course of this year but I cannot give an exact date yet.  There is the structural issue.  We clearly do not have unlimited resources to start building a whole range of specialised courts across the country.  In other countries, such as certain states in Australia, there are wonderful facilities, such as individualised family courts that do not deal with any other business of any description in the court context.  We are looking at how we deal with this in the context of our limited resources and the existing court building structure.  The Courts Service has been undertaking work in courts that hear a substantial number of family law cases to provide additional consultation facilities.  In some areas where it has done that, the provision is not adequate because the Courts Service is limited in what it can do by the nature of the building.  This is an issue in which we are engaged in dialogue.  No final conclusions have been reached but I hope that as we go through the year we will be in a position to make decisions and make some important announcements and then progress the legislative agenda with regard to the creation of an integrated unified family court system.</p></speech>

The Court of Appeal will effectively have a civil division and a criminal division.  It is anticipated that the civil side of the Court of Appeal will sit in the Four Courts and the criminal side will sit in the new modern criminal court complex.  There is work being done on that.  The Courts Service is involved in looking at these issues and, of course, it is very important that the Judiciary are consulted through the Chief Justice.  My Department is looking at these issues.  The issues range from the construction and renovations that may be necessary to create the framework of the court so that it is district from other courts, what software may be necessary so that we have the best possible high tech arrangements to reduce the amount of paperwork necessary and to maximise efficiencies.  There is the cost of any additional staff that may be required for the Court of Appeal.  There are issues also regarding whether some of the back-up staff and administrative staff may be available within the existing staff, either the Courts Service, the Department of Justice and Equality or across Departments.</p><p>  We are trying to do this in a manner that does not generate unnecessary expense.  Cearly, judges will be appointed to the court and they must be remunerated.  In the Estimates some &euro;2 million has been allocated for this project.  The objective is that the new Court of Appeal will be sitting and working in the law term starting in October this year.  I should say, Chairman, that is a very ambitious objective because we must enact legislation which is substantially developed and which I hope will be published in the next few weeks.  It must be brought to Cabinet.  I understand it will be to hand after it goes through one further drafting.</p> <p>That legislation must be enacted and the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board obviously will be involved in the context of advertising the judicial places.  It cannot do this until the legislation is enacted and then there is the physical structure.  The objective is to have the Court of Appeal up and running in October next.  While I am told this is an ambitious objective to achieve, I will try to ensure it is achieved and this is the reason the sum in question has been allocated.</p></speech>

I ask the Minister to outline the current position on the provision of a new courts complex in Limerick city.  There is a proposal somewhere within the system to relocate the District Court, which at present is adjacent to the offices of Limerick City Council, either onto or adjacent to the campus of Limerick Prison, Mulgrave Street.  When President Higgins visited Limerick yesterday, it was necessary to usher in the officers of Limerick City Council through the side door.  This is a bone of contention in Limerick in respect of image.</p></speech>

Agreement has been reached with the Prison Service about a ground-level link between the courthouse and the prison and that is included in the plans.  The funding for the project is part of the PPP investment package of projects that were announced some time ago.  While matters are developing, it will take some more time for this project to get to a point at which one discerns progress on the ground, as opposed to on the planning side.  Quite clearly, the PPP side of this and its funding must be resolved.</p></speech>

It is a pity because visually, it is a fine, great-looking building on the outside but it simply is not fit for purpose.  I have seen myself how it presents like a cattle marts.  There are no consultation rooms available for solicitors, barristers and their clients, prisoners are being locked in prison vans and it is completely not fit for the purpose for which it is required.

Everyone is happy with that.  The next item pertains to appropriations-in-aid, which covers fees for court transactions, miscellaneous items, pensions and so on and again, and there is no major change in this regard.  That concludes the Estimates for the Courts Service.  If everyone is satisfied with the Courts Service and in the absence of questions or comments, we will move on.</p><p>  We will turn to the Property Registration Authority, PRA, and will deal first with subhead A1 on wages, salaries and allowances.  Again, I note a slight reduction in this one and as for staffing levels, I note 518 full-time equivalent staff.  There any no questions or comments.  In respect of travel and subsistence, &euro;110,000 has been provided for the staff of the authority and members have no issues.  There has been a slight reduction in training and development and incidental expenses.  That includes Ordnance Survey Ireland charges, training, cleaning services, uniforms, advertising and PRA board members' fees.  There are no issues.  There is a slight reduction in the provision for postal and telecommunications services and for office equipment and external IT services.  There has been no change in the provision for office premises expenses or for consultancy services and value for money policy reviews.  There has been a slight change in the amount for pension-related deduction of public service remuneration.  In the absence of general comments in respect of the Property Registration Authority and as everyone seems satisfied in this regard, we will move onto the next programme.</p><p>  I refer to the programme to maintain a secure Ireland in the justice Vote 24.  The committee will start with administration and pay, for which there is a slight increase.  The administration non-pay subhead shows a slight decrease.  Members are happy enough in this regard.  The provision for the Irish Naturalisation and Immigration Service, INIS, has reduced from approximately &euro;49 million to approximately &euro;47.5 million.  That covers the administration of the Department's functions in respect of asylum, immigration, citizenship and related matters.  There are no comments or questions.  Provision for asylum seekers' accommodation has reduced from &euro;57 million to &euro;51 million and Deputy Mac Lochlainn wishes to comment on this one.</p></speech>

When will a point be reached when Members deal with this issue?  There are considerable human rights concerns in this regard.  A debate on the issue took place recently on "Prime Time" and it clearly is not acceptable as an accommodation option into the future.  On the departure of the former Ombudsman, Emily O'Reilly, it was notable that she believed the area of immigrants, housing, applications and so on should come under the remit of the Ombudsman.  She referred in her speech to direct provision centres and as European Ombudsman, she is now a person of international reputation in respect of defending citizens' rights and human rights.  I suggest to the Minister that this system cannot be stood over.  In particular, the core difficulty is the length of time people must stay within such centres.  I have listened to some asylum seekers who acknowledged the possibility of it being just for a period of three or six months.  The problem is linked to the system of appeals and is there a way of fast-tracking the system or reshaping and dealing with it in such a way that people do not spend years in such accommodation, with very little income or freedom while eating food that in some instances is not that to which they are culturally accustomed?  What is the Minister's vision in respect of moving away from that model?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.877" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014012900011#K01900"><p>There are a number of issues of relevance to this matter.  The people concerned are relevant, as is the language we use.  The language that is used when discussing this particular issue on occasions gives the wrong insights and perceptions.  At the outset, I note the Deputy and I share a view, which is that Ireland's legislation in this area must be changed.  One difficulty over the years has been that if one applies for asylum and if one is unsuccessful, one can then apply for leave to remain and if one is unsuccessful, one can then make another application.  Each application must be decided anew by the body dealing with that issue.  Consequently, in the case of someone who has gone through the process whereby he or she made an initial application for asylum and an appeals process which was refused, the thing keeps on starting all over again.  It is my hope and certainty, finally, that this year, legislation will be published to reform this entire area in the context of dealing with asylum, residence and immigration issues.</p> <p>Three attempts to achieve this were made by predecessors and we had three previous Bills in this area.  The reason the legislation I hope to bring forward has been delayed for so long was simply that the troika demanded that other legislation be given precedence.  We had to deal with the insolvency and legal services legislation, which were important of themselves, while the Office of the Attorney General also had to deal with a broad range of Bills from other Departments.  This has made it impossible for us to finalise the Bill.  In that context, a substantial amount work has been done in my Department and work is under way in the Office of the Attorney General.  We should have the Bill this year. </p><p> The effect of the Bill will be that, where an individual arrives in Ireland claiming asylum, a decision making process will be in place under which all issues can be determined together.  A fair, objective and proper hearing will be provided, as will an appeals procedure, but it should not take two years to work one's way through the process. </p><p> I was asked the reason people are in direct provision for so long.  I am concerned about this issue and the language surrounding it.  The issue of conditions in direct provision also arises.  I visited a number of the centres in which direct provision is being provided and spoke to many of the staff and residents in them.  I have examined a substantial number of files relating to the circumstances of individuals.  The overwhelming majority of individuals who have been in direct provision for more than 18 months are or have a family member challenging, through court proceedings, decisions made to refuse them asylum or the right to remain in this country.  Individuals are entitled to have access to the courts and some people have succeeded in their cases because the courts have taken the view that original decisions were not appropriately made, there were procedural defects in the decisions or some issues should have been given greater attention. This results in the matter being referred back for a new decision to be made.  I am not saying people should not have access to our courts.  I am simply saying the overwhelming majority of people who have been in direct provision for 18 months or more are engaged in court proceedings.  More than 1,000 cases are pending in the courts.  One of my officials will provide the exact figure.  In that context, I believe there are slightly more than 4,000 people currently in direct provision.   </p><p> Many individuals who come here and claim asylum are not truly asylum seekers but economic migrants trying to exploit the asylum process.  This is not only a problem in Ireland but a problem across Europe.  We have a system where those who want to come to this country must apply for appropriate visas and those who want to work must obtain work permits in the context of nationals of states outside the European Union member countries.  The unfortunate reality is that this creates a difficulty for genuine asylum seekers.  I have very strong views about this issue and I believe we should treat those seeking asylum correctly and allow them to stay here.  I have expressed those views many times in the House, prior to becoming a Minister and I continue express them, including in Europe where I make that case to our colleagues in other member states.  </p><p> There is an enormous problem of people seeking to evade visa requirements, although it occurs to a far lesser extent here than in most other European states.  A significant number of those who claim political asylum present information that is entirely false and present themselves as being different people from the people they are or as originating from a country that is not their home country.  For example, there are cases where people claim to be from Somalia and it turns out they are from Kenya.  In other cases people claim they were being tortured in some part of the Middle East at a time when we discovered they were living in London or Birmingham.  There are cases of people being granted political asylum and it turns out some years earlier, when they claim citizenship, that they had sought political asylum under an assumed identity and assumed nationality.  This is a major problem.</p><p> The problem is that there are a number of individuals who came here as economic migrants, failed to gain political asylum and whose cases are pending in our courts.  I am not saying this applies to everyone who has brought a case and it would be wrong for me to do so.  However, as a consequence, the courts have lacked the capacity to deal with speed with a large number of court cases and there are people in direct provision for an unduly lengthy period.</p><p> The language used around this issue is that all asylum seekers are being kept in direct provision.  A considerable number of people who have been entirely through the system should not have sought asylum in the first place.  These economic migrants are making court applications and the courts will ultimately determine the validity of the cases they are making.  I must not say anything that would prejudice anyone's case.  I re-emphasise that I am sure there are some people who brought court cases who will rightly be successful in those cases.  That is the first problem.</p><p> No one is required to remain in direct provision.  If I am an asylum seeker and have some other financial means or friends, relations or someone else who will provide me with accommodation and upkeep, I am not required to remain in direct provision.  Direct provision is a system that facilitates individuals who have no housing or home and very limited resources.  They and their children are fed and given a roof over their heads.  It facilitates their children attending school and ensures medical treatment is available.  They receive all of these supports.  What we are doing is substantially better than what is being done in a number of other European countries.  I am not saying we could not do better.  I would like a system in which all applications, save in exceptional circumstances, were determined within a maximum of 12 months.  I would like a system in which those who require these sorts of supports would not have to remain in direct provision for more than 12 months, one in which those who come here illegally, falsely claim asylum and, having been through a system in which there is full confidence and having been found not to be here lawfully and not to be asylum seekers, can be deported properly and with some speed.  </p><p> It is important to address another issue because people do not understand this.  We have some individuals against whom deportation orders have been made and they have been through the entire system, including the courts, but cannot be deported because the states from which they came will not receive them.  That is yet another aspect of the complexity of the issue.  This issue is often presented in simple black and white terms.</p><p> The objective should be to ensure we have an efficient and humane system.  I wish there was something better than direct provision.  However, if we were to say that people who come here claiming asylum and are in the system and have had their asylum application refused, should, by virtue of bringing court proceedings to delay the inevitable making of a deportation order or by virtue of other challenges, be automatically allowed to work after a certain period, it would drive a coach and four through our visa system. It would also result in thousands of people who are economic migrants arriving in Ireland.  The State would not be able to cope with the numbers.  We have domestic issues as the Deputy and I both know.  I am a member of a Government that wishes we had more funding available to us to facilitate the construction of local authority housing for individuals who are living here and were born in this State.  </p><p> My question is what is the alternative.  Direct provision provides a financially effective way of ensuring nobody claiming asylum, whether a valid asylum seeker or an economic migrant, will be left sitting on the streets and they and their families will have a roof over their heads and food.  On the issue of food, everything is being done to try to ensure, on the basis that people come from a variety of backgrounds, that ethnicity is taken into account in the type of nourishment and provisions provided.</p><p> What is the alternative within the resource capacity of the State?  We are not in a position to provide local authority housing. </p> <p>If it were done through private rented accommodation it would cost a great deal more, owing to the social welfare payments that would be required.  There would be no certainty that the type of backup facilities that exist within the direct provision system would necessarily be available.  There is oversight of the direct provision system.  The moment problems were drawn to my attention during my time as Minister, we have ensured they were addressed rapidly.</p><p> This issue is not as simple as it looks.  The language surrounding it gives rise to the impression that people, all of whom are genuine asylum seekers, are being kept in accommodation of the kind in question.  The matter is more complex than that.  Where adults or economic migrants have falsely claimed asylum, it is not their children's fault.  The big issue of concern to me is the number of young children in direct provision and the length of time for which they are there.  We are considering and addressing this as best we can to ensure the children will have available to them the sort of play facilities they need.  For example, some of the direct provision centres I have visited employ people to provide play opportunities for children.  Not all have the playgrounds I would like them to have but a number of them do and they are of benefit to the children.</p></speech>

It is no problem if members wish to do so.  What I would like to do now is go through the figures and not spend too long on any one item; otherwise, we will be here until 6 p.m.  There are other very interesting topics to be discussed.  If members are interested in doing some extra work on this, we can have a special meeting and perhaps invite the Minister or his officials back to give a detailed, comprehensive briefing.  I caution against going into too much detail on some of the subheads now because we could be here all day.</p><p>  The next matter is the Garda Complaints Board, in respect of which there has been a slight reduction.

The Constitution requires and Government accounting principles provide that the public moneys be spent only as voted or approved by D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann, unless otherwise provided by statute.  The policy of ring-fencing moneys obtained by the Exchequer and the reallocation of these for a specific purpose runs contrary to the normal Estimates process.  Under this process, moneys that have been accumulated by the Criminal Assets Bureau are paid into the Government's Central Fund.  It is a central fund from which the Government draws for expenditure on public services and investments, including the provision of drugs services.  I do not intend to travel down the route proposed.  It is ultimately the Department of Justice and Equality and the Garda that receive moneys from the Central Fund.  Under the aegis of my Department, moneys go to various groups assisting victims of crime.  In a sense this is almost an artificial conversation, because once money goes into the Central Fund, it means there are additional funds in that fund available.  The Central Fund funds the Department of Justice and Equality in addition to all others.  Therefore, this is not really a major issue.</p></speech>

We have been examining it for over nine months.  A number of amendments required to the Garda Ombudsman legislation have been suggested that are not of direct relevance to recent controversies.  I have said we should examine the issue of the Garda Ombudsman dealing with serious complaints made by serving members of the force against other members of the force.  I have done so.  I have not considered what resource implications this might have for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission.  The first stage is to develop the legislative proposals, which, I am sure the Deputy understands, must go to the Cabinet.  It is then a matter of producing those proposals.  I have not received any communications from the Garda Ombudsman to suggest it does not have the resources it needs to undertake the work it has at hand.  Obviously, should that ever be raised with me, I will address it in an appropriate way.</p></speech>

The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate&rsquo;s role is effectively to examine how Garda operations work and whether changes, either structural or procedural, should be made.  Its role is also to examine how better efficiencies can be effected in the context of the use of resources, both human and financial.  There is a range of such issues.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate does not have a remit to deal with allegations of misconduct.  However, in the context of its remit - some sight of this has been lost in recent days - the report of Assistant Commissioner O&rsquo;Mahoney and the audit report produced by the Garda side dealing with the fixed charge ticket issue were deliberately referred by me to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Inspectorate so it could consider the matter in all the relevant contexts.  I expect very shortly to receive its report on that issue.  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission deals with allegations of misconduct made against members of the force.  In dealing with issues of misconduct, when publishing a report it may comment on operational matters or procedural issues.  There can be an overlap to some extent but there is a very distinct and different focus when something is sent to the inspectorate by comparison with the Garda Ombudsman.</p></speech>

Has the Minister examined the powers of the ombudsman in the North?  The Minister suggested a garda with a serious concern, rather than a minor issue, might be able to go directly to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission rather than the confidential recipient.</p> <p>The current matter which the Minister is referring to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission will, I suspect, have considerable resource implication.  I wish to get a sense of it.</p><p> I welcome that the Minister has acknowledged there will be some additional powers, that he is thinking them through and that they will go to Cabinet.  Naturally, they will have resource implications.  Part of the modernisation process with our police service will be that strong accountability mechanism.  Has the Minister examined any models?  I have in mind not only the force in the North, the model we would most closely relate to on this island, but perhaps are there other models in Europe which the Minister has examined and he could introduce additional powers to strengthen the force.  What would be the resource implications of such a move?</p></speech>

Obviously, we would get some insight into the resource implications or otherwise.  I expect those in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission should be well able to address and deal with the issues that have been referred to them.  They would have formally received the letter of referral from me yesterday of those matters that have been the focus of public attention in recent days in the context of the engagement of the Committee of Public Accounts.  I imagine if I strayed into commenting further the Chairman would stop me and therefore I will not.</p></speech>

There is no indication to me that they lack the resources they need to address issues that are before them at present or with regard to a matter referred to them within the past 24 hours.</p><p>  Incidentally - I will say this in one sentence so that I do not get shot - it was open to the GSOC at any time to have taken up those issues on its own initiative if it had concluded it was in the public interest and need to do so.  Again, that is something that seems to be missed in some of the commentary.  Clearly, until I referred the matter to those in the GSOC, they did not form a view that the public interest required that they engage on the matter.</p></speech>

The Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains also comes within the overall allocation.  That body is still in existence.  Unfortunately, there is no indication at the moment of any significant search or excavation works to be undertaken.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-01-29a.928" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014012900015#O01700"><p>No.  The phasing out continues until 2015.  The first reduction in payments was effected in 2013, the second is 2014, this year, and the third will be 2015.  In effect, the total available fund in 2013 was &euro;4 million, in 2014 it is &euro;2 million and in 2015 it will be &euro;1 million.  It will not be fully and finally phased out until 2016.  The purpose and intent behind this is to allow those charitable bodies that benefited from the fund to reorganise and recalibrate their fund-raising activities to ensure they have maximised use for charitable purposes of moneys donated by members of the public, be it through the purchase of scratch cards, lottery cards or any other type of draw in which they have been engaged.  I was concerned to ensure there was not an instant reduction in the funding available but I had concerns, as I said in the D&aacute;il a week ago, about the manner in which that scheme was calibrated.  While well-intended and supported by a succession of governments, it was never envisaged that it would develop in a manner that simply encouraged the sale of tickets and did not result in the charities' seeking to ensure the maximum portion possible of the funds raised from the public was utilised for charitable purposes.</p></speech>

Administration pay is up and non-pay is down a bit.  Subhead F3, National Property Services Regulatory Authority is up from &euro;848,000 to over &euro;1 million.  There is a slight change under subhead F4, Insolvency Service Ireland.  As no one wants to comment on programme F we will move on to the final programme, G, which deals with appropriations-in-aid.  The total there is up slightly.  There are several sections.  Does anybody want to ask any questions about or comment on them?

I think it relates to dealing with visa applications and fees payable on foot of visa applications.  As a result of the visa waiver programme, a considerable number of people who travel to the UK from outside the EU do not require visas in this State and have come on to visit this State.  When we put that scheme in place, we envisaged there would be a reduction in income received but there was not because we have had more visitors in recent years.  This is the estimate for the fees we expect to receive in 2014.  It is a bit below the sum for the outturn of 2013 because that was the year of The Gathering and we do not have full visibility on whether visitor numbers will decrease in the year after The Gathering.  We do not know what its impact will be.  That is the estimate of the income we will receive.</p></speech>

Today the committee is considering the 2014 Estimates for Defence and Army Pensions.  I intend to give a short opening statement as opposed to a long statement, after which I will be happy to take questions from members.  I know that members are generally familiar with the background.</p><p>  The combined Estimates for Defence and Army pensions for 2014 provides for gross expenditure of &euro;898 million.  Of that sum, &euro;677 million will be spent on Defence and &euro;221 million on Army pensions.  Over 74% of the Defence Vote goes towards providing for the pay and allowances of 9,500 Permanent Defence Force personnel, 625 civilian employees and 350 civil servants.  The remaining allocation provides mainly for the replacement and maintenance of essential equipment and operational costs.</p><p>  The re-organisation of the Permanent Defence Force which was initiated in July 2012 has been successfully completed.  The re-organisation was required to accommodate the PDF strength of 9,500 within a revised two-brigade structure.  I am pleased to state the re-organisation has met its intended objectives and will continue to deliver a high level of capability and efficiency within the Defence environment.  Targeted recruitment was undertaken in 2013 and will continue in 2014.  In total, there was an overall intake of 404 PDF personnel in 2013, comprising 353 general recruits, 34 cadets, nine engine room artificers for the Naval Service; seven Air Corps apprentices, and one medical officer.  Members will be pleased to note that it is intended to commence a new recruitment campaign in March 2014.  An induction of Air Corps apprentices and Naval Service engine room artificers is also planned during 2014.  I think we will have to change that word &quot;artificers&quot; and see if we can invent a term that is from the 21st century as opposed to from the 18th century.  We will vigorously engage in that appropriate initiative.  Any suggested changes will be welcome.</p><p>  Despite the difficult economic climate prevailing, the continued application of a prudent approach to equipment purchasing and maintenance programmes has ensured the Defence Forces continue to have access to modern equipment.  The costs of procuring two new Naval Service vessels, scheduled for delivery in 2014 and 2015, are being met from the Defence allocation.  The first ship floated out in November 2013.  I should say it floated back again, otherwise we would all be in trouble.  The fitting out of equipment is taking place.  Sea trials are scheduled for the first week in February 2014 and the vessel should be ready for handover in the first week of March 2014.  The keel laying ceremony for the second ship took place in November 2013 and the work continues apace.  It is expected that the new vessel,<i> LE Samuel Beckett</i>, will be formally commissioned into service in April 2014.</p><p>  Ireland will continue its long-standing commitment to overseas missions.  Currently, 412 personnel are serving in 14 different missions throughout the world.  These missions embrace a range of activities, including conflict resolution, peacekeeping, humanitarian missions, crisis management and strengthening international security.  The two largest contingents are serving with the United Nations Interim Force in Lebanon, UNIFIL, with 210 personnel, and the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force, UNDOF, in the Golan Heights, with 119 personnel.</p><p>  At home, the Permanent Defence Force will continue to provide an efficient military operational response to both the civil power and civil authorities, as required.</p> <p>This work is ongoing and will encompass a broad range of diverse activities and services, including explosive ordnance disposal duties, maritime patrol, search and rescue missions and cash in transit escorts.</p><p> Following the value for money review of the Reserve Defence Force, a new organisational structure came into effect at the end of March 2013.  A revised strength ceiling for the Reserve of 4,069 personnel is now in place.  Work is continuing on the implementation of the reorganisation effort and the development of the single force concept.  A review of the number of active members of the RDF is being compiled in this context.  As part of this process, the criteria for participation in the RDF are also being reviewed and updated and a recruitment plan is being developed.  The revised structure has improved access to equipment, expertise and appropriate training for Reserve members.  It has also allowed for a significant reduction in the number of PDF personnel required to administer and train the Reserve on a full-time basis.  This means we are now using our resources more effectively.</p><p> I intend to publish a new White Paper on defence in 2014 and work has commenced in that regard.  In support of this, a Green Paper on defence was published in July 2013.  The Green Paper has provided a useful consultative basis for the White Paper, which will set out defence policy for the coming years.  It is anticipated that the draft White Paper will be submitted to Government for approval later this year.  I thank the members of this committee who made submissions in response to the Green Paper, either on their own behalf or on behalf of their parties.</p><p> The Defence Vote also makes provision for certain costs related to the Civil Defence.  The Civil Defence Board was disestablished and its functions integrated into the Department from January 2013.  Civil Defence continues to develop its role of providing supports to front-line emergency services.  In 2013, it supported the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in almost 100 searches for missing persons and was actively involved in supporting hundreds of community events across the country.  I fully expect that Civil Defence volunteers throughout the country will continue to provide support to both front-line services and local communities in responding to emergencies throughout 2014.</p><p>I conclude by referring to the Army pensions Vote and the increasing numbers and costs in that regard.  Expenditure from this Vote is primarily non-discretionary and demand-led.  Currently, there are some 12,000 pensioners of all categories paid by my Department under the Vote.  Reflecting recent public service trends generally, retirements on pension from the Permanent Defence Force more than doubled from 2007 to 2012.  During that period, expenditure on military pensions increased by 31%.  In recent years, any shortfall arising on the Army pensions Vote provision has been met from payroll and other savings on the Defence Vote.  In other words, there has been no extra demand on the Exchequer in respect of the Defence Vote group.  An additional sum of &euro;10 million has been provided to meet the anticipated increased expenditure requirements this year.</p><p> I commend both Revised Estimates to the committee and look forward to dealing with any questions members wish to raise.</p></speech>

I propose to go through each of the subheads, as before.  Under Vote 35, Army pensions, the first subhead is A1, administration - pay.  There is a slight reduction under this subhead.  Subhead A2 relates to payments by way of pension and gratuity lump sum to former members of the Permanent Defence Force and their dependants.  Again, there is a very slight reduction under this subhead.  The anticipated number who will receive payments this year is 11,670.  Subhead A3 deals with wound and disability pensions, and allowances and gratuities to or in respect of former members of the Defence Forces.  There is an allocation of almost &euro;9.5 million under this subhead, which is an increase of 8.7%.  Subhead A4 is payments to dependants of veterans of the War of Independence.  Clearly, the number in receipt of this payment is reducing year on year.  Subhead A5 covers compensation payments.  I understand a contingency fund is in place in this regard but is rarely drawn down.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

No.</p><p>  We move on to Vote 36, Department of Defence.  Subhead A1 is administration - pay, which has increased from &euro;17.318 million to &euro;17.951 million.

The payment of family income supplement is reflective of the particular family circumstances and background of individual personnel.  Issues relating to pay in the Defence Forces were addressed in the context of the Haddington Road agreement, the negotiations for which included engagement by the Defence Forces representative bodies.  I cannot add a great deal more than that.  We are not in a position to deal with pay issues other than as agreed and prescribed under the Haddington Road agreement.</p></speech>

Members who joined the Defence Forces in the past, when the numbers in force were much larger, had an expectation of long service and possible future promotion.  Some of them now find themselves in a position where that will not happen and they have to leave after 21 years, even though they meet all the fitness requirements and so on.  I realise that events have moved on but this seems somewhat unfair.  Is there any way of addressing it?</p></speech>

It is an issue we considered carefully.  There has been substantial reorganisation in the Defence Forces, which was necessary to achieve the appropriate numbers of personnel across the range of areas and duties and ensure we did not have numbers at officer or senior officer level beyond what was required.</p> <p>We must use our resources wisely.  The 21-year rule was in place when people joined the Defence Forces and no one was misled into believing that automatic promotions would be forthcoming.  Promotions are not automatic and there are rules and regulations relating to them.</p><p> It is very important that there should continue to be an age balance across the Defence Forces in order that staff might have the capability to carry out all of their operational duties.  There is a need for constant renewal within the Defence Forces.  When I became Minister, we were faced with a situation whereby the possibilities for recruiting were limited.  That remained the case for a number of years and there was a risk that the strength of the Defence Forces would fall to somewhere in the region of 7,000 to 7,500.  The Government made a decision to the effect that the objective strength of the Defence Forces should be 9,500.  This was conditional on our using resources wisely and reorganising appropriately, which is what we have done.  The consequences of that are that we are in a state of constant renewal.  This is in the interest of the Defence Forces themselves and it is also in the public interest.</p><p> As members are aware, in excess of 400 young people were recruited to the Defence Forces last year.  This renewal only occurs in the context of people retiring either when they reach the prescribed retirement age.  It would be quite wrong to create promotions that are not required simply in order to retain people within the Defence Forces.  I very much appreciate that many of those who have served the State well as members of the Defence Forces for 21 years would aspire to remain in their positions.  The great benefit for them upon ceasing to be members of the Defence Forces is that employment opportunities of the sort that are not always available to the wider public become open to them.  I understand that there are those who would wish to stay on longer.  However, I cannot change the rules and regulations which are in place in that context.</p></speech>

Their recruitment was based on retirements and the need to bring in replacements.  In 2009 only 47 staff were recruited and in 2010 only 45 were recruited.  When I became Minister, the overall numbers were falling below 9,000.  If there had been no recruitment in 2011, we could have reached the point where the strength of the Defence Forces would have fallen to 8,500.  We steadied the ship at an early stage by recruiting 526 staff in 2011.  This stabilised matters and brought numbers up well past 9,000.  We then recruited 633 further staff in 2012 in order to try to bring numbers up to the objective strength level of 9,500.  We solidified the position in this regard by taking on 404 recruits in 2013.  This would not have been possible without people retiring on reaching 21 years of service.  If the 21-year rule were not in place, we would be faced with greying and aging Defence Forces personnel.</p><p>  Some 87 officer promotions took place in 2013.  A total of 607 enlisted personnel were promoted last year.  A further six such personnel were promoted in the period 1 to 14 January.  A reasonable number of promotions are, therefore, taking place.  These are promotions that are required.  We must proceed on the basis of what is necessary in order to maintain operational efficiencies. That is the way in which we are approaching this matter.</p></speech>

We will now move to subhead A.4, which relates to allowances.  Again, there is a slight reduction under this subhead.  Subhead A.5 relates to the Reserve Defence Force, RDF.  I note that the provisional outturn for last year was &euro;1.9 million, that spending exceeded this and that a further increase is provided for this year.  I presume changes are happening in the context of the RDF.</p></speech>

As a result of the reorganisation of the RDF, we have a very clear view - I still have to obtain the final figures - in respect of those who are active members and those who are no longer active.  This is a very important issue.  I anticipate that I will have final visibility in respect of this matter in a very short period.  The likelihood is that we will then be recruiting to the RDF.  I cannot provide a final number in this regard but I am of the view that we will bring in an influx of new people who will be committed to the RDF and who will actively engage in training.  We have made financial provision in respect of this eventuality.</p></speech>

It makes one very proud when one sees the calibre of people who are representing the country at that level.  It is understandable that the Air Corps regularly submits requests for upgrades, new planes and to have older aircraft replaced.  Those in charge want to have the best aircraft and equipment to the members of the Air Corps in order that they can do their jobs properly.  I tabled a parliamentary question on this matter previously and I would like the Minister to indicate whether there is a biannual budgeting process for the Air Corps or are matters dealt with on a year-by-year basis?  How does the process work?  What is the position if the Air Corps wants to replace three aircraft that are over 20 years old?  People get their cars serviced regularly but eventually they must be replaced.  Must aircraft be replaced when they reach a certain age and, if so, how does this fit in with the Government's budgetary process?</p></speech>

As everyone is aware, the State has limited funds and resources and the question of whether we might, at some point in the future, invest in new aircraft has not really been on the agenda.  A reasonable sum of money - on occasion it is substantial - is required to purchase replacement parts for aircraft.</p> <p>A sum of &euro;8.8 million is provided for the maintenance of aircraft.</p><p> In the context of dealing with aircraft equipment and expenses, the priority expenditure for 2014 remains the delivery of the full range of airport and operational services associated with the roles assigned to them by the Government.  The operational requirements are outlined in the Defence Forces annual plan that we published for 2014.  Major projects currently under way or planned for this year include an overhaul of a CASA engine which will cost approximately &euro;600,000; a continuation of an upgrade programme of on-board software for the AW139 helicopter fleet, the cost of which is also estimated to be approximately &euro;600,000 in 2014; and the commencement of an end-of-life upgrade of the PC-9M  simulator projection system, which is estimated to cost approximately &euro;280,000.</p><p> In the context of the annual maintenance of aircraft, at some stage an issue could arise where, when maintenance work is being undertaken, the level of expenditure that could be identified as being required to replace parts may give rise to questions about the economic advisability of spending that money as compared to getting some alternative aircraft.  That has not occurred to date.  None of us can anticipate whether it would.  To ensure I am not misunderstood in any way, I point out that it is not in the plans to purchase any new aircraft.  </p><p> The aircraft perform a variety of functions.  The focus in the media is always the use of aircraft by Ministers to attend on Government business abroad but the same aircraft that are used for those purposes are used very often for emergency reasons to provide urgent medical assistance to individuals.  They have been used on occasions to assist with regard to Irish nationals in trouble-spots in the world.  There is a whole range of uses to which they can be put.  The reality is that we are unlikely to be replacing anything in the short term.  </p><p> The aeromedical helicopter operation is run out of Custume Barracks in Athlone, and we have addressed that previously. That operation has proved to be very successful and it is continuing.  In a sense it is a joint venture between ourselves, the Department of Health and the HSE.  We are currently carrying out a review of that operation in the context of efficiencies and how it is working.  It is not envisaged, in any shape or form, that a service of that nature will not be maintained.  That is where matters stand.  </p><p> There is an obvious issue in this context.  If we reach a point where a decision is made, for operational reasons, that there will be a need for new aircraft, the Deputy and I can predict with certainty that instead of focusing on all of the other usages for an aircraft, the only thing the media will focus on is some suggestion that Ministers want a new airplane so that they can go on some sort of junket.  No one realises that the only occasions they are used is when there is major public business abroad and when there is a need for Ministers to go from this State and return with efficiency and speed because of all of the other public duties they have to engage in, but that is never the narrative in the media and, on occasions, it is not the narrative from Opposition Deputies.  There is no question of us rushing into anything here.  The big capital expenditure this year and next is on the new naval vessels.</p></speech>

Many of the parts in the aircraft have been substantially replaced and they are not remotely 20 years old; some of them would be very recent.  An annual maintenance is undertaken on all of them.  In dealing with the Estimates on this, one cannot be absolutely right in one's predictions because it can vary.  A substantial sum can be spent one year and it would need to be considered if such a sum is needed the following year.  What arises may also depend on the extent of the usage of the particular aircraft.</p></speech>

Is there an option for a third vessel?</p></speech>

As I understand it, that option is still a possibility.  In that context there is an issue with regard to terms of contract, price and when it might be delivered.  My focus at present is on the delivery of our first one.  It is appropriate that we have called it the <i>Samuel Beckett</i>.  It was one of the first decisions confirmed by the Cabinet on the formation of this Government, on foot of a memorandum I brought to Cabinet with regard to the purchase of this vessel.  One of the reasons for calling it the <i>Samuel Beckett</i>  is that we have been waiting for Godot since March of 2011, but we are currently doing an assessment.  I am very conscious of the age of the naval fleet - this is more relevant in regard to ships than in regard to aircraft because of the capacity to replace parts and the manner in which aircraft age - and it is very important that we continue to retain essential capacities around coasts.  I am looking at that issue at present but I cannot say any more than that.</p></speech>

I admire Samuel Beckett as much as the next person but why has there been a move from the tradition of naming vessels after Irish female names?</p></speech>

There was a tradition of using Irish female names, substantially the names of mythical Irish females.  I gave some thought to this, discussed it with colleagues and we discussed it within the Department.  Our naval vessels on occasions visit ports abroad as flagships of this State, engage in events internationally, as we ask other states to engage with us with their vessels, and we have had various examples of that.  In the context of the naming of naval ships, I concluded that to ensure when they go abroad the wider global public would see some identity with Ireland and some identity with a figure that is internationally known and respected, we should rethink an approach that has been adopted, effectively since 1922.  We have very many literary giants, a disproportionate number compared to the size of the numbers on this island.  In those conversations I concluded, having discussed it with other colleagues, that we should name some of our future ships after our major literary figures.  We chose the name<i> Samuel Beckett </i>for the first ship and the name <i>James Joyce</i> for the second, although they are not all going to be named after male literary figures.</p><p>  Should we purchase a third ship, we have a name in mind that I think may be widely welcomed, if we manage to get to a point where we can contract for a third ship.  There is no certainly about that at the moment because there are obvious issues about price and identifying the funding possibilities.  It is not a matter I have yet discussed with Cabinet colleagues.</p> <p>I expect the delivery time, should we do so, would probably not be until about 2017.  These are issues for the future but I hope it would be seen as a change that is welcome and constructive.  I know that whenever change is effected some people appreciate and applaud it and others criticise it but if it draws attention to the fact that we have new, fit-for-purpose ships coming on line to the benefit of our Navy and to the country, it is a welcome event.  When we launch this ship we are hoping to have a Beckett-related event on the day, and I would anticipate that all members of this committee will be invited to the naming and the launch.</p></speech>

We visited the naval stores and the Air Corps and we were impressed with what we saw.</p><p>  There is a slight reduction in the next subhead, A.12, barrack expenses and engineering equipment.  I think we have dealt with that.  </p><p>  There is an increase in subhead A.13 for new building works and maintenance of existing works.  We note there is a good deal of work taking place in various barracks including gym refurbishment in Cathal Brugha Barracks, re-roofing in Magee Barracks and so on.  The archives are important also.  </p><p>  Subhead A.14 on ordnance, clothing and catering and so on is worthwhile, and I thank the Minister for the interesting detail given in the commentary.

That Estimate has decreased substantially.  There is no major change in Subhead A.20, equitation.  </p><p>  Regarding Subhead A.21 on compensation and additional costs, as stated in the commentary, the Department has no control over that substantial increase in the Estimate.  Subhead A.22, miscellaneous expenditure, has increased slightly also.  It relates to the Ombudsman for the Defence Forces and so on.</p><p>  Subhead A.23 on costs arising directly from Ireland's participation in the European Union's Common Security &amp;amp; Defence Policy has increased by 20%.  Subhead A.24 on Civil Defence has been reduced.  Changes have been made in that respect.</p><p>  There is no change in Subhead A.25 on Irish Red Cross Society grant-in-aid.  It is the same as 2013.  Subhead B on appropriations-in-aid is down 24% on 2013.  The commentary refers to bank escorts, UN receipts, pension levies and so forth.</p><p>  That concludes the select committee's consideration of the Revised Estimates for Vote 35 - Army Pensions and Vote 36 - Defence.  It strikes me that next year we might have two separate sessions because dealing with the Estimates of two Departments requires a long session.  The detailed work done by the Departments in producing the Estimates is very interesting and it would be useful to give each Department its own block of time.</p></speech>
