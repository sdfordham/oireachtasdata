Members will have received copies of my opening statement.  I am an assistant secretary with responsibility for illness and disability policy in the Department of Social Protection.  My colleagues, Liam Walsh, principal officer, Eoin O'Shea, assistant principal officer, Alan Chapman, assistant principal officer disability policy, Mary Kennedy, principal officer, and Aideen Mooney, assistant principal officer PRSI policy, are here to assist me in answering any questions members may wish to raise.<br /><b></b>I wish to stress the Department's continued commitment to providing a wide-ranging system of supports, both in the area of basic income supports and, of particular relevance here today, in the area of work-related supports for people with disabilities.<b></b>The context in which we seek to carry out our work in this area has been shaped by the wider transformation of the Department arising from the merger between the old Department of Social Protection and significant elements of F&Aacute;S which took place earlier this year.  Prior to the merger the role of the Department related to the structure of the various welfare payments available to people with disabilities, notably the disability allowance scheme, invalidity pension and illness benefit together with schemes such as the back-to-education allowance, which the Department operates directly.  Earlier this year, the range of income support measures was extended following the introduction of the partial capacity benefit scheme, on which I will say a few words in a moment.  </p><p>  Our remit has been significantly widened however with the transfer of elements of F&Aacute;S services into the Department.  These include the range of disability support and awareness measures, the wage subsidy scheme and the employability programme.  I should mention that responsibility for training, <i>per se</i>, remains with the Department of Education and Skills.  Each of the measures for which the Department has responsibility has an important role to play in supporting increased participation in the labour force by people with disabilities.  Clearly, the challenge to improve the level of that participation is all the greater when set in the context of the wider economic difficulties we face at present, but the merger of the two organisations presents us with the opportunity to develop a more cohesive and coherent approach to meeting that challenge.</p><p>  Put simply, the challenge we face is to further enhance the shift in focus from disability to ability.  The introduction of the partial capacity scheme in February of this year marked a significant milestone in that process.  This scheme recognises that the welfare system, which categorised people as fit to work or unfit to work, did not reflect the reality for most existing welfare customers.  It provides an opportunity for people with disabilities, and assessed to have an employment capacity which is restricted when compared to the norm, to avail of employment opportunities while continuing to receive a long-term income support payment.  The scheme is still in its infancy and it will take time for it to develop, but we believe that it is already starting to serve its purpose in enabling hundreds of people to enjoy the benefits, from both an income and an inclusion perspective, of being engaged in the world of work.  Since the scheme was introduced in February last, just under 700 claims have been awarded.</p><p>  I should mention also another important measure, the disability activation project, which we are undertaking with the support of the European Social Fund.  In a process which is being managed for the Department by Pobal, we have invited bids for projects which will test models of activation which can improve access to employment for people with disabilities, young people with disabilities and people with acquired disabilities, as well as projects which demonstrate better engagement with employers.  The intention is that these projects will be announced by the Minister for Social Protection later this month.  The projects will continue until early 2015 across the Border, midland and west region.  We are hopeful and optimistic that they will provide a valuable input into the development of more effective pathways to employment for people with disabilities in the years ahead.</p><p>  A number of additional programmes, which were formerly operated by F&Aacute;S, are now operated by the Department of Social Protection. These include: the employAbility service, formerly the supported employment programme; the wage subsidy scheme; the disability support-awareness grants and schemes; and community employment.  The main aims of the employAbility service are to facilitate the integration of people with disabilities into paid employment in the open labour market; to provide supports to assist with this integration; and to meet the requirements of employers.  The scheme is open to people with a disability who are job ready and need the support of a coach to obtain employment in the open labour market.  The service is open to people between the ages of 18 and 65 and in 2011 just under 3,000 people with disabilities were supported through this scheme.</p><p>  We also operate the wage subsidy scheme, a demand-led programme to increase the numbers of people with disabilities participating in the open labour market.  A disabled employee on a work subsidy scheme is subject to the same conditions of employment as other employees.  The employer must pay the disabled employee the going rate for the job, at least the minimum wage.  The wage subsidy scheme was placed on a permanent footing from October 2008, subject to the annual budgetary process, following the operation of a three-year pilot phase.  The uptake of the wage subsidy scheme has been incrementally slow since its inception.  It has taken a number of years to build it to this level of participation.  Included in this budget is its predecessor programme, the employment support scheme, which was frozen to new applicants in 2005.  In 2011, wage subsidy was paid in respect of 916 people.</p><p>  A number of different employment supports for people with disabilities are provided for under the heading - disability support and awareness.  These include the work equipment adaptation grant; the job interview-personal reader grant; the employee retention grant; the disability awareness support scheme and the discretionary fund for innovative projects.  The purpose of these grants is to support unemployed people with disabilities to gain access to the open labour market by providing grants for reasonable accommodation in the private sector; to support private employers and encourage them in the employment of people with disabilities; and the funding of innovative disability projects within Department of Social Protection procurement guidelines.  That is all I will say on the disability side for now and I will hand over Ms Mary Kennedy to deal with the social insurance entitlements of the self-employed.</p></speech>

A lower rate of PRSI is paid by the self-employed into the social insurance fund, which provides them with access to long-term social insurance benefits.</p><p>  Self-employed persons are liable for PRSI at the class S rate of 4% which entitles them to access long-term benefits such as State pension, contributory and widow's, widower's or surviving civil partner's pension, contributory.  Maternity benefit is also available to self-employed contributors.  Ordinary employees who have access to short-term and long-term social insurance benefits pay class A PRSI at the rate of 4%.  In addition, their employers make a PRSI contribution of 10.75% in respect of their employees, resulting in the payment of a combined 14.75% rate per employee under full-rate PRSI class A.  For employees earning less than &euro;356 per week, the rate of employer's PRSI is 4.25%. </p></speech>

I also welcome the group from Dundalk who will make the case later for social insurance for the self-employed, although I regret I may not be able to stay for the presentation because Wednesday mornings are awkward for us.</p><p>  How many people aged between 16 and 65 are registered as disabled?  What percentage is in employment?  A study in 2004 stated the number registered was 298,300 of whom only 37% were in employment with only a quarter of them employed on a part-time basis.  What progress, if any, has been made in integrating the disabled into the workforce?  I refer to the change from the previous system to partial capacity benefit.  I acknowledge the scheme is in its infancy but Ms Kennedy stated 700 claims have been awarded.  How many claims have been turned down?  How many are pending?  What is the estimated cost of the scheme in comparison to what it replaced?  What budget has been provided for the disability activation project?  Ms Kennedy said 916 people were successful in accessing the wage subsidy scheme in 2011.  How many applied?  Is a specific budget provided for the scheme or is it demand-led?  What is the budget for disability awareness supports such as the employee retention grant, work equipment and adaptation grants, etc?  How many people were helped under this scheme over the most recent measurable period?</p><p>  Ms Kennedy said that for the contributory State pension to be self-financing, the self-employed would be required to pay 15%.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

What about illness benefit?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1059" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012100300004#D00600"><p>I refer to a jobseeker's system for self-employed people who do not have the necessary contributions -  in other words, self-employed people who are looking for jobseeker's allowance.  There is a widespread perception that once somebody is self-employed, he or she can forget about looking for the allowance.  I am not familiar with other parts of the country but, in the Limerick area, that perception is being encouraged and being promoted by the interaction people have with the local social welfare office.  I am sorry to have to say that but I have to say it clearly and bluntly.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1028" speakername="Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh" time="10:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012100300005#E00200"><p>In her opening statement Ms Leonard said 3,000 people were supported by the EmployAbility service and that the wage subsidy was paid to 916 people.  We know that last year more than 100,000 were in receipt of disability allowance.  That shows the scale of the challenge faced by the Department in capturing the people concerned.  I note what was said about the partial capacity scheme and some of the changes suggested.  Is the Department considering other ways to promote and expand these two schemes?  From my limited knowledge of them, they seems to be working well.  Some employers do not seem to be aware of the partial capacity scheme, or do not seem to be taking up the opportunities it presents.  Is that because they are not aware of the scheme or are they discouraged by the bureaucracy associated with it?  What is the waiting time under the scheme?  In many schemes there is a delay between the application and the sign-off, but an employer wants an employee in place as quickly as possible.  How is the scheme working and how quick is the turnover?</p><p>  Various other grants are available to individuals and employers.  Work equipment adaptations can be made, for example, to ensure someone can be made to feel a full member of staff.  Sometimes the cost of getting to work can be onerous for a person with a severe disability.  Are employers aware of grants to adapt workplaces and equipment?  What is the delay between the application for such a grant and its delivery?</p><p>  Last year the Minister's proposals regarding disability allowance were shelved and the disability allowance scheme was reviewed.  Has this impacted on the work of the Department?  Has there been an increase in the numbers applying to participate in schemes to help them to move from disability allowance into the workforce?  It is not always for monetary gain that people move from dependency on disability payment into the workforce.  Often it has to do with inclusion.  Community employment schemes have helped in many ways in this regard.  Public representatives have been hearing that the changes the Minister made to the community employment scheme and what was termed the double payment have discouraged people with disabilities from taking up opportunities which would have left them job-ready at the conclusion of the scheme.  For an employer or a person with a disability to avail of the two schemes, the delegate mentioned that the employee must be job-ready.  The severity of a disability can exclude a person from the workforce and in need of time in a scheme targeted at addressing that exclusion.  </p><p>  We have had some discussion on the exclusion of self-employed persons from the PRSI system.  I do not doubt this is a complex area, but I have heard of strange cases from people who came to my clinic.  Some taxi drivers who are managing to survive on very low earnings have been able to avail of payments, while others have been told they must give up their PSV licence in order to qualify for jobseeker's allowance.  Some are being obliged to exit the taxi industry completely.  Some PSV licence holders, while not working as taxi drivers, have been told they must surrender their licence, although this is their only access to the workforce.  This is a complex area and needs to be looked at in detail.  </p><p>  The KPMG report on pensions suggests an employer's contribution rate of 17.3%.  The Class A contribution which covers the majority of employees consists of a combined employee and employer contribution rate of 14.75%.  Will the officials explain the reason for the difference?</p><p>  Self-employed persons often have irregular incomes.  There may be periods during which they have a reduced income or no income at all.  The current system is based on days worked.  The committee recently had a discussion on casual work during which we spoke about changing the social welfare code from days worked to hours worked.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1079" speakername="Ray Butler" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012100300006#F00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I welcome the work being done by the working group at present and look forward to its results being issued.  It is long overdue because the group was due to get back to us last year but, hopefully, that will happen in November.  There has to be a way forward with regard to the self-employed because there is no incentive to be self-employed in this country at present.  A safety net must be put in place for self-employed people.</p><p>  Speaking from experience, I agree with what Deputy O'Dea said about the frustration among the public regarding the entitlements of self-employed people.  They go to the social welfare office and are told they are entitled to nothing.  They then come to our constituency offices and we work with them.  One is at the mercy of the community welfare officer in certain cases.  In fairness to them, however, they work with and help many self-employed people.  If one is self-employed, one pays an S stamp or, if one is paying PRSI, an A stamp.  When I was self-employed I had an accountant to pay my returns to the Revenue Commissioners.  They told me what stamp I should pay and when I paid it, I received a receipt.  However, the receipt did not tell one what entitlements one had.  That is one of the issues the Department of Social Protection should deal with.  People need information, particularly the self-employed.  Self-employed people will read the fine details even though they are basically very busy people working seven days a week.  They need this information.</p><p>  Many self-employed people are calling to my constituency office at present.  Their business and turnover are down by 60% or 70% and they are living on their savings.  They are also keeping their businesses going with their savings, but the savings are drying up.  Self-employed people are in a terrible mess.  They were never really represented, and I am not blaming any Government for that.  They are a small minority of people who kept this country going, but they were never represented when it came to their entitlements.  More information should be given to self-employed people about their entitlements.</p><p>  The witnesses say that if a self-employed person can produce their facts and figures to the community welfare officer, he or she is entitled to some type of social welfare payment.  The problem is that a self-employed person's business could have been going badly for a year or two years and if they wish to get all their figures, he or she must get them from their accountant.  In certain cases, they do not have the money to pay their accountant to give them the figures so one is left in no-man's land.  The person might have a young family to feed or a mortgage to be paid but there is no money available.  The social welfare officer cannot give one anything because he or she must have the facts and figures.  We must see what the working group has to offer for self-employed people.  We need something positive from the working group and the Department of Social Protection for the future because there is a definite need for a safety net for self-employed people.</p></speech>

Do the witnesses have any early thoughts on how it is working?  It appears that many of the people who apply for it are people who might have had an exemption and a disability pension and the exemption has been removed.  They apply for the partial capacity benefit in order to keep working.  It also appears that many of them are applying initially just to see what categorisation they achieve, that is, whether it is mild, severe or profound.  That indicates how much of their basic social welfare payment they can retain.  Therefore, some people are just testing it and there is probably a great deal of work in the Department dealing with the applications but perhaps, in the end, the applicant walks away and decides not to avail of it because it does not make economic sense for them.</p></speech>

I will start with the question about partial capacity benefit.  The scheme was introduced earlier this year.  There is no forced take-up of partial capacity at this point.  People can apply for it and they can take up the option of partial capacity or employable partial capacity.  It is on a voluntary basis initially.  That is the position at present.  The points the Deputy has raised are in that context.  Mr. &Oacute; Seaghdha can give further information.</p></speech>

Up to a fortnight ago, 21 September, 1,019 applications had been received.  Of those, 764 had gone through the process of having a medical assessment and a medical opinion provided, 645 were in payment and the vast majority of those medical opinions had indicated, as we would have expected, that the people concerned were in the moderate category.  Typically, they are people one would expect to be closest to the labour market in any event.  Very few were found to be ineligible for payment.  It was inevitable that some people might come through who would have been due for review in the ordinary course of events and might have been found to be ineligible.  A total of 18 so far have fallen into that category, so it is very few.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about costs.  Essentially, the "savings" the Department is making in terms of giving slightly reduced payments to people who are availing of the scheme are negligible at present in the context of the sums the Department pays out for invalidity pension or illness benefit.  We have not started to calculate what they are, but they would be thousands rather than the millions we pay out.</p><p>  Deputy Ryan asked for our thoughts on the scheme.  He is correct that to some extent people are testing the waters and trying to see where they would fit in it.  On the operational side in the Department for the people dealing with this, a large part of the work is trying to tease through these matters with applicants.  This is a voluntary scheme.  There is no compulsion to take it up.  Even if people take it up and it does not work, there is no penalty.  People go back to their original entitlement without question.  They do not have to go through a hoop again but return to their primary payment.</p><p>  What we are trying to move from is a system where there was an exemption, which was, again, a way of testing the water.  The idea was that it would be a time limited thing.  One would get an exemption from the rules of invalidity benefit or invalidity pension and take up work.  If it worked for the person, he or she might move on.  However, that was not recognising that people needed an income support payment given their position in terms of their capacity to engage in the labour market.  Partial capacity provides that long-term support.</p></speech>

We would not necessarily have the full picture because some people with disabilities in the workforce would not necessarily be claiming a social welfare payment.  It is probably small but we do not have the full picture.  The three main schemes are as follows: the disability allowance scheme with 103,000 people; illness benefit with 69,000; and invalidity pension with 49,000.  Approximately 6,000 people on disability allowance are availing of the earnings disregard in addition to those on partial capacity benefit as mentioned in our presentation and those on the supported employment programme.  That would be our picture of the numbers of people with disabilities in the workforce who are involved in the social welfare system.  We would accept the figure is still quite low.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about making employers more aware of the supported employment programme.  We only took over the schemes formerly managed by F&Aacute;S such as the F&Aacute;S supported employment programme earlier in the year.  We now have an opportunity to get an overall handle on what is happening with regard to supports for people with disabilities in the workforce.  We now have the whole picture, so to speak.  We have the income support schemes and these programmes.  It would be our intention to investigate what opportunities present themselves such as making employers more aware, which ties in with the disability activation project Ms Leonard mentioned.  One of the strands of those projects will be the area of engaging with employers and raising their awareness about the opportunities that might exist for people with disabilities to be employed.</p></speech>

It will run from now until the first quarter of 2015.  It is half funded by the European Social Fund and half funded by the Department.  As Ms Leonard said earlier it is being managed by Pobal on behalf of the Department.  Pre-contract negotiations are ongoing and we hope to have announcements later this month on what projects have been selected and where they will go.  Those projects will deal with the interaction with employers.  Clearly awareness raising is a major aspect of the work we have to do.</p></speech>

There is an overall increase in numbers on all the disability schemes.  It is not substantial but it is a continual increase as with all the Department schemes in recent years.</p><p>  The Deputy also asked about the advisory group on taxation and social welfare report on domiciliary care and DA, which is due later in the year.  That report is not available from the group - it is still under consideration.  I have no information on the outcome of it.  The advisory group is preparing reports in a number of areas and the one on child benefit is complete and with the Minister for consideration.  The other reports on self-employment and domiciliary care and the others have not been finalised.  It is an incremental report as Ms Kennedy mentioned in her presentation.  That is why certain areas are more advanced than others in that group's reporting.</p></speech>

They are aware of the downward trend in the economy.  They will take into account changes in the person's income and will not just base it on the previous 12 months.  I know Deputy Butler said it is difficult to get the figures to prove the position because of having to pay the accountant or whatever.  However, we would need some information on their position.  I do not deal on a day-to-day basis with that area and do not know exactly what information is sought.  When our local offices deal with these cases they are aware of the downward trend as we all are and have been asked to take that into account when assessing formerly self-employed people for jobseeker's allowance.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh mentioned that some people were being told to give up PSV licences, etc.  My information is that people are being told not to deregister as self-employed.  There is awareness that people can have an income from self-employment but still be in need of additional income from the State and in those cases they will be eligible to apply for jobseeker's allowance.  Obviously we cannot comment on individual cases and the Deputy may be getting information on a daily basis.  When dealing with people who were formerly self-employed, the instruction is for local offices to look at their income in so far as they can establish it at the moment and not just rely on the previous 12 months because there has been such a downturn.  They are also recommended not to deregister and continue to be self-employed and having assessed their needs they would still be entitled to anything to which they might be entitled on the basis of that means assessment.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.46" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012100300008#H00300"><p>I will be brief.  I welcome the departmental officials and the Self-Employed Alliance Dundalk to the meeting.  I apologise for being late and for missing Ms Mary Kennedy's presentation.  I got a lesson in driving through Dublin today, as 15 miles in Dublin certainly is not like 15 miles in Killarney.</p><p>  When the Minister herself and the departmental officials appeared before the joint committee in recent weeks, I raised the issue of the self-employed and I continue to so do today.  I again ask that they be given the option to pay the contribution.  Ms Kennedy may have referred to this issue in her presentation.  Moreover, when people who were self-employed finally gain access to jobseeker's allowance, they are not allowed a credit contribution, which they need to ensure their pension in the future.  This absolutely fascinates me and I ask that serious consideration be given to allowing such people their credit contribution when they draw jobseeker's allowance.</p><p>  I can never understand the reason the family income supplement is not available to people who are self-employed.  A little help sometimes can keep people going, including those who are self-employed, and this issue should be examined.  All members know that self-employed people pay their tax, their PRSI and their employees' PRSI.  The departmental officials have informed the joint committee in recent weeks that self-employed people's own contribution would have to increase to approximately 16% in order to derive any benefit but I am sure the benefits would be worth it.  It would be just like taking on one additional person, for whom one would be paying the extra 10% or 12% to ensure one's own benefits were in order.  When such individuals apply for benefits such as medical cards or the jobseeker's allowance, trying to get and provide figures involves a quagmire of bureaucracy.  I ask the officials present to ensure that a memorandum is issued to all social welfare offices advising them they are not to ask people to deregister as self-employed because, regardless of what the witnesses might say here today, this does happen.  Perhaps the creation of uniformity among the departmental offices around the country would prevent this from happening.</p><p>  Many people who draw illness benefit or invalidity pension have a small farmholding and they pay PRSI and tax on the income from the farm.  They might have a few dry cattle or whatever the case may be.  When their accountant registers this income, it now emerges that they are drawing illness benefit while making self-employed contributions by paying PRSI.  Consequently, they are in a lot of trouble with the Department and in some cases, the fraud squad has contacted such people, alleging they are working and drawing the benefit.</p><p>  Two weeks ago I asked the officials for figures in respect of the overseas pensions being paid but I have not received anything to date.  Consequently, they might provide me with an update in this regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.47" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1068" speakername="Peter Fitzpatrick" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012100300008#H00400"><p>First, I welcome the Self-Employed Alliance Dundalk.  I myself was self-employed for a number of years.  I took a chance and I gave employment.  I do not understand the reason self-employed people cannot pay the same PRSI contributions as their employees.  Being self-employed, one pays all one taxes, one pays one's PRSI, one's universal social charges and one's PAYE obligations.  One takes a chance every day that one will get paid for the service one supplies.  One pays all one's staff holiday pay and overtime and one is taking people off social welfare.  However, if things change and if business gets bad, one does not get paid.  Moreover, when one's business can no longer survive, one spends all one's savings.  If one seeks help from the social services, one is told that as one was self-employed, one is entitled to nothing.  Even if such people have families to look after, where do they go?  After working all their lives and paying all their taxes, they do not even get jobseeker's benefits, as to so do one must pay PRSI at the class A rate.  Similarly, one does not receive redundancy payments.  Self-employed people are being punished and this must stop.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1106" speakername="Simon Harris" time="10:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012100300008#H00500"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  While I agree with Deputy Fitzpatrick with regard to the self-employed, I wish to revert to the issue regarding the supports available to enable people with disabilities to gain access to the workforce.  The key job for this joint committee and for Members of the Oireachtas is to try to ensure that each euro being spent on disability services is making a difference.  With that in mind, I wish to discuss the wage subsidy scheme.  The departmental officials should outline what checks are carried out to make sure the aforementioned scheme is actually working for the employer who is availing of it in the name of an employee with a disability.  What background checks are conducted or what evidence does the Department have that the employees are receiving the reasonable support and accommodation they are meant to receive?  As I am sure have many other Oireachtas Members, I have encountered instances in which employees in a company who are doing precisely the same work as other employees without a disability, are not being given that reasonable level of accommodation.  They are not being allowed to start a little later or to finish a little earlier or whatever may be required to accommodate their disability.  One must remember that in many cases, the employer is receiving nearly 50% of the hourly wage from the Department for that perceived lack of productivity.  This is one of my questions because I am not convinced that in every case, sufficient checks are being carried out to ensure that employers are passing on the benefit to the employees for which the taxpayers are paying.</p><p>  When one talks about helping people with disabilities to get into the workforce, it really is a cross-departmental and cross-Government issue.  Obviously, the Department of Social Protection has a key role in this regard but so has the HSE, the Departments of Health and Environment, Community and Local Government and so on.  What sort of cross-departmental work is under way at present?  By way of example, many employees with a disability might need the support of a personal assistant, PA, to actually access work.  I note there has been much recent media comment on PA hours.  Obviously, the issue of PA hours is a matter for the HSE and the Department of Health but if such hours are not available, the Department's initiative to get people with disabilities back into the workforce obviously cannot happen.  I have witnesses to comment on such cross-departmental work.</p><p>  In the context of disability, one hears a great deal from those who provide the services, from officials and from politicians but one rarely hears the voice of the person with the disability.  The witnesses should outline the structures the Department has in place to hear feedback from those who are availing of the employment support and the assisted employment services.  With that in mind, this may be something the joint committee could consider because while it is highly beneficial to have the officials in attendance today and I greatly welcome that, it might be useful at some point to hear from those who avail of such services about some of the anomalies they experience.</p></speech>

Before asking the officials to respond, I note Ms Kennedy mentioned the KPMG report and stated it was published on 17 September.  I make the point that it was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas on 24 August and was a public document thereafter.  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh made a point to which others alluded, on how Ms Kennedy gave a figure of 15% or 16% as the contribution self-employed people would need to make to break even.</p></speech>

He mentioned the &euro;87 million, which is the cost assuming that the same level of self-employed would claim jobseeker's benefit as applies to the bulk of the population.  Figures were also produced based on it being 20% lower and 20% higher.  If the numbers claiming were 20% lower than the norm, the estimated cost would be &euro;73 million in 2013 and if the incidence is 20% higher than the norm then the cost in 2013 would be &euro;105 million.  One needs to remember that these are estimates based on the best information they can use because obviously there is no information available to us of the number of self-employed who would seek these payments.  We are assuming the incidence would be the same as applies in the normal population and then doing a costing on that basis and also doing some sensitivities for 20% higher and 20% lower.  The &euro;87 million figure assumes that the rate applying for jobseeker's benefit would be the same as applies to the overall population.</p><p>  Senator Moloney mentioned the option to pay at class A.  It is not possible to opt in or out - by and large social insurance is compulsory.  If the self-employed were to pay at class A then all self-employed would have to pay whatever rate is deemed appropriate to meet the cost of the benefits.  She also mentioned credits for the self-employed.  As she knows there are no credits for self-employed persons at the moment.  If self-employed individuals want to preserve their entitlement to their pension they would have the option of becoming a voluntary contributor.  That is the only route at the moment for self-employed persons.</p></speech>

I suppose it goes back to the fact that they are paying 4% and doing very well on the 4%.  To give them credits on top of that might have been considered inappropriate at the time.  It is something we can certainly look at.</p></speech>

We suggest that the option is there to become a voluntary contributor.  The Senator also raised the issue of FIS and the self-employed.  I do not have any information on that.  Again it is something we may need to look at in the context of the other issues.</p><p>  A number of members mentioned the lack of information.  We recently posted to <i>www.welfare.ie</i> a detailed note on the self-employed.  It deals with assessment of needs and other such information.  I take the point that more information may be needed.  I believe the Senator suggested sending a memo to all the local offices and we will certainly bring that comment back to our colleagues in that area.  We have already done this and we will do it again if there is an issue with different treatments in different areas.  We can certainly do that.</p><p>  The Senator also sought information on pensions and I am aware of that.  My understanding is that we are very close to issuing a letter to the Senator if it has not already issued.  We can also send that to the Chairman to provide it to other members of the committee.</p><p>  With regard to the 14.75% and 17.3%, all I can say is that the 17.3% and the other figures are the figures KPMG calculated as being the cost.  The 14.75% is the current combined rate.  Some people on very high salaries are paying a high amount because of the redistributive nature of the fund.  What is paid in respect of some people at the lower level is quite low.  That is probably how it balances out at an average of 14.75%.</p></speech>

I appreciate what the officials have said about posting the recent information to the website.  However, more needs to be done to provide greater information for self-employed people.

Deputy Harris spoke about the ongoing cross-departmental work.  The main vehicle for that at the moment is the national disability strategy implementation group, chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy Kathleen Lynch.  It draws together all the main players working in that area and tries to co-ordinate the response across the public sector to the delivery of the national disability strategy.  That is the main formal vehicle that exists in that space.</p><p>  The Deputy asked about the structures in the Department.  I reiterate a point I made earlier that we have now taken over some of the support to the employment services previously delivered by F&Aacute;S.  That in itself delivered some degree of rationalisation in that area because that has now been added to our brief and work in the area.  In terms of formal structures, within the Department we have a consultative forum, whereby we met people with disabilities mainly to talk about operational issues on the ground as opposed to policy.  However, that forum exists and people with disabilities are represented on it.  From time to time the Department also holds focus group sessions with targeted groups.</p></speech>

I thank them for appearing before us and apologise for the long wait.  However, it is hoped our discussion with the departmental officials has provided them with an insight into the Department's policies in this area.</p><p>  Before we commence, I draw attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person, persons or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  I now invite Mr. McArdle to introduce his colleagues and make his presentation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.83" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin McArdle" time="11:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2012100300010#K01100"><p>I am accompanied by Mr. Fred Matthews, Mr. Cathal Cassidy and Mr. Derek Watters.  Mr. Denis Dolan who is self-employed had to leave to attend a prior engagement.  He did not expect to be here very long.  As a self-employed person, one cannot always hang around for as long as one would like.</p><p>  There has been much discussion on some of the issues we wish to address.  I get the impression that many members have been visited at their clinics by self-employed persons whose situation has increasingly become serious in the past few years owing to the downturn in the economy, which is what drove us to establish our organisation.  We thank the committee for providing us with the opportunity to state our case against the unjust and unwarranted discrimination against members of Self-Employed Alliance Dundalk and all self-employed persons in the country.  Self-employed individuals have contributed enormously to the financing and social structure of the country.  Latest Central Statistics Office figures show that in the first quarter of this year there were just under 300,000 self-employed persons in the State.  The people in question employ a larger section of the workforce than the multinationals which many consider are the dominant employers in the country.  </p><p>  I run a shop in my home town of Dundalk, selling outdoor activity products.  Self-Employed Alliance Dundalk was formed in early 2011 as a result of the fear, anxiety and lack of hope within the local business community.  Our members include a wide range of retail and service providers.  Many businesses have seen a dramatic reduction in turnover, while many others have closed in recent years, primarily as a result of the economic downturn.  Large numbers of shops have closed in Dundalk, some of which were in business for generations.  It was obvious from early meetings of the group that there was a wide diversity of factors which were having a detrimental effect on members, including a lack of credit from banks, the withdrawal of long-term overdraft facilities with little notice and no discussion, the burden imposed by the local authority rate increase, bad debts and redundancy payments, etc.  However, the number one issue of concern for many self-employed persons was that there was no safety net for them from the Government when things went wrong.  </p><p>  Examples of the disadvantages of being self-employed, as identified by our members, are, first, there is no exposure to unfair dismissal procedures; second, there is no guarantee of a weekly or monthly income; third, there is exposure to financial risk in carrying out work, including bad debts where they arise.  In addition, when things go wrong, family homes can be repossessed.  The fourth reason is the lack of social welfare benefits available should they become unemployed.  Illness, disability and unemployment are not covered by class 3 contributions.</p></speech>

I have employed between 20 and 25 persons for up to 25 years at a time and contributed millions of euro in tax to the State.  Three years ago my financial well-being hit a wall and I am now treated as worthless by the State.  My daughters decided to go back to education and, because they did not understand the social welfare system and had worked up until the time they sat the leaving certificate examination, were unable to access grants.  They had worked until the month of May, sat the leaving certificate examination and obtained their places.  However, if they had gone on the dole or received jobseeker's allowance in February, they would have been fully funded by the State.  I went to the VEC and other places looking for help because I did not have the ability to fund the fees.  I came out of the VEC in tears; I felt humiliated.  At 59 years of age the State had nothing for me.  I went back to work.  All I understand is that, as an individual, I can create wealth and generate an income.  It is humiliating that my adult daughters, because I am perceived to have the wealth I used to have, are being put through the mill to receive a basic education.  It is stressful and I have had to attend for counselling to get myself in fit shape to live a life.  It has affected my whole family.  This is the impact on the self-employed.  I am independent, but what I do is lunacy.  I create wealth instead of finding a job.  People tell us it cannot be done, but one goes and does it.  That is the core of independent SMEs, but it is being decimated and savaged by being ignored.  That independence leaves us totally isolated because we are easily picked off.</p><p>  I am looking for leadership from members and the Deputies and Senators who lead the country.  They give me the impression that they are on this treadmill that was vacated by the Fianna F&aacute;il-led Government and that they are busy running, but they lack a vision for the future.  Without the ability and support of SMEs, the country will collapse totally because they create the wealth and employment.  I employed 25 persons; now I am indebted everywhere.  Social services which are within the remit of the committee should be available to me and my family when needed.  No one should feel like a second-class citizen in the State.</p></speech>

While it was quite succinct, it was very clear and comprehensive.  When the delegation referred to the context of job losses, etc., it could have been talking about my town.  I know exactly where it is coming from.</p><p>  One will have noted from the discussion with the officials that we are all aware of the imbalance between the treatment of the self-employed and the treatment of other employees in the social welfare system.  I thank the delegation for its efforts to help correct the imbalance.  It is quite a sacrifice for those who are trying to run their businesses daily to form a pressure group.  They put a lot of time and effort into their cause.  It is a sacrifice for the delegation to be present here today.  My party is now aware that there is a severe imbalance between the treatment of the self-employed and the treatment of employees with regard to the social insurance scheme.  I deal with this daily in my constituency.  I will work very hard to ensure the sacrifices the delegation is making to correct the imbalance are not being made in vain.</p></speech>

It is great to see them making a presentation.  Their concerns comprise one of the most significant issues that arose on the doorsteps during the last general election campaign.</p><p>  I had a shoe shop for 24 years and have been self-employed all my life.  It is disappointing to see so many doors being shut and a lack of information.  Self-employed people really do not know their entitlements because they are busy protecting their businesses and getting on with what they do.  For a self-employed person to enter a constituency office is a huge step.  The self-employed have never been in looking for anything in their lives and, therefore, do not know their entitlements.  All self-employed people have done all their lives is paid.  They kept paying.</p><p>  My late father &ndash; Lord have mercy on him &ndash; used to say that once one puts one's name over the door and becomes self-employed, one becomes an unpaid tax collector.  It is great to see the delegates making their case.  Many of the Senators and Deputies are aware of the problem that exists because they have encountered it in their constituencies.  They hear about it daily.</p><p>  Many self-employed people have battled to retain their businesses, yet those businesses have deteriorated even more.  They are receiving no help from the banks or credit unions.  I agree totally with Mr. Matthews on this.  The self-employed have been using their savings and the savings are now drying up.  If we are serious about getting this country moving and taking it out of its current mess, we will need self-employed people and SMEs.  The latter will restore the country.  We need a safety net for SMEs.</p><p>  I am delighted to see representatives from the Department of Social Protection present.  They have changed their attitude to the self-employed and their entitlements considerably since I became a Member 18 months ago.  In fairness to the Minister for Social Protection, she is working on the issue.  An independent group is producing a report and we will determine how we should proceed when we receive it.</p><p>  Circumstances have changed.  During the last general election campaign, I was on local radio, LMFM, and remember Mr. Michael Reade asking me what I would like to do if I got elected.  The issue we are talking about is one I said I would like to address because it has affected me personally.  I know what it is like to go home with the stress and strain of trying to pay one's bills, including one's rates, electricity bill and staff bill.  The SME owner is the last person to get paid and does not get a shilling at all some weeks; he or she is just trying to survive.  I know what it is like to have no money and to bring all one's pressures home with one.  We need a safety net for the self-employed if there is to be progress.</p><p>  When I know we are in tough times, I realise we need a safety system if we are to get the country going again.  Self-employed people and SMEs will get the country out of the hole it is in if they are given a chance.</p></speech>

Every time there was a debate on social welfare in the Seanad, I raised the problem of the self-employed.  At every meeting of this committee since I became a member two months ago, I have raised the issue, and I will continue to do so.  We await the advisory committee's report and I hope it will contain recommendations that suit the self-employed.</p><p>  While we are always worrying about the big multinational companies and saving 400 jobs here and 300 there, we must realise that if we concentrated on retaining one job here and two or three there, the combined number would be considerable.  The self-employed, while generating an income for their families and not drawing on the Exchequer, help their few employees.  It is vital, therefore, that we help the self-employed.  I will continue to fight their case until we achieve at least some of their objectives.</p></speech>

I am a newly elected Deputy and know how hard it is to appear before an Oireachtas committee to make a statement.  The delegates have done a fantastic job.  Mr. Kevin McArdle&rsquo;s presentation was very honest.  He did not leave anything out and everything he said is true.  It took a lot for a very established businessman in Dundalk to make time to come here to tell the truth.  He is a very lucky man to have the support of his family.  I thank everyone who made a contribution.</p><p>  I am a former self-employed person and fully appreciate the position of the delegates.  I employed 20 people.</p> <p>My business was different.  One gave people 60 or 90 days' credit and depended on them to pay.  All that our guests wanted after busting their backsides and providing a fantastic service was to get paid.  If someone did not pay them, it was not their fault.  The system is wrong where the self-employed are concerned.  They took a chance, tried to better their lives and took people off social welfare.  They have done everything right.  If a business is not going well, one-----</p></speech>

I apologise for having missed some of Mr. McArdle's presentation.  Like my colleague, I read it in the Seanad Chamber.  We are all singing from the same hymn sheet and well aware of the issues.  I am married to a self-employed man.  The mention of being unable to take a holiday was particularly poignant.  The employees are paid and well looked after in terms of PRSI, etc., but the self-employed are caught in a loop and nothing can be done for them.</p><p>  There has been plenty of talk, but we need to progress matters.  Perhaps our guests have already offered their opinions, but how best can we support them further?  In the past year, I have been inundated by self-employed people attending my office.  Being expected to pay rates is a big deal for someone who has never sought anything from or been beholden to the State.  As a PRSI and PAYE employee, I never needed to deal with such considerations.  Everything was deducted from my final cheque.  It is shocking that self-employed people are still expected to pay their bills even when they are receiving no money.  I would value our guests' opinions on how we can best help them.</p></speech>

This is a major issue for the entire country and the Department of Social Protection must address it.  The cost of providing social insurance for self-employed people will need to be met, but that insurance is necessary, given the significant increase in the number of people seeking help in this regard.  I would support a system of social insurance for the self-employed.  I hope that the committee will determine to support such a system as well.</p></speech>

They were as high as 17.3%, yet that rate did not include all of the benefits.  Mr. McArdle rounded off his presentation by stating that we were looking for equality.  We have no difficulty with paying the additional PRSI and we do not expect to get benefits without paying for them.  However, I have a difficulty with paying an additional 3% or so and not getting the same benefits.</p></speech>

The departmental officials were adamant that the benefits were good, in that they included an old age pension, a survivor's contributory pension, the bereavement grant and maternity benefit.  We are trying to get the self-employed into the bracket for other benefits, for example, carer's, jobseeker's and illness.  The extra payments would go towards them.</p></speech>

What "class S" means should be written on their receipts.  The Department could do this.  When we were county councillors, we were all on class K stamps, which is a different type of stamp.  When I closed my business and sought to find out whether I was entitled to the family income supplement, FIS, I had to wait 25 weeks for a decision.  I did not have two bob to rub together.  The decision was that I was not entitled, as I had not paid a class A stamp.</p></speech>

I did not get an answer this morning from the Department of Social Protection as to why PAYE workers would pay a total of 14.75%, made up of rates of 10.75% and 4%, with self-employed people having to pay a rate of 17.3% and not even getting the same benefits.  If this has an actuarial basis, we must consider both sectors and formulate one true figure rather than two.  The principle of entitlement should be considered first.</p></speech>

Two and half years ago I am sure people's businesses were thriving, so there is no true reflection of what is happening now.  There should be some kind of emergency provision so that people could get money now while the Department considers the circumstances of that business.  Two and half years is a long way to go back in anybody's books.</p></speech>

That was one of the issues raised by Deputies and Senators.  The 17% figure arises as the fund has a shortfall of approximately &euro;1.5 billion this year and will have a shortfall of &euro;3 billion in four years.  There will be a major shortfall in years to come if nothing is done.  The 17% figure comes from an assumption that the shortfall cannot be widened further.

There is a bit of a maverick about them as they act in ways that others may not.  It may not be easy to find a certain element and that must be encompassed in whatever system is put in place for small and medium enterprises.  It is against the grain for any of us to look for something.  One may feel awkward or remiss or rejected if somebody is looking for a form.

This morning I asked about an optional payment and I am disappointed that the group is not agreeable to this; it seems it is all or nothing.  The bigger self-employed businesses, which are making some money, may fight such a process because they may not want to pay extra.  I was hoping people could opt for a payment and if they fell on hard times, they would be able to draw benefits.</p><p>  There must be a fight for credit contributions as it is vital for pensions.  There will be a gap in the pensions of these business people if they do not get that credit stamp.  It was not mentioned in the presentation but it is vital.  I hope the witnesses will fight hard for that and we will fight from this end.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.142" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/974" speakername="Pat Breen" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012100300003#D00200"><p>I am conscious that we are behind time and that our witnesses must head to Dublin Airport at 3.45 p.m.  I apologise to our witnesses for the delay in commencing the public session of the meeting.  We were discussing another matter in private session and it overran.</p><p>  On behalf of the committee I welcome Mr. Pierre Vimont, the Executive Secretary General of the European External Action Service, EEAS.  He is accompanied by Ms Jutta Edthofer, the Antici counsellor, and Mr. Keith McBean, the Irish Ambassador to the Political and Security Committee in Brussels.</p><p>  The EEAS is a very young organisation, having been established in December 2010.  Mr. Vimont and his colleagues have faced the challenge of putting in place a very large organisation with a shared organisational culture, which is a daunting task given that the staff is drawn from so many various backgrounds.  Parallel to these organisational challenges, the EEAS has had to establish itself as an effective actor in international affairs on behalf of the European Union and has played an important role in Serbia and Kosovo, in talks with Iran and in efforts to bring about a resumption of talks in the Middle East peace process.  These few lines sum up a very daunting task.</p><p>  The committee is interested to hear how the EEAS approaches the challenges which determine its policy priorities and how it interacts for this purpose with the institutions of the European Union and the member states, in particular the state holding the Presidency, which we will do in the first six months of 2013.  I commend High Representative Catherine Ashton for her commitment in interacting directly with the committees on foreign affairs of EU national parliaments at their twice yearly interparliamentary conferences.  Since I became Chairman of this committee I have attended three Presidency meetings and Baroness Ashton has been there to brief chairpersons from throughout the EU and she also holds question and answer sessions.  I am very impressed with her and her role.  I hope over time the relationship between her and these committees can develop.  It is important that this happens.  In the meantime, we look forward to welcoming Baroness Ashton.  I believe she will be here for OSCE meetings in the first week in December.  We will host a meeting during the Irish Presidency, in the third week of March, and Baroness Ashton has committed to attend it.</p><p>  I wish to advise Mr. Vimont that he is protected by absolute privilege in respect of utterances to this committee.  However, if he is directed by the committee to cease making remarks on a particular matter and continues to do so, he is entitled, thereafter, only to a qualified privilege in respect of his remarks.  He is directed that only comments or evidence connected with the subject matter of the meeting are to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that where possible, he should not criticise or make charges against a Member of either House of the Oireachtas, a person outside of the Houses or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  Once again I apologise for the delay.</p></speech>

My only urgency is to catch a flight later but until then I am at the disposal of the committee for any questions the members would like to raise.</p><p>  My presentation will be brief and will focus on the reason I am here, namely, to prepare for the rotating Presidency which Ireland will hold at the beginning of 2013.  The EEAS must do this because the workings of the institutional system makes very close collaboration with the rotating Presidency very important for us.  The Chairman mentioned the High Representative several times.  As she has two hats - she is also Vice President of the Commission - she has an almost impossible task and therefore needs assistance from the rotating Presidency in some of the work she must complete.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.146" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012100300004#E00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and I hope they have a safe journey back.  I have not been a member of this committee for long and I am not familiar with many of the terms referring to the organisations involved.  I am not familiar with the role played by the EEAS so I found the briefing document interesting in the questions it raises.</p><p>  Is the EEAS planning any activity on trade with Israeli settlements in light of this committee's proposal for an EU-wide ban on trade on settlement goods?  This arose from the discussion on what was happening in Gaza.  Does the EEAS have a role?  I am supportive of the ban on Israeli settlement goods in order to emphasise that the ban is only on goods produced in Israeli settlements.  We support it because of the illegality of the settlements and the human rights abuses that took place.  It seems that ethnic cleansing is taking place and different NGOs gave us the background to what is happening in the settlement areas.  Does the EEAS have a view?</p><p>  Regarding EU sanctions, in the Middle East the High Representative has ensured an ongoing European contribution to efforts to bring about a resumption of talks and to highlight the humanitarian situation in Gaza.  This is a concern shared by Ireland.  The EEAS refers to sanctions policies, another area that has developed significantly over the past year and a half, and the recent resumption of discussions on the Iranian nuclear programme has been in part attributed to the tough measures imposed in January of this year, including a ban on crude oil.  We know the Israeli Government is not signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons, NPT, and it seems to have nuclear weapons.  It certainly has nuclear power and is able to enrich nuclear fuel.  We have no ban or similar efforts in respect of Israel, despite what is happening in Gaza.  There seems to be a contradiction with what is wrong in one part of the world and what we are doing in another.  Perhaps it is beyond the remit of the EEAS to comment on these matters.  We are placing sanctions on one country yet we do not do anything to another country involved in the same thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012100300004#E00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I am examining the role of the organisation in respect of human rights.  The ambassador referred to working on reform in terms of crisis response and crisis management structures.  Will it apply where there are significant abuses of human rights?  As the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade, we have presentations, meetings and briefings with a number of countries and agencies concerned with human rights issues.  Today, three of us had a meeting on the appalling situation in Bahrain, where doctors are prevented from treating injured people because they were protesting.  Other meetings concern what happened in Syria.  It is all very well having human rights principles but we do not have the action to follow from the principles.  Is there a major role for the EEAS in that respect?  What power will it have to intervene in those horrific situations?  I am struck by the irony of certain countries sitting on human rights commissions and committees when such countries are to the fore in human rights concerns.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.148" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1056" speakername="Dan Neville" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012100300004#E00500"><p>Perhaps this point is too political but Ireland is a neutral country.  We are very protective of our neutrality.  The EEAS is part of the common foreign and security policy.  How does that fit with a neutral country, which is defensive of its neutrality and any implication that this might be compromised?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.149" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="14:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012100300004#E00600"><p>The witnesses are most welcome.  I apologise for not having read the briefing note.  We were called into two meetings, one of which concerned an issue in Malawi and another concerned the delegation from Bahrain talking about human rights.  I apologise for not being well briefed and if I put questions that may not be applicable.</p><p>  What is the relationship between Europe and the African Union and the Arab League?  The latter two are important international players in the field and at the heart of areas of substantial conflict.</p><p>  We have had disturbing reports of how High Representative Ashton was handling Bosnia-Herzegovina, particularly Republika Srpska.  There was an argument that matters were unfolding rather than getting better.  In a nutshell, we can hit every area of conflict, excluding Palestine, Syria and Bahrain but we do not have time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.151" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1067" speakername="Gerald Nash" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012100300005#F00200"><p>I welcome Mr. Vimont to the committee.  I recently met him in Brussels as part of a delegation on the Palestine issue and was impressed by his grasp of the situation and with some of the views he expressed on behalf of the European External Action Service.</p><p>  Establishment of the European External Action Service has allowed Europe to act in a more coherent fashion in terms of the application of foreign policy, which is to be welcomed.  A criticism appropriately levelled at the European Union in recent years was that there did not exist a type of resourced operation which allowed us to act in a coherent manner.  While, as we are all aware, the service is experiencing some teething problems, they are matters that can be addressed if the political will to do so exists and resources are made available.</p><p>  In terms of the Palestinian question, the international community has been rightly accused of inaction in recent years in terms of it allowing the situation to drift.  When a situation like that drifts, the prospects of vulnerable people, including those on the front line, are damaged.  It appears to many of us that the prospects for peace and a lasting settlement in Palestine are distant at this point given what we know about illegal settlements and various other activities.  It also appears that the Palestinian question is always at the mercy of the US electoral cycle.  It is self-evident that the European Union should be playing a much more proactive role in the resolution of the intractable problem on our own doorstep in our southern neighbourhood.</p><p>  I would appreciate if Mr. Vimont could outline the role he sees the European Union playing in the context of the EEAS in terms of the resolution of the Palestinian question and if he would comment on the prospect of an EU-wide ban on produce from illegal settlements, on which the committee took a position in recent weeks.  The T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade has a strong view on that issue in terms of how it applies to Ireland.  </p><p>  I had the opportunity to visit Tunisia in recent months, where I met with some senior public representatives of the new Administration.  We are all aware of the Arab Spring and the consequences in that regard.  A key concern of the Tunisian people, given their proximity to the European Union and historic relationship with Europe during colonial times and in recent times, is how the European Union can assist in bedding down democracy, trade and development and employment and so on in the Maghreb area in Tunisia and across into the Middle East to areas that are now hungry for democracy.</p></speech>

On the Bosnian situation which was raised by Deputy Eric Byrne, I recently read an article in which Mr. Paddy Ashdown stated that the policy of the international community in the past few years has been utterly disastrous.  Perhaps Mr. Vimont would address that issue and would also comment on the renewal of the chapter 7 mandate by the Security Council in November.  Some highly respected experts have warned of the ending of that mandate and the danger of the dissolution of Bosnia without the safeguards provided by the chapter 7 mandate.</p><p>  I have two brief questions in regard to humanitarian aid and action.  Will the EEAS become a signatory to the EU consensus on humanitarian aid?  In regard to the important work of human rights defenders, what actions, if any, is the EEAS considering to ensure consistent implementation of the EU guidelines?</p></speech>

I have one question for the ambassador in relation to the EEAS.  What plans are in place to further the relationship of the EEAS with national parliaments, in particular the Croatian Parliament?  Does the EEAS intend to develop its relationship with these parliaments?  The relationship between national parliaments and the EEAS is important and should be built upon.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pierre Vimont" time="14:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012100300005#F00500"><p>I will try to answer all of the questions asked.  As regards trade in some products from Israeli settlements in Palestinian territory, this is an issue with which we have been dealing for some time.  It must be remembered that EEAS work can only go as far as member states allow.  Also, this is a competence that belongs to our colleagues in the Commission, with whom we work closely.  On an issue as political as this, we are of course very much involved.  We have stated several times, including again recently, in conclusions from the Council that this issue is one of concern for the European Union.  We have discussed this with member states several times.  To be totally honest, we have not been able thus far to reach an agreement of the 27 members.  What we are witnessing at the moment is member states individually trying to address the issue.  Members may be aware that some UK companies have taken the decision to tag these products in terms of origin.  The decisions which have been taken by individual member states or by enterprise or corporations in those member states are the only ones taken so far.  We recently discussed this issue again with the High Representative who told us she wanted us to continue to put pressure on member states to see how far we can go.  This is a matter of major concern for the Palestinian authorities with whom we are engaging.</p><p>  On the general issue of the relationship between the EEAS and the Palestinian Authority, I remind members that the major donor in terms of financial assistance to the Palestinian Authority is the European Union.  In spite of what is being said by many partners inside the region or from other entities around the international community, the European Union is providing most of the financial resources for the day-to-day work of the Palestinian Authority, in other words, the Palestinian administration.  We are supporting the UN agency in charge of Palestinian refugees outside of the Palestinian territory, either in Syria, Lebanon or Jordan.  I could go on.  There is no doubt but that the European Union is the major partner for our Palestinian counterpart.  We intend to continue that work.  Where we can act we try, as we have done in the past, to do so through the provision of financial resources, statements and support for the Palestinian position.  On some other issues which are rather controversial, including that of trade of products from the settlements, we have not been able to go as far as would wish to.  </p><p>  The issue of sanctions taken against Iran and against Israel on the issue of the use of nuclear energy for military purposes was mentioned.  Members will be aware, in spite of what has been said time and again, that there is no clear evidence and so on in the Vienna agencies of nuclear weapons in Israel.</p></speech>

For example, is the EEAS regarded as a necessary evil or nuisance?  There is a subtlety that should not go unnoticed.  To what extent is the EEAS respected, rather than feared?  When a submission is made that should be taken note of, is it ignored?  The tendency is for warring factions in various places to ignore everybody.  The EU, by virtue of its financial contribution in these areas, does have a right to follow up and ask whether it is being taken seriously.  Syria is a classic example.  To what extent is the fear of being dragged before the International Criminal Court a factor?  To what extent has it been used by the EEAS as a means of promoting the positive progress in respect of the situation presented?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2012-10-03a.159" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pierre Vimont" time="15:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2012100300007#H00400"><p>Perhaps I can explain a few elements.  The Deputy asked about Syria.  We have maintained our EU delegation to Syria, therefore, we are in contact with the Government of Syria and express strong messages, time and again, about the need for the Syrian Government to take notice of what the international community has repeated time and again.  Of course, we are a nuisance and Syria is not happy with that and has told us so.  At the same time, it respects us because we have remained in Damascus saying we want to be close to the people of Damascus and Syria at a time of great suffering and try to help them as much as we can through humanitarian assistance.  We should do much more and this is what we are trying to do.  The fact that we are there is important.</p><p>  In the case of Iran, the High Representative, Catherine Ashton, chairs the EU 3 plus 3 group, in other words the group that is negotiating on behalf of the international community to try to find a solution to the whole issue of the nuclear programme.  She has regular contacts with her counterpart.  Every time they have decided they should meet they have arranged a meeting without difficulty, which means they may not like what the High Representative has to tell them but they come, listen, discuss and, perhaps, contradict her but we are considered as a legitimate partner, which is not bad. </p><p>  On the question about the International Criminal Court and whether there should be a referral to that court, that is a complicated issue.  Do we have to push that issue as quickly as possible at the beginning of a crisis, with the risk of closing any possibility of finding a solution to make the leader involved in that crisis step down from office?  There is a need to think about this issue.   </p><p>  With regard to Syria, more than half of the member states are of the opinion that we should have a referral to the International Criminal Court.  A few member states wonder whether we should wait a little longer.  It was decided among all of us to discuss that issue with Mr. Lakhdar Brahimi, the joint special representative of the UN and the Arab League for Syria.  We would not want to jeopardise his efforts and the plan he is trying to set up to try to find a political solution to the crisis.  If Mr. Brahimi is of the opinion that we should go ahead with a referral to the International Criminal Court, then the 27 of us will meet again to decide if we should go forward on that issue.  It is a tricky issue on which, every time, we have to look at the pros and cons and find the right balancing act.  While we have not yet decided on a referral to the International Criminal Court, we are trying to use, as much as possible, all the evidence we can gather and work very closely with the commission of inquiry in Geneva to have the principle of accountability with regard to what is happening in Syria implemented as fully as possible</p></speech>

Our discussions were useful.  Perhaps we can look forward to a further discussion in the future.  I hope there will be many opportunities for the parliamentary committee to interact with the EEAS.  There will be an opportunity next year at a meeting in Dublin to interact with the EU High Representative, Baroness Ashton.  I wish Mr. Pierre Vimont well in his efforts to consolidate the EEAS as a very successful organisation.</p></speech>
