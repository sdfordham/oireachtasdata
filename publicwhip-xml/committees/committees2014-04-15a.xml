I welcome everybody.  From the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, we have Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue, Mr. John Ward, Ms Eibhl&iacute;n O'Sullivan and Mr. Ciar&aacute;n Healy; from Iascair&iacute; Cois C&oacute;sta Inis &Oacute;irr, Mr. M&iacute;che&aacute;l &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in and Mr. Trevor McHale; from the South Wexford Lobster Company, Mr. Aidan Scallan and Mr. Kevin Kielty; from &Iacute;ascair&iacute; Int&iacute;re Cois Cladach na h&Eacute;ireann, Mr. &Eacute;amon &Oacute; Corcora and Mr. John &Oacute; Conghaile; from Galway Bay Inshore Fishermans Association, Mr. Gerry Sweeney and Mr. Pat Mullins.  I thank them for coming today.<br />Before we begin I draw witnesses&rsquo; attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />Given that there are five groups we have asked witnesses to be as concise as possible.  We will then have questions and answers in order to get as much information and to make the meeting as productive as possible for everyone.  I will call speakers in the order in which I have called out the names.  Speakers have said they will try to keep their contributions to less than five minutes.  We will not ring a bell if they go a little over time but in order for members to engage it would be helpful if opening comments could be kept as brief as possible.  I remind members and witnesses to switch off mobile phones and other devices as they interfere with the broadcasting equipment which makes it very difficult for the proceedings to be broadcast.  I invite Mr. O'Donoghue to speak first on behalf of the Federation of Irish Fishermen.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Se&aacute;n O'Donoghue" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014041500003#C00300"><p>Thank you Chairman for inviting us to the committee meeting today.  We have a very serious topic that we wish to discuss, namely, the bad weather that occurred in December 2013 and January and February of this year.  In our delegation we also have Mr. Kieran Healy who is an active fisherman who has not gone to sea since the weather was bad in December.  Members can ask questions directly of him as he is someone who is actively affected by what we will outline.  There will be no difficulty in that regard.</p><p>  To put the issue in perspective, we experienced one of the most severe winters, which lasted three months, that has happened in a long time.  In the submission which we circulated, which I hope everybody has, we have shown that we had wind gusts of greater than 40 knots, which is gale force 8.  One is talking about wave heights of between 5.5 m and 7.5 m.  We had 40 days of such weather during a three-month period.</p><p>  The weather information comes from Met &Eacute;ireann.  It is not something we dreamt up along the way.  When one looks at the severe weather events over the four months, one will see the wind gusts of greater than 40 knots to 60 knots were consistent over the period and they were far higher than any of the previous years.  There is no doubt we are talking about an extreme weather event.  This is not something on which we will seek support from the committee every year.  Unfortunately, from a fisherman&rsquo;s point of view, because of the severe weather events, fishermen were unable to go to sea for a period of almost three months.  Any of the lucky vessels that did manage to go to sea &ndash; they were the larger white fish vessels &ndash; only managed it for a short period, probably up to five days.</p><p>  We are aware that the Minister, Deputy Coveney, introduced a limited pot scheme.  We have only had an uptake of 151 applications out of a possible 1,800.  That is a tiny amount of applications.  There are a number of reasons for that.  The first is that it was very difficult for many small-scale fishermen to find receipts for pots they purchased a year or two years ago.  One does not normally keep such receipts.  More importantly, the scheme was based on one buying a replacement pot and then claiming the grant support.  If one did not have the financial wherewithal then one would not be able to do anything.  We brought the situation to the attention of the Minister.  FIF has been in touch with him on a number of occasions seeking that an appropriate scheme would be put in place to help alleviate the financial ruin many fishermen face.</p><p>  We also highlighted that the situation did not just relate to pots.  Whitefish vessels also suffered severe economic loss.  That is in contrast to what was done in Northern Ireland and the United Kingdom where schemes were immediately introduced.  We have been very mean in our attitude towards the situation.  I have not gone into all the detail because of the time constraints.  In the document we have come up with a number of ways to address the problem.  We seek additional funds to be made immediately available by the Minister from the Exchequer.  In addition, there is a European maritime and fisheries fund which was agreed at technical and political level between the European Parliament and the Council at the end of January this year.  There is a particular article in that which allows for compensation to fishermen in extreme climactic situations.  We can guarantee that what we experienced were extreme climactic conditions.</p> <p>Also, the Fisheries Commissioner, Maria Damanaki, has pointed out that there is scope for compensation under that scheme.</p><p> If we do not do something about this issue, a significant number of vessel owners will experience extreme financial hardship.  Some of them will have no option but to declare bankruptcy.  We are calling on the Government to put in place immediately additional Exchequer funds, and to top up those with funds from the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund, EMFF.  That legislation may not be published yet but it can be backdated to 1 January 2014.</p><p> This additional scheme must be in place before the end of April.  It is very important that the scheme put in place has a user-friendly application process and that it does not require people to put moneys up-front before they can buy gear.  If this scheme is to mean anything, the compensation aspect of it must be paid by the end of May.</p><p> In essence, we had an extreme climatic event which has caused havoc in the small-scale fisheries and in the whitefish fisheries.  We have not got an adequate response from the Minister or the Government in that regard and we are calling for the scheme to be put in place urgently to avoid these fishermen suffering further financial hardship and even ruin.</p><p> We have a separate submission, which we are not dealing with today, on the seafarers allowance and other social welfare issues on the fishing side.</p></speech>

C&uacute;pla bliain &oacute; shin, th&aacute;inig muid le ch&eacute;ile mar go raibh imn&iacute; mh&oacute;r orainn leis an todhcha&iacute; at&aacute; amach romhainn san iascaireacht cois c&oacute;sta.</p><p>  Winter storms are part of our lives.  This year was unusual in that we had more of them than we would have normally, and our location is particularly exposed being a small island.  Damage done to boats and fishing gear is relative to the scale of the fishing operation.  For many years, fishing on our island was seasonal and part time, as is tourism and farming, but in recent years we have been forced to work through the year in dangerous conditions to try to make a living due to a significant decrease in the price of lobsters, the increase in the price of equipment and so on.  In addition, living on an island and fishing in a traditional way, many of our members would make their own equipment rather than buy it, therefore, in terms of applying for this compensation, receipts do not apply.  </p><p>  Fishing in this way all year round is not sustainable in the long term.  We know that because our area is so small.  We live in a unique location and community, and we have to make a living in a unique fashion, not amenable to the practices of large-scale operations but grounded on the traditions and reality of island life, which can be different.</p><p>  Compensation packages alone for the small, traditional operators offer little in ensuring the long-term sustainability of our industry, which is mainly traditional.  Many of our members engage in what we would call subsistence fishing.  Some are not making an income or even breaking even, yet they are maintaining a tradition that has been handed down to us by our forefathers.</p><p>  We would be interested in a managed fishery with a closed season and pot limit, with regulation dealing with the taking of berried lobsters and other issues to do with the long-term sustainability of our livelihood.  The compensation package we are discussing today might not deal with that but perhaps it should be examined.</p><p>  We see a big input for a local management structure to implement a sustainable fishery because if there is not consensus among the local fishermen, it will be very difficult to implement any of this; that must be the starting point.</p><p>  Regarding income loss into the future, we see the proposed salmon farming venture by BIM as the biggest single threat to our environment and to our fishery, which has sustained us for many generations and on which we depend for our future because who will compensate us for the loss of our fisheries?  We are talking about a 500 ha farm, which will take up most of our inshore fisheries, therefore, there must be compensation for the loss of our fisheries.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan Scallan" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014041500004#D00500"><p>I am from the South Wexford Lobster Co Op and we are putting forward a submission for the inshore fishing sector arising out of the loss of earnings and loss of fishing gear during the severe weather conditions this winter.  Our members, likewise, our fishermen have not earned any money since last November with the loss of fishing gear and the loss of income.  Most of our members have families to feed, mortgages to pay and boat repayments to be met along with the upkeep and maintenance of our boats.  We do not qualify for social welfare due to our self-employed status.</p><p>  Many of our members are unable to avail of the scheme offered by the Minister because we cannot afford to put 100% of the money up-front, and claiming back 40% from the Department is not sufficient for us.  We need 100% capital put up-front to allow us purchase the gear.  Many of our members do not have the money to put up-front.</p><p>  We are looking for assistance to get back to work because our fishing activity generates work and income for approximately 150 to 200 families in our area.  With our boats tied up, there is a loss of revenue to the State.  Some 80% of our catch is supplied to local processors who employ approximately 100 staff and depend on our product.  We are a small community whose biggest employer is the fishing industry.</p><p>  Currently, most of our members are living on credit with no income, with assistance from family and friends.  With no money coming in and no means to start generating an income, bills are going unpaid.  We are up to our eyes in debt to the banks.  Some of our members are in a desperate situation.  Without assistance our fishermen will go out of business and onto the dole queues, which is neither good for the State nor the fishermen.</p><p>  South Wexford Lobster Co Op is in agreement with the Federation of Irish Fishermen, FIF, on calling on the Minister, Deputy Coveney, to help our fishermen who have suffered severe hardship as a result of last winter's storms.  Precedence was set in the tax year 1994-95 when fishermen were given full financial assistance during severe winter weather for loss of earnings.  That scheme was administered by BIM.</p><p>  Currently, most of our vessels are tied up and due for renewal of the code of practice safety survey.</p> <p>This is an added financial burden on our fishermen which they cannot afford.  Many of the larger vessels have gone back to work, creating some income for their owners.  However, the small inshore sector cannot start making an income due to lack of gear.  For the small inshore pot fisheries to start making an income, we need 100% of purchase costs to buy new gear and to cover the loss of earnings from the end of November to the present.  It makes sense to keep us in work, earning a living and not joining the dole queues.</p></speech>

T&aacute; s&uacute;il againn nach ch&iacute;fimid go deo ar&iacute;s &eacute; ach an oiread.</p><p>  From 27 November 2013, for 87 days many fishing vessels and smaller boats of 10 m and under have been tied up and cannot get to sea.  As well as that, the recent storms caused loss of fishing gear, as well as damage to boats and to equipment.  Unfortunately, there is a lack of Government support to deal with this issue.  One wonders how much interest it has for the 4,500 people involved in the inshore fisheries sector.  We have been here before and I am afraid matters have got worse since then.</p><p>  For many of these vessels, they have a high level of debt because they need to purchase new gear.  Not being able to fish means a loss to the local economy of the costal and rural communities, particularly in islands and Gaeltacht areas.  For many of them, there is no other infrastructure or industry, barring fishing, small farming and seasonal tourism that lasts up to six weeks.  The loss of revenue to the Exchequer will be significant.  There is no income to sustain households, to purchase new fishing gear, to make repairs to boats, to purchase new safety equipment or to purchase goods in the local economy.  There is also no access to social welfare for fishermen.  We made a submission on that last June.</p><p>  The Government compensation scheme was not suitable for most fishermen.  I have been fishing for 34 years and know we are all under serious pressure.  Deputies and Senators from coastal communities are aware of this.  Why was no EU support requested?  Cornish fishermen got an average of &pound;6,000 each, the equivalent of &euro;10,000.  In 1991, the then Minister, Michael Woods, introduced a scheme to assist fishermen with European backing.  It is often preached to us that we are all Europeans.  Is it, however, that we are Europeans when it suits us and not when there is another agenda?</p><p>  Up to 75% of the Irish fleet is under 10 m.  Do we want the 4,500 fishermen involved to go out of business?  The Government has been able to support farmers, a good development, in small rural communities.  The scheme whereby the fisherman has to pay for fishing gear upfront and then get a poor enough compensation afterwards is not working.  The gear companies will not supply fishermen if they believe they will not be able to pay them back.  Fishermen are strapped to the hilt and cannot get bank loans easily due to limited access to credit.  There is no debt write-down for the likes of us.</p><p>  There should be adequate financial support for this sector from both the Exchequer and the EU.  Fully licensed and compliant fishermen should receive across-the-board compensation.  There should also be future-proofing against events like this.  A fund should be established to assist people affected by adverse weather events.  This is not just a few fishermen with the hand out looking for something.  This is about coastal communities and the people of rural Ireland.</p><p>  If a proper compensation scheme were introduced for the recent bad weather, it would allow fishermen - small and medium-sized enterprises which the Government has been warned to support - to return to fishing and earn an income to support them and their hard-pressed families.  Fishermen spend locally since they do not have time to go to the other side of the world for their holidays, thereby boosting the local economy.  A scheme would allow them to purchase new fishing gear and new safety equipment such as EPIRBs, emergency position-indicating radio beacon, necessary due to changes in the rules.  Many of us who have had to replace them did so at a cost of &euro;600 last year.  This safety equipment is necessary and I welcome it on vessels.</p> <p>I would never say it was overdone but it is hard to come back to the same people year after year and ask them to put their hands in their pockets again while they earn less and less.  Insurance costs &euro;3,000 for a small boat.  It is an awful kick in the face at the start of the year.  This inadequate compensation fund would help to clear the debt burden.  Many of us owe money from last year and, in turn, the fund would increase the tax revenue for the State.  If all this was done, everybody would be happy and give it the thumbs up.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.18" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Pat Mullins" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014041500006#F00200"><p>I will give a brief rundown on our organisation.  I am public relations officer for the Galway Bay Inshore Fishermen's Association.  I am accompanied by Mr. Gerry Sweeney who is the secretary of the group.  We set up as a group six years ago to protect the interests of fishermen working in Galway Bay and along the Clare coast.  We have approximately 33 members, the majority of whom are full-time fishermen, with experience of more than 30 years.  Our main fisheries are lobster, shrimp, velvet crab, brown crab and scallop.  At the moment we are working with BIM, the Marine Institute and the SFPA on the long-term sustainability of the fishery.  For example, last year our organisation agreed to regulate the shrimp fishery which was poor and we postponed that until 1 October.  It usually starts on 1 September.  We also have a successful v-notching programme.  We are working with BIM and the Marine Institute to try to introduce a pot limit because most of our fishery is potting.  The past winter storms were horrendous and I reiterate the comments of the previous speakers.  I do not need to go through all the damage done, the wear and tear of gear and loss of earnings.  The replacement costs are excessive at a time our backs are to the wall in the fishing industry.  We are having a tough time surviving.  We had red tides and poor easterly winds during the previous two seasons.  We are trying to research the red tide.  The velvet crab fishery in Galway Bay has been wiped out during the past two seasons.  That was one of our main fisheries with five or six boats engaged.  Up to 50% of our income came from this fishery, which we had nurtured.  We returned juvenile fish and so on but, out of the blue, this fishery was wiped out.  We think it was due to the red tide and severe easterly winds.  Research was conducted on this fishery in England because 60 tonnes of velvet crab washed up on the beaches in southern England.</p><p>  We have not followed up on this.  I have been a fisherman for 35 years and not much research has been done on inshore fishing.  These fisheries are sustainable.  In 2010, we did a report with the Marine Institute and BIM on the shrimp fishery, which was worth &euro;1 million that season.  That was more or less wiped out during the storms last winter because our gear was damaged.  It is well worth investing a little in inshore fishing in the context of research and development.  We need compensation but that is a short-term fix.  We need to look at the future and where we are going in the long term.  We are not coming here with a begging bowl.  We all want to fish and to work.  We have all reared our families and put our kids through college and we worked hard at it.  We have not made a fortune out of it but we have had a reasonably decent living.  That is where we want to stay.</p><p>  The reason we are here is the compensation package the Minister has offered us.  In a way he has recognised that we need to be compensated but the compensation is minuscule.  It is a shame it was not delved out on the ground through BIM area officers who know what is going on the ground and who know bona fide fishermen.  All inshore fishermen want to know is that they have a future.  We need to be taken seriously.  Research and development needs to be conducted.  The Marine Institute does good work but little work has been done on inshore fishing over the past 35 years.   Between 70% and 80% of inshore boats are under 12 m.  More than 2,000 fishermen work in Ireland and the vast majority of them are inshore fishermen.</p><p>  The proposed salmon farm in Galway Bay is going down a different route.  If a fraction of the money that is being put into that from Government coffers was put into inshore fishermen to manage stocks correctly, there would be a significant spin-off for the local economy, for example, in Galway Bay where 200 fishermen work.  It is still not too late.  We could have a bright future.  All these inshore fisheries are sustainable.  Our lobster fishery was decimated 15 or 20 years ago and it has come back from the grave due to v-notching, BIM and ourselves.  If each fishery was dealt with on that basis and a little effort put into it, we would have a great future.   Perhaps we can address these issues with the committee in the future.</p></speech>

Many boats have had practically no fishing for 87 days and 4,500 people are dependent on them. An adequate compensation package to help people recover is lacking.  It would take little to kick-start the industry again and it is not appropriate to put a package in place compelling people to borrow money to buy fishing gear when the vast majority of them cannot do so because financial institutions will not lend to people who are not reasonably well off in the current circumstances.

Many boats have had practically no fishing for 87 days and 4,500 people in that category are dependent on this . An adequate compensation package to help people recover is lacking.  It would take little to kick-start the industry again and to put a package in place.  Compelling people to borrow money to buy fishing gear when the vast majority of them cannot do so because financial institutions will not lend to people who are not reasonably well off in the current circumstances.  If this package is not re-examined and reshaped, people will be unable to buy gear and resume fishing.  I come from a coastal community and I am acutely aware of the difficulties the groups are facing.</p><p>  The Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development, Ms Michelle O'Neill, and her officials in the North provided the money upfront in order that fishermen could buy their gear and return to fishing, feed their families, pay off some of the debts they incurred during the 87 days without fishing and kick-start the industry and we need something similar here.  It does not make sense to insist on the proposed package under which fishermen can make claims subsequently if they are lucky enough to be able to afford lobster pots or whatever fishing gear is needed or get a loan to buy them.  If the money was provided up-front, people would go out fishing and the money generated would be spent in the local economy and the spin-off would benefit everyone.  I cannot understand what is proposed.</p><p> I propose that the committee asks the Minister to revisit this and to put in place a methodology through which people can access the funding in order that they can purchase gear to return to fishing.  I hope this would be supported unanimously but something like that is needed.</p><p>  It was said only 151 fisherman had taken up the offer of compensation.  That speaks volumes.</p> <p>That in itself speaks volumes.  Of all the people involved in the industry only 150 have managed to take it up.  Looking at that it should tell any Minister what is really happening.</p><p> The witnesses have suggested accessing the European Maritime and Fisheries Fund.  That is another mechanism available to the Minister in order to make finance available to help get people back.</p><p> Since I was first elected to this House, I have got the impression that only the few of us elected representatives from the coastal communities really understand what it takes to service that community.  The vast majority do not have any understanding of it.  We need to try to convince people of what needs to be done here.</p><p> I have read Mr. &Oacute; Cath&aacute;in's presentation regarding trying to conserve the stocks and improve them.  A considerable amount of work needs to be done within the industry in order to allow the industry to progress.  I have spoken to the people from Kilmore - I know Mr. &Oacute; Corcora personally.  At one time it was possible to fish with 100 pots and make a decent living.  The same people fishing for the same amount of fish now have 600, 700 or 800 pots out to try to make a living.</p><p> We need to look at how we can increase the stocks and preserve the stocks.  Mr. Pat Mullins said that in his area the stocks had increased.  However, I know that in my area and along most of the south coast the stocks are not in a healthy condition and that needs to be looked at.  We need to look at it in the broader context of how we can manage that sector of the fishing economy and make it better and more productive for the people involved in it.  That is a bigger debate and something the committee might look at.  In consultation with the sector we might make proposals to make the sector more viable and sustainable in the long term.</p><p> I have heard what the witnesses have said and I absolutely concur with every word because I have seen it first-hand on the ground.  I know the difficulties fishermen are experiencing.  I know that a small manoeuvre can make things far easier.  If the money was put upfront so that people could buy their fishing gear and go back fishing, it would be a huge help.</p><p> From meeting fishermen around the coast I am well acquainted with the difficulties they have in trying to access social welfare.  If they are tied up for 87 days and cannot access social welfare they are depending on credit from the local shopkeeper or loans from family members or friends - some people have had to go down that road - in order to be able to keep going.  There is difficulty with red tape surrounding somebody trying to get money from a community welfare officer or to get a few bob from the social welfare to feed a family.  I know all of that and it is a huge problem.</p><p> I do not believe that any of us from the coastal community have ever experienced the weather we had from the end of the second week of December up to four weeks ago.  There were three storms and I believe 40 days with winds of 40 knots or more, as outlined in the presentation.  That tells its own story.  We will need to try to up our game to ensure fishermen get some hope and that funding is made available so that they can purchase the gear necessary to go back fishing.</p></speech>

Listening to those presentations reminded me of the meetings we had last year on the fodder crisis.  There was no space to move in this room for Members and media presence.  In an equally big crisis if not worse within the inshore fishing fleet, we see how little attention it is getting, which is quite stark given the impact the recent weather conditions have had on the inshore fishing fleet.  To a certain extent as a Member I should take some of the blame for that because we may not have been vociferous enough in raising the issue.</p><p>  The presentations have made clear how inadequate the compensation scheme offered by the Minister is.  It is good to hear that at first hand.  It gives the committee ammunition to make representations to the Department after the meeting to try to secure changes to it.  The representatives of the Federation of Irish Fishermen have referred to the potential use of the EMFF for compensation.  The line fed by Ministers is that the amount of damage done by the storms did not meet the threshold to trigger European funding.  However, in this scheme that threshold does not apply.  We need to ensure the Department gets in there straightaway to try to find ways to access that fund.  There may be a co-funding element, which may need to be sorted out.  However, if the will is there, the way will be found very easily.  For many years I believe fishermen have been missing the will at official level to deal with these problems.</p><p>  We will probably make contact with the Department after this meeting to raise these issues.  We certainly have ammunition that strengthens our argument in making a case to it.  I hope we can get a quick reaction to provide money upfront and to alter the levels of compensation.  In our later work we will be dealing with the issues of the pot limits and access to social welfare.  We will see all the witnesses then in that regard.  Hopefully we will be able to get a resolution to this issue in itself.</p></speech>

I am sorry I was late; I was unavoidably detained.</p><p>  Ba mhaith liom d&iacute;ri&uacute; ar rud amh&aacute;in ar an gc&eacute;ad dul s&iacute;os.  T&aacute; s&eacute; r&aacute;ite ag an Aire go bhfuil &euro;1.5 milli&uacute;n ar f&aacute;il don sc&eacute;im.  The Minister has said he has &euro;1.5 million available.  He has said that no money has been paid out and 150 applications have come in.  Those 150 applications represent &euro;350,000, taking his average figure of &euro;2,400 per head.  Some will get &euro;100, some will get &euro;75, some will get &euro;12 and some will get &euro;24.  When it is all stacked up it comes to somewhere between &euro;300,000 and &euro;350,000.</p><p>  As I see it there are two big issues and I would like to get the witnesses' steer on this.  In reality the Minister will not rip the whole book up and start all over again.  One is the existing scheme for shrimp fishermen and lobster fishermen.  Does that need to be reopened without a condition for the lobster people to produce receipts?  Does the grant aid need to be increased from 40%?  Is the pot limit at 50 and 100 too low?  I am consciously not working in the wider scene.  In my view the wider scene is really important, but it is an issue for another day.  I just wish to focus on the lobster and shrimp case.  The Minister has a scheme and there are obvious flaws in the scheme because the uptake is not what he anticipated given that he provided four times the money that has been taken up.</p><p>  I am very sorry to have been late and I know things have been said.  However, I do not see it covered specifically in the documentation before me, which I understand covers the presentations.  Would that make a significant difference to that scheme within the terms of that scheme and what the Minister has indicated he is willing to do?  He has already admitted with the shrimp pots that he does not need receipts for the old ones.  I am not talking about the new ones.  From talking to people living along the coast I hear that 40% is way too small and that the number limits are way too small.</p><p>  In the very short term there is another bigger issue, which is the loss of earnings for those who would have been fishing in that period and were not fishing.</p> <p>There is a case to be made for these fishermen because the way the social welfare system works for those out of work for so long is unsustainable.  Their income from the better times in the year is spread evenly throughout the entire year although they may be out of work for three or four months.</p><p> In such situations as we have today my gut instinct is to focus on short-term achievables.  If the committee does not do so the short-term schemes will not be put right, the &euro;1.5 million will not be spent and we will not move on to the bigger issues.  Huge issues exist which have been very well articulated in newspapers and by my colleagues.  These need to be tackled.  We have seen over the years that there is a very small number of Teachta&iacute; agus Seanad&oacute;ir&iacute; go bhfuil aon sp&eacute;is acu sa sc&eacute;al seo.</p><p> The committee has done much work on coastal communities and we are committed to the wider issue of how to sustain them, but there is an immediate job in hand with regard to what is achievable and realistic and would, if we brought it to the Minister, bring some relief.  We must maximise our chance of having some success because a whole lot of nothing is still nothing while a little bit of something is still something.  This is the equation on which I would like the thoughts of the witnesses.  Does one throw the kitchen sink at it and come back with nothing, or does one accept the Minister has set parameters within which are issues which are too tight and we ask whether they can be loosened?  This would still be within the &euro;1.5 million budget and would mean it would be spent.</p><p> The other issue I raised is between the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Loss of income for bigger boats which would have been fishing during the period is a crucial issue.  Rather than trying to solve the entire fishing industry, getting nothing and leaving behind &euro;1.2 million which was put on the table we could focus on these two issues.</p></speech>

Gabhaim bu&iacute;ochas leis an finn&eacute;ithe as ucht an cur i l&aacute;thair.  I thank the witnesses for their presentation.  I do not sit on the committee full-time but I come in as much as possible.  I am familiar with the issues in Connemara and we have met fishermen.  We called for a compensation and support scheme but when we saw the pot scheme coming through we did not think it would do the business or solve the problem.  It was an Elastoplast to give the appearance something was being done but it is the wrong medicine.</p><p>  I support most of what has been stated by other speakers.  It is important the &euro;1.5 million is re-examined by the Minister.  We support calls for this and will continue do so.  The report launched in Inis &Oacute;irr recently shows the commitment of the committee to work with the industry.  The inshore fishery industry has been the poor relative for many years and it is important the Government focuses on it.  The Commission for the Economic Development of Rural Areas, CEDRA, report is very light on detail on the fishing industry although it does mention it so the committee should examine it and make submissions to ensure more focus on inshore fishermen.  Although consultations on the report are complete, there will be an ongoing process.  I support wholeheartedly what has already been suggested.  The committee should fully support all of the proposals put forward.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/995" speakername="Noel Harrington" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2014041500008#H00300"><p>I am not a full-time member of the committee but I am very pleased to have listened to the presentations from the inshore fishers.  I live in Castletownbere and I have already heard in the west Cork area much of what the witnesses stated.  I support Deputy Ferris's proposal to ask the Minister and the Department to re-evaluate the situation, initially, as Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v stated, how to maximise compensation to those entitled to it within the very narrow confines of the scheme.  I was very disappointed when I heard last weekend of the poor take-up of the scheme.  I could not believe it even though I knew some fishermen were not affected and could not qualify because they had not lost gear as they had taken it in and stowed it.  Many others had lost far more gear than would have been covered by the maximum amount of compensation allowed under the scheme.</p><p>  I have become aware that some people missed the deadline.  I sent out an application form to a fisherman yesterday in the vain hope if he sent it back it might be considered.  Perhaps the Department might examine this.  Perhaps there are people out there who missed the deadline.  It was advertised on the BIM website and in publications but people were not contacted directly by the Department.  Some people may have missed out through no fault of their own.</p><p>  Many of the presentations were very strong on some of the long-term issues regarding sustainable fishing and trying to make a living, particularly for the inshore fleet.  Almost 80% of our entire register is under 15 m and it is fragmented.  We must be honest about this.  It is very difficult to get a cohesive inshore fleet message from Carlingford around to Fanad in the Republic.  It is very difficult to have one voice.  We have been trying, and the Chairman has done tremendous work on the report in which it was identified as a big problem.  It is an issue for the industry but it should also be addressed by the authorities with the assistance of the industry.  Freedom of association is enshrined in the Constitution, and people can make whatever associations they wish, but issues such as this need focus.</p><p>  We hear about climate change and we must assume the events we had this winter will become more and more prevalent.  Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v mentioned the 1991 scheme.  Perhaps in ten years time we will be discussing another big blow after which people will be left without an income for three months.  This is not desirable.  We must have a built-in system so compensation or an alleviation measure for the fleet does not come down to the whims of a particular Minister, Department, official or policy.  This touches on what Deputy Pringle spoke about, which is a lack of understanding.  Many people who do not understand will state the industry is here again whining, cribbing and moaning like farmers looking for something.  I can almost guarantee this is true of some people watching and some of those on social media.  It is not understood that if one is not fishing, catching or landing one is not earning but spending.  One receives no compensation, no single farm payment and no monthly cheque.  On top of this, because the vast majority are self-employed they have no entitlement to social protection.  This is not very well understood.  The committee has tried to highlight it but it cannot be emphasised enough.  I want to take this opportunity to hammer home the point.  Families have not seen one cent of income for two or three months because they are weather-bound.</p> <p>That must be emphasised.</p><p> There are other issues for debate in a broader scheme, such as days at sea, how one can manage a fishery or how one can manage timings, opening and closing seasons and the like.  That is possibly a debate for another day, but it is inevitable and must happen.  In times when there are challenging quotas, for example, and I realise that is more related to the offshore sector, or quotas are diminishing or where, at best, the price has been the same as it was 20 years ago for landing to same fish, we must look at a greater value for that catch or added value.  Bringing it to the market in a more sophisticated way might help, but again that is a debate for another day.</p><p> With regard to the terms of this particular scheme, it is well worth referring back to the Minister on whether he can increase the envelope.  I know some fishermen who have lost hundreds of pots.  It is far more than the &euro;2,500 compensation package would deliver.  This is only the thin end of a much larger debate for the entire fishing sector, not just the inshore sector but all the different sectors in the industry.  It does not get the same air time or attention as other industries and that has been detrimental to the industry.  However, in the inshore sector one is depending on a group from within one's own 20 or 30 mile radius to form an association, so it is difficult.</p><p> I welcome further debate on it and further suggestions on how this scheme could be addressed.</p></speech>

While there might not be many members, they are all well informed.  They are people who understand.</p><p>  I am going to do something a little unusual from the committee's point of view.  Before I go back to the witnesses the members of the committee have identified two issues in particular that Deputies should immediately agree to, and we need not wait to do it if members agree.  On the review of the rules governing the existing scheme, we should write to the Minister immediately, given the fact that there is a 20% uptake of the scheme.  Notwithstanding the fact that there is a request for further compensation, we should first exhaust the one that is there.</p><p>  The second matter is contained in our report.  It is probably the only action in the shorter term contained in the report produced by the sub-committee.  It was with regard to how fishermen are treated for the purpose of social welfare entitlements as self-employed people.  There is no understanding of the specific challenges in the fishing community's work in that regard.  There is no point in waiting until the end of the tax year to seek a tax rebate when one must live today as a self-employed person.  The social welfare Department must examine this with a specific emphasis on it.  I have not read the CEDRA report but I am sure if it was done in the spirit in which it was intended, rural, coastal and island communities form part of it.  We would hope that the recommendations we produced in our report would feed into CEDRA and how that report will give further regard to coastal communities.</p><p>  Third, and this has nothing to do with today's meeting, there is a Harnessing Our Ocean Wealth seminar being scheduled for June.  The initial one is in Dublin Castle.  We already hope the report we produced earlier would feed into that and perhaps some of us could go, as members of the sub-committee, and speak on it and contribute to that seminar.  We must maintain the pressure and keep the focus on this sector, if we are serious about rural development and maintaining a socioeconomic model that will work for rural communities.</p><p>  Is it agreed that we write to the Minister with a view to revisiting the rules governing this scheme and also write to both him and the Minister for Social Protection asking them to urgently review how fishermen and fisherwomen are treated in the social welfare code?  Does Deputy Ferris have a suggestion?</p></speech>

In other words, one should ask in a way that maximises one's chance of achieving something.  Park the income issue for the moment and look at the narrow scheme he introduced.  He said it is &euro;1.5 million and it comes out of current resources.  I would imagine that he will not go back to the Cabinet for money until he spends the &euro;1.5 million.  I say this as a member of the Opposition.  Therefore, the first challenge is how to tweak the scheme within the parameters that have been set to at least draw down the &euro;1.5 million.  If we end up at the end of this year and it is still &euro;337,000, we will wonder why we did not just confine ourselves and get what was on the table, the &euro;1.5 million that the Minister found in his Department to give.</p><p>  In that regard, the first barrier I discovered was that the lobster men do not have receipts for the original pots.  That is why there are only 150 applications.  Perhaps in other parts of the country they have receipts, but it is fair to say that many pots were bought on DoneDeal.ie and in all sorts of different ways.  That is quite legitimate, but no receipts were kept over that period of time.  It seems that any scheme to help lobster fishermen with pots, and both we and the witnesses have made the case for them, must get that condition removed.  It is not there for the shrimp, so there is a precedent.  It is always good to work with a precedent with Departments.</p><p>  The second issue is that at 1,500 the numbers are too small to make it worth people's while.  I recommend to the committee that we increase that number, but not to a point that would put it way above the &euro;1.5 million.  If we start doing that we will end up with all of nothing.</p><p>  Third, the 40% grant is very low grant aid.  If one has lost the thing, it is not as if one is buying something new.  One is replacing something that was there.  If one is buying something new, I would give one a 60% or 40% grant.  That is fine, because it is something one never had before.  In this case, one is only going to end up with what one had before, so I would say it should be increased.</p><p>  By taking this minimalist approach, as it were, my sense is that I am not making myself a hero here but giving the witnesses the hard-headed advice.  I have a good idea of the parameters the Minister laid down in the original document he gave to the committee.  I believe that would maximise the chances of at least not leaving &euro;1.2 million behind.  It is already on the table but the fishermen cannot get their hands on it because the conditions are too onerous.</p></speech>

However, there is only a take-up of 151.  There are many more than 151 people who lost their pots.  They cannot apply because they are paid after they purchase and on the receipts.</p> <p>How can one buy lots of pots when one has not got the money?  That is the problem.  One can juggle the figures any way one wants.  The stumbling block is where one does not have the money upfront to purchase the pots or whatever one needs.  A sum of &euro;1.5 million was made available, which was inadequate from the start, but I thought that there would have been a great takeup of the funding.  I spoke to lads this morning and they said that a lot of people were interested in the scheme but could not avail of it because they did not have the money to buy the pots.  We need to look at that matter.</p></speech>

From my perspective, and my questioning of people, that is one of the biggest reasons people have not applied for the scheme.  There have been 151 applications but that does not mean there will be 151 grant payments.  I give, as an example, one of my members, who is here with us today.  Mr. Healy made an application and he can tell us about it in a minute.  He knows that he will not be able to fulfil the requirements of the application because he cannot access finance to buy the pots in order to claim the grant payment afterwards.  That is why FIF, in its paper, highlighted both the UK and the Northern Ireland schemes.  For example, the Northern Ireland scheme provides a flat payment regardless of whether one is inshore, offshore or whatever and the payment is linked to the size of vessel.  One does not have to produce receipts either because they know that people will have to buy gear.  We have all made the same point here today.  Unfortunately, because people do not have gear, have suffered damage to their boat or have had no income for the past three or four months and cannot replace the gear, they cannot go fishing.</p><p>  I appreciate the suggestions to improve the scheme made by Deputy &Oacute; Cu&iacute;v.  I also appreciate the points made by the Chairman and Deputy Ferris about removing the requirement to spend the money upfront.  Their suggestions would be very useful and would probably greatly increase interest in the scheme.</p><p>  Not to put too fine a point on it, and this is a message that I have tried to hammer home - I apologise to the various Deputies around the table who have heard from me over the past couple of months - there is European maritime fisheries funding available.  MEPs, the Commission and, of all people, Maria Damanaki, have confirmed that funding is available under the EMFF which should hopefully be in place in June or July of this year but can be backdated to the start of the year.</p><p>  I wish to make an important point.  Member states are working on their operational programmes which they had to develop to administer these funds.  If they do not allow for the possibility of using the money, for such purposes as compensation for storm events, they will not be able to remedy the matter afterwards.  That is why it is very important that the matter is included in Ireland's operational programme and this meeting is as good an opportunity as any to make that point.  </p><p>  I shall briefly hand over to Mr. Healy and him to explain why he made an application which, more than likely, will not lead to him receiving cash from the compensation scheme.    </p></speech>

I shall outline my personal losses.  Due to the bad weather I lost all of my 300 crab pots and 243 of my 270 shrimp pots, including ropes and buoys.  I did find a few bits of broken equipment on the shore afterwards.  If I were to replace the equipment it would cost me &euro;33,000 at last year's prices.  I need not say it but I do not have access to anywhere near that amount of money.</p><p>  I subscribed to the scheme put forward by the Minister even though I know, in my heart and soul, that it will not help me very much.  He is offering 40% of the cost of 50 pots after I spend the remaining 60% but I do not have the money.  To add to my misfortune, in the last throws of the hurricane force winds my boat broke free from the pier in Crosshaven and collided with two other boats.  To cut a long story short, the cost of the damage was mostly paid by my insurance company but the outlook for the next premium is almost &euro;15,000, with the first &euro;2,200 excess provided by me.  </p><p>  I am 36 years fishing this year and for the past six years I have fished single-handed.  Almost every penny of my earnings from fishing is spent locally and the bulk of it, outside of gear, is spent within four miles of the pier in Crosshaven.  Every year my local Centra shop gets slightly over &euro;2,000 and my local co-op gets paid &euro;1,000 or thereabouts for lubricant oil and hydraulic oil.  I also buy diesel from a local supplier who was born and reared in Crosshaven.  I know that oil does not come from under the ground in Crosshaven but I use a local supplier whom I pay &euro;12,000, give or take, each year.  I also buy my gear suppliers from two Irish suppliers.  They must import some of the equipment from abroad but they employ people in this country.  Finally, I rig all of my own nets partly because I have no more pots to play with.  I could not afford to travel here today but the PO are paying for it.  I have cancelled my pension and, to be honest, I do not know where else I can go.  This is my last throw of the dice.  I hope that I have given a personal picture on what my colleagues here have explained.  Are there any more questions?  </p></speech>

I was born on an island like the lads here and I am fishing for over 50 years.  In my area there was no secondary school or anything so the only choice was to go fishing or take the white boat to London or wherever.</p><p>  The industry has become very hard for us now.  We received forms the other day to fill in but I must travel 60 miles to a solicitor in order to get the form signed, which will cost a lot of money.  I buy my pots up Donegal way but I have no dockets for them.  When I bought my pots I left the dockets in my van which was ruined when the sea came in on top of it.  My dockets and all are gone.  I also lost all of my pots off the pier.</p><p>  I do not fish in winter because it does a lot of damage.  When I started fishing I had 50 pots and could earn a week's wages which I saved in order to keep me going in winter.  Now boats around me fish 1,000 or 1,500 pots in order to catch the same amount of fish but the fish are not there.  Five or six years ago I was fishing about 300 pots and got about ten boxes of lobsters.  Last year I reduced my number of pots down to 200.  I caught a box of lobsters every week which amounted to about &euro;200 which did not leave me with much after baits, petrol and everything was paid for.  There is nothing else to do in my area so I have to keep on fishing.  </p><p>  I fish shrimps and velvets and I think managing must come into inshore fishing.  Every other type of fishing has gone such as dogfish, salmon, and all of the other kinds of fishing that we did, including bask fishing down south.  Everybody is now fishing lobsters so there is pressure on the lobster population at the moment.</p><p>  I do not think that the Government applied for moneys from the EU Solidarity Fund.  About an hour ago I spoke to an MEP who told me that nobody applied for money from it to compensate fishermen.  He said that the whitefish small trawlers in Rossaveal had not been fishing for months before Christmas.  Therefore, they have not earned a penny and are in trouble.  The small fishermen are in trouble.  There are no jobs in my area and it has no factories.  There is nothing only the shore around to make a living from.  Now we are being told that we cannot cut seaweed, pick winkles and so on.  We kept the Irish language going in our area and we have kept everything going.  If nothing is done everyone will soon be out of fishing.  Something must be done for small fishermen.  Perhaps the date for the submission of application forms could be extended and we could get more money for the fishermen.  </p></speech>

If we take Mr. Healy's situation, where he is entitled to 50 shrimp pots at &euro;12 each, it amounts to &euro;600.  We see the same thing in agricultural schemes when there is a lot of hassle and little money.  People walk past it and say that it is better to buy them and to forget about it.  If that is changed to a maximum  of 200 pots at &euro;18, it amounts to &euro;3,600.  One may say this is no good against &euro;30,000 involved in the boats but if I told someone a cheque of &euro;3,600 was in O'Connell Street to be collected, he or she would be down in a shot.  I keep coming back to working within the parameters.  How many fishermen made a loss around the coast?  Are we talking about 1,000?</p></speech>

If I thought there was a snowball's chance in hell of getting &euro;10 million from the Minister, I would be the first person to pound down his door.  If he is doing it out of the current budget, we will not get &euro;10 million if we ask for it but there is &euro;1.5 million on the table and we are not even taking it.  What are the biggest things we could tweak?  We will take responsibility.  Is it the receipt system, the limit on the number of pots, or the system of cash upfront and the receipts later?  I suspect it is a mixture of all.  In the case of some people, the cash is not the hardest problem and other people are strapped for cash.  It is useful for us because we must undertake private deliberations on this to have some sense, within those parameters, of the biggest barriers to people applying for what is on the table, &euro;1.5 million.</p></speech>

The reason we are here is to deal with compensation packages.  We could be here for the rest of our lives talking about fisheries in general but we must deal with this issue first and foremost.

One of the fundamental flaws in the system is that money upfront is a major issue.  Combining those with other suggestions, such as increasing the pot limits, is a great idea.  The receipt system is a major issue.  People must be able to get over the idea of financing upfront.  It must be examined.  We went to great lengths to get the meteorological data to show this was an extreme weather situation.  We must take exceptional measures to do something about this.  Otherwise, many people will be in financial hardship and some will be in bankruptcy.  There is no question about it.  While &euro;1.5 million is available, the European maritime and fisheries fund has not been tapped.  Unlike the larger fund, there is no prerequisite that people must spend a certain amount.  At the moment, it is not legally there but it could be fast tracked.  We could accept that we will not get &euro;10 million but we should not set our sights on &euro;1.5 million.  This goes for whitefish people as most of them have only had a few days work in three months.  There is no social welfare or PRSI system.  The system is not fit for purpose.  The P rate of social welfare is as good as useless and the fish assist scheme is crazy.  People must sell boats in order to claim payment under the scheme.  It is madness.  The most immediate thing is that the existing scheme is not fit for purpose.  It must be changed and we must tap into European funds so that we can broaden it and bring other people into play.  It must be done quickly.</p></speech>

Being a constituent of the Minister, I met him and when he admitted some cases were extreme, I suggested that they should be dealt with in an exceptional manner.  This should not be lumped in with the rest.  I suggested that he fully fund 150 of the smallest pots - a 22 inch crab or a lobster pot.  Along with ropes, this would come to approximately &euro;9,000.  If he delivered them to me on Monday, I would be making money from landing a catch on those pots by the weekend.  I could top that up with nets I could rig myself and I could forget about shrimp pots.  With these nets, pots and pollock boards, there are cheaper ways to fish using less expensive gear.  This is some of the funding for shrimp pots in the season and a fellow could pick himself up.</p></speech>

When the sums have been done and the receipts are produced, people must figure out in their heads what is realistic as if they are going to the fair to sell or buy an animal.  The Chairman said very clearly that we will pursue the social welfare issue.  This applies to those who are out of fishing.  We should also ask the Minister to pursue all European sources of funding.  It is a fair point and this must be pursued.  There is a point about live horse and get grass because Europe can be slow.</p></speech>

Unfortunately - this is the way the EU works - it has to be translated into all the member states' languages.  This is happening at the moment, but it takes time.  The point we are making is that is that it can be fast-tracked.  The UK and Northern Ireland have decided to go ahead and provide the funding.  As I mentioned earlier, Commissioner Damanaki made it clear in her statement that this legislation can be used for these precise purposes, in which there have been economic losses as a result of adverse climatic events.  Up to 100% funding can be provided.  It would be remiss of us not to utilise this opportunity.  I understand the Minister's point that the fund is technically not yet in place.  That is true today, but the fund will be in place in a matter of weeks.  If we miss this opportunity, we will not have another one for a number of years.</p></speech>

There are a few variations among people who fish for shrimp and people who put out lobster pots.  Some people do both.  Reference was made to the need to increase the numbers on the current scheme.  That is vital for some people.  Some people have the benefit of drawing from both schemes, while some people have the benefit of drawing from just one scheme.  The increase is vital along with the grant.</p></speech>

We ran this meeting in an unconventional way to facilitate interaction between the members of the committee and the representatives of the fishing industry.  We are keen to get an idea of how we can help to make the scheme work and deal with some other issues.  With the agreement of members, I propose that we go into private session to decide what we will do next.  Normally, we would adjourn.  As we are not sitting next week, it is important for us to agree a couple of things today.  If we have to reconvene on Thursday morning to finalise and sign off on them, we will do so.  I thank all the witnesses for attending today's meeting and making their presentations.  I hope it is of some comfort to the representatives of the various fishing communities that we are trying to understand their circumstances and be of assistance to them.  That is what the committee is here to do.  We hope to be able to make representations to the relevant Ministers and the other powers-that-be with the aim of trying to resolve the short-term and medium-term difficulties.  I understand that the first conference of the Harnessing our Ocean Wealth initiative will take place on Wednesday, 18 June next at The Printworks in Dublin Castle.  Further details will be available at <i>ouroceanwealth.ie</i>in approximately two weeks.  That information became available to us during the meeting.  I thank the witnesses again.</p></speech>

We asked the witnesses from the three banks to come in a little earlier because of a clash in timing between this meeting and Question Time.  I welcome Mr. Richie Boucher, group chief executive, Mr. Liam McLoughlin, chief executive of retail Ireland, Bank of Ireland group, and Mr. Pat Farrell, head of group communication, Bank of Ireland, to discuss access to finance for SMEs and all matters associated with that.  I thank the witnesses for facilitating the time change and apologise in advance on behalf of members who have to leave and come back to the meeting as Question Time in taking place at the same time.  Apologies for the slight confusion.<br />In accordance with procedure, I am required to read out the following notice.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.  <br />I ask Mr. Boucher to make his presentation to the committee on access to finance for SMEs, following which we will have a question and answer session.</p></speech>

I would like to spend a few minutes giving an update on where the bank is.  That is pertinent, reflecting why the SME sector is important to us and why we have the capability and there is the necessity to support that.  With the Chairman's permission, Mr. Liam McLoughlin, who is head of our retail Ireland business, will focus in particular on the SME sector.</p><p>  I draw members' attention to page 3 of our presentation.  From Bank of Ireland's perspective, we are the Irish bank which has an EU restructuring plan agreed, having received State aid, and our restructuring plan confirms that we have a very significant presence in Ireland.  We have very substantial businesses in Ireland and businesses outside Ireland.  Also as part of our restructuring plan, we managed to negotiate that we retained our New Ireland business and, as a punishment measure in substitution for that, we have exited certain business banking activities in Great Britain.  </p><p>  During 2013 we were able to continue our progress in repaying the State aid and, in particular, towards the end of the year in December we raised equity and we sold on preference shares owned by the State in the market.  A total of &euro;1.8 billion worth of preference shares were dealt with from the Government's perspective.  That means, from the European Commission's point of view, that all the State aid we received has been repaid.  </p><p>  It is important also to reflect that in 2013 the bank, and the system as a whole, came off the ELG scheme, that scheme having expired.  That obviously removed a significant burden from the taxpayers and had economic benefits for the bank.  Again, it is important to reflect on the fact that we were able to come off that scheme while safely funding ourselves, so liquidity is not an issue for the bank.  </p><p>  From Bank of Ireland's perspective, we received State aid.  The total quantum of State aid that we received was &euro;4.8 billion and we have returned &euro;6 billion in cash to the taxpayers over that period of time and the State still owns a valuable 14% shareholding in the bank, which is worth somewhere in excess of &euro;1 billion as of today.</p><p>  Our progress during 2013 was also reflected in our profits.  We achieved a net interest margin of 2%, notwithstanding a very low interest rate environment.  Over the past five years we have reduced our costs by over &euro;500 million while we have been investing very heavily in our businesses, in particular in our core businesses, including our branch network in Ireland and our payments and our infrastructure in Ireland.  </p><p>  We have had significant access to the funding markets - funding is not an issue.  Our customer loans are funded by capital and customer deposits - our liquid assets - are funded in the wholesale markets, and we have termed out the funding in those wholesale markets.  </p><p>  Last year was also an important milestone year in that the level of defaulted loans - customers who were defaulting - reduced for the first time since 2009 and the absolute level of defaulted loans has reduced.  Pertinent to the work of this committee is that defaults in commercial real estate, consumer mortgages and SME lending in Ireland came down.  </p><p>  During the second half of 2013, as Ireland was exiting from the troika programme, on behalf of the troika, the Central Bank of Ireland did a balance sheet and capital assessment of the Bank of Ireland working to requirements set by the troika, and we came through that.  There were certain observations regarding risk-weighted assets and provisioning and we addressed those at the year end.  As a public company, we set out very clearly, in comprehensive detail, in December when the results came out what the findings were and we addressed those at the year end.</p><p>  We have had a deficit in our pension schemes and our staff have agreed for the second time in three years to have further reductions in their pension benefits and that has been reflected in our cost base and also in the capital.  We are strongly capitalised.  We have a robust capital ratio of 12.3% under Basel III, which are the new capital rules for the banking system, therefore, we have the capital available.  It is important, as I talk about this, to point out that we have the core franchises, our cost base has been addressed, we are funding ourselves safely, we have repaid the State aid - the taxpayers are in profit - and we have the capital that is being provided to us by the private sector by people who believe in the recovery of the Irish economy and believe that Bank of Ireland can play a significant part in that.</p><p>  Our key issue is the generation of revenue and the generation of revenue means supporting our customers.  All of that having come together, we had a significant improvement in our financial performance in the second half of 2013, as is reflected in the slides.  As I address the committee today, Bank of Ireland is generating profits and is generating capital.</p> <p>The capital we generate is available to support our growth ambitions.  </p><p> I have gone through my presentation relatively quickly because I am very conscious that members are under some time pressures.  Mr. McLoughlin will go through our Irish franchise.</p></speech>

The key message is very much that the bank's key focus is on being the number one bank for business and enterprise in Ireland, achieving this by approving the giving of more credit to viable businesses and having this money drawn down.  Through our 250 branch network nationwide, staffed by experienced qualified business managers and advisers and supported by sector specialist teams, including, for example, our agri and food teams located across the country, we are very much open for business and focused on meeting customer needs on a commercially sustainable basis.  The bank is committed to advancing &euro;33 billion in new lending to the economy in the five years to the end of 2017.  Of that &euro;33 billion, &euro;12 billion will be to support the SME sector, in particular.</p><p>  Looking back on 2013, we received more than 1,000 applications a week.  The total number of applications for the year exceeded 56,000 and our approval rate remained constant at 85%, both in 2012 and 2013.  Approvals for new and increased lending were at a figure of &euro;3 billion in value terms in 2011, &euro;3.7 billion in 2012 and &euro;4 billion in 2013.  They are for new and approved applications, excluding restructures.  </p><p>  We have seen significant growth in the agri and food and export sectors.  There was certainly a pick-up in manufacturing and the health care sector in 2013 and a strong start in other sectors, including the motor sector, in the first quarter of 2014.  The bank provided more than 50% of all new non-property SME lending in 2013.  </p><p>  In regard to restructures, we have an agreed resolution programme in place for the majority of challenged SMEs.  At the end of 2013 more than nine out of ten of all medium challenged cases were in end state arrangements, with the focus on working with these SME customers in implementing these arrangements as they returned to growth.  This number has improved further in 2014.  Consensual arrangements were sought with only 18 receivers to trading business appointed since 2009.  </p><p>  In regard to our outreach programme to support the economy and job creation, we have a very extensive outreach programme to encourage new lending applications.  A key focus of the programme, with which people are very familiar, is our national enterprise week.  The next one is the week of 16-23 May, our tenth such national enterprise week.  There is a week long programme of events.  In 2013 there were more than 130 business and agri credit clinics, with more than 1,500 Show your Business participants, and a further similar programme is planned for 2014.</p><p>  In 2013 we supported 16,000 start-ups.  We have very significant funding committed to seed and development capital funds supported by specialist and targeted funds, working closely with the likes of Kernel and Delta.  We have a number of other funds aligned with this supporting specific sectors, including energy and technology.</p><p>  We have been a leading provider under the credit guarantee scheme and were a key supporter of Microfinance Ireland in 2013.  We have a number of other ancillary initiatives also such as the enterprise lounge on Grafton Street to support businesses - a service offered to enterprises.  We sponsor a number of events, including "Dragons' Den", a significant attractor of start-up businesses.  We are also looking at a number of accelerator programmes in Dublin and Cork to support start-up initiatives in that space.  </p><p>  In addition to our business banking sector, we also have a significant presence in the corporate banking sector in Ireland, supporting plcs, multinationals, the IFSC and foreign direct investment, which are of importance to the jobs agenda for the country.  Aligned with this business within corporate banking, we have a very significant infrastructure team supporting public private partnerships, including the N11, N17, N18 and N25 road projects and schools bundles working closely with the EIB.</p></speech>

I apologise in advance to the delegates as it is Question Time in the D&aacute;il.  It will be like Lanigan's Ball today in that we will be stepping in and stepping out.</p><p>  The context of these hearings is the huge frustration still being expressed to us about bank lending facilities and the lack thereof.  Even as late as last night, I attended a meeting at which huge frustration was expressed.  This is backed up by figures from the Central Bank that to year end - September 2013 - lending to SMEs declined by 4.8%, or &euro;1.3 billion, and that lending to all non-financial and non-property business declined by 3.9%.  The figure was 5.9% at the end of September 2012.  </p><p>  The Government-commissioned RedC report stated perceptions of bank lending were still poor and that many people would not go to the bank because they feared their existing credit facilities would be reduced.  The Credit Review Office has shown that 55% of appeals to it were upheld.  Under Bank of Ireland's own internal appeals mechanism, only 14% of appeals got through the system.  That is the frustration of which we are trying to get to the bottom to see if there is a solution.</p><p>  It was stated a sum of &euro;4 billion was approved for SMEs last year.  How much of it was drawn down as opposed to applications just been approved?  </p><p>  I can ask all of my questions now if the delegates like in order that we can get them out of the way.</p></speech>

I would like to know the difference between the actual amount approved and the amount drawn down.<br />What is Bank of Ireland doing in the branch network to promote the Credit Review Office?  How many applications to Bank of Ireland went to the Credit Review Office?  Is there active engagement on Bank of Ireland's part in promoting the service?<br />On the recent comments of Professor Morgan Kelly on SME loan impairment, Mr. Gerry Prizeman, head of small business, said there was no time bomb in Bank of Ireland.  Will the delegates flesh out that comment?  What percentage of SME and company loans has Bank of Ireland restructured in the past few years?  Has it farmed out any of its debt to outside companies for pursual?  <br />When one speaks to business people, there is huge frustration about the increase in bank charges in the past few years - charges for basic banking services, including coins and coin lodgements.  What is the average increase in bank charges to SMEs in the past three years?  What other charges is the bank imposing on businesses, including loan fees?  Does it charge them if members of its recovery team helps them to restructure their business?  <br />I refer to an issue highlighted in the Entrepreneurship Forum report which was commissioned by the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation and headed by Mr. Sean O'Sullivan.  There are a number of issues around finance, one of which is around the notion of personal guarantees.  The SME lending code of conduct from the Central Bank states:<blockquote>7. Having due regard to the nature, liquidity and value of collateral a regulated entity [the bank] must not impose unreasonable collateral requirements for providing credit facilities, having regard to the value of the credit being offered.<br />8. A regulated entity<b></b>must not impose unreasonable personal guarantee requirements on borrowers<b>.</b></blockquote>The Entrepreneurship Forum report approved by the Department, states:<blockquote>However, the lending banks in Ireland are not following this code.<br />For example, even for established, profitable, non-leveraged limited companies, a requirement for personal guarantees is considered normal rather than an exception.  This is outrageous and Irish banks should begin to follow international standards on this issue rather than continue this current backwater behaviour.</blockquote>I would like to hear the delegates reaction to this.  <br />Mr. McLoughlin mentioned the credit guarantee scheme, but that scheme has been a flop and the Minister will come back in a few weeks with new legislation.  What suggestions would he make in trying to get some value for the money available under the credit guarantee scheme?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500003#B00700"><p>Depending on who one talks to, there are very different views on SME lending.  It was indicated that 85% of lending applications had been approved at some level, while ISME, for example, would give a different figure of probably around 50%.</p> <p>They would indicate that there has been a fall-off in lending.  Is any of the new lending indicated a roll-over of debt or financing of a previous debt?  What are the impediments from the SME side in terms of lending and what are the impediments from the side of the banks in terms of lending to individuals?  There are informal methods by which banks do not provide loans.  One of those ways would be literally an informal conversation and another could be the length of time taken to process a credit line, which it might be necessary to do very quickly.  I would welcome a comment in that regard.</p><p> There is also a view that bank staff are not fully trained or sufficiently skilled to deliver SME lending.  Most of them have spent their early years giving loans to the property sector.  We also hear that many businesses who are looking to purchase retail premises in provincial towns find it impossible to get a loan for that purpose.  What are the plans of the banks to ensure access for SMEs in the regions in terms of the geographical footprint of branches throughout the State?  Do they have plans to increase or decrease the number of branches?</p><p> In addition to lending, debt distress is a massive issue for banks.  We hear that 50% of SMEs are in debt distress.  How many of the SME clients of the bank are in debt distress?  Does the bank have figures for the past two years for the amount of businesses in debt distress that ended up closing?  What solutions does the bank offer to businesses in debt distress?  What kind of restructuring has it given?  Were write-downs offered on certain debt distress?  Debt distress in itself has a major impact on the level of employment within the State.  We heard recently from Morgan Kelly that it was feared that if the ECB changed its policy on the debt distress of SMEs and sought to accelerate the cleaning up of those loans that it would have an enormous effect on the economy and employment.  What are the views of the bank in that regard?</p></speech>

There is some reduction in credit in the country.  There are banks exiting the country.  It is obvious that there are banks exiting the country and the number of banks is shrinking.  Bank of Ireland is not exiting.  I cannot overemphasise what we have done, with support from the taxpayers, who have been repaid.  We have raised the capital and we are funding ourselves.  We have reduced our costs while investing in our businesses but the capital that has been provided to us from the private sector does not come from people who felt sorry for us or had to deal with a black hole.  They are people who believe there is an opportunity in Ireland.  My requirement and that of my colleagues is to deploy that capital with the opportunity that is in Ireland.  How we will be judged by our shareholders &ndash; the people I work for &ndash; is the deployment of our capital, taking advantage of opportunities we believe are available to us in this market.  The SME sector is a key sector for us.  That is at the heart of our strategy.  We have been consistent about it and that is what we have done.  All the restructuring and everything we have done is to bring us into this position today because we believe there is opportunity.</p><p>  To turn to some of the statistics Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n and Deputy Calleary inquired about, of the &euro;4 billion of new and increased lending &ndash; it is not roll-over debt &ndash; we do not make money until we provide new and increased credit.  Utilisation was around about 50%.  That reflects some of the new and increased lending.  Some of it is new and increased overdraft facilities, receivable financing or stock financing facilities, where one would expect a level of fluctuation.  What we have seen happen over the past couple of years is increased utilisation of, for example, the receivable financing lines that we provide.  Increased utilisation has moved from roughly the late 40s three years ago to about 60% utilisation of the average invoice discounting line.</p></speech>

We have seasonal facilities, stocking facilities and invoice discounting.  Overdraft facilities are an element of that and some of it is term loans.  Utilisation will reflect that.  We do not make money unless the money is utilised.  We only earn the income as the money is utilised, so utilisation is the key criteria that we look at.  Increased usage of invoice discounting means to us that our customers are slowly recovering.  They are selling more product and therefore have a greater utilisation factor to finance against debtors.</p><p>  With regard to the Credit Review Office, CRO, we had 70 cases in which a decision was overturned by the CRO.  The funds were advanced in 37 of those cases.  It is important to bear in mind that in 30% of the cases in which funds were advanced after a credit decision by Bank of Ireland was overturned, those customers have subsequently defaulted.  My point is that lending to SMEs is not an exact science.  One is making judgments and using opinions the whole time.  We will get it wrong.  We assess a significant number of credits every day.  We have a desire to approve the credit on the basis that it is safe for us, but we get it wrong.  We will lend money to people today who will default in a year&rsquo;s time and we will decline some customers who might have been able to repay us.  It is not an exact science.  If we just use the example of the Credit Review Office, it has independently looked at the credit and it has asked us to look again at certain customers, and one third of those customers have defaulted.  That is the risk we take.  We are in the risk business.  We try to accept risk but we will not always get it right.  We work the whole time to try to.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked about lending.  One of the biggest issues for us in lending to SMEs is the character judgment one is making about the entrepreneur and the ability to predict future cashflow.  Lending is all about the ability to predict future cashflow.  We are not glorified pawnbrokers who just lend against security.  One of the things on which we have worked hard and provided intensive staff training is a better ability to ask the right questions and support customers in the assessment of future cashflow.  We stress the future cashflow and spend as much time on the assumptions and what would happen if it was correct or incorrect, and what is the sensitivity of the future cashflow to future predictions.  That is the hardest part of SME lending.  It is anticipating what might happen in the future and whether we can make an appropriate credit decision against that.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n also asked about our statistics.  We are a public company so we must verify every statistic that we mention as part of a presentation to the committee or talk about to our investors because those are statements to the market on which investors are making decisions.  When we say that 85% of the SME loans that come to us are approved, that is a verifiable statistic.  It is something we share with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank and we give quite a lot of detail around that.</p><p>  With regard to personal guarantees, we are clear that is an issue.  Again, the bank&rsquo;s desire is to lend money.  We do not make money until we lend the money.  Our job is to make money to generate revenue.  A customer will decide what corporate structure he or she wants to carry on the business through.  Some people will say for tax or other reasons that they want to borrow in their sole names and therefore the loan is with full recourse.  Other people will want to go through a limited liability company and again they will want to make decisions which will be based on that.  We do not provide 100% finance willingly.  I have to be absolutely clear on that.  Sometimes we end up doing it by mistake but our view is that there must be equity in a transaction that de-risks the transaction from the customer&rsquo;s point of view and the point of view of the bank.  If someone decides to go through a limited liability company the choice to the customer is whether they put equity in the form of cash into the limited liability company as share capital.  Some customers decide not to do that.</p> <p>They decide they want to keep their assets outside the company and we say that if we are to provide a loan on a basis that we can accept the risk then that equity contribution must be recognised by way of a personal guarantee.  It is not something that we look for as a matter of rote, it is an assessment of the relevant level of the equity that goes into the company.</p><p> Mr. McLoughlin might want to take the question on bank charges.</p></speech>

Our charges have not changed in this phase but our modus operandi is one where in support of the national payments plan we support the move towards electronic transactions and a reduction in coins and cheques in use in the economy.  Clearly our fee structure certainly for personal customers favours automated transactions over coin and cash.  We are making the process in branches more efficient.  There is more self-serve for customers to make the process of coin, cash and cheque lodgement much more efficient.  The move is towards supporting the national payments plan.</p><p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n asked a question about our branch footprint and access to SMEs.  The bank took a significant, strategic position 18 months ago on our branch footprint.  We have 250 branches across the country and we are strategically supportive of the branch footprint.  We have not closed rural branches across the country.  We have a requirement to make sure those branches remain commercially viable and that they are run efficiently and we strive to work towards that as well.  As long as local businesses support the branches our objective is to make them all viable.</p><p>  Another question related to SME training.  We have an ongoing training programme for staff in SMEs on the job.  The best training one gets on the SME sector is in the collections area.  We have a lot of people working in the growth area.  Initially, they work in growth but then go back to collections.  Growth is very much part of our future plan.  We work with the professional courses that are organised by the Institute of Banking in particular the professional diploma in SME lending that it introduced 18 months ago.  A number of staff have gone on the programme.</p><p>  Deputy Calleary is no longer present but he inquired about the credit guarantee scheme.  There are challenges with the scheme.  We agree that the number of cases that have gone through it is not sufficient.  We have an automatic process in the bank where if a credit has been refused the customer is referred to the microfinance scheme for example.  The credit guarantee scheme is also promoted to customers as well and we can come back with suggestions in terms of input to the debate on how that can be improved.</p></speech>

Reference was made to Professor Morgan Kelly and defaulted loans.  As I touched on in the earlier part of my presentation, as part of the troika review and following the troika&rsquo;s exit from Ireland there was an asset quality review of the banks.  It was a very forensic study of the credit profiles of the banks.  There were significant reviews of individual SME files, corporate files, business banking and mortgage files.  We reflected that at the year end.  I am sorry if I do not have the customer numbers for the absolute level of defaulted loans but I have the volumes.  At 30 June 2013 the number of SME &ndash; to be consistent we use the EU definition of the term &ldquo;SME&rdquo; - defaulted loans was &euro;2.9 billion.  Those defaulted loans had reduced to &euro;2.7 billion by December.  That reflected in part restructures but in part customers that had been restructured moving to cure.  I advised the stock market when we gave an update on our results that the number of customers defaulting had reduced and I referred to the number of curing customers.  The cures we set out in our accounts so the restructures that we have available to customers is that we have restructured SME loans of &euro;1.487 billion at the end of December 2013; &euro;679 million of the restructure was term extensions; &euro;116 million was adjustments or non-enforcement of covenants; &euro;278 million was reduced payment with full interest; &euro;277 million was reduced payment greater than full interest; arrears capitalisation was &euro;36 million and the balance was a range of other solutions.</p><p>  My colleague, Mr. McLoughlin, mentioned that there were certain targets set by the Central Bank of Ireland.  We met those targets.  The targets are reviewed by the Central Bank.  It sends in people to review how we have achieved them and we were able to again update the market on a verified numbers basis that nine out of ten of the challenged customers at the end of December 2012 had been in an agreed condition at the end of December 2013.  The nine out of ten has since moved to around about 95%.  Obviously, we will have some customers who will move into a default and we have to work with those customers but the most important thing was to look at what was the position at the end of December 2012 and where those customers were at the end of December 2013.  I have tried to give some colour of what the restructures look like.</p><p>  We also clearly do have some customers who have moved into a default position where they have gone into examination, receivership or otherwise.  In the vast majority of those cases the business has survived.  The ownership has changed but employment has been preserved to some extent as someone else has come on board in the business.  What we are seeing is quite a lot of opportunity in the marketplace at the moment.  As confidence starts to slowly come back, people who perceive themselves as natural consolidators are starting to roll out.  People might have survived and now they see opportunities to buy a premises up the road or buy out a competitor.  The first signs we saw of that are in the area of car dealerships.  We are seeing it also in pub chains and hotel chains.  As that natural consolidation takes place we are helping and supporting those customers.</p></speech>

That is conditional on the customer performance continuing to improve.  In some cases part of the end state agreement with the customer is that he or she will sell certain of their other assets and time is given to allow that to happen with milestones for achievement.  The big thing for us is that the market will look, so that is why we disclosed for example that &euro;1.487 billion was restructured.  The market will then look at us each June and December to see whether the restructures are sticking because that is a key thing on which the market looks at for us.</p><p>  Mr. McLoughlin wishes to correct a statement I have made.

I apologise that I had to leave earlier.  Perhaps some of the issues I wish to raise might have been previously raised.</p><p>  As has been pointed out by Deputy Calleary, ISME stated that there is a disappointing increase in bank refusal rates.  It also said the banks cannot be trusted.  Is there independent verification of the 85% approval rates?  Has the Central Bank or other body verified that they are true?  If the figures are true then the banks would argue that their rates are high as well.  I wonder about the entire debate because anecdotally it is suggested by ISME that the refusal rate is 50%.  Could someone please clarify the issue?</p><p>  The Credit Review Office has stated that banks in general, not just Bank of Ireland, have a low-risk appetite.  What is the view of Bank of Ireland on increased competition from credit unions?  Would it welcome such competition?  Credit unions have a large amount of money to invest in SMEs.</p><p>  Are decisions being made at local level or are they made in Dublin?  Local branch managers have knowledge of the experience of their clients or have a feel for the people who make applications to them.</p> <p>How many people are put off from making a credit application because they feel the bank will not help them?  Has Mr. Boucher any figures on this?</p></speech>

I said earlier that there are banks exiting the country and others unsure of what they are doing.  I can only speak for Bank of Ireland.  If I give a figure, it has to be verified because our investors and shareholders are making a decision every day of the week, every hour of the day, as to whether they buy or sell Bank of Ireland shares.  It might be verified by our own auditors or separate teams in the bank.  The 85% figure is a consistent figure.</p></speech>

From a Bank of Ireland perspective, we have to grow our business.  There is no shortage of capital to grow our business.  The private sector has provided the capital for us to grow our business.  We are comfortably and safely funding ourselves.  We have cut our costs.  We are investing in branches and payment systems.  We do not make money by saying, &ldquo;No&rdquo;; we make it by saying, &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo;  We have a risk appetite but we have to be careful.  Our interest margin is 2%.  We have to get 98% of our decisions right.  We are in the business of taking risk.</p><p>  I hear sometimes that someone gets put off asking for credit.  I have to be blunt.  I have met few successful businesspeople who were afraid to ask for something.  The secret of business is persistence and consistency.  My colleague, Mr. Liam McLoughlin, has colleagues who have to get loan targets.  We have to grow our business.  There are people charged with ensuring they get applications in and that they are processed.  No individual, myself included, has sole personal credit discretion in the Bank of Ireland.  There is always a second opinion underwriter.</p><p>  While other banks have taken a cost perspective that they cannot afford investing in their branch network, we have heavily invested in ours to give it a chance.  We believe having a presence in a local community is vital for the growth of revenue.  Small and medium-sized enterprise, SME, lending is very branch based.  It is all down to the knowledge of the local manager and his or her staff, properly trained to assess future cash flow perspectives and working with their customers.  Their recommendation carries a lot of weight.  Underwriting is separate, however, from recommendation.  It is hard to approve a loan that has not been recommended, however.  The recommendation of the branch manager is extremely important, provided we have worked hard to ensure he or she has been properly equipped to assess the credit and make the recommendation.  It is their personal conviction that the bank&rsquo;s money, our shareholders&rsquo; and depositors&rsquo; money, is properly identified in lending to that customer.  It carries much weight but it is a separate decision.</p><p>  I do not have a strong view on credit unions.  For us, lending to SME&rsquo;s has a relative level of risk.  It is about having a range of products from overdrafts to receivable finance to foreign exchange products.  We have to constantly refresh our skills level.  The skill we have to develop and work on the whole time is our ability to assess what might happen in the future, not what happened in the past.  We have to assess how a businessperson has thought about the future for their business, how have they assessed the opportunities and the threats to it and how we can mitigate the threats and avail of the opportunities.  That takes time, experience and tools to build up.  We have worked hard on this and recognised that cash flow forecasting is not an innate skill.  Much lending in the past was done purely on collateral.  If a customer goes to our website, he or she will find a cash flow tool which helps them think about their predictions of future cash flows.</p></speech>

There are a range of other surveys that come out that would tend to be different.  I just do not know what ISME&rsquo;s survey sample was and what questions were asked.  A survey also depends on the size of the base sample.  We would love the 85% figure to be higher but there will inevitably be cases where we will have to say, &ldquo;No&rdquo;.  It is human nature.  Someone gets credit approval and they move on quickly.  Someone who does not is more likely to go to a representative body or elected representative to see if they can get help.  We have no problem with that.</p><p>  Like I said earlier we do not get all our decisions right.  SME lending is the most difficult form of lending we do.  It involves meeting a businessperson, looking at their plan and trying to figure out how it will be in the future.  It is not like one presses four buttons and the answer spews out.</p></speech>

One of the things banks need to do is to learn the lessons from the mistakes of the past.  Mr. Boucher gave a general but helpful overview of where Bank of Ireland is now.  When the Celtic tiger was in full roar, the banks were lending irresponsibly.  There was far too much credit and money thrown around the place which fuelled the property bubble.  We all know how that ended up for the banks and the rest of us.  It strikes me that the banks are mirroring what is happening in the economy.  Now, when we need capital and credit to be used as a tool to stimulate the economy, there simply is not enough of it.  Maybe the banks are being too cautious.  Does Mr. Boucher have a view on how cautious or not Bank of Ireland is now?</p><p>  Mr. Boucher has responded to the ISME survey on SME&rsquo;s gaining access to credit.  He claimed he does not know what questions the survey asked.  I find that incredible.  If I were in his position, I would want to know what questions were asked and assess that survey.  ISME was told there was a problem with credit access for SMEs.  It carried out its survey and published its findings but Mr. Boucher does not know anything about it.  However, he is confident that this analysis does not sit with his bank&rsquo;s experience.  Has the bank met with ISME to discuss this survey?</p><p>  We need to break down what we mean about access to credit because that will determine the success rate.  Access to credit could mean many different things.</p> <p>Perhaps Mr. Boucher might outline the success rate for start-up capital.  Has the bank broken down the issue of access to credit in that way?  Access to credit means firms need start-up capital or funding and overdrafts to expand.  What is the success rate on overdrafts?  Are they being tightened up?  Is that a problem for SMEs?  Is the restructuring of legacy and bad debt considered an element of access of credit?  The success of BOI's lending to SMEs and meeting targets very much depends on how access to credit is defined and perhaps Mr. Boucher will respond to that.</p><p> My third question relates to the number of SMEs on the bank's books experiencing debt distress.  In simple terms, I would like a percentage of SMEs based on the EU definition of what constitutes an SME.  Before Mr. Boucher answers that, he needs to tell the committee how the bank defines "debt distress" because that will determine whether we are on the same page.  I would like to understand the bank's definition of an SME in debt distress.</p></speech>

I will answer the Senator's final question first.  The definition is a customer who has defaulted, that is, he has missed payments for 90 days plus or having done an independent assessment, the bank is at likely risk of loss.  SME loans from the bank at the end of December amounted to &euro;10.3 billion of which defaulted loans amounted to &euro;2.7 billion.  Defaulted loans as a percentage is 27%.  The impairment provision we have made against that of potential loss is &euro;1.4 billion.  Our provision coverage ratio, therefore, is 50%.  That is the definition we use.  It is a standardised definition to make sure that it is consistent across the industry.</p><p>  With regard to the ISME survey, my colleagues have met ISME.  I am not looking to disparage it.  I am just saying there is a range of different surveys.  We are aware of the kind of questions-----</p></speech>

One has to learn the lessons the bank had in the past because we are a bank with an approved EU restructuring plan.  As part of an approved EU restructuring plan, one has to confirm the mistakes one made, what one has done about them and how one has fixed them.  The biggest issue we had was an over reliance on wholesale funding and running with too thin capital and that has been assessed and confirmed by the EU.  Our plan had been to address those.  The generation of that capital, which we have generated from the private sector, has been to meet our ambition.  These are people who believe the Irish economy will recover.  They wanted to put capital to work in Ireland and they felt our bank would be a good place to get that to work because they felt in a growing economy a bank that had an ambition to meet those objectives would generate profit for them.  Heretofore, they have been proved right.</p><p>  With regard to the question of whether our branch managers or underwriters have become gun shy, Mr. McLoughlin and his colleagues look on an ongoing basis at the credit applications as they come in.  They are assessed for the quality of assessment by individual branch managers who have measures for the quality of the applications they submit.  For example, where customers are asked a question today, then another question tomorrow and another the following day, a key criterion is whether the first credit application contains all the appropriate information to enable the underwriter to turn around the decision very quickly.  Are we asking the right questions and are we making the right judgments?  We have learned about the different dynamics of different industry sectors.  For example, we look at our credit risk appetite, we say what we think is happening in a sector and we give guidance and direction to branch managers in assessing that credit.  For example, in the agriculture sector, we started a process three years ago - we have a little way to go - to recruit specialist agricultural advisers who do not just look at a farm's accounts from a balance sheet or a profit-loss perspective but who understand the dynamics of what a good farm looks like.  They work with people.  As Mr. McLoughlin mentioned, we have people who look at a motor dealership and what is happening there.  We will adjust our credit appetite as to what we want to achieve there.</p></speech>

This is a good example of sectoral lending.  The abolition of the milk quota will present opportunities for farmers to expand their herds and so on and access to credit will be an issue for them.  Is the bank considering this?  The Government's national jobs strategy refers to emerging sectors where jobs can be created.  How in tune is the bank with that to look forward to where opportunities will be created and having targets for lending into these areas?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.112" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Richie Boucher" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500007#F00800"><p>The agriculture sector is an important sector for us and we recognised that we had to enhance our skills base and have people who understand the dynamics because sometimes what one sees in black and white on a loan application is straightforward profit and loss and that is not necessarily a judgment as to whether he or she is a good farmer.  We are a universal bank with 250 branches.  There is no sector where we say we have no appetite for it because in our view good business people can make money and develop their businesses even in challenged sectors and less good business people can lose money in such sectors.  We see areas of particular opportunity.  For example, my colleague, Mr. McLoughin, mentioned infrastructure where we have applied skills that we developed in our international business.  We have brought them back to Ireland.  Public private partnerships are highly complex and it is a specialised area of lending.  We have a particular expertise which we learned overseas and we are using that.  Sometimes, one can become too specialist in an area and there is a danger that people become too specialist because many business people are generalists anyway but there are certain sectors such as hotels, nursing homes, motor dealerships and the pharmacy sector, which have their own dynamics and, therefore, we have specialist teams who help the underwriter by outlining the dynamic and saying, for example, we looked at the sector a year ago and it was challenged but things are improving.  Our appetite will be judged on that.  We will not get all the decisions right but we have to try to grow our business.</p><p>  With regard to independent surveys and so on, the only proof of the pudding is we have 250 branches and they have to generate business.  If those branches do not, then we have to look at our cost base differently but we want to give them an opportunity.</p></speech>

We supported 16,000 start-ups in 2013.  I do not have records of their success but we have a generous start-up package for new businesses and we are keen to support them.  In addition to what the bank does in respect of banking arrangements and access to legal, accountancy and other advice that we offer to start-ups, we also have a number of development or start-up funds.  There is &euro;250 million available across a range of funds to support seed finance and start-up-development finance and we are keen to support and develop those.  Those schemes are well used.</p></speech>

Mr. Boucher said he will be judged by his shareholders and that is understandable, as he has a business to run.  Given the fact the bank would probably be out of business but for the taxpayer, does he feel any pressure to be a service provider to the people as well as a business or does profit remain the top priority because of pressure from shareholders?</p> <p>It goes without saying that the bigger the business the easier it is to get money from the bank, but the bigger businesses were those which cost the bank the most when the recession arrived.  Although things might be starting to recover does Mr. Boucher agree it is more difficult for the small guy than the big guy to get help from the bank?  Many small businesses might not look like a wonderful financial bet, but given some help they would come through and pay all their bills.  They are struggling to get this help.  Given that banks have left the market Bank of Ireland has a nicer pick which amounts to lower risk lending on its part.</p><p> Does Mr. Boucher think the pillar banks may be too big to deal with the demands of small and medium enterprises?  Should we have a State strategic investment bank to answer their needs?  What does Mr. Boucher think of a State strategic investment bank which would lend solely to SMEs?</p><p> Was money available from the ECB at 1% which could have gone to SMEs?  Was it cordoned off for other areas?  Did Bank of Ireland avail of much of the money available from the ECB at 1%?  Did the bank invest some of this money abroad or did it confine it to Ireland?</p></speech>

Young entrepreneurs have difficulties as they do not have credit ratings.  How does the bank deal with them?  Of its 16,000 start-up businesses what percentage were started by those aged under 24?  Young entrepreneurs are the future of the economy.  Does the bank advise customers, whether young entrepreneurs or other people applying for loans, on what else may be available outside of the banking sector and link with other sources of funding which may be available?  Loan applications are rejected because of their quality.  Is assistance provided by the banks in this regard?  It was stated that capital is required to grow a business.  The capital invested in Bank of Ireland was in a small number of hands, including the Government's.  Is there a fear that a sudden pull-out by these investors and a sell-off of these shares could have a catastrophic effect on confidence in the bank?  A problem associated with the Celtic tiger was that bank branches and individuals in branches had targets to meet with regard to selling insurance and other products, and these targets were associated with bonuses.  Does this culture still exist or have we shifted from it?  Has the link between targets and bonuses being broken?  Mr. Boucher may have answered questions on how the bank deals with SMEs with property-related debts pulling them back.  Their core businesses are successful but property has a stranglehold on them.  Property developers and builders are also SMEs.  We have a serious housing deficit in certain areas in the greater Dublin region.  Last week it was reported that 8,000 properties were built last year but 25,000 are required.  Does the bank see itself as having an input in stimulating the construction industry?  It is time we matured and discussed this and were not fearful of what happened in the past because we have a need, particularly in the greater Dublin area.</p></speech>

They have almost talked themselves out of going to the bank to get a loan.  I was amazed to discover that when we held their hands they were able to get loans in practically all cases, but they need this help.  What basic mistake is made by those SMEs who apply for loans and do not get them?  Is there something the bank can tell them they should do to get it right?  There are success stories and there can be more, but perhaps the SMEs just need hand-holding or advice.  Is the bank capable of giving them this advice?</p></speech>

To answer Deputy Wallace, we are a business.</p> <p>We have received private capital and support from the taxpayer.  We should never have allowed the bank to get into the position of requiring taxpayer support but we did.  While that support has been repaid, with profit, the bank has a greater responsibility to the economy.  That is enlightened self interest.  Ireland's success will be Bank of Ireland's success and vice versa.  One of the key lessons learned is that chasing profits in the short term is detrimental to the sustainability and viability of the business in the longer term.  A key issue now is how much capital we have and how it is deployed.  It is often best to hang back from the market - in other words, when a competitor is going a particular route and one is not sure how its business model works, being prepared to concede market share, particularly if a credit bubble is developing.  Some of the lessons we have learned include that is sometimes best to concede market share, that it is important to ensure that one can continue to provide products for customers and that one has a business model which ensures the bank can charge.  To pretend that one can provide products free of charge and will somehow magically generate a profit is not sustainable.  A sustainable business is one that generates profits over the medium term by providing products to its customers on the basis that customers will be with the bank not because they have to and do not have choice but because they want to be with us.  No business should ever think that the customer has no choice because inevitably a new business will come along and offer it to them.  </p><p> Bank of Ireland needs to be a sustainable business and to support the economy.  We need to be profitable because if we are not we cannot support the economy and will require bailout by the taxpayer.  It is a virtuous circle and a measured approach, in particular in terms of ensuring the sustainable viability of the bank.  I agree that doing this can be difficult.  Large corporations and companies have teams of accountants and treasurers, people who can provide financing packages, have track records and financial projections and will have undertaken industry research, which means it is often easier to look at the lending proposition from such customers.  However, in the context of the bank's current customers, its largest corporations started out as small businesses in Ireland.  Our job is to find the small businesses of today and to take a chance on some of them.  </p><p> In response to a question from Deputy Lawlor and Senator Quinn, the bank has to work harder to identify what customers find intimidating about dealing with the bank and how we can help them prepare a loan application.  The bank provides credit clinics across the country and there are credit links on the bank's website which provide customers with information on what they need to know in advance.  There are also business development officers employed by the bank whose job it is to communicate with local accountants, business intermediaries and customers in regard to how we can help them to prepare their best application prior to it being put before us.  Issues such as what they need to think about, how to prepare a cash flow forecast, how to structure a credit application and so on are addressed.  We have had to use the web and other sources in this regard.  In some cases, the anonymisation of information and assistance can help.  In other words, a customer often feels less intimidated if he or she can access information in the comfort of their own home and so on.  We want customers to put their best foot forward.  Every loan application that we cannot process is wasted time for us.  It also involves a cost for the bank.  Every loan application that the bank can process quickly improves our business.</p><p> In response to Deputy Lawlor's other question, I do not know a business that does not set objectives for people.  I cannot see how anyone could run a business without appointing X to do a particular job and showing what X doing a particular job well looks like and what X not doing the job well looks like.  Staff involved in front-line business in our banks have objectives.  For example, they must meet a particular number of customers and accountants every week and deal with a set number of applications.  We do not pay bonuses.  I cannot believe that there is any business that does not set objectives for individuals involved in it.</p></speech>

I set tough targets for Mr. McLoughlin and I am required to meet the tough targets set by the bank's investors.  We have objectives, which we have to set out and achieve.  A key objective for the bank is growing its balance sheet.</p><p>  On Senator Quinn's question, confidence is the biggest concern.  Bank of Ireland needs to lend money.  It is not a question of the bank "wanting" to lend money, it "needs" to lend money.  If people approach the bank it will work hard with them.  While we will need the courage to say "Yes" we will also need to be able to say "No".  We want to do business.  What is important is that customers believe in their businesses and do not take "No" for an answer.  They must prepare as well as they can and this means not focusing solely on numbers.  I accept we will need to assist people in the forecasting of cash flows, but convincing the bank that a particular business will be successful is the job of the applicant.  To do this the applicant needs to focus not only on how he or she proposes to ensure the business will be successful but on potential bumps in the road and how he or she proposes to mitigate that risk, all of which is important from the point of view of the bank.  It is important an applicant can show that he or she has thought about what problems might arise for the business.  It is important customers are able to look at the downside risk because that is what the bank has to do.  The bank's margin is a fixed one and it does not participate in the upside.  As such, if customers have considered any possible downside and how they propose to mitigate it the process will be much easier.  The bank needs to continue to work hard to let people know all of this.  I am delighted to hear that customers approaching Bank of Ireland, although worried, are happy with its approval rates.  Our success comes from that.  </p><p>  With regard to Deputy Wallace's question in relation to the ECB and EIB, Bank of Ireland is required to repay the ECB as quickly as possible.  Current borrowing by the bank from the ECB is invested in Irish Government bonds or in support of NAMA bonds.  The money we borrowed from the wholesale markets was for funding loan assets.  As customer deposits increase we are required to repay the ECB.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's question.  On the issue of big business versus small business, we try to address this issue using separate teams.  We have teams of people who deal with the corporate bank and other teams who deal with what we call the mid-segment, which is customers who have a borrowing requirement of &euro;300,000 to &euro;10 million and a further team trained and experienced in dealing with smaller credits.  For example, a person seeking a small loan for a plumbing shop would be dealt with by one team and the large corporation would be dealt with by another one.  We segment applications in this way to ensure we can put in place objectives and goals for staff in terms of chasing business.  </p></speech>

It is not necessarily debt capacity but the equity contribution.  The Government has put a lot of effort into equity contributions.  Bank of Ireland is not a natural equity provider.  Very often, if the bank ends up with equity in a business it is because it made a lending mistake.  To generate profit and help to stimulate the economy the bank provides more than &euro;250 million of equity to a range of funds which are dedicated to provide equity primarily for start-up businesses, early stage businesses or businesses in the high tech sector which would not naturally suit a debt funding model but where equity can be of assistance to it.  I do not have a firm view as to whether the Government should be involved in the banking business but I do not think taxpayers should be.  I believe that the primary issue is very often equity rather than debt.  Specialist funds can help with that equity.</p></speech>

I do not have details on how many of those start-ups involved people under 24 years of age.  However, the bank is very focused and would be in agreement with the Deputy that young entrepreneurs are the future.  That is very much where we hope to provide support.  We work closely with a number of the universities through the provision of banking facilities, including in relation to incubation units to support young entrepreneurs.  As I have mentioned previously, the bank sponsored a number of entrepreneurs through "Dragon's Den".  In this regard, two of the ten programmes are focused on second level schools.  The programme featuring the universities is scheduled for filming over the next couple of months.</p> <p>The bank is also aligned to a number of accelerator programmes to support young entrepreneurs trying to accelerate their way through businesses.  We have a programme which we fund in Dublin and we are due to launch one later in the spring in Cork.  There are a number of schemes relating to the younger entrepreneurs, but I do not have statistics on that space below 24 years of age.</p></speech>

We have credit appetite for the construction sector.  Obviously, we must be cognisant that property development was a significant problem for banks - less so for Bank of Ireland, but nevertheless a significant issue for us.  Again, to refer back to another question, we must be careful not to become completely gun shy.  The construction of property is a normal part of an economy.  We see some opportunities there.  We recognise that one of the issues might be the level of equity that a builder can put into a scheme, but perhaps it just means the scheme starts smaller.  What happened in the past is that the value of land started to drive the asking price for the end product.  Clearly, the asking price for the end product should be what drives the price of the land and of the construction backwards.</p><p>  We are prepared to look at different models.  We are also prepared to support people who are building under licence with a fixed profit margin, provided they are good builders.  A contribution of equity coming in to support the construction industry is happening.  I was in North America over the last couple of weeks and equity funds are starting to see this as an opportunity as well for putting equity to work.  They have bought property, they see there are opportunities in construction and they would like to examine that.  The bank is not a natural equity provider.  We put it through funds, but we certainly have an appetite for financing construction activity on a measured basis.</p></speech>

However, it would be wrong not to point out that the majority of people I meet are finding it difficult to get finance, and I know many people in small business and others have come to me about it.</p></speech>

If there are instances where elected representatives feel there is a customer they believe should get a second chance, on the basis of their knowledge of that customer's business, my colleague, Mr. Farrell, would be the best person to deal directly with.  He is in the right place in the bank.  This is a free advertisement for the bank as well, from my point of view.  We need business and we must get business.  We have raised the capital and we have the funding.  We have managed our costs and we must grow revenue, and the only way we can grow revenue is by getting more business.</p></speech>

The meeting today is for a report on this area which we are preparing over the next two months.  We will share the results with you.  We are talking not just to banks but also to stakeholders and business users on all sides to see if there is a problem and where it is and to highlight any solutions.  If we identify areas of concern that we think you can have a role in addressing, we will refer back to you and work on it.  The objective is to provide a report to the various Ministers to try to secure actions there as well.  We are conscious in our research that it is not just bank lending that we must examine but all access to finance for business.<br />I thank Mr. Boucher, Mr. McLoughlin and Mr. Farrell for their attendance.  The discussion was very useful.  I apologise for the time changes and for running over time.  I appreciate your patience and your direct answers.  At some stage you might refer back to us with the cost of credit.  I will not go into it now, but it is an issue as well.<br />I welcome Mr. Jim Brown, chief executive officer, Ms Ellvena Graham, managing director for SMEs, and Mr. Andrew Blair, wholesale chief officer, of Ulster Bank to discuss access to finance for SMEs.  My sincere apologies for starting this session a little late.  The first session went a little over schedule.  We have delayed you, so if you need to leave just say it and we can get your replies again.<br />Before hearing your presentation, I am required to give the following privilege warning.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />Today's meeting clashes with parliamentary questions on enterprise which are taking place in the D&aacute;il at present, so some of the committee members will be coming in and leaving to attend those.  I apologise for that.  The spokespersons from Fianna F&aacute;il and Sinn F&eacute;in intend to return to the meeting as they wish to raise issues with you.  I invite Mr. Brown to make his presentation to the committee on access to finance for SMEs.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Brown" time="15:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500010#J00900"><p>I am joined by my colleagues, Ms Ellvena Graham, head of SME banking, and Mr. Andrew Blair, chief credit officer.  I thank the committee for the opportunity to provide an update on Ulster Bank's progress in the areas outlined in the committee's invitation.  I will go through our introduction quickly and then respond to any specific topics that the committee wishes to discuss.</p><p>  Ulster Bank is the number three bank in the Republic of Ireland and the number one bank in Northern Ireland, building substantial market share in a number of key areas including the SME sector.  We have a clearly defined strategy based on building a really good bank for our customers and at the same time addressing our legacy issues.  We expect to return to profitability this year.</p><p>  We fully recognise the importance of the SME sector to the economy.  SMEs play a vital role in its recovery and supporting SMEs is a core part of our focus.  Our Republic of Ireland lending book to businesses is approximately &euro;6.7 billion and while we support the broad spectrum of businesses, we are specifically focused on the agrifood, exports and the professional and private sectors.  There are two main aspects of our SME operations: new business lending and development, and supporting SMEs in financial difficulty.  We have &euro;1.2 billion set aside for new business lending in 2014.  This is open to all businesses who are seeking finance to support their growth plans.  Every proposal is different and individually assessed against sensible, straightforward, criteria.  The first quarter of 2014 has seen a strong start to the year.  We held a series of ten dedicated town hall sessions for SMEs across the country and we have been very visible in the market with a strong "open for business" message.</p> <p>We are well positioned, we have a strong pipeline of business, we are growing market share and we look forward to expansion into the SME market as both demand and the economy improve.</p><p> We have also recently restructured our business to respond to customer behaviours.  We are enhancing our online and telephony capabilities and are creating customer contact hubs in key locations while at the same time returning business relationship managers to the branch network to better support our customers.  We also have a substantial number of relationship managers specifically seeking new business opportunities.  We have also introduced new accreditation programmes for our people which ultimately ensures they better understand our customers' needs and, as a result, serve them well. </p><p> Separately, we have a number of initiatives in place to support enterprises through all stages of development.  This includes financial packages such as our business start-up, early stage growth and agri packages, in addition to our business achievers sponsorship programme and many other networking events.  We are also the lead banking support for Small Business Can, a dedicated website that allows business to network and share issues with their peers.  These initiatives continue to prove both popular and effective within the sector.</p><p> As I have said, we are also working with SME businesses in financial difficulty.  Legacy issues tend to be complex and can include elements of property speculation that remain a drag on many businesses.  In the Republic of Ireland we have 300 people dedicated to working in this area.  Our ultimate aim is to return viable businesses to profitability using a wide range of options and, in the process, save jobs.  It is our experience that early intervention and engagement with our customers is essential to ensuring we can assist the business back to financial health.  This strategy is working.  </p><p> In conclusion, let me reiterate that Ulster Bank is fully committed to supporting businesses and growth in the economy.  We have a clear strategy.  We are making strong progress towards becoming a simple, more efficient and sustainable bank - a really good bank - for our customers.  Supporting SMEs is a core part of our focus.  I thank the committee and am happy to take questions.</p></speech>

I shall ask a couple of general questions first and then I shall ask some specific questions, particularly on the work of the bank's global restructuring group.  Mr. Brown gave figures on lending and stated that &euro;1.2 billion had been set aside for 2014.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.154" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Brown" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500011#K00400"><p>That is correct.</p></speech>

How much was approved?   How much was drawn down?  Is there a difference between the two figures?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.156" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Brown" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500011#K00600"><p>The sum of &euro;1.2 billion was set aside for new lending, so that is for drawdown.  It is not approvals, limits or anything like that but actual cash that we are looking to get out the door.  We are looking to lend &euro;1.2 billion across the island.  We expect two thirds of the figure to be spent in the Republic, which reflects our business here.  That may amount to between &euro;800 million and &euro;850 million and can be compared with around &euro;600,000 in 2013.  The sum of &euro;1.2 billion is actual cash to get out the door and be drawn down.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1071" speakername="Dara Calleary" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500011#K00700"><p>In terms of the budget for 2013, I want a figure for what was allocated and what was drawn down.  It is one thing to say that there is approved lending.  We have got feedback from businesses that loans are often approved but the drawdown conditions are so unreasonable that businesses do not proceed to draw down.  Also, the length of the approval process for drawing down is a major issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.158" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ellvena Graham" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500011#K00800"><p>Technically, only about 50% of our loans get drawn down once we approve them.  The figures that Mr. Brown mentioned earlier are actual drawdowns.  That means it is actual money that customers have drawn down to use for the expansion or development of their businesses.  We have not even talked about approval numbers yet.  Typically, there are a lot more approved than get drawn down, so the Deputy's question is fair.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.160" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jim Brown" time="15:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500011#K01000"><p>We have regular dialogue with the Credit Review Office.  The scheme, as I understand it, was originally set up to look at an appeals process for the pillar banks.  We do not participate in it because Ulster Bank has a separate review process.</p><p>  I shall give the Deputy some idea of the number of approvals.  About 94% of our loans are approved so the number of cases appealed against is relatively small.  Of the number that are appealed, about one third are ultimately re-approved.</p></speech>

Do they work for the group or are they part of a separate operation?</p></speech>

On the island of Ireland we have about 500 people in total, which cover the real estate issues as well as the SME issues.</p></speech>

He compiled a report on banking for SMEs in the UK and, in particular, he had a lot of harsh things to say about RBS.  Mr. Brown has been very critical of his findings.  Have there been any findings within Ulster Bank?  It has been suggested that there are 40 potential cases within Ulster Bank and 50 in the northern part of the island that were identified in the Tomlinson allegations.  Has Ulster Bank looked into the matter?</p></speech>

First, Mr. Tomlinson has not engaged with me at all.  I have not seen any of the allegations or any of the cases that have been alleged either.  We have had one contact from him, through his office, to a relatively junior member of staff to inquire about one line.  That is the only contact that we have had.</p><p>  In terms of the key findings, there is nothing in the report that specifically covers Ulster Bank.  What I have said is that we take these allegations seriously and that RBS has instigated a separate review and commissioned Clifford Chance, one of the world's largest law firms, to carry out a review, which is under way as we speak.  We expect the review to be concluded in the coming weeks.  Separately, a review is being conducted by the UK regulator.  The Clifford Chance review covers Northern Ireland and the Republic.</p></speech>

His testimony would identify exactly - and replicated exactly what Mr. Tomlinson reported - a matter which was in the public domain before Mr. Brown did his interview with the <i>Belfast Telegraph</i>.  Is Mr. Brown saying he is very happy with the way customers are being treated by Ulster Bank?  Is he saying he has no difficulties with the work of the global restructuring group?</p></speech>

No doubt many of those situations are emotive in terms of having to deal with those issues.  There are no doubt customers occasionally who are not happy about the situation that they are in.  On the alleged systemic issues with regard to how we handled cases, I have seen no evidence that that is the case.</p></speech>

First, let us look at where we are at with Ulster Bank.  We have some legal real estate issues which we are dealing with.  We have set up an internal bad bank to deal with them, which is called RCR.  We are looking to wind the portfolio down over the next three years but we will do so in an orderly way.</p> <p>We will do that in an orderly way.  It is not in our interests to do anything other than that.   As part of that, there will be hotels that we will bring to the market and they are primarily those built as part of the boom that have real estate issues.  Separate to that, we are supporting lending to the leisure sector, which includes hotels, and we are more than happy to provide credit and underwrite good businesses in that sector.</p></speech>

I was fascinated by the figure that 50% of loans approved are drawn down.  Can we get some idea of why that happens?  We are here to talk about SMEs because we hear so much about SMEs having great difficulty getting loans.  What advice would the witnesses give to an SME about what it must do to get the bank's willingness to approve loans?  Why are only 50% drawn down after all the difficulties we hear about?  What mistakes are those looking for loans and getting turned down making?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.180" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Ellvena Graham" time="16:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500012#L00300"><p>I will take the first question.  We find that more of our loans are now getting drawn down more quickly.  Last year, we saw customers getting approval but not having the confidence to spend the money.  In quarter 1, we find our lending is almost three times what it was in quarter 1 of 2013.  There is a greater uptake in the drawdown of loans.  We are encouraging that.</p><p>  It is important we spend time with the customer.  The relationship manager must explain the data and financial information we need.  We look for quarterly financial statements but we find that if our relationship manager works closely with the customer, if all the information is in place it makes it more simple.  That is why we can approve 94% of what comes in through formal application.  Much improvement was needed with our relationship managers and we have put them through an accreditation programme of credit skills training and cash flow lending because many of them are not skilled in that area.  Our programme is accredited by the Chartered Banker Institute in the UK.  The more skilled the relationship managers, the better they are in dealing with customers, which means a better quality of application coming into us.  It is a two-way street.</p></speech>

I have just come from Oral Questions and, bizarrely, it is running concurrently with this meeting.</p><p>  The witnesses mentioned that 94% of formal loan applications are successful.  Is there any method of filtering potential clients before that formal application?  How many are filtered out before making a formal application?  What is the percentage of interested clients who make early requests for information and what percentage is filtered out?</p><p>  With regard to the bank balance sheet, are SMEs in debt distress?  What percentage are in debt distress?  What restructuring does Ulster Bank offer businesses in debt distress?  Has it written down any of the debt?  Is it the understanding of Ulster Bank that businesses in debt distress have closed down?  Are there figures available for its former clients?  Do any of the figures refer to the rolling over of loans or is it new lending?  What is the percentage drawdown of people who have been given approval for loans?</p></speech>

The loan figure we quoted is all new money, not rollovers.  The &euro;1.2 billion available is all new money and is not for the rollover or restructuring of existing debt.  The first question was how much gets filtered out but I cannot give a percentage.  We have made sure the relationship managers spend as much time as they can with customers to ensure we get the right level of information and to make sure the quality of application coming in is much better than it used to be.  That is why we can say we have a 94% approval rate because the effort goes in to getting the detail, which makes the credit process much simpler.</p></speech>

We have changed the business model to get more people out and about.</p></speech>

We have people dedicated to managing existing portfolios, customers who have existing loans and other guys out on the road, North and South.  They are business development managers out looking for new business.  We are moving our business bankers back to the branches, where possible, so that they are closer to customers.  We are doing many things to ensure we are close to where customers are, so that understand that there and so that we split new business and looking after existing customers.</p></speech>

Customers repeatedly ask where the decision is made.  For small businesses, we make it close to the customer.  In terms of the range of options, we have all sorts of options that we developed on the mortgage side for the personal customer and this has been rolled out to SMEs.  This includes reduced capital payments, term extensions, interest only arrangements and longer-term arrangements where we look at the capacity of the customer to repay and identify that there are certain assets they do not need for the purpose of their business and that they may want or need to sell at that point in time.  This will create a lower debt burden and a higher level of viability.  If needs be, we will also warehouse debt in the business for the SMEs.</p></speech>

Has a similar thing been done in business lending?  Has business debt been written down?  Working closely with clients in advance of seeking loans makes them more prepared for the loan.  This is positive but the negative aspect is that an undefined amount of people are filtered out.  A good chunk of them could be real loan opportunities but because of the bank's pro cyclical policy and a retrenchment with regard to credit, it has decided not to afford them credit.</p><p>  In the SME sector, it is coming out of that trough in the cycle and yet in year six we see a tightening of credit.  This is worrisome in respect of small businesses and their ability to grow.  How does the north and south compare in most of these key indicators?</p></speech>

We manage the customer through the process and only in circumstances where we go through to the resolution of all assets, where there are no further assets available, that we consider a write-down.  This is consistent with what we do on the mortgage side.</p></speech>

The number of SME businesses we have put into receivership in the five years since the crisis is only 31.  It is clear from the magnitude of distress that this is a relatively small number.  With the solutions we have, as long as customers can engage with us, and if there is a real viable business, we can ensure that business will continue to trade.  With regard to demand, in the past few years there were a couple of issues.  The banks, particularly Ulster Bank, were inwardly focused, having had to deal with many real estate issues as a result of the crisis, including mortgage arrears.  We are very conscious of that.  One of the things we did was to organise the business in early 2013 particularly to support SMEs, so that we could get the message out that we were open for business.  We have people on the road looking for business and we have relationship managers back in the branch network.  There are many other things we have done over and above that to support digital developments.  It is fair to say that as a result of that, plus the upturn in the economy that has come through from the middle of last year, we have seen a significant uptake in demand, and the volume we have had in the first quarter of 2014 versus 2013 has doubled.  I cannot give the specific numbers because we are in a closed period for financial reporting but there has definitely been an uptake in demand and an uptake in absolute lending by Ulster Bank.</p></speech>

While confidence is fragile, we see a good uptake in agriculture on both sides.  In the North, thankfully, unemployment did not increase to a great extent, but there is still a very high reliance on the public sector.  Agriculture is strong, as well as food and drink, and exports are not quite as strong in the North as in the South but there is a good uptake.  The volume is about three times greater on both sides of the Border versus this time last year.  There is a Government product for lending in the North, called funding for lending.  That means we can give out loans where there is a 1% reduction in the margin and there are no arrangement fees.  We find that product very successful in Northern Ireland.  We have lent more than &euro;150 million under that product since it was launched in September 2012.  That has been a very good product for us, to which we signed up at the very start.  More than 1,000 customers have availed of it in Northern Ireland.  We are seeing a good uptake on both sides of the Border.</p></speech>

They mentioned the whole area of new lending of &euro;1.2 billion.  What is the trend in terms of new versus restructuring funding?  In regard to lending performance, what engagement does Ulster Bank have with the Department of Finance?  I appreciate that Ulster Bank is not a pillar bank.  The training of staff and external professional accreditation was mentioned.  Who is used for that purpose?  I have two final questions which I also put to Bank of Ireland.  I note Ulster Bank has a high approval rate.  Is there independent verification of these figures?  For example, ISME would state that the level of funding for the banks in general - not specifically Ulster Bank - is 50% to 54%.  Does the bank have verification of these figures and, if not, is it an issue it would consider?  If all banks had independent verification we would not have anecdotal evidence or queries about the actual percentage figures.  Does Ulster Bank have any concerns regarding competition from credit unions, which have a desire to get into the market for the purposes of greater lending to SMEs?</p></speech>

Distressed mortgage lending is an asset that impacts immediately on capital requirements and provisioning, yet the banks must try to use their resources to lend new money to new businesses and new money for projects to old businesses that are weighed down by debt.  As I said to the previous visitors, the information we got in broad report terms and the management information for a period of four to five years was totally unreliable and misleading, and it hid the lack of prudential policy on the part of the boards of banks.

In order to be a healthy lender and supporter of businesses, the bank has to be healthy itself.  We actually got estimates from the banks of their capital requirements in March 2010 and again in March 2011 which fell short.  We find that the banks, their activities and operations at present are those of zombie or paralysed banks, because the money is not flowing into the economy.  The balance sheet repair work is going on.  This is not acceptable.  Is the information we are getting fully transparent and truthful?  Can we believe the witnesses?  We are continually hearing reports and figures and the individual microcosmic stories are at variance with the overall figures.  That is deeply disappointing.</p><p>  As regards SME businesses being articulate in presenting the requirements, most of the clients who are good at their business know how to present the requirements and they are the people worth backing.  I have come from 20 years of lending to SMEs through ICC Bank, where we got stuck into the businesses of the clients.</p> <p>It is like being an athlete.  If they do not understand what goes into training and preparation then they will not compete and they are probably not a good bet.  There are exceptions.  However, this idea of the bank being the magic wand or the aunt or uncle to businesses and helping them through does not really wash.  My experience is that those in business who really understand their business know in their sleep who their debtors are, what the production costs are, who their creditors and sources of credit are and so on.  They may need someone to sit down at a desk and do it but they know the details.  There is some disingenuous conversation in this regard.</p><p> The deputation referred to the business model of banks.  We know from the review of the balance sheets of the banks that prior to 2008 the policy of fractional reserve banking was totally abandoned and that this caused the credit boom and bust and the asset price collapse.  I do not have the figures for Ulster Bank but I have them for the six Irish-owned banks.  I can do an approximation for Ulster Bank because it was a subsidiary of RBS, whose loan-to-deposit ratio, if we ignore ABN Amro, was approximately 135% - that is, 45 percentage points above the recommended level of 90%.  The RBS presence in Ireland is evidentially responsible for 50% of the asset price collapse.  It is unfair on the customers who were caught in doing their ordinary business and providing homes for their families.  It is unfair for them to be the subject of 100% recovery of loans that were used in the creation of a boom and bust.  It is not right and it is not fair.  That is the policy.

I call on Ulster Bank to consider the point carefully.  The experience of ICC Bank when it came to the maturity of a loan portfolio and the relationship with SME businesses over five, ten, 15 or 20 years was that there was an education for the customer and the lender or the lender executives in the relationship.  Loans are not products.  I keep hearing the expression from the banks that they have a product for this or that.  They are five-, ten-, 15- or 25-year relationships of trust and involve supplying information both ways.  That is what they are.  They are priced according to the risks involved.

From an Ulster Bank perspective it is clear that we have more than enough capital.  We have had the full support of RBS through the crisis.  A total of &pound;15 billion was injected into Ulster Bank through that period.</p><p>  The other key point to note is that we have taken considerable provisions, including in December of the year just gone by.  This was to enable us to deal with the legacy real estate issues and to get them behind us once and for all.  They will be gone over the next three years.</p><p>  We are involved in the asset quality review process and I am comfortable that we are in a good position for that.</p><p>  There was a question on restructuring and the volume of restructuring that we do.  Last year we did &pound;350 million in addition to new lending.  It was over and above that.</p><p>  Reference was made to credit unions.  I believe the credit unions have a role to play in the community.  Obviously, they do small ticket and personal loan lending and so on.  I do not really have a view on whether they should be involved in SMEs.  The key area to highlight is that it is important that the right skills and expertise are involved in any organisation when it comes to that lending, and that should be examined.</p><p>  We have a regular dialogue with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank on a wide range of issues and we update them on our various strategies and progress against those.</p><p>  Ms Graham may wish to comment on the farming sector and entrepreneur training.</p></speech>

We tailored an offering to new entrants to the farming sector last year.  We ran several educational seminars with Macra na Feirme to try to work with younger farmers.<br />The question of what we do with young entrepreneurs was raised.  We do a good deal of work through Small Business Can, an online offering.  A total of 20,000 people or businesses are registered and use the website now.  A raft of information is available on the website and many of the people who use <i>smallbusinesscan.com</i>are entrepreneurs.  We run many workshops through an offshoot, the Businesswomen Can programme, which is tailored directly to women entrepreneurs.  We have ambassadors for that in the bank and outside the bank.  We have several online offerings and seminars and a good deal of material is available through the <i>smallbusinesscan.com</i>website.  It is all aimed at young entrepreneurs and entrepreneurs in general.<br />A question was asked about accreditation.  The bank is accredited by the Chartered Banker Institute in the United Kingdom.

We welcome the opportunity to present the bank's perspective and our plans on the vital issue of lending to the SME sector and fuelling the regrowth of the Irish economy.  This forum provides a unique and very valuable means of communicating the bank's strategy to the political and wider environment and it allows the bank to absorb members' ideas and recommendations in terms of shaping bank policies.<br />I am very glad to be able to report that we are making progress on the difficult road back to normalised banking activity.  The major restructuring that AIB has undertaken to become a fit-for-purpose bank, capable of normal lending, dealing with loan arrears and customers in difficulty, capital adequacy and returning to profitability, is yielding solid results.  AIB expects to return to profitability during this year, 2014, and we believe we are adequately capitalised to meet the demands of an improving economy.<br />A number of perceptions persist around the bank's lending policy and I wish to briefly address these.  To suggest that AIB is refusing credit to viable businesses is wrong and it fundamentally misunderstands the situation.  With SMEs accounting for the vast majority of enterprises in Ireland, it makes absolutely no business sense not to facilitate their financing.  The bank's ability to grow and make a return to the Irish taxpayer depends on its willingness and capacity to lend prudently.  To do otherwise would be to remain static and is counter-productive on all fronts.  The financial health of the SME sector and that of the indigenous banking sector are inextricably bound together.<br />Second, it is important to point out the mistake in making a distinction between new lending and refinancing as though the latter was somehow less critical to the economy.  Protecting existing jobs is as important as laying the foundations for new employment and our figures demonstrate precisely the scale of refinancing required for SME customers in financial distress.  The scale of SME lending in Ireland has to be viewed in context.  From the highs of the boom years, demand and lending have fallen dramatically but all indicators are that 2014 will mark a turning point for SMEs as consumer sentiment improves to a point not seen since the economic crisis, coupled with a year-on-year fall in unemployment.  AIB exceeded the Government's &euro;4 billion lending target in 2013 with &euro;4.3 billion sanctioned to 32,000 SME customers in new and refinanced facilities.  The approval rate for lending applications was 92% for the year.<br />While factors such as consumer sentiment, employment levels and disposable income ultimately dictate the level of demand for credit, AIB is adopting a proactive sectoral approach through streamlined SME lending structures, targeted funds and detailed engagement with SME customers across all key sectors of the economy.  The bank is building new sectoral teams with specific skills and expertise to complement our traditional core areas, such as agriculture.  It is establishing dedicated personnel to originate and nurture new business opportunities in areas such as technology media and telecoms, energy, life sciences, exports, entrepreneurship, hospitality, tourism and property.  We are also making funds available to stimulate and support many of these sectors, with a &euro;1 billion in funds committed to the energy sector by 2017, a &euro;350 million new residential homes fund and our more recent announcement of a &euro;500 million agri-fund.  AlB's volume of new money approvals rose by 22% last year and we are seeing this positive trend continuing into the first quarter of 2014.  Increased levels of new money-sanctioned activity grew across a range of sectors, including wholesale-retail, agriculture and transport.<br />AIB has established itself as the leading Irish bank for SME start-ups, supporting approximately 50,000 job in the past three years.  The bank has the No. 1 market share for new start-ups seeking banking facilities and has launched a number of initiatives including a business start-up academy in partnership with <i>The Irish Times.  </i>The level of indebtedness in the Irish economy, relative to EU norms, is very high and this affects demand.  Almost all SME borrowers are seeking to pay down existing debt rather taking on new loans.  Repayment of loans continues to outstrip new lending activity.<br />We notice that the issue of SME arrears and distress appears to be the subject of less national debate than the question of mortgage arrears, even though its resolution is absolutely critical in terms of Ireland's economic activity.  SME debt makes up the greater part of the bank's troubled loan book but we have made very significant progress with much higher rates of customer engagement among SMEs than among mortgage customers.  We are on course to complete the substantial majority of SME restructures this year.  As a pillar bank, AlB's strategy is to support viable businesses and protect jobs where possible and SMEs in difficulty are identified as the top priority.  Criticised and impaired SME loans are typically managed with the banks financial solutions group and have a dedicated relationship manager to help resolve these issues.<br />Approximately 9,000 SME customers, employing a total of almost 40,000 people and &euro;15 billion of loans, are managed within AIB financial solutions group, FSG.  Proactive and targeted solutions are necessary to deal with these issues and AIB has set itself aggressive targets to agree long-term fundamental restructuring with its SME customers in order to restore them to unimpaired status and allow them and the bank to move onto a solid and certain arrangement.<br />A recovery in the SME sector is crucial to the Irish economy and to the banking sector.  AlB's financial planning is concentrated on achieving total lending approvals - mortgages, personal and business - of between &euro;7 billion and &euro;10 billion each year up to 2017.  On behalf of AIB, I want to use this opportunity to express again our thanks to the Irish taxpayers for their continued support.  Our endeavours are focused on re-establishing AIB as a profitable, investable bank to deliver on the State's investment over time.  We continue to invest and work towards the development of a customer-centric bank, meeting the challenges of the recovery and providing credit and all other banking services to Irish businesses that are the backbone of our economy.  We welcome questions from members.</p></speech>

We have received conflicting information from the banks and from a number of SMEs.  The SMEs tell us that it is very difficult to get a loan and the banks tell us that the vast majority - 90% - are getting loans.  It would seem that a filtering process is being used by the banks before the formal loan application is made and that from the point of view of the banks this process is to ensure that people are fit and ready to make an application.  However, from the point of view of the entrepreneurs, it is an informal method for saying "No".  We are told that banks are aggressively pursuing the delivery of credit but we also know that they are aggressively deleveraging from the market.  Some enterprise organisations have said that there is a reduction in credit supply for them this year.</p><p>  Mr. Byrne is correct when he speaks about debt distress and he is one of the first people from the banks to say that debt distress is a major problem in the Irish economy.  It is the equivalent of a foot on the neck of small businesses as they seek to grow and emerge from being knocked down.  Until we get a proper solution to debt distress for small businesses we are in effect discounting these small businesses from future participation and from being an engine of growth in the economy.  All I have heard so far today is that there is a level of forbearance on the part of the banks, which includes warehousing, for example.  </p> <p>From my perspective, there is no plan of action to identify the businesses with potential to grow into the future and ensure they have some level of write-down, some reduction in interest rate or some level of separation from their toxic debts.  Will the delegates indicate the percentage of AIB's business customers who are in debt distress and what the bank has done to ensure there is a real alleviation of that weight on their shoulders rather than simply a deferral of the problem?  Will they comment also on the flow of credit and how they are ensuring the filtering process is not a barrier to credit?</p></speech>

There are numerous surveys out there, many of which, of late, are moving in a very similar direction.  A very interesting survey in terms of its commentary is that of InterTradeIreland, which is largely independent.  In regard to perceptions of the availability of bank lending, the report states, on page 58, "SMEs are not forming their opinion based on personal experience".  In fact, InterTradeIreland found that only 20% of SMEs who answered a question in this regard did so based on their own experience.  On the other hand, 43% formed their opinion based on media reports, and 40% on the basis of general commentary outside of the media.  We need to arrive at a common view on this issue.</p><p>  We have tried to be as clear as we can in terms of what happens in an approval process.  If somebody does not apply for credit, it is difficult to arrive at accurate data by tracking applications.  We tried to do something in this regard a year or 18 months ago, but people are still basing their views on the anecdotal conversation in the golf club and so on.  We decided to focus specifically on the issue of SME credit to see what could be done there.  Members might be surprised to hear that the majority of loan applications from small businesses are for less than &euro;30,000.  In fact, 60% of all applications are for less than &euro;25,000, with &euro;19,000 being the average.  We put in place an initiative in our branches where a two-page application form was provided for SME loan applicants, with a commitment given that they would have an answer by close of business the following day.  There is no external involvement in the credit application process; it is done in-branch and the answer is given the next day.  We have a 97% approval rate in respect of those transactions and 95% of the amount is drawn down.  That is the quickest way we could find to put in place a local discretionary and decision-making capacity, and it has worked very effectively in each local community.</p><p>  Once one moves up the chain and into general surveys, we are confident that what is coming out of DKM and the Department of Finance accurately reflects what is happening on the ground.  However, it is very difficult to beat the anecdote when it is not recorded.  We are constantly advising people to put in a formal application.  I would prefer if the approval rate had to decline in order to ensure we had the entire population included.  If it really matters to people's business, we are urging them to put in their application.  If we reject it, it can be submitted to our internal appeals process.  If the applicant is rejected on appeal, he or she can go to the Credit Review Office, where there are very competent and capable people to assist them.  These are the mechanisms we have in place and we try to encourage people in that direction.  We discourage them from doing anything other than following the formal application process.</p><p>  In terms of the availability of credit, our loan to deposit ratio, which was a crucial issue for us, is below 100% at this point.</p></speech>

We have plenty of capital and plenty of capacity to lend from a liquidity point of view.  It is our objective to grow that balance sheet at the same time as we are trying to grow the profitability of the bank.  We have no intrinsic motivation to do anything other than that.  It comes down to the question of what is the demand for new credit.  I referred already to the level of indebtedness that exists across SMEs, which is high.  The other factor, which is always important, is the capacity in the marketplace to absorb that indebtedness.  If we go back to 2008, when a lot of this credit was taken on, people were projecting that the economy would grow by a quarter in the coming years.  In fact, it is actually 25% smaller now than it was six years ago.</p><p>  There is significant extra capacity in the economy in terms of the investment in fixed infrastructure, which means demand has been low for a period.  We always need to look at both sides of the issue.  It is our job to try to improve the supply side.  We feel we have done a lot in this regard, but we can always do more.  The other important factor is how we can stimulate things on the demand side.  The skills issue is another factor in that SMEs need more skills to submit their applications properly and understand the business planning process.</p><p>  We are all agreed on the importance of resolving the debt distress issues.  It is our job to seek to solve it by coming up with permanent solutions.  I ask my colleague, Mr. O'Connor, to elaborate on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.229" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan O'Connor" time="16:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUJ2014041500016#P00500"><p>At our last appearance before the committee we spoke about the critical importance of resolving the issue of SMEs in financial difficulty.  We have approximately 9,000 SME customers, some of whom have multiple accounts, with &euro;15 billion of debt attached.  That debt was taken on at a different time and often in respect of non-core assets.  Most typically, borrowers in Ireland are not legal entities but instead borrow in their own name.  One frequently finds that assets are entangled - for example, buy-to-let properties mixed in with commercial real estate, apart from the SME itself.  It is our strategy to disentangle what I would call the non-core debt over time.</p><p>  We have a structure in place, which has been rolled out across the market and has quite a bit of traction, whereby we determine the level of sustainable debt a company can maintain.  "Sustainable" does not refer to a maximum; we do not talk about maximising our return on debt but rather optimising the return.  It is about finding the level of debt a company can sustain while continuing to run the business.  An hotel, for example, needs working capital, a pub might want to install a new kitchen, and so on.  We determine the level of debt-collect the SME can maintain while sustaining itself.  The first step in this regard is determining whether the SME itself is viable.  In some cases, for reasons unrelated to debt - changed market conditions, for instance - the business might simply no longer be viable.  Once we have established viability, we put a structure in place for those customers who need it whereby the bank will compromise on the amount of debt outstanding.  In other words, wet will right-size the balance sheet of the SME.</p><p>  In the past 12 months alone, we have approved more than &euro;2 billion worth of compromise.  Such arrangements are subject to performance, so the SME needs to perform on the sustainable portion.  To the extent that it does, it knows beforehand there will be a compromise on the unsustainable debt.  Practically speaking, our approach is no different from what we are doing on mortgages.  Where we have assessed that a debt cannot be repaid or never can be repaid, we are prepared to compromise on that debt.</p></speech>

The purpose of our group is to put specialists in place who can hand-hold customers through what might simply be a difficult time for them.  We expect trading conditions to improve.  Some of our customers have no debt other than working capital debt.  We deploy short-term solutions most often in respect of those customers.  I do not have the exact breakdown and it is reasonably fluid, but they probably account for 20% to 25% of the book.</p><p>  Beyond that, we move to a situation where we put in forbearance in the form of, for example, a capital moratorium, no interest rate at all, an interest-only arrangement and so on.  We modify the contract, but we put that in place while the company is proving viability, that is, proving that absent the overhang of debt, it would be a sustainable business.  We have what I call medium-term forbearance for that proof period, for want of a better term, where both the customer and the bank are seeking satisfaction as to what is the future for the business and what is sustainable.  In many cases - most of our customers understand this and we work with them on it - adjustments will have to be made to the core business itself.  It is not just about debt; often it is about cost management, testing new markets and so on.  In such cases, the types of instruments I talked about, including moratoriums, interest-only arrangements and so on, would come into play.</p><p>  Where we determine that a company is viable, will require a right-sizing of its balance sheet and we will have to compromise on debt, we put in place a fundamental restructuring.</p> <p>It is important to say that we contract that with the customer up-front to ensure they are not wondering what will happen in two, three, four or five years time.  We put in place a five year or seven year solution.  It could require disposal of non-core assets before we finally know what we are dealing with but we contract it up-front and we put in a longer-term restructure.  Approximately 25% of the customers in that fundamental restructuring process are completed.  Approximately 40% are currently in that process, and I hope that we would have the back broken on it by the end of 2014.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Connor said that AIB did &euro;4.3 billion in lending in 2013, or approved &euro;4.3 billion.  How much of that was drawn down during the course of the year?  What plans does AIB have to increase the draw-down rate?  AIB's internal appeals mechanism has a 34% success rate compared to an average of 55% from the Credit Review Office.  How many AIB cases were overturned by the Credit Review Office?  One of the earlier speakers mentioned the number of cases overturned by the Credit Review Office.  What percentage of those subsequently went into arrears?</p><p>  I welcome AIB's comments on debt distress.  It is the first bank to raise it as an issue.  It is not the fault of this committee that small and medium enterprise lending does not get the kind of attention given to mortgage lending; that is the reason we have the witnesses before the committee.  We may have to invite them back after today's meeting.  </p><p>  The Entrepreneurship Forum set up by Sean O'Sullivan published a report in January in which its members are particularly critical of the dependence of Irish banks on personal guarantees.  They called it outrageous and said that Irish banks should begin to follow international standards on personal guarantees rather than continue what they have called "this current backwater behaviour".  It is the contention of the entrepreneurship forum report that personal guarantees are in contradiction of the Central Bank code on SME lending.  How much does AIB still rely on personal guarantees?  For instance, how many of the 9,000 cases in its group would have personal guarantees in place?</p><p>  I raise two other issues.  Has AIB increased its standard bank charges to businesses be it for standard transactions or others in the past three years?   Does it charge any special fees to businesses that might be in the FSG group?  What level of fees are charged?</p><p>  Mr. O'Connor mentioned the work under way in the buy-to-let market.  How many outside agencies does AIB have assisting it with that?  I am aware that PricewaterhouseCoopers is involved with it in that.  What fees is AIB paying to outside agencies for the buy-to-let resolution process?</p><p>  As one of the pillar banks AIB is crucial to the credit guarantee scheme, which has been a flop.  The Minister will re-evaluate it.  What suggestions will AIB give to try to make a success of the credit guarantee scheme?</p></speech>

On the first point on drawn balances versus sanctions, we made a comment earlier which the Deputy might have missed but I will repeat.  The way to look at this depends on the size of the facility being sought.  In general, for those seeking small facilities, and as I said, the average facility being sold is less than &euro;30,000, the drawn balance would be quite high.  In terms of the example we gave, we have an under &euro;25,000 initiative.  In respect of that initiative the drawn balance was 95% of the sanctioned balance.  For small businesses, therefore, it tends to match quite closely because people are reasonably specific in their requirement and then we can fund.  As we move up the spectrum we tend to find that people put in more surplus capacity and therefore the level of drawn balance would be lower.  For example, the average for overdrafts is approximately 60% in terms of the drawn balance piece.  It is a big number, and it tends to weight the number.  I would say the average is probably closer to 60% but the smaller the facility, the more likely it is to be between 90% and 100% drawn because it will probably match the exact requirement of the business.  That is one of the ways we look at it.  Larger organisations will tend to put in more capacity because there can be more variability depending on their business.</p><p>  On the Credit Review Office, in total, since the Credit Review Office has been in place, and I said earlier we believe it is a very good initiative because it gives people the confidence that there is some other mechanism outside the banks to examine this credit, we have had 90 overturns.  In that same period we have had 140,000 applications for SME credit, and our approval rate is 92%.  It is less than 0.1% in terms of where that has gone.  I do not know the statistic.  I will have to find it in terms of how that has performed subsequently.  I do not know the statistic and I will not make it up for the Deputy.  We can come back and look at that.  I do not know if Mr. Burke has any comment on that.</p></speech>

That is not something we are saying.  I would reinforce the point that the customer speaks to our internal appeals process and to the external appeals process before a customer even gets to that point.  There is a four eyes principle in all our branches, business centres and direct channels, therefore, before something is declined it goes to another lender who reviews.  The basic premise is that we are trying to make the loan.  We are trying to find a way to afford the credit.  It may not necessarily be on the same terms or conditions the customer sought it or it may not be for the same amount but our starting point is whether we can afford this credit to the customer.</p></speech>

It is a feature of the current position of the Irish market.  The logic is that many small and medium enterprises, SMEs, operate either in an incorporated structure or personally.  Those who operate personally is a separate issue because they have taken on the borrowing personally.  When they are operating with an incorporated structure, which may be for tax purposes or some other reasons, we have a choice, which is to try to get to the point where the person can put sufficient capital into the entity to support their commitment or, in many instances where they are unwilling to do that because it might cause a liquidation of assets to be necessary to put in the capital, a personal guarantee will be sought and put in place.  People seek it in many instances.  I am talking about the world now as opposed to the world pre-2008.  It just happened pre-2008; personal guarantees existed for almost everything.  The world we are in now is slightly different but personal guarantees are still a feature, and they allow people do things which they may not be able to do because they do not have access to equity or do not seek or wish to put in equity directly.  We do not seek the family home in respect of those issues.  That is an important distinction in respect to that.  Currently, it is a feature.  If we look at the general survey information available, the level of finance for SMEs in the Irish market that comes from banks is about 93% or 94%; it is significantly higher than the European norms.  One of the reasons that is the case is because there is less equity being put in outside of banking.  That is another feature that exists.</p><p>  On our marketplace, we cannot take just one statistic for the market.  In overall terms we must examine how SME lending works in the marketplace with other marketplaces.  I do not believe a like-for-like comparison can be done.  In overall terms we agree with the principle that there should not be blind personal guarantees in place.  It should be focused on supporting the underlying banking transaction and banking proposition.</p></speech>

They are not people who make flamboyant statements.  They just get on with their job.  Did it not wake up AIB when they used the term "backwater behaviour"?  Should we be doing something different in that regard?  I asked that question of the representatives of other banks also?</p></speech>

Businesses that have significant collateral with real assets are one proposition.  In the case of businesses with no collateral or equity coming in, there will be a need for more equity from them.  We have the largest seed fund in the marketplace and we need to bridge part of that ourselves so we can provide some of the seed fund capital.</p><p>  The issue is complex.  There needs to be an evolution of this with which we would be happy to work and to continue to contribute to the debate.  It should be very focused on meeting the needs of the lending proposition because one ends up supporting more lending propositions than one might otherwise because people do not have the equity in their business.  I do not believe one can come up with a blanket answer.  It needs to be thoughtfully considered to ensure we do not shoot ourselves in the foot due to the wrong answer.</p><p>  We rate this as part of our participation in the credit supply clearing group.  A sub-committee of the group is meeting to consider the options that might be available.  When one looks at the various funds playing in the Irish market, there is quite a bit of investment in the &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion and above space.  It is that &euro;1 million to &euro;2 billion space that we need to challenge ourselves about so as to find how we can provide alternative sources of equity funding.</p><p>  We are confident we have the lowest level of fees and charges in the marketplace which we review constantly.  We have a very attractive package for our start-ups.  Any business start-up will have two years free banking fees, access to AIB&rsquo;s iBusiness Banking, iBB, and access to merchant services of the debit and credit card service without an enrolment charge.  This is the only opportunity for start-up businesses in the marketplace.</p></speech>

The words &ldquo;temporary&rdquo; and &ldquo;partial&rdquo; were problems.  A guarantee scheme that is not for the duration of the loan and does not cover it creates a challenge.  The underlying credit in itself could not support the application.  If someone does not give the comfort and respect of it, then one is not changing the credit decision.</p></speech>

I am not sure we have ever measured the figure of how many personal guarantees we have but there would be a substantial amount of them.  Off the top of my head, I would say it is probably half of our customers.</p><p>  To the extent there is a personal guarantee, we would consider the totality of the debt as I mentioned across all of the asset classes.  It comes into play when we are compromising on debt.  We will also seek the introduction of something by the sponsor into that.  The only reason we are around is because we are in receipt of &euro;20 billion from the taxpayer.  The idea I could compromise on debt where people have borrowed in their own name for an SME and leave behind value that could have been introduced by the business owner is not tenable.  We do not consider personal guarantees as something distinct or separate.  We look at it in the totality of trying to come to an arrangement across all of the asset classes while protecting the SME and employment.  Those are the two priorities we put into our business.</p><p>  There are no fees to be in the financial services group.  It would strike me as counterintuitive to increase fees on someone already in difficulty, given that in many cases we will not recover all of the debt in question.  All I would actually be doing is making my loss greater.  In fact, we often have to forbear on fees and charges for customers that fall under the remit of the financial services group because it does not make sense in the long run.</p><p>  I cannot disclose the fees we pay to receivers of buy-to-let properties.  I deal with four different buy-to-let platforms but the clue is in the name, the low-cost fixed-asset receiver platform.  As an overall percentage of the asset, it is quite small and we would have tendered out on it.  </p></speech>

When it comes to those customers, that is generally not where buy-to-let receivers are used because we are trying to come a solution around the totality of the debt.  Generally if there is a buy-to-let receiver, the case is broken down and there will more than likely be a legal resolution to it in time.  It can also be consensual in some cases where we agree a legal resolution which is in the best interest of the bank and borrower.</p></speech>

In any of our dealings with the ECB, via the troika, it has all been about strategies to support SMEs and get a transmission of credit to them.  Leaving aside that, we fully accept Morgan Kelly&rsquo;s basic premise that one needs to separate the non-core debt from the core trading or viable debt.  That is our strategy.  It is not new news from our perspective.  However, I did not get the point that the ECB wanted to take down SMEs.</p></speech>

Is that 92% of those who apply?  If so, what percentage is drawn down, particularly by SMEs?  As one of the owners of the bank, I want it to be profitable and to do well.</p><p> I was involved for four years helping a number of retailers around the country and the vast majority of them said there was no point in them going to the bank for credit because they would be turned down.  However, when we helped them and they approached the banks, they got what they wanted on most occasions, although we do not hear that.  What is the main error SMEs make when they apply for credit which leads to them being turned them?  What advice can Mr. Byrne give them about what they should do the next time they apply for loan?  Are they making basic errors?</p></speech>

The main advice is their track record matters and, therefore, the performance of their account is important, particularly for smaller applications, say, below &euro;25,000.  Most of them are based on their track record.  If someone has a performing account, that will be a huge credit to him or her applying for a small credit.  When applying for something beyond that or incremental to one's business, which is different, it comes down to a credible business plan that has been well prepared and makes the justifiable argument as to why somebody should be given cash now for cash he or she will generate from his or her business in the future.  It is cash flow.</p></speech>

One of the things we have been working particularly on over the past two years is developing our own competence and capability in specific sectors.  When we speak to some SMEs, they say, "One size does not fit all; my size needs to fit me."  We have been investing heavily in all sectors in developing our own competence.  We have always had strong competence in traditional sectors, particularly on the agricultural side.  We doubled the number of agricultural advisors we have on the ground this week and launched a &euro;500 million fund acknowledging the growth needs of the agriculture sector in the run up to the removal of milk quotas.</p><p>  On the retail side, we took on the former managing director of ADM Londis to advise us internally as to how best we can react to the needs of retailers.  We have done specific research.  During 2013 and into 2014, we launched six specific sectoral outlook reports where we commissioned independent research on the dynamics and needs of the sector.  We partner with the key players in the sectors.  For instance, RGDATA was a key partner in the production of a report on the retail convenience sector.  It is not just about building our internal capability, which is important, but about bringing that message to retailers.  We have done a series of roadshows where we have worked with retailers to help them prepare as to how they might approach the bank with applications for credit, how they might digitise their business, how they might reduce their fees and charges and, practically, to help them and demonstrate that level of understanding.  Right now in the retail sector we are seeing a level of investment and reinvestment and some pick up in retail spending which is allowing retailers to remodel some of their stores.  We are also seeing a lot of activity in the necessary re-financing of customers of exiting banks.  Customers of those banks that are leaving our shores who may be doing deals with them need a new banking partner that can understand their business and give them the necessary credit to allow them to part company with the exiting bank and reinvest in the business that might have in some way stagnated.</p></speech>

It has been a feature.  As a bank, we just had to get ourselves in to a position where we recognise we have a role to help rather than adjudicating on poorly prepared submissions or lack of support for customers.  We have been reaching out more in terms of beginning to have dialogue with customers.  During 2013, we had 103 seminars across our business where we invited customers to our premises in the evening at times that suited them and talked to them about how to prepare a business plan and what the bank looks for to address the mystique around this and to get the message out.  There has been a strong perception that banks have not been as open as we believe we are.  We have to get out there and prove that to customers.  Sanctioning is one thing but reaching out and spending time with customers and helping them to put an application together that will meet the bank's requirements has been important.  This is a journey but one we are very much about and we have recognised we are key stakeholders in building that education.</p></speech>

Typically, the process is a customer of another bank would come to us and say he or she may be able to do a deal and ask what he or she can raise.  We run the numbers, go through the cash flows because it is important that we do not replace a customer that might be in difficulty with another bank with an unsustainable debt level and we also want to make sure that the customer has enough money to trade and to continue to invest in his or her business.  Typically we issue a heads of terms to say all things being equal this is the type of funding we are likely do to.  They would go back to the exiting bank and negotiate and then the deal would be cemented.  That often comes back quickly.  An exiting bank might have an end of year or end of quarter date by which it is prepared to do a deal with a particular customer.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is because we, representing the people, share the cockpit with AIB management and board in trying to get back to funding the important sectors of the economy.  During the five years leading up to 2011, the information, management and board reports from all the banks were at best unreliable, if not misleading.  I asked the bankers who appeared earlier why we should believe what we are hearing now.  I will not ask the officials to answer this question immediately because on the basis of what they have outlined over the past while, they have pulled back the curtains a little to allow us to see the operational actions they have taken.</p><p>  Having worked in banking for 20 years at SME level in ICC Bank, I recognise the authenticity of what they have said.  I hope they keep it up and do more of this.  I appreciate that Mr. O'Connor bears a great deal of responsibility, as his neck of the woods is about cleaning up the mess of the past and clearing the stage for businesses and households to move forward again.</p><p>  I am glad there is no suite of options for people and businesses in distress.  There is only one answer in each case because the facts of the circumstances for that person or business will reveal the answer regarding what is sustainable.  When I hear loose talk about six or seven options, it does not wash.</p> <p>When Nagasaki was bombed and people were suffering from radiation one could not spray an overall medicine for everybody.  Each person who was hurt and suffering from radiation had to be treated separately.  This is what the bank management is doing to deal with the issue and address it.  I am glad to hear that where there is financial gangrene it must be cut off through debt write-down.</p></speech>

Are there interbank protocols on fractional reserve banking?  Mr. Byrne mentioned the bank is at a 100% loan-to-deposit ratio, which means either deposits have increased or loans have decreased.  We know loans have decreased because in 2008 the figure on the loan book was &euro;134 billion and it has decreased to approximately &euro;90 billion, minus &euro;18 billion provisions, which makes it approximately &euro;78 billion.  This is the contraction in the overall economy about which Mr. Byrne spoke.  It is similar for the other bank.  Keep up the clearing up of loans and the contract up-front for survival frameworks for borrowers.</p></speech>

How does the bank deal with young entrepreneurs and those aged under 24?  They have difficulties in obtaining credit ratings.  Does the bank guide them to other means of finance apart from banking finance?  Construction is briefly mentioned in the documentation but it is a very important sector of the Irish economy.  It became too important to fail a while back and we are now getting to the stage at which it needs to develop.  How does the bank see itself as being proactive in this regard?  We need to build a minimum of 25,000 houses a year but the ESRI stated that only 8,000 houses were built last year.  There is a deficit in housing in the greater Dublin area at present.</p></speech>

There is a need for finance as part of an overall mix to try to move forward the construction of new homes.  There is a clear demand; we can debate the number, but it is more than 20,000.  We see ourselves as being very keen and anxious to support this development.  As Mr. Burke mentioned earlier, we have a fund of &euro;350 million.  One of the main reasons for the fund was to state that we are keen to lend and support development.  Another important element is the availability of mortgage finance at the far side, so developers know mortgage finance will be available after they construct housing.  We are very keen to show the size of our commitment in this respect.  We are very active in the market and we have campaigns to show we are lending, open and active.  A total of 80% of all mortgage applications are approved.  It is important for the developer to know there will be a financed end-user market.</p><p>  We are working with many developers to establish the point at which they are comfortable.  There is anecdotal and media evidence of equity being available domestically and internationally to support developers.  There is also a Government initiative on NAMA and the overall freeing of property into the marketplace to support it.  All of the bits are coming into place.  There are planning issues and infrastructural issues associated with the development of sites which need to be progressed.  We cannot help in this respect but we can state we are very much open for business, we are happy to support development finance in the short, medium and long term and we will be available to provide finance to many new buyers to complete the project.  We see this as a very important activity and we are keen to support it.  The fund is an element of this support.</p></speech>

These are teams of relationship managers who have no other portfolio responsibilities but to respond quickly to new business requests.  Much of the pipeline they built in the early days was with customers of other banks, including exiting banks.  We have ring-fenced our property capability with specialist relationship managers and credit professionals who partner stakeholders such as Property Industry Ireland, PII, and the Construction Industry Federation, CIF, to ensure we can respond quickly.  We are playing one part in unlocking the jigsaw, which is the financing and funding part, but other parts also need to fall into place.</p></speech>

To some extent this is sector-dependent, if we assume many of the younger entrepreneurs are more predominant in technology and media.  We are close to all of the start-ups and all of the accelerator and incubator funds.  We are committed in terms of our sectoral capacity, to which Mr. Burke referred.  We have a sectoral team focused on innovation.  None of these start-ups have assets which can be used as collateral.  Some might just need a credit card and there may not be much capital required.  We are trying to work as closely as we can with them.  We are the only financial sponsor of the Dublin Web Summit, which was attended by 10,000 people.  The sector needs to be understood.  It will not be capable of supporting large amounts of debt at any point in time.  Businesses must be enabled to process and become part of the payment system, and we believe we can help with this.  We have available accelerator and equity funds.  We partly fund the Dublin Business Innovation Centre, through which people can start businesses.  We believe we are playing our part in this respect.  It is not collateral-based so one must understand the business.  Mostly it is about facilitating rather than providing capital.</p></speech>

SMEs sometimes ask for too little finance as they think the bank will be resistant to the request, and under-pitch their requirements.  The bank is developing and educating specialist teams, which is good, because if they see that the business they are examining requires more finance they will be able to tell the business it should increase its application.  If a business falls short it will go on a journey but not arrive at its destination.  It will be goosed.  Template assessment will not tell one this.  It requires teams of specialists who understand the business.  The bank's development in this regard is good.</p><p>  With regard to personal guarantees, where there is no equity up-front the finance should be limited and released as the business takes root.  One can be flexible about these issues.  Some finance can be provided up-front to get the commitment, and as years two, three and four progress the rest of the finance can be released.  This is the way out.</p><p>  The business expansion scheme, BES, is a very good way to get equity because it combines tax shielding for investors who want to support businesses recommended by lenders.  If a bank has had a five-year relationship with a business which needs a second-stage injection of equity, the bank knows the business has been good for the first five years and that it has a future.  However, as the bank is not an equity investor it should lobby the Government and state it should give BES breaks to investors who trust those businesses in the borrowing stables of the banks.</p> <p>The bank might also consider providing extended periods of grace in respect of capital gains tax liability for SME start-ups or second-phase business.  During the start-up and early stages of business people make huge sacrifices.  It is unwise to apply too a high a level of capital gains tax liability where a business is being sold or merged.  </p><p> The property recovery issue is currently in the chatter of the newspapers and airwaves.  Allied Irish Bank is currently working on restoring its credibility.  It is important to put paid to the speculation that there is a property bubble emerging.  There is a small volume of transactions taking place in the context of the demand in the rental sector, which is leading people to think the property bubble is starting up again.  We know that if the bank, in the context of restructuring its balance sheets, sticks to fractional reserving, this will not happen.  It would not have happened previously if fractional reserving had been done by the banks.  That is the tragedy of all of this.  It is important to put paid to that nonsense.  </p><p> The silence of leadership on the part of Government in this regard is, in my view, irresponsible.  It might give people the impression that it is happy to accept that property prices have increased generally by 15% when in fact that is not the case and cannot be shown to be the case by a capitalisation of rental yields.  The Government has a vested interest in this because if there is to be a recalibration of local property tax in 2016 and it can be proven that property prices have risen by 15%, this will be low-hanging fruit.  The banks not engaged in the roll-up-sleeves work in which Allied Irish Bank is engaged on a case-by-case basis, including debt write-down, are questioning whether they should do anything if the underlying security has recovered a little.

Multiplied by 15, this equates to a 7% yield, or &euro;360,000.  That would be the open market value of the property.  The cross check in this regard is that the family likely to be living in that property, if owner-occupied, will not, on average, have an income of more than &euro;100,000.  If one multiplies that by three, the investment yield valuation is lower.  This needs to be dealt with by people who are in a position of authority.  As I said, there is an awful lot of chatter around this issue at the moment.  It may also be the case that currently there are people who, owing to an inheritance or a legacy, are participants in a small market, volume-wise, that has bid up prices beyond those investment values.</p></speech>

One of the key recommendations is that the Government address it as soon as possible.  I have always believed in the need for good business coaching and advice.  Perhaps the witnesses would provide information at a later date to the committee secretariat on how the bank has strengthened its team, including the number of people employed therein, their qualifications, positions and so on.  The issue of business coaching was raised with us by InterTradeIreland and I would like to back up the need for this with some evidence and so on.</p></speech>

In quarter 4, some 1,100 people were given specific sectoral training.  We also have a programme allied to professional qualifications which means that between 65% and 80% of our relationship managers in the larger business centres hold a professional qualification or are in the course of obtaining such a qualification.  Many people have left the organisation through early retirement and as such we are rebuilding our teams, including by taking people from the market.  We now have a number of qualified accountants on board.  Equally, we have taken on board people who have been entrepreneurs.  These people are advising on start-ups.  We now have a blend of skills.</p></speech>

Housing Association.  I welcome Mr. Justin O'Brien, chief executive officer, and Mr. Jerome Casey, chairman, of Circle Voluntary Housing Association; Mr. Brian O'Gorman, chief executive officer, and Mr. Simon Brook, head of policy, of Cl&uacute;id Housing Association; Mr. Ned Brennan, chief operations officer, and Mr. P&aacute;draic Brennan, eastern regional manager, of Respond! Housing Association.  I propose to take the opening statements in the order of the witnesses I have just mentioned - that is, in alphabetical order.<br />I ask the witnesses to bear with me as I go through the technical procedure of outlining the privilege warning.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  However, if they directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against a person or an entity either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statements and any other documents witnesses have provided to the committee may be published on the committee's website after the conclusion of the meeting.<br />Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />The issue of housing is a particular focus for this committee.  There have been fluctuations in the housing market for many years and there appears to be growing demand again, particularly in the Dublin area.  We must develop a housing policy and ensure that meeting demand in a sustainable manner does not contribute to another housing bubble or shortage of supply to meet demands for housing.  It is a huge topic for the committee.  None of us wishes to return to the situation of previous years, but that does not mean we should not monitor trends closely and tailor policy around that.  This is the first of a number of meetings the committee will have with various stakeholders in the housing sector.  We have invited representatives of the voluntary housing associations to today's meeting and at our meeting on 29 April we will engage with representatives of a number of local authorities and officials from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We wish to explore all of the relevant issues and to engage in a comprehensive discussion so we can put together a set of practical proposals for the Minister.  I hope today's meeting will contribute in no small way to that process.<br />I call on the representative of the Circle Voluntary Housing Association to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.320" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Jerome Casey" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014041500003#C00300"><p>I thank the committee for the opportunity to make a presentation today.  We forwarded our submission to the committee a week ago, so I will try to summarise the key points and messages we wish to communicate in the context of the wider brief that was requested by the committee of Circle Voluntary Housing Association and the other approved bodies.</p><p>  Circle VHA is an approved housing association with certified status from the Housing Finance Agency, HFA.  We are looking at this issue from our perspective as an approved housing provider.  The housing policy statement in 2011 was very important and significant in terms of how it communicated the paradigm of housing and the inequality between the different housing tenures.  It was also significant in stating that approved housing bodies should have a lead role in the provision of social housing.  We welcome it in that context.  It was a forthright recognition of our role and of what we aspire to be in terms of delivering social housing for those who cannot afford it.</p><p>  Since that policy statement was issued in 2011 the housing market has continued to evolve.  It is very volatile.  The structure and tenure of housing type have changed in the last ten years since the boom and from our perspective there should be a national policy and plan for housing, embracing all tenures and recognising the variation within urban areas, between urban areas and between rural and urban areas.  It is a complex, changing market, but our policies have not adjusted to those changes.  There is currently an under-supply of housing in urban areas and an over-supply of housing in non-urban areas.  That is a real challenge for everybody.</p><p>  We must also work in the context of reduced capital budgets.  All approved housing bodies have been affected by that.  The Department has tried to switch us from a 100% capital grant regime to a loan finance regime, where we get an average 20% CALF - capital advance leasing facility - grant from the Government and must secure 80% private finance.  That is an extreme challenge for the sector.  It is not that the Circle VHA is against that policy in principle, but the context in which we are expected to apply it in a very short period of time.  In other European countries such as Holland and the United Kingdom it has taken 15 to 20 years for that policy to evolve with the ratio of capital grant and private finance.  It is therefore very hard for us to address housing need.  That is a key fundamental message.</p><p>  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government had the Housing Agency undertake a review of the CALF, the capital loan finance policy which gives us a loan grant, at 2%, to procure.  It is repayable after the private loan finance is repaid via a revenue-based system of payment and availability.  The agency conducted an internal review of it and tried to change from a net present value, NPV, ratio to an internal rate of return, IRR.  It has a 3.6% return on capital.</p> <p>We think the change to our ability to borrow private finance will not help us.  It will make our chances of being able to acquire new units of accommodation or design and build unachievable.  In our view the measure will affect our capacity to deliver new social housing units.<br />Another matter that is important currently, particularly in Dublin areas, is the lack of supply in housing in urban areas and increased rents in the private rented sector.  This situation is having an adverse impact on families and single people presenting as homeless because rents have become unaffordable.  Also, the Department of Social protection has a cap on the amount of rent contribution that people on low incomes can receive.  Its rent policy and prices must be reviewed and we should adopt the German model which provides a return on housing of between 6% and 8%.  The current inflation and bubble in property prices in Dublin and the private rented sector is also having a damaging consequence on housing need.<br />I have outlined our substantial points.  We have given a response to the legislation planned by the Government, the housing miscellaneous provisions Bill.  In broad principle, we welcome the broad proposals with regard to repossession procedures.  We think the proposals are in line with the Supreme Court judgment in the case of Donegan <i>v.</i>Dublin City Council and the European Court of Human Rights.<br />The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government wants the sector to come under the remit of the Private Residential Tenancies Board, which would be a big change for us.  We are not greatly in favour of the legislation that was enacted by the Oireachtas this year and will come into force in the next 12 months.  Having said that, we have adopted a pragmatic view.  The PRTB is finding it difficult to deal with the problems presenting in landlord-tenant disputes.  How will it have the capacity to address difficulties that emerge with the addition of 26,000 tenancies?  <br />Another issue of note is the tenant purchase matter.  It has been a policy of Governments over the past 40 years and longer that tenant purchase applies in local authority housing.  Our view is that the sale of local authority housing diminishes the supply of available housing stock.  Also, it is often applied to purchasers who are on low incomes, but they end up getting into difficulty when they cannot repay the loan.  There is a real challenge regarding the matter.<br />There is a serious difficulty with the affordable homes scheme.  For the past ten years a lot of people thought they could afford to buy units via the scheme but they have not been able to make loan repayments.  <br />We welcome the housing assistance payment scheme in terms of its creation and the transfer of the rent allowance scheme from the Department of Social Protection to the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  Politicians have said that the scheme will enable a new provision of between &euro;500 million and &euro;600 million for housing each year.  I believe it will change the paradigm of housing because local authorities will take responsibility.  However, the scheme will maintain people in homes, so we do not oppose it in principle.  The scheme should give local authorities a more strategic role, but the key issue is whether they have the capacity to deliver and inspect the quality of housing, because they have been poor on that to date.<br />I wish to say one more thing about the housing assistance scheme.  There are 98,000 people on the national housing list, as assessed by the Department, and many of them are in private rented accommodation.  If the rent allowance is paid by local authorities, arguably it will reduce the number of people on the waiting list, which is welcome.  The scheme is meant to help people get over the poverty trap in which they are working but not receiving rent allowance, but there may be a negative consequence for approved housing bodies.  Those who remain on the housing list will often be people who are unemployed.  That may be a challenge for my sector and the local authority sector.</p></speech>

In my short introductory comments I shall attempt to outline the scope of work undertaken by the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association.</p><p>  Cl&uacute;id is a not-for-profit housing association which operates to further its key objective to help households in housing need.  The organisation is an approved housing body which was accorded approved status by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government in February 1994, which means it is 20 years old this year.</p><p>  Cl&uacute;id is led by a board of directors who delegate day-to-day operations to a team of paid staff.  The board is comprised of volunteers who are not remunerated, who come from a wide range of backgrounds and bring much valued expertise to the organisation.  In 2014, Cl&uacute;id's board was awarded the inaugural board of governance award, which was presented by the Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, at the Irish Council for Social Housing biennial housing conference.  </p><p>  Cl&uacute;id is committed to good governance.  It is a signatory of the Government's code for the community sector and the code issued by the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government entitled Building for the Future.</p><p>  We strongly support the inclusion of housing association tenancies within the residential tenancies board.  The measure will promote good governance and provide important safeguards to tenants.</p><p>  Cl&uacute;id employs 111 staff across a range of disciplines.  The association has two core activities - developing new housing and managing its existing property portfolio.  At present the association owns and manages 4,770 properties and provides property services to another 713 properties.  It also provides these services to other social landlords, mainly local authorities but also housing associations.  All of Cl&uacute;id's property management staff are licensed by the Property Services Regulatory Authority to undertake property management services.  Tenants who occupy Cl&uacute;id dwellings are nominated by local authorities from their housing waiting list.  Tenants pay a differential or affordable rents in much the same way as local authority tenants, based on a percentage of their disposable income.  That means that if their income goes up then their rent increases and if their income goes down - due to losing a job, for example - then their rent will decrease.</p><p>  In our written submission we gave a breakdown of the supply of housing achieved by the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association during 2013.  We measure our success on the basis of the number of new households that we can assist in any one year.  The housing environment remains challenging and waiting lists for houses continue to grow, so it is imperative that housing associations continue to provide social housing to those in need.  In 2013 Cl&uacute;id delivered 407 new homes through eight different routes.  Private finance was raised to secure 151 new properties.  An example of this was at Coneyboro, Athy, County Kildare, where properties were purchased from NAMA, which also carried out completion works.  The loan finance was sourced through the Housing Finance Agency.  The acquisition completed an unfinished private estate where the empty dwellings had been the source of much anti-social behaviour.  Therefore, the scheme provided the dual gain of providing housing for those in need and bringing to an end a troublesome section of a new and otherwise thriving private estate.  Under the mortgage-to-rent scheme 31 properties were acquired, which enabled Cl&uacute;id to assist households with unsustainable mortgages.  In applying for mortgage-to-rent the householder agrees to surrender ownership of the property and become a tenant of the housing association.  This enables the householder to remain in their former home and community.  </p><p>  Leasing initiatives enabled us to provide housing to 28 households in the past year.  There are properties located in areas of housing need.  We lease these properties from private owners and make them available to housing applicants on local authority waiting lists.</p><p>  The capital assistance scheme is targeted at special needs households.  In 2013, the scheme provided 40 homes for older persons.  Included in these 40 homes were 15 in Oakwood in Killarney which are located beside an existing housing development for older persons and a day centre previously developed by Cl&uacute;id.  In 2010 the capital loan and subsidy scheme was discontinued, but a small number of properties are still being completed.  In 2013, Cl&uacute;id delivered seven properties at Esker Hill, Ballinasloe, County Galway using funding provided by the scheme.  Also, 23 units were provided in Mallow, County Cork, through the National Asset Residential Property Services, NARPS, which is NAMA's special purpose vehicle.  A total of 74 homes were provided by bringing into use properties that local authorities had developed for sale but that remained unoccupied due to the collapse of the private owner-occupier sector.  When a housing association succeeds in letting these properties, the local authority is no longer responsible for making local loan repayments and the money saved can be used to provide local services.  The majority of the properties brought into use by Cl&uacute;id during 2013 were in County Cork.  </p><p>  Management agreements where the Cl&uacute;id Housing Association manages new property on behalf of other social landlords, mainly local authorities, produced 53 units for us during 2013.  As many as 30 of them were acquired by Dublin City Council in Herberton in Dublin city.  </p><p>  We hope that Cl&uacute;id can increase its level of delivery during 2014.  We are acutely aware of the responsibility placed on housing associations to deliver supply to households on waiting lists and we will endeavour to meet this challenge.  I thank the committee for their attention.  I am happy to respond to any questions or requests for clarification.</p></speech>

Many of the issues raised by my colleagues will be reflected in my presentation.  Respond! Housing Association is a not-for-profit organisation founded 32 years ago in 1982.  We employ 300 staff across the country.  We provide a development programme in the delivery of new houses and a support programme for our tenants.  We have an extensive community development programme for our tenants and their children.  We manage approximately 40 preschools, 40 after schools and a number of homework clubs and youth programmes for the children living on our estates and those living on nearby estates.  We see ourselves as a community development organisation with housing as a part of our remit in the delivery of services to people in need of housing and in the delivery of services to low-income families living on our estates.  I will address the issues of a national housing plan, spending on social housing, corporate partnerships with Government and measures that will support the voluntary sector in increasing the housing output.</p><p>  I reflect what my colleague, Mr. Justin O'Brien, said earlier about the need for a national housing development plan.  Fewer than 9,000 houses were delivered in 2013 and the recent housing agency report last week indicates that the economy needs approximately 80,000 houses over the coming five years, amounting to 16,000 per year.  The figures from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government are somewhat at variance with Mr. Brian O'Gorman's figures.  The sector produced 211 units last year, compared to 2009, when the sector delivered over 2,000 units.  Last year we delivered less than 10% of what we delivered some seven years ago.  At this point, there are nearly 90,000 families or 200,000 individuals on local authority waiting lists across the country.  We need a national housing plan that is properly researched, properly planned and fully resourced.  In the absence of a national development plan, we will not learn from the mistakes of the past and we are bound to repeat them.</p><p>  The second area concerns the spend on social housing, which has decreased by 63% between 2008 and 2014.  That is a massive shrinking of the amount of State funding available to support the delivery of social housing from the voluntary sector and the local authority sector.  Another area that Mr. Justin O'Brien alluded to is that of corporate partnerships with the Government.  The committee will consider the Residential Tenancies (Amendment) (No. 2) Bill in the coming weeks.  While we fully support the Bill in respect of tenants, we do not favour the idea that the voluntary sector should be shoehorned in under legislation that was primarily instigated ten years ago for the private sector.  As I outlined in my paper, we share the same characteristics as the local authority housing sector and we feel it is more appropriate that tenants' rights should be vindicated through a housing ombudsman or through a social housing ombudsman, as is the case in respect of local authority tenants.  Local authority tenants with complaints can have their rights vindicated through the ombudsman.  It is a great waste of resources to set up a new structure in the Private Residential Tenancies Board when there is an existing structure under the ombudsman, which could service an additional 24,000 tenancies on top of the 130,000 tenancies it is supporting in the local authority sector.  The ombudsman service has the expertise in the area of social housing whereas it is a whole new learning curve for the Private Residential Tenancies Board.</p><p>  The third area concerns measures to support the voluntary sector in increasing housing output.  With regard to the CALF scheme and the payment and availability agreement, the CALF is a capital subsidy of a percentage, varying from 15% to 25%, that must be paid back at the end of the period.  An availability agreement is a revenue subsidy on the moneys borrowed by the housing association from a commercial financial institution to build or acquire houses.  Two elements are contained in that, one of which is the funding and capital costs, and the other of which is the interest repayments on the loan over a 25-year period.  A State guarantee or a Government underwriting of these loans, as is common in Holland, Denmark and parts of the UK, would greatly support the ability of the sector to deliver social housing over the coming years.  Mr. Justin O'Brien has alluded to the fact that we were 100% capital funded until 2007.  This has now been reduced by between 15% and 30%, and the transition in the UK from a high level of capital subsidy to a low level took 20 to 25 years.  The only way the sector can continue to deliver the 2009 level of output, at 2,000 units per year, is through a Government guarantee on our borrowings.</p><p>  The second aspect that will assist us in delivering is the subordination of local authority loan charges on the mortgages.  At the moment, we sign a mortgage under the capital loan and subsidy scheme and under the capital assistance scheme with the local authority.  It is a non-chargeable and non-repayable mortgage as long as we maintain the houses for the period of the mortgage, 25 years, and make them available to people in need of social housing.  Some mortgages - we suggest 40% - could be written off without any cost to the State.  It is a way of trying to leverage additional private finance into the sector.  The capital loan and subsidy scheme must be more flexible in terms of geographical areas.  Dublin, where rents are good, does not need the same level of subsidy as rural areas, where rents are low and where it is more challenging to deliver.</p><p>  Regarding the payment and availability agreement and the CALF, some of the restrictions need to be revised to provide more flexible mechanisms so that we can borrow and deliver additional social housing.  As Mr. Justin O'Brien alluded to, only 39 units have been delivered under the mortgage to rent scheme while 1,337 applicants have been approved.  If all applicants were to be approved, it would amount to &euro;133 million.  Based on the &euro;10 million set aside by the Government this year, there is no way we can cover the gap of almost &euro;130 million.  Other sources of funding could be successfully tapped, such as the European Investment Bank and other European sources of funding.  We feel the Government should put together a model to deliver finance for the delivery of social housing and support services to those most in need.  Programmes are available, under the JESSICA fund, of &euro;150 million for the delivery of retrofitting or housing in disadvantaged areas or those in need of urban regeneration.  This is useful and is of great assistance to the sector in the delivery of housing to those most in need of housing in our society.</p></speech>

The need for social housing is sometimes mentioned in the same sentence as the need for housing.  The need for social housing has increased because of the collapse in the economy.  More people have moved into the lower income bracket.  Is the income threshold to qualify for social housing at an unrealistically low level?  It is &euro;25,500 for a couple with children in some counties.</p> <p>There are those on such incomes, and up to &euro;40,000 or &euro;45,000, who cannot buy and would never have any hope of buying.  What should happen to that lower middle income group?  Do the witnesses see the need to move the income threshold upwards?  In regard to local authorities, approximately &euro;24,000 or &euro;25,000 is provided by the voluntary housing sector through the various packages.  Local authorities continue to be the major provider but not of new builds.  Do the witnesses see local authorities continuing to play a major role in the provision of social housing, with the voluntary housing associations having a separate role, given that they have access to separate sources of funding? </p></speech>

Generally speaking, that is not good for those people and it is not good for the communities in which they live.  There is an argument for saying those income thresholds should be increased.  However, the difficulty we face is that there are far more people on low incomes on social housing waiting lists than we can house, or are likely to house, for the foreseeable future.  In one sense, it is about priorities.  One answer to the issue lies not with the housing association sector but with changes to private rented housing.  If the private rented sector was seen to be a more viable long-term choice that people were able to make, people whose incomes may not be high enough to purchase but are above those which would make them eligible for social housing, that might be one housing route for those people.  Overall, we would support an increase in the income threshold for people on housing waiting lists but the fact is we are having great difficulty in meeting the demands as expressed at present.  In terms of the role of local authorities, we have always supported a joint approach, with local authorities and housing associations as providers of social housing in Ireland.  We have put a great deal of work into establishing effective partnerships with local authorities and we think we have been successful in that to a large extent.  We would hope very much that local authorities will continue to be providers of social housing and develop new social housing.  The one thing we are able to do at present that local authorities are not able to do is to access loan finance.  That means that under current arrangements it is easier for us to develop social housing than would be the case for local authorities.</p></speech>

Obviously, if something is to be done, money is needed.  One of the associations, in its presentation, raised the issue of accessing funding from the European Investment Bank.  Are the witnesses in favour of the establishment of trusts within local authority areas to access that funding - in other words, that it is off the State balance sheet in terms of accessing money that is available from the European Investment Bank and other sources?</p></speech>

We need to have a radical reconsideration of housing because there is an awful lot of stratification and ghettoisation.  We need to look at housing in a big-picture type of environment rather than under the existing structures.  We are committed to integrated housing, building estates which contain social housing for families and housing for older people, with private housing and rental housing for private renters.  We are talking about a whole new model of delivery of housing in an integrated manner, which happens in many European countries such as France, Holland and Belgium.  In regard to accessing funding from the European Investment Bank, we would support the idea of setting up trusts so they would be off the State balance sheet.  We are well positioned in our sector to advance those vehicles to access those levels of funding, particularly in deprived areas that are in need of urban regeneration.  Many of the programmes, such as Joint European Support for Sustainable Investment in City Areas, JESSICA, are designed to alleviate poverty and combat disadvantage.  We are well positioned to deliver in relation to those programmes.</p></speech>

The cost of capital that it will allow us when we go the private sources of funds is very much below the cost of mortgages, at 3.6% versus 5%, and probably rising.  It is not doable.  We will be using up our capital in order to fund projects because we are not allowed 5% across capital.  It is an issue for the committee rather than for us, but some kind of German-style control of rents and house prices is probably unavoidable, and preferable to wringing our hands and saying something will turn up, as we did during the boom.  We have to act responsibly as a society - provide a return by all means to private investors, as is done in Germany, but also ensure people can have rents which grow slowly and in line with the economy.</p></speech>

Accusations have been levelled against the voluntary housing sector that it cherry-picks tenants and that more troublesome tenants are left to the local authority to house.  I have not found great evidence of that but I have heard from different parts of the country that those accusations have been levelled at various housing associations.  Are the tenants it gets 100% nominations by the local authority from the local authority waiting list?  Obviously, it has estate management issues to deal with.  Is it the case that at times they may be refused on the basis of the tenant's history?</p></speech>

There is a different set of tenancies with which it has no experience.  It is a whole new area for the board.  Given the halving of its staff, those who remain will have a sharp learning curve in getting to understand the operations of the social rental sector, which is utterly different from the private rental sector.  We do not think it is a good fit.</p></speech>

Perhaps they would outline the policy on one-off rural housing which is provided by local authorities that have no money.  This is pertinent in County Mayo.  There are people in substandard housing who could do with a house and who have a site but have nowhere to go.  On the issue of tenant purchase, it was not clear to me from what Mr. Jerome Casey said whether he was for or against it.  I think it is a good scheme.  There are local authority areas of varying age in my area.  Where people are allowed to buy out, there is a better mix of tenants.  It allows people to aspire ultimately to buy out and own their own houses.</p> <p>Most people find it easier to deal with the council than a high-street bank.</p><p> I am unsure which deputation commented on the idea that the housing associations could be brought under the remit of the Private Residential Tenancies Board and that they share the same characteristics as the housing authorities, that is, the local authorities, in terms of how they function and the service they provide.  I wonder whether there is a problem with the way we support and allow our housing authorities to operate.  They are operated by the councils.  In my town an estate required rejuvenation.  It was done well by one of the voluntary housing associations after it was handed over by the council, because the council could not access funding.  The council must deal with people.  Deputy Stanley referred to people from whatever background who end up coming to the council.  It is unsatisfactory that housing authorities cannot get funding.  The housing associations can get funding.  The deputations have made suggestions and I do not blame them for that.  They made reference to a Government guarantee etc. for the work they are doing.  However, local authorities need to provide houses, including purpose-built units etc. but they cannot get the money.  I wonder whether something is wrong with the system when we have come to rely so much on the housing associations.  I realise it may be a case of asking turkeys about Christmas but I would welcome some comments.  Obviously the housing associations are doing good work but it seems that there are some shortcomings.</p></speech>

Rural rehousing is important.  We are currently taking over 21 units from Rural Resettlement Ireland.  There is a cluster of 21 units around east Clare.  They had been developed as a one-off houses in the past 15 years.  Now, Rural Resettlement Ireland is giving up the business and we are taking over the management of those houses.  Generally speaking, we would only develop new houses where we have an existing cluster of houses.  That is the only limitation.  We develop new houses where we have an existing structure in place already.<br />Reference was made to tenant purchase.  We are not opposed to tenant purchase <i>per se</i>.  However, there is certainly a case to be made for a portion or percentage of houses which are paid for out of the State purse to be available all the time for people in need of housing and this is the argument we have made for the past 20 years.  Rather than selling off the silverware in a cycle every 20 years, some of the silverware should be kept for those in need of housing.  Such people will always be with us and in our society.<br />Reference was made to the funding of the local authority sector in comparison with the funding of the approved bodies.  The local authority sector has been curtailed because its source is Government funding and the funding shows up on the balance sheet.  Given the role of the troika and the financial downturn in recent years, the State has been unable to leverage the amount of capital funding necessary to deliver social housing.  However, with a little innovation and new thinking the voluntary sector has been able to continue to work to access funding with the assistance and support of the State, in small percentage terms, in the delivery of various forms of funding under different models.</p></speech>

We share Mr. Brennan's view that historically housing associations have not given tenants the right to buy.  Historically, housing associations have been primarily special needs providers.  Certainly, there would be difficulties in bringing in a tenant purchase scheme in a scheme for sheltered housing for the elderly, for example.  However, for mainstream housing we have absolutely no objection to it - in fact, we would strongly support it - but it must be done in a way that means there is no reduction in the overall amount of social housing.  This means it must not be done at a discount because we cannot afford to sell housing at a loss.  We can afford to sell housing at market value because we could then replace the unit sold with another social housing unit.  In fact, there would be an overall increase in the amount of social housing as a result.  We are looking at putting together a scheme which we believe is feasible.  We will be presenting it to the Department in due course and we have approval from our board for it.  Another feature is that this would help with creating mixed tenure communities and there is considerable evidence that these types of communities are successful.</p><p>  Deputy Mulherin made a comment about local authorities and asked whether there was something wrong with the system.  Yes, certainly there is something wrong with the system.  We have no wish to hog all the available resources.  We have plenty of work to do and there is plenty of work for local authorities to do as well.  If there were mechanisms by which local authorities could access funding that was off-balance-sheet - this is the only way such mechanisms can function at the moment - then we would strongly welcome them.</p></speech>

We need to recognise the reality that tenant purchase has been a significant element of housing policy and practice for the past 200 years.  From my point of view the issue is the capacity of those in the sector to be able to sell off some of the assets they own which they have acquired through Government grants.  If that is Government policy, it has not applied to us to date.  As Mr. Brook has said, we have to get the value return on assets rather than sell them at discount.  This is because we are operating on a small scale compared to the large stock transfers that have taken place in the United Kingdom and so on.</p><p>  Alongside our work the Department is undertaking work.  Mixed tenure is important.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is to undertake a review of the provisions of Part V of the Planning and Development Act.  I believe that legislation should not be amended.  It should be fully endorsed and implemented by local authorities because it enables mixed tenure provision of social housing, which has been beneficial and it works.  Much of our housing is in mixed tenure schemes and there is no difference between the social housing and the owner-occupied housing.  That is an important policy instrument.</p><p>  Reference has been made to what is a real risk.  There is a crisis in the provision of social housing as per the absolute reduction in capital grants.  The expectation of the State is that we and our boards take the risk of borrowing private finance to acquire new units.  As the chairman of my board has outlined, there are serious difficulties in respect of us being able to undertake this given the scale of what is required and the grants that we may get from the State to complement private finance.</p><p>  Policy has evolved.  Under the European model of social housing provision housing associations are the main providers and are designated as special providers.  If this is what the Government wants us to do then we need to have the instruments to be able to deliver it for the State and its citizens.  This is not to belittle local authorities; they have multiple and varied functions.  We are more or less specialist housing agencies.  This is what we deliver; it is our main core business alongside facility services.  We do not have responsibility for rates, roads, water or the various other elements for which a local authority is responsible.  I am suggesting that the change of role referred to is slowly evolving.  The policy instruments to enable stock transfer or to enable us to have a greater role are not as developed as we would like them to be.</p></speech>

Any such plan must be ambitious.  We must think differently from how we have thought in the past.  There is a real chance that we will go back to doing everything that we did before which caused all the problems.  There needs to be a far larger rental sector with a far greater public emphasis in order that people can rent a home for as long as they wish to live in it, rather than rent a property, which is more a temporary thing.</p> <p>There is some element of law that gives them a certain period of time to vacate but this is not stacking up in that people are being pressurised out of private rented accommodation.</p><p> The housing waiting list is at 89,000 and the very large number of repossessions coming down the tracks will add to that list.  It should be noted that the list is not uniform in all parts of the country.  Six local authorities - three in Dublin, two in Cork and Kildare local authority - between them make up 50% of that list.  When the housing associations are considering locations for building houses, do they take into account locations where rents are highest and where Department of Social Protection rental caps exist?</p><p> Dr. Michelle Norris appeared before the committee recently.  She told us there was &euro;500 million available and that there had been an approach made by the European Investment Bank to draw down more money.  She spoke about the key issue not necessarily being the availability of funding which to me was a real bolt out of the blue, but rather it is a question of the right structures being in place.  She talked about the capacity of the housing association sector to avail of that funding.</p><p> What role can the housing association sector play in the short term to help in the current crisis and to contribute to a national housing plan in the medium term?  On the issue of the ratio of funding from the State along with drawing down money from elsewhere, what examples are available from elsewhere with regard to drawing down funding from that kind of source?  Will the housing associations have the capacity to increase the number of units if funding was available or funding in the right mix was available?  If it was a question that there would have to be some sort of a guarantee or the Government would have to underwrite it, would this introduce a new impediment in terms of drawing down money from the European Investment Bank?</p><p> I have a couple of other questions and I will put them now so that delegates can respond to them.  I refer to the significant issue of void houses.  The problem is that the new procurement policy by local authorities is making the turnaround of voids very lengthy.  It can take many months if a contractor has to be appointed.  Is that same impediment an imposition for the housing associations or do they function under a different set of rules?</p><p> The Department of Social Protection will be moving to HAP, housing assistance payment.  What role will the housing association sector play in this regard?  That is one of the issues the committee is to address.  This meeting was not organised to respond to the legislation the heads of which have just been published but it is timely that we can respond to it and it would be useful to hear the views of the housing association sector.</p><p> The housing associations say that there is not sufficient national funding provided for a take-up of the mortgage to rent scheme.  The scheme is available in theory but the delegates maintain it is not available in practice.  Is that because sufficient national funding has not been set aside?</p></speech>

If a person buying a house for &euro;100,000 is given a CALF subsidy of 20% which would be &euro;20,000, the person would have to raise a loan of &euro;80,000.  If the house is in a rural town where the average rents are &euro;500 a month for a three-bedroom semi-detached house, there would not be enough there to raise &euro;80,000 so there is going to be a gap between the State subsidy and what the person can borrow.  The voluntary sector can only take up that gap to a limited extent in that its balance sheet can only bear a certain amount of borrowings.  That is where the difficulty lies.  A Government guarantee would take the risk out of that gap of money and it would allow us to be able to develop more, knowing that we would be able to keep the thing moving at a sustainable level.  The difficulty at the moment is that we are taking all the risk.  We are going from a situation seven years ago where we had no risk - we were 100% capital funded - to today virtually taking on the whole risk.  As charities we cannot take on that risk to that extent.  We have to be more cautious in how we do our dealings and as a result of that caution we cannot really develop the same number as was possible previously.  We have a strategic policy of delivering or looking for sites or developing housing in areas where there is the highest need, such as in the Cork city area, along the east coast and in the counties of Kildare and Meath.</p><p>  On the question about the European Investment Bank, certainly the sector has the capacity to deliver.  In 2009 RESPOND! had 1,200 houses or units under construction.  We have the capacity and the technical capability to be able to deliver in that we have our own in-house engineers, technicians and architects.  The funding piece of the cake is missing at the moment.  We have the capacity to be able to deliver and we have the capacity and the experience to ramp up and start delivering again very quickly but without the State support in providing that safeguard or lifeline we cannot take on that level of risk.</p><p>  With regard to voids we have a fairly quick turnaround and we do not have the same number or percentage of voids.  Of course we are a much younger and newer sector so our houses do not probably need as much work as local authority houses may need when they are being re-let.  </p><p>  With all respect to Dr. Norris, all the talk about structures is window dressing.  We have delivered in the past and we will be able to deliver in the future.  The idea of having the structures right is only window dressing.  We can deliver but the question is whether the Government will put that model together to support the sector in delivering more houses to those people who are in need in our society.</p></speech>

The current issue is not a shortage of finance; the current issue is that the main banks are not taking it seriously.  That is the truth of the matter.  The scheme has been running for nearly two and a half years and we and other housing associations, including RESPOND!, have put very considerable resources into it.  We have 39 units completed and we have closed the sale on another 40.  The Government's original proposals envisaged 500 units a year for seven years.  We are nowhere near that and we never will be.  The current issue is not finance, it is the fact that the banks are not taking it seriously.</p></speech>

The finance committee has been speaking to the main banks.  They are saying the opposite.  However, I am more inclined to believe Mr. Brooks.  I ask him to give an example because the example will always tell the story.  He does not need to name the banking institution in question but I think I will be able to guess.  I ask him to give an example of the delays and problems in a typical case.</p></speech>

The sub-prime lenders appear to have no difficulty with operating the scheme.  Of the 31 units we have processed, I think 28 have been from a sub-prime lender, although I am not certain.</p> <p>The system can be made to operate if that is what the lenders want.  What we are up against with the main banks is that they express interest in a number of cases but that is where it ends.  We simply do not get any further detail or any further processing of the cases from the banks.  These delays occur all the way through the process, even, for example, where we have agreed everything and are closing the sale.  In some cases, we have serious problems in getting the information we need from the banks - in regard to title, for instance - in order to close the sale.</p><p> The main difficulty for us in dealing with the banks is the occurrence of these types of delays.  There are, however, other difficulties with the process, as we have consistently maintained.  It involves two changes of ownership, for example, which inevitably makes it more complex than we would like it to be.  There are changes that could be made to simplify the process, but it could be made to work as it is if all the stakeholders were genuinely committed to making it work.</p></speech>

It is one of the main issues that emerged from last week's discussions.</p><p>  Regarding NAMA's role in this, my view is that the houses are simply in the wrong places.  That is why they cannot be sold and are in NAMA in the first place.  The problem is that they are not located in places where people, in either the private or social market, actually want to live.</p><p>  I also have a question regarding the 80% funding.  I understand an experiment was done in the Docklands which has worked extremely well, involving a mixture of market, social and voluntary housing.  Would pursuing that type of mixed development make the borrowing more secure for the organisations represented today or is there an issue in that regard in terms of their own governance?  Would a model which included some element of market rent be more economical?  I accept that the organisations' primary function is to provide social housing, but that type of model has advantages not only in the financial sense but also in that it would facilitate a good social mix.  Unfortunately, I do not have time to go into the idea of a Government guarantee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.359" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian O'Gorman" time="16:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014041500009#J00300"><p>We developed one scheme in Sandyford with a mixture of private and social housing.  Of the 58 units in the scheme, 34 are social and 24 are private.  That works extremely well and there is no problem with demand on either the social end or the private.  Indeed, they cross-subsidise each other very well, so to speak.  It sounds perverse in some ways but where we take out loans, they are backed by a payment and availability agreement.  We make the property available to the Government or local authority, which puts a payment agreement in place.  When a lender looks at that, the guaranteed payment is worth a lot more than a private sector letting.  A private sector tenant might leave in a year, for example, and there might be voids in the leasing, but the payment and availability agreement is guaranteed.  In that sense, it is a better bet for a financier.</p><p>  Cl&uacute;id has developed housing using the current funding model.  That model is not ideal but it is there to be used and it can be made to work.  The difficulty with a Government guarantee is it would mean the Government having to take debt onto its balance sheet, which is simply not going to happen.  We need to work within the current framework.</p></speech>

If it proves successful, will Cl&uacute;id or any of the other organisations look at rolling out that model on a broader scale?  There is a social gain in providing that type of mix, quite apart from the benefit of providing houses.</p></speech>

I am not referring here to rental integration but to schemes which included affordable houses.  The developments include local authority affordable units, local authority rental properties, rentals for the voluntary sector, accommodation for older people and, in one case, Traveller accommodation.  That integrated model has worked very well in all of those locations.</p><p>  We are considering the development of a model in Dublin for a mixed scheme which would include social rental and private rental accommodation.  In my view, that is the way to go in Dublin and Cork, in a context where we are not able to secure sufficient finance to fund the social side.  It is particularly relevant in Dublin, where pent-up demand has begun to bubble to the surface in the past 12 to 18 months.  It certainly is a viable option, in line with what is happening in many capital cities around Europe.</p></speech>

On the other hand, do they see anything in the heads that would assist them to roll out such a model to a greater extent?  Finally, does the model we are discussing have any negative impact on the 80% funding the associations can borrow?  Specifically, will they be able to borrow at the same level where a market element is included?</p></speech>

If one develops private housing, one is doing so privately and will not get any funding for it.  That makes sense, because it is a different model.  We are not-for-profit social businesses, so this amounts to a jump into a different sector, with different risks and so on.  However, the Deputy has raised an interesting point in terms of the ability to lever off the private rental market.  Certainly, in other jurisdictions across Europe, including the United Kingdom, it is quite a regular model.  However, as was pointed out earlier, we have a very residualised social rented rector in his country, whereas it is much more mixed across Europe.</p><p>  Mr. Brook made the point that resources are scarce and we need to target them at the people in greatest need.  The result is that we do get concentrations or the potential for concentrations of low-income households.  That is why the continuation of Part V is so important.  During the Part V years we participated in developments in places like D&uacute;n Laoghaire, for instance, where we had never before been able to get in a social housing component.</p></speech>

However, the terms on which we can borrow from the agency are quite different from those available to local authorities.  That affects capacity.  We are borrowing at a rate of 5% compared with 2% or so for local authorities.  In addition, the Irish banks do not have a strategic view on social housing as a long-term investment.  They have not engaged with us in any serious way.  There have been some once-off deals but no long-term strategic view.  That is part of the wider context in which we are working to enable greater provision of social housing, with due regard to the potential risk that goes with moving into mixed-tenure development.</p><p>  I have a word of caution on the mixed model to which Deputy Kevin Humphreys referred.  The United Kingdom housing associations have gone considerably into private finance, which raises some questions as to whether they have lost their primary function of social housing provision.  In a situation where their balance sheets and books are so large, they have got caught up in private finance and repaying the loans.</p></speech>

I am not an elected politician and, as such, do not have the same level of experience as some colleagues of dealing with constituents on this issue.  What are the delegates' macro views on the recently published legislative proposals?  It is unfortunate that we have not had more time to deliberate on those proposals.  We might have to invite the delegates back in due course to go through the details of that legislation.  For now, however, I am very interested in the delegates' response at this point to what the Government is proposing.</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien referred to German-style rent control mechanisms.</p> <p>Could Mr. O'Brien please elaborate on that a little more for us and how he thinks it might impact on this country?</p></speech>

It is important.  It is a tidying-up exercise by the Department in terms of the Supreme Court judgment in the Donegan case, and the fact that when they were trying to get repossession against people involved in anti-social behaviour they were unable to do so because the procedures were not right and there was not some independence in it.  We welcome that.</p><p>  The housing assistance payment has been discussed for 20 years.  It would seem to make strategic sense that it would go from the Department of Social Protection to a housing body that has overall responsibility for housing.  We would support that.  The approach with tenant purchase is that some of the value should come back if a tenant sells on a home and gets profit from it.  Some of the profit should go back to the State that created the asset.  That is the broad substance of the legislation.  To me it is a tidying-up piece of housing miscellaneous provisions legislation which the Government tends to introduce every two or three years to deal with issues.  In fairness to the Department and the Minister, it is a follow-on to the housing policy statement.  Some of the policies that were enumerated in it in 2011 are being put on a legislative basis.  In that context one would say the Bill is addressing policy via legislative methods.  I will hand over to my colleague to comment on the German model.</p></speech>

One can be sure when one signs up to rent a property in Germany that the rent will rise very moderately over the duration one wishes to remain in the property.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy said, one can rent a house for as long as one wishes to live in it rather than rent a property.  The Germans have managed over a long period to make renting at least equally preferable with purchasing.  They have specialised funding through Bausparkassen, and various other such methods.  Local authorities determine rents.  One must leave the house or the apartment in the condition one got it in.  That is important.  They also involve both individuals and utilities &ndash; pension funds &ndash; in the provision of private rented accommodation because one allows them a reasonable return on property, which as I said is in the range of 6% to 8%, which is way above what one would get on German gilts at the moment.  If one considers that the State is getting about 3% on its bonds, 5% would not be inappropriate for a return on private rent or a mortgage to the voluntary housing associations.  I will not say any more.  It is entirely different from the British and Irish version but it does give one what the Germans really like ever since the Weimar Republic - namely, stability in house prices and rents.</p></speech>

The first is that it drives a coach and four through the Government&rsquo;s own policy of equity across tenure as set out in the housing policy statement of 2011, which basically says one should not give special deals to particular groups.  By giving a substantial discount to tenants who can afford to purchase, the Government drives a coach and four through the stated policy.  Second, it means that any scheme we would be able to offer would not be able to compete with the generosity of the scheme that is envisaged in the Bill.  We are a not-for-profit organisation, but we are also a not-for-loss organisation, and we simply cannot afford to sell off-----</p></speech>

Housing is the top priority in this country at the moment.  I am delighted the witnesses are present today.  On local authorities, the bank loan scheme and mixed tenure, the latter is important.  One must consider how one achieves it.  Stability is an issue in local authority estates and voluntary housing estates.  If people cannot purchase their own homes they might move away from the area and it will not be possible to achieve stability.  How does one achieve stability if one does not allow people to purchase their homes?</p><p>  Someone mentioned the JESSICA fund.  Have any of the groups availed of it, and if not why not?  It seems to be a good European fund and it is used in Scotland more than here.  What problems have been found with it?</p><p>  Shared ownership relates to local authorities only, but do the witnesses envisage going down that route?  A response has been given to the question on the capital grant system and the loan scheme and how they should be made easier.  There is food for thought in that.</p><p>  The NAMA houses that were offered were located where people did not want to live, yet we have a good rural rehousing scheme.  Have the witnesses matched applicants from the rural rehousing scheme to the areas of NAMA houses that were offered?  A person who is now on a local authority housing list who is developing an IT business might love to live in a rural area.  What matching is done by the various schemes?</p><p>  A witness referred to a Government guarantee or capital underwriting.  That is interesting, but could it lead to a bit of loose accountancy if everything is guaranteed?  I am a bit wary of giving guarantees on everything.  The best way to watch what a person does is to make him or her responsible.</p><p>  Reference was made to 40% mortgage write-offs.  Would one not have to equalise that across the private rented sector because of the way the Constitution is written?</p><p>  I read the Cl&uacute;id annual report.  The organisation has 94 employees.  Could the other housing associations inform the committee in writing how many employees they have, how many houses were delivered each year and the salaries of employees?  We are aware of openness, transparency, responsibility and accountability.  Is the information available online?  The information is not in the annual report.  I looked at income and expenditure.  I am sorry for picking on Cl&uacute;id, which has a good annual report, but it is not listed either on page 54 or in the director&rsquo;s report.  I do not know where the information is but I could not find it.  Such information should be available online from all the organisations.  I have said the same to every voluntary organisation that comes before the committee.  The housing ombudsman is the local authority and not the Private Residential Tenancies Board.  If rules are introduced for the PRTB to implement and the local authority rules are more lax, a local authority tenant will have more rights.  I would be reluctant to say that everyone should be governed by the same yardstick.  There should be important rules for each one.</p></speech>

One can develop estates with proper structures in good locations with good infrastructure, transport, social facilities and community buildings, which ensures that people are provided with accommodation in the best of locations with the best of supports where people will want to live because the location is attractive.  The right to buy does not necessarily make an area attractive for people to live in.</p><p>  The Government is trying to put together funding proposals for the JESSICA scheme at the moment.  We have not been able to access the European Investment Bank or other programmes directly; we have to go through Departments.  We are trying to interface with some European agencies in order to access funding.</p></speech>

All of those issues are now combining to produce a disaster.  Would Mr. Brook agree with that?  It is certainly the case in D&uacute;n Laoghaire where the council officials tell me that for the first time ever they are having to turn people away.  They have nothing to offer them.  They do not even have a hotel on the other side of the city, which is bad enough.  The queue for their homeless accommodation is out the door.  Even those on the top of the priority list will be waiting a year.  They have nothing to offer in that regard.  I would be very grateful if the representatives would use their presence here to ring the alarm bells.  They might say categorically that there must be a shift away from this hoped-for provision of social housing from the private rented sector through leasing arrangements and so on.  That idea was nonsense.  It has failed and clear statements must be made to the effect that we must return to direct provision of social housing via the representatives' organisations or the local authorities.  How would the representatives respond to that?</p></speech>

There is no question about it and the context for that is the economic circumstances in which we find ourselves.  That has gone both ways making it worse.  The demand for social housing has increased among people who have a severe need for it.  At its extreme, people are homeless.  At other levels, people are living in extremely poor quality accommodation.  There is a greater demand for social housing while at the same time the output of social housing has collapsed in recent years.  We face enormous challenges in addressing that but as Mr. O'Gorman stated at the outset, we produced 400 new units last year and we are extremely proud of that.  It is a very small contribution but, nevertheless, it is 400 households off local authority housing waiting lists who are now living in good quality housing, and we want to do better than that.  Part of what we urge constantly is to make the current systems work as effectively as they possibly can and, where possible, to bring in new systems.  There is not one simple solution to the problem of housing in Ireland.  It requires a range of different solutions, which may well include leasing, but we also must make the target finance model work.</p></speech>

However, in many areas of Dublin the landlords, even if they entered into agreements two years ago when they needed tenants, are now pulling out of those because they are not a good deal for them.  A big pillar of the plan, therefore, has collapsed and I do not see how it can be resuscitated.  Do we not need to revert to what works, namely, the representatives' organisations and local authority housing?</p></speech>

It is the lack of planning.  Mr. O'Brien and myself have been saying that there is a need for a national housing plan.  A "mix'em and gather'em" of little bits have been pulled together and there are different programmes delivering different services.  We need to start with a clear white sheet and decide where are the needs, particularly with regard to what Mr. Brook mentioned.  The most marginalised people are homeless people.  Their ability to get services are diminishing every day, and these are the most marginalised people in our society.  If we cannot provide for homeless people, what chance do we have of providing for anyone else in need of housing?  We need to start with a clean white sheet.  There is a great deal of knowledge and strategic vision in the Departments and in the State agencies to allow us be able to begin to build up a housing policy, which is determined by analysing need, identifying the best places to live, identifying the resources, and putting that package together.  We cannot rely on the private sector, as the Deputy rightly pointed out, because the private sector will go where there is the most money.  Social housing was a cove in a storm.  When it got cold and windy, the private sector came in for a breather.  Now that the sun is shining again it is back out fishing in the middle of the ocean, and that is what will happen.  We cannot depend on the private sector to deliver social housing.</p></speech>

There is no doubt we have a major crisis on our hands and that we need a national housing plan because I believe everyone has a right to a home.  However, increasingly, the voluntary housing groups are being given more of a role when it comes to housing, even in terms of the way they raise funds.  The local authorities do not have the same ability to do that.  We know from the Minister, who states it repeatedly, that this issue will end up in Europe because we are borrowing money but not accounting for it.  That was one of the reasons we suggested that local authorities would borrow in the same way as the voluntary housing groups and set up a similar system.  The Minister of State, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, says it is possible.  The local authorities say it is not.  I do not know, but with a little imagination I believe it can be done.</p><p>  In terms of the homelessness problem, the Minister of State said she will end long-term homelessness by 2016.  That is fantasy.  It will not happen, but I know the local authorities nominate people to the representatives' organisations.  Do their organisations insist on a percentage of homeless people coming to them or are we relying on the local authorities?  I understand a certain percentage is taken, which is very important.  We have to be careful with the terms we use.  It is not "homelessness"; it is "long-term homelessness".  That is not to say we will solve the problem of homelessness.  It is playing with words, and it is deceiving.</p><p>  On getting the best value for money, we have NAMA, new housing, etc., but looking at some of the second-hand housing, in the same way that the local authority buys for senior citizens or whatever, is there any value in examining that area because houses will be much cheaper?  It might cost them to refurbish them, which might be an issue, but with a little imagination I believe it would work out cheaper.</p><p>  It was mentioned that, overall, there are 35,000 units in the voluntary housing sector.  Does that include HAIL and Fold Ireland?  Is that the entire sector?  We have seen Fold Ireland take over housing in Finglas east from the local authority.  I am annoyed about that.  I do not believe the local authority should do that but they do not have the funds.  That is where we need to have a little more imagination.</p><p>  I am aware NAMA has been given a role in terms of how it delivers housing, etc.  It was written into the NAMA legislation that it had to get a gain in that regard.  We should consider changing that legislation.  This issue should be passed over to the local authorities or to the voluntary housing groups to deal with.  For various reasons we have thrown away a chance of getting that good housing.  We can talk about the housing the representatives say cannot be utilised in certain areas but with a little imagination some of those could be utilised.</p><p>  On the scheme for selling off houses, we ran into trouble with Dublin City Council in terms of the flats, apartments and so on and it never happened.  The representatives might comment how we might get around that.</p></speech>

They nominate and we allocate the houses.  Ultimately, it is their waiting lists and they choose who is allocated housing.  If the applicants are homeless, they get it.  It is at the behest of the local authorities.  We take 100% nominations.</p><p>  I would like to throw something back at the politicians.  We have been involved in negotiations for many years with local authorities throughout the country and time and again the issue of homelessness and demand continues to arise.  We put proposals before politicians, particularly elected members, on short-life housing.  Where there is a crisis, as there is in Dublin, and there are large numbers of voids in local authorities we would take that accommodation and bring it up to a standard to allow it be allocated to somebody who is homeless on a licence basis so that when the local authority gets funding to develop a particular scheme, it would be available to go back to the local authority.</p> <p>This goes nowhere.  Whether it is quoted as an industrial relations issue, it simply cannot get past the members on the council floor.  They consider it a transfer of responsibility and are not willing to engage with us on that level.</p></speech>

Community Action Network is a community development organisation that has been working to resource local communities over the past 25 or 30 years.  In recent times we have been asked by the policing forum based in the south inner city of Dublin to look at how the experience of community safety issues on the ground might be brought to bear on legislation.  The Housing (Miscellaneous Provisions) Bill 2014 is important in that regard.  The policing forum is a multi-agency group comprising community workers who have been involved in their communities for many years, Dublin City Council, the Garda, the Canals Communities Partnership, the drugs task force and so on.</p><p>  There is significant local authority housing in the canals area.  Community safety is a key issue for residents, as they do not feel safe in their communities.  The policing forum has come across a number of issues that can only be resolved through legislation.  The committee will be familiar with the contradiction between the European Court of Human Rights and the power of the District Court to deal effectively with cases of anti-social behaviour and we understand the Bill is trying to address that.  The concern of the communities is the time it will take.  Our understanding is the legislative process can take up to two years.  I have submitted figures on evictions.  We do not wish to see evictions but, in some cases, it is the last resort in pursuing anti-social behaviour.  Our concern is not that the issue is not being addressed but the time it will take to address it.</p><p>  It has also been suggested within the policing forum that a dedicated court is needed because the experience is court cases can take a long time and judges who are not familiar with the cases act on them and things get lost, especially the right of appeal.  The cases are appealed almost automatically.  We suggest that the committee considers a dedicated court to consider estate management matters perhaps once a month overseen by a judge who is familiar with the experiences of people living on local authority estates.</p><p>  We also recognise that people feel they know what is going on in their communities but nothing ever happens to those who are causing difficulties for whatever reason.  As well as using hard evidence, provision should be made for local knowledge or soft intelligence that people have about what is going on.</p><p>  Exclusion orders are an important tool in combatting anti-social behaviour.  They are usually for one year but can be applied for three years.  They are often made and the person could be in prison.  The order continues to run but the process has to start again.  We would like the committee to consider a proposal for the person to enter a bond whereby the exclusion order can be reimposed if the person acts out in the area from which he or she has been excluded.</p><p>  Another concrete difficulty that is experienced is somebody, for example, selling drugs or involved in serious anti-social behaviour away from his or her own dwelling.  This is a common experience where they move to another place.  The hands of Dublin City Council are tied in terms of calling these people in and making a provision against their tenancy because they are acting out like this.  We would like the committee to consider expanding the definition of the word "vicinity" to mean other areas generally where there is local authority housing.</p><p>  Local authority housing is increasingly being taken over by approved housing bodies and this needs to be streamlined so that, for example, if somebody from a local authority estate is acting out on a Cl&uacute;id housing estate, the local authority should be able to act and cannot just say, "They are up in Cl&uacute;id so we can't do anything about them". </p><p>  The committee might consider a reasonable probationary period for tenancies specifically related to anti-social behaviour.   There should be provision to act on serious anti-social behaviour such as drug dealing which usually shows up within the first year of a tenancy.</p><p>  I referred to the need to streamline the rules applying to local authority housing to approved housing bodies as well.  There is also concern that a plan to deal with anti-social behaviour originating in private housing on local authority housing estates where people own their own houses or in private rented accommodation needs to be devised and implemented.  The committee is overseeing the private residential tenancies Bill, which contains a provision for complaints to be made to the Private Residential Tenancies Board, but we are concerned about the power the board might have and the need to consider other actions to address the problem of anti-social behaviour emanating from privately-owned and privately-rented dwellings.</p><p>  A great deal of work in the canal communities area has gone into providing support for families.  Much of the anti-social behaviour is a result of the social inequality that exists and the fact that people are often in chaos and crisis.  In particular, where children are involved, there should be a provision to refer those cases to an inter-agency body.  We have at work a family welfare initiative and there are similar bodies around the country.  For those facing eviction or exclusion orders, supports should be available for the families.</p></speech>

Focus Ireland is one of the leading homeless and housing organisations in the country.  We are not just a homeless organisation; we are also an approved housing body.  We have more than 600 housing units across the country for families and single people.  We span a range of the concerns the committee is addressing.</p><p>  I will make a general comment on the heads of the Bill before moving on to the housing supply issue we have been asked to address.  The legislation is extremely important and I hope we will be able to engage in discussion as the legislation is drafted and proceeds through the D&aacute;il.  While we recognise there is a requirement to provide for evictions and amendments are needed to deal with the human rights issues and so on that are problematic in the current legislation, the heads as drafted at the moment are simply a mechanism to achieve an eviction and we strongly believe that is the next but worst outcome that could arise.</p> <p>Much more needs to be included in the legislation so the underlying problems which lead to the threat of eviction might be addressed, not as an outside issue which officials may bring into play in particular circumstances but as a clearly specified legal part of the process in which organisations which can help people sustain their tenancies should be engaged.  We and our colleagues in the Simon Community have prevention teams in the city which work with local authorities and both organisations have an extremely good record of intervening with families and households threatened with eviction and helping them deal with the problems which caused the threat in the first place to the satisfaction of the local authority and the neighbours, which is crucial.  This is missing entirely.  While we can understand how a community faced with families behaving in an antisocial way would wish simply to see the family moved elsewhere, as a society making families homeless is not a solution to any social problems we face and we need to closely examine what can be done to prevent it while the legislation goes through the D&aacute;il.</p><p> Moving to the question on more general housing supply, homelessness is a very complex issue with many causes, one of which at any given time has to do with a shortage of housing, but there are usually many other factors such as mental health, social behaviour and poverty.  At present the extent to which homelessness is caused simply as a housing supply issue is coming to the fore.  In our submission we identify one of the areas in which we particularly work is with homeless families.  In January 42 families in Dublin presented as homeless.  This is three times as many as there were 18 months ago when we started this work.  Of the 42 families, 40 had no previous experience of homelessness.  The cause of their homelessness was housing supply.  It was economics and not any social problem or issue.</p><p> The question of housing supply is central and it is a problem throughout society, including for relatively well-off people trying to achieve the home they wish.  We make no apology for stating the part of society for whom we speak, namely, those at the bottom for whom the choice is not between a better home and a less good home but between homelessness and any type of home, are those whom the D&aacute;il, Parliament and committee should prioritise in what they do.  We do not believe simple measures to create an aggregate increase in the amount of housing in a rising tide will lift all boats way will solve the problem for those at the bottom.  We need measures specifically designed to provide housing for people who cannot afford to provide it on their own in the free market.  We need it through subsidies to existing housing, ring-fencing housing and policies leading to the building of public, social and community housing of one form or another.</p><p> We lay out a number of short-term measures in our presentation, which all committee members have read.  A key element is our argument that rent supplement needs to be reviewed.  It was reviewed almost a year ago and the Department of Social Protection states the review will last for 18 months and it will not re-examine it until the end of this year.  According to the laws the Parliament has set down, landlords can review rent on an annual basis.  It is our belief the way in which the State responds to the needs of tenants should reflect the laws of the land and we should also review rent supplement on an annual basis.  This means we should examine it now with a view to revising the figures at the end of June.</p><p> We recognise that increasing rent supplement levels would have an impact on the cost to the State and there is a risk that rents will increase.  The argument for rent regulation and rent control has never been stronger.  The legislation we are discussing today which committee members will examine over a period of time where this argument can be progressed.  We should not wait several years to do it.  We should do it now.  We have put forward a number of ideas on rebalancing tax reliefs in the private rented sector so landlords would no longer be able to get rent relief for behaving in what we believe to be a blatantly discriminatory manner whereby they state they will not accept rent supplement tenants, while at the same time they receive tax relief on 75% of their income.  This should be rebalanced so there is a tax incentive for landlords to take people from the bottom of the pack who are in greatest difficulty.</p><p> These are short-term measures, which we need, but we will not be able to deal with this problem with short-term measures only.  We need to consider long-term measures also.  In particular we draw attention to the important issue of reforming and retaining Part V.  If a decision is taken to abolish it there would be little hope for providing sufficient social housing for our people.</p></speech>

I will also speak about housing and homelessness.  The Simon Community in Ireland is made up of a network of eight regionally-based independent local communities in Cork, Dublin, Dundalk, Galway, the midlands, the mid-west, the north west and south east.  All eight communities work collectively with our national policy office to conduct valuable research and inform and influence national policy.</p><p>  Our main concern about the general scheme of the Bill is that some aspects may impede the Government's target of ending long-term homelessness by 2016.  Every effort must be made to ensure evictions and exclusions for anti-social behaviour are the very last resort.  People must not end up in emergency hostels and accommodation or sleeping rough and proper processes must be put in place.</p><p>  The extension of the tenancy purchase scheme should not impact on the availability of social and affordable housing with almost 90,000 households on local authority waiting lists.  The transfer of rent supplement to a housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is very much welcomed but issues remain to be addressed, including maximum rent caps reflecting market prices, the acceptance of housing assistance payments by landlords and outstanding deposit guarantee issues.  In addition there is a need for a national scheme similar to the rent supplement initiative within the HAP scheme.  This would make provision to allow higher rent payments to be made under the HAP scheme nationally to secure accommodation for people who are homeless.</p><p>  The present homelessness situation has been described as a tsunami and desperate.  It is the worst most of us have seen during the duration of my career with the Simon Community.  Last night 70 people were sleeping rough in the area between Harcourt Street, Amiens Street and Jervis Street.  This is the highest number we have seen and it is at a time when the accommodation put in place for the cold weather initiative remains.  Last night up to 1,600 people shared emergency accommodation in the greater Dublin area.  As Focus Ireland well knows this includes many families.  The number of families experiencing homelessness has increased.</p><p>  Simon Communities are very supportive of the commitment to end long-term homelessness and the need to sleep rough by 2016 and the work of the homeless oversight group.  We firmly believe with sufficient resources and national direction this can be achieved.  The prolonged economic crisis means more people are at risk of homelessness.  More people are becoming homeless and more people are turning to the Simon Communities for support.  Last year we saw a large increase in the number of people we supported, as did other agencies.  We are doing everything possible to address the crisis.  We have increased our capacity and opened up new projects, sometimes with little or no funding from the Government and we had to rely on our own resources and donors.  We are developing new ways of providing housing with support for those who are homeless, such as the Cork rentals initiative with Focus Ireland and other organisations.  We are experimenting in a number of areas with shared accommodation.  Dublin Simon has increased the number of new and refurbished units available, which we bought and revamped ourselves.  Some of the revamps have been with the help of the State.  We now have more than 70 units which is a huge opportunity for us.</p><p>  We have housing shortages and rent increases and there is no end to it.  It is a conundrum and a bubble which keeps getting bigger.  People state it is exploding.  This morning on the radio I heard a discussion during which the unemployment rate next year was projected to be 10%.  If this is made up of people coming home to work in the construction industry we will have a real problem because the supply problem will increase.</p> <p>The construction of private and social housing is urgently needed.  This will require funding.  Finance is required for approved housing bodies.  Currently, only six housing bodies are approved by the Housing Finance Agency.  There are many more such bodies in existence.  NAMA must also deliver social housing.  However, to my mind despite the requirement for NAMA to deliver as time goes by it has fewer units of accommodation available for various reasons.  </p><p> As already suggested, the introduction of rent control in the private rental market is critical because rents are spiralling and will continue to increase because of demand and a shortage of housing.  Transfer of voids to approved housing bodies and NGOs is critical.  However, this, too, is not a bottomless pit.  In addition, some of these voids may be beyond use at this stage.  The establishment of a national social rental agency is a strong option, be that in the form of local authority groupings or otherwise.  There is only so much rental accommodation available and there must be controls around it.</p><p> As already stated the promotion and funding of early intervention and prevention is critical.  While the Minister of State has allocated additional funding for this purpose, unfortunately, that funding was taken from another space.  The intention is to provide additional focus in this area.  In terms of where urgent action is needed, we are expecting a miracle.  We are expecting the big ticket item to come out of the homeless oversight group and the homeless policy implementation team.  However, there has been similar expectation in the past.  My hope is that this time we will get what we expect.  Sustained funding from the Departments of the Environment, Community and Local Government and Social Protection and the HSE is critical for the next three years.  Unless Government is imaginative in terms of the steps needed to get this country back on its feet and to achieve a reduction in unemployment we are heading into a crisis.  </p><p> Members will note the many issues facing us which have been highlighted on the balloon I have drawn, including a housing shortage, housing quality issues owing to what is available, an increased risk of illness among long term homeless people, all of which is a draw on resources, a reduction in rent supplement despite that rents continue to increase, limited funding to assist those in mortgage arrears and increased unemployment.  Many of the people who have returned to live with their mothers and fathers will in future need to rent accommodation.  We are heading for a real problem and would like the assistance of the committee in solving it.</p></speech>

I meet every day with the people affected, some of whom I would never have expected to have to rent a home.  Some of these people are working and others are unfortunately unemployed.  The rent caps are a significant part of the problem in areas of high demand.  As a public representative, I have run out of things to say to people who come to my clinics about this issue.  There are no solutions at the moment.  As stated, there is a need for short, medium and long-term measures to address this problem.  There is also a need for Departments and agencies to work together in finding solutions.  This problem must be addressed on a multi-agency basis.  We must ensure we have homes that are acceptable as places for people to live.  There is little of this type of approach which would break a cycle in the context of anti-social behavioural problems.  There is a mountain of work to be done.</p><p>  Most of my dealings on this issue are with families with children.  Last week, I met with a parent who, with child, had slept the previous night in a car.  When I raised this matter with the local authority I was informed that this person should seek a relative who would allow them sleep on their couch because there was no hostel, B&amp;B or other accommodation available.  This problem must be acknowledged for what it is, namely, a crisis.  Up to now I have not had any dealings with the Simon Community in my area.  However, I now find myself in regular contact with it.  Some people think that because there are a couple of big industries located in north Kildare it is a well-to-do area.  However, homeless is very prevalent in areas where the local authority lists are lengthy.</p><p>  On proposed solutions, the rent caps set for many areas are way below the market rents, particularly in urban areas of high demand.  Last year, &euro;403 million was spent on rent supplement.  The more one takes out of people's pockets in rent the less there is for the economy.  We need to view rent caps from the broader economic perspective also.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses views on that issue.</p><p>  On the housing assistance payment, the heads of the Bill dealing with this issue were published recently.  I foresee two major issues arising in this regard.  First, some of the local authorities do not have the resources to deal with this, particularly those located in areas of high demand.  Are the witnesses concerned about this?  Second, I do not know of anybody in private rented accommodation in my area that is not paying a top-up.  In all of the cases concerned, these are illegal top-ups but people are forced to pay them or face homelessness.  Would the witnesses agree that this is an issue?  I would also welcome their views on whether people are obtaining accommodation at rent rates which are below the market rents.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.401" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="17:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014041500016#Q00600"><p>On top-ups, during research a year or so ago on the experience of people on rent supplement we found that a huge number of them were paying top-ups.  We also did another piece of research towards the end of last year which focused on families that had become homeless in Dublin, the vast majority of whom had previously lived in private rented accommodation, in respect of which they had been paying large top-ups which they later could not afford and got into debt with their landlords and ultimately lost their homes.</p><p>  When one raises this issue with the Department of Social Protection the response is that there is no evidence of this.  When we then ask if we sent to the Department a person who was engaged in paying top-ups and could prove this was happening the response is that they should move out of where they are living because that is against the rules.  One cannot present evidence of this because the Department of Social Protection will penalise the whistleblower.  In my view it is the only area of social welfare fraud in which the State is complicit in that it is the poor defrauding the poor.  That is a very controversial thing to say but people seem to be perfectly happy with the poor defrauding themselves and no resources are applied to put this right.  This leads to the issue of rent control.  Greater regulation in the area of the receipt of and control of rents would help to control the issue of top-ups.  Obviously, in introducing rent control one would have to ensure that making property available on the market remains attractive to landlords.</p> <p>That should be a given.  It is not simple to design such a system, but every other country in Europe, other than Britain, has managed it and there are many lessons we can learn from it.  The State has a policy of increasing the number of people who live in private rented accommodation but it has done insufficient work on putting policies in place to ensure that people can also have a home in the private rented sector as well as just an apartment.</p></speech>

It is impossible to find accommodation within rent caps.  It was a problem even before they were increased.  They were increased in some areas and reduced in other areas last June and it is still causing difficulty for people.  Another issue is that landlords are now advertising that they are not accepting rent supplement.  We have said in our statement that when rent supplement is transferred to HAP there must be something in place so landlords will accept people who are in receipt of HAP.  Top-ups cannot continue.  The limits must be set in accordance with the consumer price index and the rental index.</p></speech>

We are familiar with one county council in a county quite near to the city that is struggling even to secure funding for a homeless services worker.  We have provided that funding from our own pockets, so there is a concern regarding the roll-out of HAP nationally.  We have said in the submission that it is not just the question of the roll-out but also that the supports, infrastructure and resources are applicable as well for each local authority.</p></speech>

HAP is better than rent supplement if we can fix the issues, but we must work at it as soon as possible.</p></speech>

So far, we have a family welfare initiative in the Rialto area and another one in the general Bluebell-St. Michael's area and they have been working quite well.</p></speech>

It is a pity we must welcome homeless agencies at all, but it is a fact of life.  It is sad in this day and age to see the figures for last night, with 74 people sleeping rough, particularly when one constantly hears about vacant properties.  It is a pity we cannot match social housing need and vacant properties.</p><p>  The witness spoke about the dedicated court system.  Obviously, that would speed up the process to ensure community safety.  In my 20 years on a local authority the issue of community safety and anti-social behaviour arose regularly.  There is always a root cause of anti-social behaviour.  It is not just the person being anti-social for the sake of it.  The witness spoke about supports.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs has recognised this with the establishment of the Child and Family Agency.  It is the first time there has been such a dedicated agency and a Minister for Children and Youth Affairs.  Steps have been taken in that regard but a great deal more must be done.  It is better to stop the horse before it bolts, as it were, with the problems.  What initiative could be taken there that is not being taken at present?  What would the witness recommend?</p><p>  With regard to Focus Ireland and intervention teams, that is an issue that should be addressed in the Bill.  It should be included there.  I will see if there is a reason it cannot be included or if it could be included in another Bill if it is not in this one.  Deputy Murphy addressed the issue of landlords and the top-ups that are taking place.  The entire issue of supply, demand and the market must be addressed.  It is very difficult when there is limited supply.  Somebody mentioned a big ticket item.  What is the item they would recommend?  If one can only do so much, where does one start?  It is a huge problem and there are so many items, but what do the witnesses consider to be the priority or most important? </p><p>  Somebody mentioned the establishment of a national social housing agency.  There are many agencies and representatives of a number of agencies have appeared before the committee today.  Could they not all be brought together?  There must be co-ordination but is the establishment of another agency the way to go?  Personally, I doubt that it is.  I hate too many agencies because one gets lost when finding out what each one ultimately does.</p><p>  The witnesses have welcomed the housing assistance payment, HAP.  Hopefully, it will work a great deal better now when it is co-ordinated under the local authorities than was the case in the past.</p></speech>

We have many services that focus on families particularly in terms of intervention.  The big thing for us is when one makes the intervention, particularly with regard to young children who are involved in serious anti-social behaviour.  The people involved in the distribution and supply of drugs in our communities generally do not cause a major nuisance, it is the young children they have running for them.  It is extremely difficult to get them into the system, because they are not seen as being highly problematic.  Some of these children are now attending school.  They are still in school so they would not be deemed to be a high risk category but the reality is that they are on that train.  For me it is about early intervention, but an early intervention that deals not just with the child but also with the family and the community.  That would be the big thing for me.  It is early intervention and not waiting for somebody to go so far as into the criminal justice system.  That is a big challenge for the new agency, particularly with the limited resources available at present.</p></speech>

The report that is being launched in the next couple of weeks indicates that those children who attend preschool benefit, but one of the biggest indicators for children not progressing is where there is a concentration of poverty and social disadvantage and there are continuous problems of anti-social behaviour and criminality.

Using the metaphor of preventing the horse from bolting leads one to look at the issue of prevention.  Much of the work we are doing with people involves finding them a home.  The people who are not yet homeless already have a home.  If we could do more to keep people in the homes they have, it would allow us to focus more of the resources on the other people.  We have included a number of things in our submission in that regard.</p><p>  To elaborate a little further, there is no process either in the private sector or in local authority sector for when a process of eviction is begun.  Nobody needs to be informed.</p> <p>Even though a person has become homeless the first time that homeless services need to be informed is when he or she is homeless.  By that stage it is too late for prevention and dealing with the issues.  We have looked at the Scottish system but there are other systems in a number of jurisdictions where informing the authorities is part of the eviction process.  This is done not to prevent an eviction but to allow other institutions to intervene in a timely manner and see whether something can be done to remove the underlying cause for the eviction.  We strongly argue for such a system and for a much better use of the teams referred to by the Senator that Focus Irland and Simon have, and maybe others have, who already work with local authorities and can prevent evictions.  There are safeguards in place which are not sufficiently used or integrated into the system</p><p> With regards a national agency, it is probably not a good thing to include "national" or "social" in a name.  Such places tend not to have a good history anywhere in the world.  </p></speech>

Recently rationalisation took place which means town councils are no longer involved.  More than 300 approved housing bodies also exist.  Having a national body does not mean there should be another agency or player.  There must be some way in which the combined efforts of all of the many players are made more effective.  One of the biggest problems faced by approved housing bodies and local authorities when delivering social housing is the scale needed to get the system going.  I refer to private funding, credit rating and so on.  Bringing that work together in some form of a national housing agency is a very positive idea and needs to be explored further.  I refer to a way of reducing the number of agencies, not to add another one.  </p></speech>

I agree with everything that Mr. Allen has said about intervention.  Early intervention is critical because it can save time and money and keep people in their homes.</p><p>  With regard to the agency piece, there are too many of us desperately searching for rental accommodation.  An agency would be much more effective.  I do not mind if Savills or some other commercial body does the work because it can give example.</p><p>  The big ticket for me is to somehow push back on the State and Government in terms of believing in themselves, believing in what they have done, and believing in the future and having hope.  We need to invest in people.  It is not as if there are no funds in certain coffers to be availed of.  On the one hand, we have the current expenditure but that is being nailed.  On the other hand, we must have development money to get new industry and business and spread the food industry.  Where is the money for developing homes?  Housing is a real issue.  I am sure that we have a number of billions of euro in the NTMA or is part of the pension fund.  Half a billion of that money could be taken out like what was done in Finland.  When Finland had a housing crisis they said: "Okay, this is how we use it."  If that money was given to the Minister of State responsible for housing it would remove an awful lot of pressure on her.  Plus, we would all be delighted to work around her and help her spend the money.</p></speech>

In the previous session we talked about the crisis and in this session we have talked about the crisis bordering on a disaster, particularly the statistics on families from Focus Ireland and the image that last night, between Jervis Street, Amiens Street and Harcourt Street, in excess of 70 people slept rough.  That situation is a terrible indictment of society and an extraordinary statistic of which to make sense.</p><p>  I have a question for Focus Ireland and the Simon community and apologise for not directing a question at the third delegation.  Focus Ireland and Simon are aware of the Homelessness Oversight Group which made a recommendation at the end of last year.  Is it feasible to believe that homelessness will be ended by 2016 which is just two years away?   </p><p>  The oversight group's main recommendation is to have a single unit established with responsibilities.  In other words, it wants one group to adopt a multi-agency approach.  I would like to hear the views of both organisations on the matter.</p><p>  Early intervention and prevention is a big ticket item.  Is the next big ticket item rent control?  Is that the elephant in the room?  Should the Government, without apology, introduce rent control?  Mr. Allen of Focus Ireland made a statement on the matter and I ask him to elaborate further.  Does he think rent control can be included in legislation?  I ask the same question of the Simon Community.  </p><p>  I have a final question for both organisations.  Perhaps my other colleagues share my view about the awful image given by Mr. Allen about the poor defrauding the poor.  For the sake of the record, I ask him to elaborate on the matter for people like myself, public representatives who do not have a constituency office.  I ask him to elaborate so that we can visualise what he meant by his phrase.  </p></speech>

That means nobody should be homeless for longer than six months which seems a hard target to reach considering the circumstances that we have talked about.  In theory, one could have the same number of homeless people but make sure that they are moved on within that period.  That would not be everything we would wish to achieve but it would still be better than having people homeless for very long periods.</p><p>  The Homeless Oversight Group was not sceptical but said the target is not going to be achieved unless a whole range of other things are done.   </p></speech>

Homelessness is a multi-factoral issue and one of the things that the group asked for is a central unit that can say to various groups - whether that is the HSE, the Department of Social Protection, etc. - the following: "Hold on a minute.  This is a Government target.  We know that you have got other concerns over here but pay attention to this issue because it is a national and Government target that must be delivered."  We believe that it is crucial to have a centralised command unit.  Focus Ireland, like all of its colleagues in the homeless sector, is committed to doing everything within its power to achieve the 2016 target but whether the conditions for succeeding will be created by the rest of the actors in the sector is beyond our control.</p><p>  My comment "the poor defrauding the poor" is a controversial image and some of my colleagues do not like me using the term.  I meant that people are defrauding themselves.  For example, people on very low incomes break a rule by topping up their rent by taking money that they are supposed to spend on food - and legislation says that it should be spent on food and other living needs - because they need to keep a roof over their head.  That is a breach of their conditions for rent supplement and could result in them losing their tenancy but their alternative is a loss of tenancy.  We have a good rule that it is right in the heart of our anti-poverty legislation which says one cannot pay so much rent that it will leave a person with insufficient resources to provide for the needs of that person and his or her family.  Every elected representative in this House knows that people are doing exactly that and it is widespread throughout the system yet no action has been taken to address the matter.</p><p>  I am not sure if rent control is the elephant in the room.  We are trying to name it.  The nature of the argument is that one does not name it so let us name it as central to the matter.  There are a number of ways one needs to go about rent control.  At the moment rents fluctuate simply due to supply and demand and landlords, tenants and the State are extremely vulnerable to changes in rents.  We must move to a system of rents being more based on the cost of providing accommodation rather than current market rents.  </p></speech>

In the current situation, rent control is needed for everyone trying to get into any premises, not just homeless people.  I do know how close people in this room are to it but people looking for an apartment are queueing outside and are being gazumped.  We used to talk about being gazumped for buying a house but now they are being gazumped for getting a flat.  The shortage is dire.  We also made a submission about quality.  There could be a BER mark for quality.  With regard to income tax relief, the withdrawal of the measure was a shame because it put control on the market.  Now, there are no controls.</p><p>  With regard to the homeless oversight group, Mr. Mike Allen, myself and Focus Ireland must believe this is manageable; otherwise, we could not go to work every day.  We work in a very sad state of affairs and the most unfortunate people are getting more unfortunate as things improve.  Everything is falling on top of them and the situation is getting more dire.  Last night, there were 1,600 people and their family members in emergency accommodation.  That is fixable.  The combined group could come up with a robust, Government-supported action plan and we could get somewhere.  There are two and a half years to go and much could be done.  All of us are walking in the same direction.  People with large titles are on the oversight group and if they can come up with a plan and influence local authorities, a lot could happen.  However, it will take funding and the funding must come from the side of the balance sheet that we put aside for investment.  Unless we invest in our beliefs, we will not get there.</p></speech>

With regard to the homeless figures for last night, is there any evidence on the number of people coming out of the rural Ireland into the city?  I make it my business to stop and talk to the homeless people around this building every day.  Most of them are from rural Ireland.  I am curious as to whether the groups have any information on that.</p><p>  With regard to antisocial behaviour, I spent 27 years on a local authority.  One of the problems in recent years has been those who are in private accommodation within local authority estates or the mix of the rental accommodation scheme, long-term leasing and local authorities being in the same estates.  How will the legislation cut through this and deal with people equally?  The options were outlined in respect of taking this through the various stages.  At the end of the line, people who have refused to abide by any rule of law and intervention end up back in rented accommodation paid for by the State.  What should we do in that situation?  Should we accept it?</p><p>  Mr. Mike Allen mentioned rent control and rent regulation in his submission.  It has gone from south to north.  People were pleading with local authorities to take buy-to-let property through long-term leasing when they had 20 properties.  Now, they are trying to get out of the agreements because they are stuck on a certain figure.  How will rent regulation happen?  Will it happen at the level of local authorities or will there be an overarching system?  Colleagues in Dublin talk about astronomical rent levels that, by virtue of demand, do not compare with what I experience in Tipperary.  I do not see rent regulation happening at a national level.  It must be broken down.</p></speech>

With regard to private accommodation, there is public housing, approved housing bodies and private accommodation and some cases in between where people on local authority estates are being helped to buy their houses.  The question of vicinity is important.  It is very much an issue outside Dublin as well as in Dublin.  If there is a local authority estate where someone has purchased a house or is renting it privately and is engaged in serious antisocial behaviour involving criminality through the drug trade, the local authority says there is nothing it can do as a sanction.  If local authorities take responsibility and say they have a duty to protect their tenants who live within the estate, the question of vicinity is important.  If a person is in private accommodation but dealing drugs around the estate, the local authority can say that it must protect its tenants.</p></speech>

It is a crucial issue.  The Residential Tenancies Act refers to antisocial behaviour coming under the remit of the board.  We discussed this in the policing forum and thought it might help.  It depends in what capacity the tenancies board can respond to those questions.</p><p>  The second question concerned early intervention and supporting people facing eviction.  I agree that once eviction becomes a possibility, support should be mobilised straightaway.  There is a sense that we cannot intervene and change people but in many cases nothing is tried or it is very haphazard.  In many cases, intervention would make a difference.  From our experience, the drug trade is the organising principle around much of this.  Even if young people are not directly involved in drug dealing, the atmosphere created on an estate where this happening leads to all kinds of chaos.  It is important to recognise that, where there is a drug dealer seen by everyone to be living the good life who seems to be untouchable even if not dealing drugs directly, it feeds into the aspirations of young people on the estate and leads to a particular culture.</p><p>  There are two kinds of hard cases.  There is a person who is so chaotic that all kinds of intervention will not help.  There may be a need for specialised housing for folks like that.  People may be on their own and chronic alcoholics and causing problems for their neighbours.  Their place becomes somewhere where people can deal drugs.  They need supported housing that can help them because they will not change easily.</p></speech>

With the regeneration of Fatima Mansions, the incentive was for people to move into new houses.  Mr. Peter Dorman referred to the recent Donegan case.  There is an air that people are untouchable and that there is no sanction for bad behaviour.  In the new Act, there must be some sanction.  No one wants to see people and families evicted but the simple reality is that six or seven families cause trouble on an intergenerational basis in our community.</p> <p>There is a need for new and innovative ideas in response, otherwise they are destroying entire communities.  There is a responsibility on the homeless.  It is easy to find somebody a house but suddenly he or she disappears.  I do not think there is enough follow-up.  There are cases in our community where people have been placed in the service and, perhaps because of lack of resources, disappear and the cycle returns.  There is a need for intensive intervention.  </p></speech>

In terms of early intervention a couple of initiatives are run very successfully in Inchicore, having been piloted in St. Michael's Estate.  Bringing it all Back Home is one initiative that has been very successful.  The Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, has more on it.  Another is the family welfare initiative.  Both initiatives are early intervention and preventative programmes.  Obviously eviction will be necessary in some extreme cases.  If we get in at the early intervention stage and try to break that generational cycle, relationships between and within families can be improved and that can lay foundations for a better sustainable community in the long term.</p><p>  On the issue of the supply of housing, anything that can be done to increase the void turnover rates in local authority and the approved bodies housing stock would be welcome.  In addition to providing an increased supply of rental accommodation, it would act to stabilise the communities within which those units are based.  If a community has 20% vacant or void units, that can act to destabilise the community and it is aesthetically displeasing.  It can add to the whole environment of a difficult community.</p></speech>

I would agree with the Senator that there is not a need.  However, there is a huge need for the existing agencies to work much closer together and to be encouraged and, sometimes, directed to work closely together around an identified issue, such as homelessness and problem tenancies, which are related.  There should be a direction on the particular departments to work closely together until something is done with it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.444" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Mike Allen" time="17:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ENJ2014041500020#U00600"><p>I wish to pick up on the points made by colleagues in Community Action Network, which were extremely valuable.  Many of the problems we are talking about, anti-social behaviour and so on, essentially arise from our problems with drug abuse, the drug trade and criminality.  Currently, in terms of the legislation before the committee, one is trying to address those problems with an eviction policy.  While an eviction policy might be part of it, as Mr. Peter Dorman said we also need a housing policy.  An eviction policy is not a housing policy; it is part of it.  A much more sophisticated housing policy and a whole range of other services and supports, both criminal justice supports and community supports that communities need, are required.  It is not possible to deal with a problem so complex simply by having an eviction policy.  The current legislation attempts to do that and I think it will become badly unstuck.  The homeless services will fill up with people with whom we are not able to deal because the system is already unable to deal with them.</p><p>  Senator Denis Landy asked about rent control.  Clearly, we should not think the answer is simply a guy in a suit somewhere deciding what the rent should be across the country and that everybody will have to stick to that.  Clearly that would not work.  There is already rent regulation right across the private rented sector in Ireland.  One is not allowed to change the rent more than once a year and one is allowed to change it only in line with the market.  That allows for the fact that it will probably be more expensive to rent in Dublin than in Tipperary and elsewhere to be reflected.  We could look to what extent we identify that.  We could say that it cannot be changed more than once a year and that one is not allowed to vary it by X amount.  Additional controls could be inserted as to when the landlord wishes to move it to change the rent.  There are limitations as to how they can do that and over what what time period and with the reasons they might do it.  Landlords have already gone through a huge collapse in rent levels in various parts of the country.  Given how the housing market works, this will work both ways.  The people who want to invest in housing want to know the bottom will not fall out of the rental market from time to time, rendering them unable to pay their mortgage and, equally, people who want to live in rented accommodation want to know that the rent will not suddenly sky rocket and make them unable to stay there.  Some form of moderation, through regulation, not formally rent setting in an old-fashioned sort of way, is the way to go.  We recognise this is a sophisticated question and we would need some elaboration to get a system that would work.     </p></speech>

Local authorities would prefer if people sought their benefits from wherever those benefits were sourced.  It may be the case that many are eligible to collect their benefits in Dublin but in most cases they would be connected with wherever that local authority is.  The difficulty is that in many cases there is not a place to bring them in to work on those issues, because there is not the accommodation.  The number of sleeping bags handed out per week could be up to 200.  There is a huge conundrum of stuff.  People will say there are some people who could collect a sleeping bag every night and God knows what they are doing with it.  The situation on the street and the situation in emergency accommodation is at more than capacity.  Unless something happens, we cannot deal with the capacity issue without having a medium and long-term plan.</p></speech>

While Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the communication from the European Commission addressing the consequences of disenfranchising European citizens, our position on voting rights for Irish citizens living outside the State predates this communication and extends beyond EU member states, because it is based on the principle of equal citizenship.  The current legislative disenfranchisement of citizens residing outside this State produces an unequal and two-tier citizenship.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports full voting rights for all Irish citizens of voting age in presidential elections, regardless of their place of residence.  This would give effect to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, as amended by the Good Friday Agreement.  Emigrant citizens are effectively disenfranchised immediately on their departure and dual citizens living in the North cannot exercise their constitutional right to vote.</p><p>  Currently an anomaly exists whereby Irish citizens living outside the State may stand for the Presidency and serve as President if elected but they may not vote for presidential candidates.  For this reason we support the introduction of an express constitutional guarantee of a right to vote in presidential elections for all Irish citizens of voting age.  While the method by which this right is exercised is a matter for ordinary legislation rather the Constitution, care should be taken to ensure that Northern Unionists may also exercise this right should they so choose, without requiring them to compromise their identity or ethos.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed the Constitutional Convention's report on voting rights in presidential elections for Irish citizens living outside the State.  Seventy-eight percent of delegates to the convention were in favour of extending voting rights.  We also note, however, that the four-month deadline within which the Government was expected to respond has now passed.  We urge the Taoiseach to arrange a debate in the D&aacute;il on the matter and ask that such a debate be extended to include consideration of Oireachtas representation for Irish citizens living outside the State.</p><p>  With regard to voting rights for the Oireachtas, Sinn F&eacute;in's position is twofold.  In respect of diaspora representation, we regard the diaspora as fundamental to the Irish nation both historically and today.  If we can ask our emigrant citizens and people of Irish ancestry to support Ireland financially and in the peace process, and to otherwise maintain and promote our cultural heritage abroad, it is not unreasonable to offer those passport holders who care enough to register and vote a limited form of representation in the Oireachtas.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that such representation should take the form of a reserved constituency, which would neutralise any concerns people may have about swamping of electoral results by our large diaspora population.  This would require an amendment to Article 16 of the Constitution.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not support time limits on diaspora voting, and would instead require citizens in the diaspora to regularly register their intention to vote.</p><p>  In regard to Irish citizens living in the North, we recognise that the Oireachtas is not the Parliament of a united Ireland, but Northern citizens are nevertheless affected directly and indirectly by many of the decisions and laws made by the Oireachtas.  For this reason, Northern citizens should have the right to appropriate representation in the Legislature as a form of equal treatment for their identity, ethos and aspirations, which is guaranteed by the Irish Government under the Good Friday Agreement.  We propose that democratically elected MPs for Northern constituencies be accorded automatic membership of the D&aacute;il, where they could exercise full rights of representation on matters they consider relevant to their constituents, subject to reasonable parameters appropriate to their non-residence in this State as set out in legislation.  MPs who choose not to take their seats should nevertheless be afforded attendance and speaking rights on matters of direct concern to their home constituencies.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's position on the Seanad is that the diaspora and Northern citizens should be represented in a reformed Seanad that is fully inclusive, representative and accountable.  We see this as taking the form of specified diaspora and Northern representation.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the extension of voting rights to Irish citizens living outside the State.  We are obliged to extend voting rights not only under our EU obligations but also under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The public will to make such a change has been demonstrated in numerous polls and in the Constitutional Convention.  What is now required is the political will to make the change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.460" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041500003#B00300"><p>I wish to make it clear before I begin that while I was nominated by the Technical Group I do not necessarily represent the views of its members by virtue of its composition.</p><p>  More than 120 of the 196 nations in the world have enfranchised their citizens who live abroad.  Many of the nations which deny the vote are either military dictatorships or given to elections that are neither fair nor free.  Ireland falls into neither category, yet it remains one of only three EU member states to completely deny emigrants the basic democratic and civil right to vote.  It is estimated that up to 500,000 Irish people who left the country as a result of our economic problems are disenfranchised.  In the past two years alone, more than one quarter of the population have been affected by the emigration of a close family member.  Without the right to elect a national representative, either at home or elsewhere in the world, these new emigrants are denied meaningful access to our democratic process.  Up to 500,000 Irish people, by being denied the right to vote in D&aacute;il elections, are effectively denied their right to free movement.  Concern has repeatedly been expressed at EU level that such a practice risks turning our emigrants into second-class citizens.  Not only will many feel let down because they were forced to leave what they regard as a bankrupt country and a political system that failed them, but they are also denied any involvement in a future political system.</p><p>  Internationally, there has been an accelerating trend towards allowing overseas citizens to vote, even among countries with particularly high levels of emigration.  We live in an interconnected and globalised society where, with the development of social media, Irish emigrants are in touch with home on a daily basis.  It is unjust and a further insult to the people who had to emigrate from this country for economic reasons that they are now denied a say in the political process.</p><p>  The Constitutional Convention took a small step in the right direction when it recommended the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens outside the State.  We now need to follow the example of our European counterparts and allow our citizens, wherever they may reside, the right to parliamentary representation.  Given that voters living in this country are not asked to pass a current affairs examination, the argument that people living abroad do not have sufficient links with their home country and are not interested in politics simply does not hold up.  If they are that disinterested, they will not vote anyway.  Studies in other countries that allow their emigrants to vote show that emigrants do not generally vote in a way that is radically different from those at home.  Surely the option should available for them.</p><p>  It has been estimated that Ireland has the largest diaspora in the world relative to its domestic population.  The number of Irish passport holders living in Northern Ireland and overseas equates to about 36% of all those who are entitled to be Irish citizens.</p> <p> The number of Irish passport holders living in Northern Ireland and overseas equates to approximately 36% of all of those entitled to be Irish citizens.  The point has been made repeatedly that given the volume of the diaspora, the process of opening up the voting system to emigrants would be complicated and overwhelming.  However, other nations have come up with a range of solutions to these challenges.  Some countries disallow voting after a certain period of time.  For example, the United Kingdom limits the vote to the first 15 years of living abroad.  France reserves seats in Parliament for representatives elected specifically to represent those living abroad.  There is a diverse range of solutions to every argument against allowing our emigrants to vote, but it is crucial that we find some way of giving recognition to the Irish abroad.  If one speaks to many of those living abroad, one will find their opinion is that in order to have a say, they should have a vote in the democratic process here.</p><p> Last year, the National Youth Council of Ireland published the results of a qualitative study on the experience and impact of emigration on Ireland's youth.  The majority who took part in the study said they intended to return to Ireland after a period of time, provided they could get a job.  This emigrant voice is an integral part of Ireland's future and it must continue to be heard in the political life of the country.  These people contribute too much to be denied a voice.  They deserve more than The Gathering.  They deserve to have their say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.462" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="15:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041500004#C00200"><p>I will outline the Fianna F&aacute;il position on this matter.  We believe Irish citizens abroad should have a say in the political life of Ireland.  We support voting rights for Irish citizens abroad for presidential elections and believe that these citizens and our diaspora should be represented in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  With regard to Irish citizens who reside in the European Union, we believe we must find some way to ensure the rights derived from their citizenship - not just of Ireland but of the European Union - are respected.  The European Commission proposal to make it easier for Irish citizens within the Union to retain their voting rights in Irish elections is a welcome development.  However, the implementation of this proposal must be examined carefully before any rash decisions are taken merely in order to meet the concerns expressed by the Commission.</p><p>  It must be acknowledged that Ireland is unusual in our increasingly globalised world in not allowing the majority of its overseas citizens any say in the political process.  Members of the armed forces and the diplomatic services are able to vote in D&aacute;il elections, while only NUI and Trinity College graduates can vote in Seanad elections.  Beyond these exceptions, only those who are ordinarily resident in Ireland may vote.  We believe it is vital for democracy that Irish citizens who are entitled to vote in our elections can vote.  If people engage in the most important act of our democratic tradition, that of voting, this will enhance our democracy by consolidating the legitimacy of our parliamentary democracy.</p><p>  The Council of Europe's report on Europeans living abroad advocates a broader sense of citizenship and nationality that embraces rights and responsibilities beyond a simple set of national feelings.  Writing citizenship into the voting system rather than tying it to geography gives a deeper sense of what it means to come from a particular country.  These citizen studies show that those living abroad do not vote radically differently from citizens based in their country of origin.  Currently, approximately 115 countries and territories, including almost all developed nations, have systems in place to allow their citizens abroad to vote.  This number is growing.</p><p>  Even countries with high numbers of citizens abroad, such as Italy, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, have recently allowed their expatriates to vote.  If we look at those countries and examine the systems they have invoked, we can learn from them.  If Ireland is to embrace its citizens abroad, we must look at the logistics of how our voting system can be made work to embrace the opinions of these citizens.  Sixty-five of the countries mentioned allow for external voting for everyone, while approximately 25 place restrictions on voting based on factors such as whether the person intends to return permanently or how long he or she has been away.  As committee members know, citizens of the US can vote no matter how long they stay away, while citizens of Britain are disqualified after 15 years.  Some countries, like France, reserve seats in their parliaments for citizens who live abroad, while others vote in the constituencies in which they used to live.  Last week, we heard from European colleagues in regard to the methods they employ to connect the diaspora to the specific places for which they will vote.  Other countries only allow for votes in national or presidential elections.</p><p>  On the issue of a form, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the idea of having a permanent, independent electoral commission which would be in charge of running all elections and referendums.  I would like to see the Government set up this kind of commission immediately.  The electoral system can be significantly improved and, as politicians, we must embrace change in this regard.  With few exceptions, polling is carried out in the same manner today as it was 90 years ago.  Much has changed in those 90 years and our voting procedures should change also.  We should not be afraid to embrace new ways of doing things in this regard, if that results in greater participation and an enhanced democratic process.  </p><p>  Voting procedures are not the primary reason turnout in our elections is lower than in other countries, but voting should certainly be made more accessible.  Fianna F&aacute;il has made a number of proposals in this regard in its policy document, Real Political Reform.  These proposals include ideas such as a review of Article 16.4.1&deg; of the Constitution, which contains the requirement for polling to be, as far as practical, on one day.  This should be amended to allow for a more flexible approach.  We would support a standard polling procedure as found in some parts of Europe, where polls are open on Friday and Saturday.  Counting could then take place on Sundays.  The predominant model of voting should remain voting in person, but greater flexibility should be allowed for casting a ballot in advance or through our embassies abroad.  There is already provision for this for citizens who live on our islands.  This provision could be expanded to include our embassy network, in order to allow Irish citizens abroad to vote.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il agrees with the European Commission recommendations that in instances in which member states' policies limit the rights of nationals to vote in national elections based exclusively on a residence condition, member states should enable their nationals who make use of their right to free movement and residence within the European Union to demonstrate a continuing interest in the political life in the member state of which they are nationals, including through an application to remain registered on the electoral roll, and by doing so to retain their right to vote.  We believe this recommendation could be facilitated through our embassy network within the European Union.  It would also ensure that Irish citizens living and working outside Ireland but within the European Union would register with the local embassy.  The register should be required to be updated on an annual basis.  Citizens seeking to vote from abroad should be obliged to select the constituency to which they have the closest connection.  This is important to prevent fraud and would act as a control measure.  Nonetheless, Fianna F&aacute;il accepts that all relevant applications could be submitted electronically.  We also accept the European Commission's fourth recommendation, that member states inform citizens abroad by appropriate means and in a timely manner about the conditions and practical arrangements for retaining their right to vote in national elections.  Again, this would have to be facilitated through our embassy and consular network.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is broadly supportive of the recommendations outlined by the European Commission and hopes the Government will use this opportunity to implement a reform of our electoral system which will broaden participation, establish an independent electoral commission and, for the first time, grant substantial voting rights to all our citizens within the European Union, and consider extending this right to citizens further afield.</p></speech>

I welcome those who have made presentations.</p><p>  Deputy Dooley touched on the concept of "abroad" and I noticed in Ms Boylan's presentation a different focus in regard to the North.  Deputy Dooley mentioned Irish citizens living within the European Union, which one might consider to be less "abroad" than other parts of the world.  Do the witnesses believe there should be a difference between how Irish citizens within Northern Ireland or the European Union are considered and those in the rest of the world?  Could this be a stepping stone to getting the vote for Irish citizens abroad?</p><p>  What is the witnesses' view on European Union citizens in any European country, including Ireland, voting in our national elections?</p> <p>Those of us canvassing in the local elections meet people who have EU passports but cannot vote here.  What is good for the goose, etc.  Deputy Dooley may have included the point about the difference between citizen and diaspora but I may have misheard it.  A fourth or fifth generation Irish person may have another passport.  Is it proposed that anyone with any links to Ireland should have a right to vote?  I believe that was the Spanish position.  Given that we have the largest diaspora in the world is the right it confined to passport holders?  Ms Boylan mentioned the registration process which possibly answers that question.</p></speech>

In respect of dual citizenship is it presumed that all Irish citizens abroad, in Europe, the US, Australia or wherever, would have the right to vote whether they had an Irish passport or not?  The three witnesses might clarify that.  If they do not have the right to vote how would the witnesses determine who should and should not vote?  These people would retain their rights to vote in their adoptive countries.  How would that be affected by membership of the EU?  Within the EU the presumption is that they would have the right to vote in the country in which they reside and in this country.</p><p>  Ms Boylan referred to politicians from Northern Ireland having the right to participate in these Houses.  How would that affect groups who might decide to abstain?  Given that we are trying to give representation to a broader spectrum of Irish people would their abstention diminish their influence?</p><p>  The embassy voting system proposal is quite good.  It is normal that we would expect that the embassies could be used for voting abroad.  I would have serious reservations about changing the method of voting based on our previous experience.  A move in that direction would not necessarily be of any great benefit to the diaspora or us.  I strongly urge that we avoid moving in that direction notwithstanding advances in technology and the need to modernise.  The basic elements of democracy are well founded and historically tested.  That they are old, or in some cases, old-fashioned, does not mean that they are out of date or no longer valid.</p></speech>

It is good from a number of perspectives that members of our diaspora would have the right to vote.  I also agree with using the embassies.  That makes sense.  Electronic registration should be allowed, to enable people to indicate their interest.  How far would we go down the generations?  We would have to go to the first generation to have left the country.  I think we would have to stop at that generation, albeit subsequent generations claim their Irishness.</p></speech>

It becomes messy.  It is difficult to administer and where is the cut-off?  Could a third-generation person, who has a very romanticised and distant concept of the homeland, vote and influence the outcome of elections here?  I think not.  I would stop at the first generation but I will be interested in the panel's response to that question and to how it will be administered.</p></speech>

The broader diaspora there is between 3 and 4 million.  We do not know the figures for Scotland.  Across the world the diaspora is probably between 40 and 60 million people.</p><p>  In order for this committee to make a serious recommendation to the Parliament will each of the witnesses define his or her party's position on what constitutes citizenship?  We will have to prepare a report that is very specific and need to know who we are talking about.  Who does each party argue has the right to vote?  How do they define citizenship?  While the embassies could be used in Europe because there is, I think, one in each of the 28 member states it is more complicated for the diaspora who are scattered.  It is well documented that we are very poorly represented by embassies and consulates in other countries, such as Denmark.  How do we, on the one hand, enfranchise a diaspora that we deem Irish on the basis of citizenship but on the other hand, have a large diaspora whom the process cannot encompass?  Do we then create a two-tier citizenship or are the benefits of citizenship to be unfairly distributed?  It is not difficult in Europe and America where there are great numbers of Irish people but there are many also scattered throughout isolated parts of Africa.  One finds Irish people all over the world.  How do the witnesses define citizenship in order to allocate voting rights?</p> <p>Do any of the witnesses agree that while the convention has looked at presidential elections - many speakers referred to it - it is really a cop-out with regard to what the European Commission said?  The Commission is not talking about presidential elections; it is talking about general elections or national elections.</p></speech>

First, what is most important to establish is whether we agree with the idea and if it is a good idea.  We should really start the conversation from there, not by saying why we cannot do something.  We can all come up with obstacles, some of which have been mentioned previously.  Fraud is one issue.  Logistics is another issue to which everyone refers.  Concern has been expressed to the effect that the vote might influence the Government in this country.  I invite comments in that regard.  I accept that reference was made to it in some contributions.</p><p>  Reference was made to the Irish in Britain.  A quote from President Michael D. Higgins suggests that the Irishness now emerging will be informed by the experience of the Irish abroad.  That is the type of inclusive language we need to use in the debate.  One probably does have to put up barriers in terms of where one starts, but do the witnesses agree that first we must try to include the diaspora?  It could be a starting point.  Ultimately, we might confine it to passport holders, or it might depend on how long a person has lived abroad.  We can discuss the detail later.</p><p>  The witnesses stated that 78% of delegates at the Constitutional Convention were in favour of giving votes to the diaspora.  Opinion polls all point in the same direction.  We are not just out of step with the rest of the world in terms of how countries give their diaspora a vote, but it appears we are also out of step with the feelings of Irish people.  Reference was made to the Good Friday Agreement and to people in the North.  Is it the impression of the witnesses that such an approach was envisaged in the Agreement - that people would be brought into this House and that it would not be a cold place for Northern Nationalists or Unionists?  The situation has not developed that way.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  We were to involve people in discussions.  It is important that that element of the Agreement is also developed.</p><p>  People say they are Irish when they leave, but when does one lose one&rsquo;s Irishness?  Is it right that one would lose one&rsquo;s Irishness after six months, 12 months, 20 years or 100 years &ndash; whatever length of time one is out of the country?  One could even narrow the confines in terms of who would be allowed to vote.  Do the witnesses accept that if we could tap into the 70 million people who consider themselves to have an Irish background, it would be a good thing for this country?  We are great at asking people for money and remittances.  I refer to The Gathering, for example.  However, do the witnesses agree that the potential of those people is also an issue to be considered in the debate?</p></speech>

We are talking about two criteria.  One is citizenship, which is based on nationhood &ndash; in reality, a 19th century principle that precedes the European Union and the idea of a transnational identity.  The second is the other pre-EU principle, which is that of subsidiarity.  In other words, decision making is brought down to the lowest possible level so that the person who is going to be most affected by the decision should have a say in how the decision is made.  In reality, we have two competing principles.  One of the things we are trying to do is to reconcile those principles.  I am not clear how that can be done to the extent that it has been discussed by the committee - not necessarily by the three witnesses, but by other people who have come before us.</p><p>  I note that for the sake of argument Deputy Halligan talked about Irish citizens &ndash; I ask him to correct me if I am wrong &ndash; having a say in presidential elections and Seanad elections but not D&aacute;il elections, for example.</p></speech>

Does she mean Irish citizens abroad?  Deputy Byrne asked the same question.</p><p>  In terms of specific Northern representation, I might be behind the curve, but for the sake of argument, how many people from the South are represented in the Northern Irish Assembly?  To what extent can we talk about parity of esteem?  To what extent should we look at subsidiarity - in other words, that the people who are most affected by decisions are the ones who make the decisions?</p><p>  When we talk about Irish citizens abroad, are we not to some extent moving away from the principle that the EU stands for, which is a community of interests?  Does Ms Boylan suggest that we should give rights to Irish people resident in the EU?  None of the witnesses said whether there should be a difference between Irish citizens who are resident in other EU countries and Irish citizens who are resident in the US, China, Japan or wherever else.  To what extent is this about the European Union, our membership of it and our citizenship within the European Union, and to what extent is Ms Boylan talking about the interests of Irish citizens who live outside Ireland?</p><p>  I am personally conflicted on the issue of nationhood.  To me, moving towards more European involvement is about the community of the European Union and less about nationhood, but then perhaps that is my particular perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="15:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041500006#E00600"><p>First, there is no question but that all of us accept it is a complex issue by virtue of the fact that we have the largest diaspora in the world relative to the population in Ireland.  It is in the region of 40 million to 70 million if one is to include everybody who left Ireland.</p><p>  A couple of issues arise.  One is that we should be careful how we decide to define an Irish citizen.  The Chairman said that we do not have a problem with someone representing our country in football games because their grandfather was born in Ireland.  We tend to cherish the person who puts on a green jersey and sings the national anthem.  We probably give such a person more recognition that we would give to someone who was born in this country but is unable to vote because he or she had to leave the country through no fault of his or her own.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe hit the nail on the head.  First, we need to accept that there is a problem - namely, that we are disenfranchising millions of Irish people around the world.  It is a complex situation.  It might be that we decide to give the vote to everybody who holds an Irish passport.  Someone suggested that we could trace family heredity.  I have family members in America who have been there for two or three generations.  One could ask whether we should go down through the generations and give them a vote.  I am not too sure about that.  I am open to hearing the opinion of others in that regard.</p> <p>We all accept that we need to stop disenfranchising our citizens.  Many members will have relations living in other countries who are still interested in what happens in Ireland.  Without getting into the blame game for our bad economic situation, as we could have the same 20 years from now, hundreds of thousands of people have had to leave our country through no fault of their own.  If we asked them if they would like to have a say in how the country is run, they would give a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  We owe it to those people.  I accept that it would be extremely difficult and complicated to give the vote to the 70 million people around the world who claim Irish ancestry.  Legislatively, it would probably collapse on top of us.  However, a person born in this country who has an Irish passport should be given the vote.</p><p> I specifically did not mention the Seanad because ordinary people do not have a vote in its elections anyway.</p></speech>

However, we have to start on the premise that we are wrongfully disenfranchising our citizens, as Europe has told us.  I agree that we need to include the greater diaspora.  We cannot just give the vote to Irish citizens in Europe while excluding those in America and Australia.</p></speech>

Citizenship cannot be exclusive but must be based on equality.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policy is that a European citizen resident in Ireland for five years should be afforded the right to vote in national elections.  One would need a compelling argument as to why it cannot be extended to D&aacute;il elections if it is extended to presidential and Seanad elections.</p><p>  There are many ways around the issue of those in the diaspora overruling the people living in Ireland.  Many other countries have figured out the mechanics of this.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that the diaspora vote would go to a reserved constituency, which would prevent such swamping.</p><p>  Under Article 2, people in the North have the right to belong to the Irish nation.  They are slightly different, however, so it is not just a case of broadening it out to citizens of EU member states.  That is why we would treat them separately.  At the moment, they are treated differently from Northern Unionists who vote for the British Parliament.</p></speech>

The question arises on how we treat Irish citizens residing in the EU as opposed to those outside it.  Should an Irish citizen be only allowed one vote for the European Parliament?  What about the Irish citizen residing in Australia?  There are mechanics that can be worked out.  The principle is that citizens who wish to avail of a franchise that will allow them some capacity to determine the governance of a jurisdiction they feel is important to them should be facilitated.  I take Senator Hayden&rsquo;s point about the guiding principles of the European Union and the shared nature of the way in which we do our business rather than an attachment to nationhood.  I am of a similar mind to Deputy Halligan on this.</p><p>  As for the swamping effect of a potential 400,000 Irish voters in England and Wales, the experience in countries such as Italy, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, which allow their diasporas to vote, shows that there is actually a low take-up of this entitlement.  I feel those who left the country more recently will be the ones who will take up the vote, rather than the 60 million people in the United States who could potentially have an Irish passport and claim some ancestry from the old sod.  I do not have concerns about swamping or the external vote overtaking the domestic vote.</p><p>  As Deputy Crowe said, we have to start somewhere and set the ball rolling.  Our view is that we should start with presidential and Seanad elections.</p> <p>We have a view about the composition of the Seanad and how it is elected.  In doing so we give a greater participation to the citizens of the State and those outside.  That would allow for broader access to the voting system and it could, therefore, be extended in a way that would cover what Senator Hayden mentioned.</p><p> Deputies Durkan and Byrne raised the issue of what we would do in the event of our not having an embassy.  We must provide some other methodology by which people can cast their votes.  If they have registered electronically, for example, we must afford them some kind of postal process or otherwise that allows for the vote to be cast.  Deputy Durkan has clearly said he would like to retain the peann luaidhe.  Notwithstanding that, I have always been a firm believer that electronic voting and i-voting should not be ruled out.  While I accept that we had a difficult experience, it has been made to work in other countries and it should not prevent our revisiting the system.  I do not suggest it is a priority, but we need to examine it.</p></speech>

Who wishes to explain to me how one would operate the single transferable vote in a general election, as opposed to the French who might have the list system?  How would one distribute votes from all over the world that are cast by the diaspora in a reserved constituency?  Who would be the candidates in this reserved constituency?</p></speech>

Although we have not set out a very concrete proposal, we think the reserved constituency is the preferred method because it prevents swamping.  The logistics of representation for the different countries or areas can be decided once we get broad agreement on whether we are in favour of extending the vote or not.</p></speech>

I remind members, witnesses and persons in the public gallery that mobile telephones must be switched off to avoid interference with the broadcasting of the meeting.  I welcome the Minister, Deputy Michael Noonan, and his departmental officials - Mr. John McCarthy, chief economist; Mr. John Palmer, principal officer; Mr. Niall Feerick, assistant principal officer; Mr. Patrick Quill, statistician; and Mr. Shane Enright, assistant principal officer.</p><p>  The Government's update on the stability programme for 2014 comes in the wake of Ireland's exit from the EU-IMF programme of external assistance in December 2013, with the State now eligible to participate in the EU semester process.  The semester is a yearly cycle of EU economic and fiscal policy co-ordination which commences formally in January each year.  The cycle begins in December with the preparation by the Government of its annual stability programme, which sets out the medium-term economic parameters for the economy.  An update of the stability programme is published the following April and must be submitted to the EU institutions by 30 April.</p><p>  The role of the committee today is to scrutinise the stability programme update before it is submitted to the European Commission and Council.  The discussion will begin with opening remarks by the Minister, following which questions may be put to him by members.</p></speech>

The document was approved by the Government earlier today, with this meeting being the first public engagement on the update.  In a new departure, the Government is making the document available in draft form with a view to facilitating constructive and robust discussion.  The finalised document will be submitted to the European Commission later this month in line with our obligations under the European semester.  There is a great deal of information and detail in the document.  In the interests of brevity, therefore, my opening remarks will focus on the main messages contained therein.</p><p>  The forecasts set out in the update have not changed greatly from those published on budget day.  This is a positive development and indicative of the general improvement in and stabilisation of the economic and fiscal outlook.  Encouragingly, the greatest changes are in the stronger employment forecast.  Job creation is the best indicator of economic activity and the top priority of this Government.  We are seeing real progress in this regard, with an average of 5,000 jobs being created each month.  The stated objective of the medium-term economic strategy published in December is full employment by 2020.  Today's update suggests we have made a strong start on reaching that target.</p><p>  The European semester is about improving economic governance in the EU.  The rationale is that member states will better align their economic and fiscal policies with the rules agreed at EU level.  In this co-ordinated way, the aims of the semester are to promote economic growth and ensure sound public finances in member states and the Union as a whole.  As part of this annual cycle of policy co-ordination, each member state submits a stability or convergence programme to the European Commission in April.  The stability programme update sets out the stance for fiscal policy in the coming years.</p> <p>It complements and is prepared in conjunction with updates of national reform programmes, NRP.  In the case of Ireland, the NRP details the progress made under our EU-IMF programme and it maps out our continued progress towards achieving our Europe 2020 targets.  A draft of the NRP was discussed at the Joint Committee on European Affairs in early April.  As part of the semester, the fiscal and economic policies set out by each member state are subject to peer review at a European level and country-specific recommendations are subsequently endorsed by the European Council in June for each member state to ensure that the policies are consistent with the goals of the Union as a whole. In my remarks this evening I will concentrate on the stability programme update.  With respect to economic developments, preliminary figures indicate that real GDP declined by 0.3% last year.  However, the disappointing outturn was due largely to sector-specific developments in the pharma-chemical sector, commonly referred to as the patent cliff, which acted to depress goods exports in the year.  Because of this, the headline growth figure somewhat distorts what was otherwise an encouraging year for the Irish economy.  GNP, which excludes the impact of this sector-specific issue, increased by 3.4 % last year.</p><p> Signs of economic recovery are increasingly evident.  Investment returned to growth in 2013 and recent indications are of a strong pick-up in consumer spending so far in 2014.  As I mentioned earlier, the most concrete piece of evidence comes from the labour market, where data have been unambiguously positive over the past year or so.  For instance, employment rose by 3.3%, the equivalent of 61,000 jobs over the year to the fourth quarter, the strongest annual employment growth in the entire EU in this period.  The vast majority of job gains were in full-time employment and broadly based across sectors.  Unemployment, while remaining at a level which the Government regards as too high, continues to fall every month.  I think it fair to say that signs of economic recovery are everywhere except in the initial GDP figures for 2013 which will be reassessed by the CSO in June.</p><p> Turning to the economic outlook, my Department expects GDP growth of 2.1% this year, broadly unchanged from budget time.  GNP growth should be somewhat stronger at around 2.7%.  The perennial question of which measure to use to assess economic progress, whether GDP or GNP, is very pertinent at this time.  My view is that the labour market provides the best indicator of what is happening on the ground at present.  As I said earlier, the developments over the past year have been extremely encouraging.</p><p> A pick-up in GDP growth in 2015 and beyond, is anticipated, accompanied by further recovery in the labour market.  There is now a consensus that unemployment is on a downward path and my Department is projecting an unemployment rate of 8.0% by 2018.  While this would represent considerable progress from the unemployment rate seen in early 2012, I would stress that the Government does not see these labour market forecasts as targets nor do we limit our ambition to their achievement.  The economic forecasts upon which the stability programme update is based have been provided by the Irish Fiscal Advisory Council.  I am happy to report that the projections were endorsed by the Council earlier this month.  The letter of endorsement is contained in an annex to the stability programme update.  In the interests of transparency, a publicly-available memorandum of understanding between the two institutions sets out how this endorsement process operates.</p><p> There is, of course, much uncertainty at the moment and there are both up side and down side risks to the outlook.  Externally, although developments over the past year have been reasonably encouraging, the emerging recovery in our key trading partners remains at a fragile stage.  In particular, risks associated with excessively low inflation in the euro area have of late been flagged by both the European Commission and the IMF.</p><p> Domestically, a deterioration in confidence among Irish consumers could result in a re-escalation of household deleveraging, which would serve to dampen consumer spending.  On the upside, there is also the possibility that the labour market may be stronger than we have assumed.  Last year, for instance, employment growth surpassed all expectations and a repeat performance would indeed be welcome.</p><p> On the fiscal front, a general government deficit of 7.2 % GDP was recorded last year according to the CSO.  This was within the 7.5% of GDP ceiling imposed under the excessive deficit procedure, the third successive year of over-achievement.  The projected deficit for this year announced in budget 2014 remains at 4.8% of GDP.  This is inside the EDP ceiling.  Therefore, we remain on track to bring the deficit below 3 % by next year, in line with our commitments.</p><p> In line with the requirements of the Stability and Growth Pact and the fiscal stability treaty, once Ireland corrects the excessive deficit in 2015, it will be necessary to ensure convergence towards our medium-term budgetary objective, also known as the MTO.  In Ireland's case this will mean achieving a balanced budget in structural terms by 2018.  More specifically, this involves a budgetary position where general government revenues and expenditures are equal in a given year, once correction for the position in the economic cycle has been made.  The projections in the stability programme update are consistent with this.</p><p> The stability programme update also highlights that the debt-to-GDP ratio has now peaked at 124% at the end of last year.  For this year and beyond the debt ratio is now on a firm downward path.  Of interest to investors and analysts, the document also includes figures on the debt ratio in net terms, in other words, excluding the impact of cash reserves that we have built up in order to smooth our re-entry to capital markets following our successful exit from the EU-IMF programme.  On this basis, the debt ratio was 98% of GDP at the end of last year, a figure which is not dissimilar to EU norms.</p><p> In conclusion, sustainable public finances are a necessary condition for the economic growth that is required to raise living standards and reduce unemployment.  The stability programme update confirms that revenue and expenditure are being more closely aligned but there is still work to be done.  The Government's policies are paying dividends, a fact which is clear from the turnaround in the labour market over the year.</p><p> I welcome questions and the constructive observations that I am confident I will hear from members.</p></speech>

The Chairman and I were involved in much of the conversations.  It is not possible, in my view, to have a currency union which does not have a fiscal union or something very close to it because there is always the risk that countries within the currency union which do not obey moderate fiscal rules will drag down everyone else.  The move towards a fiscal union is that common rules would apply across the Community and everybody has to comply with certain criteria.</p> <p>Then there is peer review.  If we do not come up to standard on the peer review in June we will get specific recommendations under the semester process and we will be obliged to correct on that basis.</p></speech>

What kind of enforcement could be put in place in Germany?  It is fine to wag one&rsquo;s finger at a small European state but Germany is a different kettle of fish.  We saw that previously with Maastricht when criteria were put in place it was not the small member states that broke the rules it was the major states such as France and Britain that were stepping outside the rules.</p></speech>

We would like to see Germany reducing its current account surplus because a model where everybody eliminates deficits and nobody reduces surpluses does not seem to be tenable in the long term unless we run a balance of payments surplus with the rest of the world on a continuing basis.  I do not think that is the way to go either.  There must be some kind of internal balance but it is a work in progress.  Much progress has been made.</p></speech>

On ten-year bond interest rates, the trend has been downward but that is for reasons that were well planned in the Department of Finance and through the NTMA.  Effectively, we are de-risking the Irish debt all the time.  The principal reason for Irish ten-year bonds to be at 2.9% coming down from 3% ten days ago is a realisation in the markets that there is no further risk left in IBRC and that the risk in NAMA has been eliminated.  What one sees is what one gets in terms of Ireland.  The quantum of sovereign debt is what we have to deal with and no side issue is going to jump up and surprise people as they go forward.  That is not to say that interest rates will not rise again and that it would not affect sovereign spreads but the issue is the relative rate.  It was very narrow this morning on the five-year paper.  With the five-year German bond, there were only 40 basis points.  It was slightly more on the ten-year paper.  We are moving in the right direction but we need to work on it every day.  The ten-year was 140 basis points above the bond.</p></speech>

We have had a limited opportunity to review the draft document and to come up with key questions.</p><p>  How confident can we be that the Department&rsquo;s projections in terms of GDP growth of 2.1% this year are going to be accurate?  The Minister acknowledged that the outturn for 2013 was quite disappointing with a contraction of 0.3%.  This time last year the Department forecast that the economy would grow in 2013 by 1.3% so it was out by approximately 1.6%.  For 2014 there is a forecast of 2.1%.  How confident can we be this time that the estimate will be accurate?  The Minister attributed last year&rsquo;s poor performance to GDP grounds such as the patent cliff and the sector-specific issues in the pharmaceutical industry but they would have been known at this time last year.  I acknowledge GDP is a volatile measure of an economy, employment growth has been positive and further positive growth is forecast in that regard but how confident can we be that this time that the forecast from the Department on the overall measure of the economy will be broadly correct?</p><p>  Second, there has been considerable speculation that in the next budget in six months time there might be scope for some tax reductions especially for middle income earners.  Looking at the figures today in the stability programme update, SPU, even with &euro;2 billion of an adjustment the Department is forecasting that we will come in right on the button of a deficit of 2.9% next year which is the limit of the deficit at which we are allowed to come in.  Where stands all of the speculation that has been fuelled by senior Ministers and the Taoiseach that there might be scope in October&rsquo;s budget to relieve the burden of income tax on families given that the official forecast today shows that even with a full &euro;2 billion adjustment of tax increases and spending cuts we will still only just about come in on the button of 2.9% deficit next year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.540" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="20:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014041500005#D02200"><p>On Deputy McGrath's first question, I am as confident as any finance Minister in Europe can be about how events will play out by the end of the year.  We also are not that enthusiastic about GDP figures because GNP is a more accurate measure of how the Irish economy is going now than GDP.  As the Deputy knows, GDP includes all the foreign stuff whereas GNP is more or less the domestic economy with the foreign profits stripped out of it.  What is happening with GNP is consistent with the very high levels of increased employment.</p><p>  I am confident, first because we are at the lower end of the consensus.  Deputy McGrath will have seen what the ESRI, IBEC and the various stockbroker economists predicted.  Even the Central Bank is slightly ahead of us now.  We are at the lower end of the consensus but we are still within the consensus space.  Our forecasts have been endorsed by the Fiscal Advisory Council which is also very prudent in its approach.  There is always uncertainty.  I cannot give a cast iron guarantee.  I am sure Deputy McGrath is aware that what happened with the patent cliff.  There are particularly high-selling drugs manufactured in Ireland, for example, Lipitor - anyone who has a heart problem would be familiar with that - and Viagra and its co-equivalents under other names is also very high selling and is highly profitable.</p> <p>As they go off patent they continue to produce them, and the same number of people are employed in the pharmaceutical industry.  There are more people employed in the pharmaceutical industry this year than there was last year or in 2012 but in terms of value, what they produce is worth less.  Pharmaceuticals, with 25,000 employees and massively expensive products, were contributing about 5% to GDP, and that has to be pulled back.  We are not quite clear how it washes through, so to speak, because we do not control the decision-making in the companies.  However, from what we can see up to now they continue to produce but what they are producing now in general terms would be more on the generic side rather than the patented product where the high profits are available.  Obviously, they will come in again with new patented products and it will drive again.  That has given us a distortion, and that is the best explanation I can give the Deputy.</p><p> On the level of adjustment made, we are saying that we are in line with our budgetary predictions after three months of 2014 and that we are on target to get to the deficit of 4.8% but to go from 4.8% to less than 3% will require an adjustment of about &euro;2 billion next year.  That is what we have predicted for a couple of years, and we are not moving from that forecast even though independent forecasters are saying we could do this much easier.  If there is a big surge in tax receipts as the year goes by or a big fall in expenditure because many additional people go back to work, we will welcome that and take it into account coming into the budget, but currently we are looking at an adjustment.</p><p> The Deputy asked how that leaves scope for tax reductions.  I have always talked about tax reductions in the context of the tax reductions I have had in the past three budgets.  The Deputy will recall that I reduced VAT from 13.5% to 9%, but I had to raise revenue elsewhere.  I reduced stamp duty to transfer family farms to the next generation of young farmers.  I gave enhanced provisions for research and development, which enhanced the IDA package and succeeded in bringing in many American companies, with emphasis on research and development.  I gave a capital gains window for the property industry in Dublin, which brought a wall of money into Dublin for commercial property.  I use taxes as quasi-supply side initiatives, to use a fancy term, to stimulate sectors of the economy.  I brought in other measures and they did not work, and no doubt the Deputy will remind me of those, but that is no reason for not trying.</p><p> An aspect of the tax code that currently is most jobs unfriendly is the fact that people on relatively small incomes must go on the high rate of tax.  A single person earning &euro;32,800 goes on the high rate of tax, and I am saying that my next move on tax is to address that.  If I do not have some resources what I can do will be very small, but I am pledged to doing something.  If there is a good deal of movement in that regard, that is where I will have the emphasis in the budget but that is not inconsistent with the correction we have to make.  I am simply saying that we will continue to make the tax code across the different tax heads jobs and growth friendly because our objective is to grow the economy and create more jobs.</p></speech>

I welcome that this document has been published in draft form because there is a glaring omission in it regarding the potential for a deal on the bank debt to move it away from the sovereign debt.  Obviously, that would have a huge impact on the future public finances if it happened and I was surprised to see that it was not down as an upside risk.  It is not down under European developments and as far as I can see, it is not included in the chapter on long-term sustainability of the public finances.  Has it been left out of this document because it is assumed that a deal cannot take place?  Is that the basis on which the Government is operating or is it an omission the Minister might correct as it is only in draft form?</p></speech>

We cannot put wishes, aspirations or policies in it until there is agreement, but that does not mean we will not continue to pursue the policy and several other policies to make our debt position more sustainable.</p></speech>

There is also a section on European developments and a section on long-term sustainability.  If a deal were to be reached, and a deal was announced to have been reached in July 2012, it would have a major impact on public finances.  As a constructive comment on this, which the Minister invited, I believe it should be included.  It would show the Government's seriousness of intent with its European partners and with the Commission, that it is looking for this because it seems to me from this document that a major item that would have a huge impact on the figures before us is excluded, and I do not know the reason for that.</p></speech>

An agreement was announced by the Taoiseach almost two years ago.  That agreement, which would have a massive impact on the public finances, should be included in this document.  It would also remind Europe that we are still looking for it because someone reading this might conclude that we are no longer looking for it.</p></speech>

The Minister mentioned a number of upside risks that in no way could be described as hard figures, and they have not been announced as decisions reached at a European level.  The Minister states regarding upside risks that economy-wide investment remains close to record low levels, therefore, if they go up there will be a huge impact.  He mentions that employment growth has surpassed expectations and that if that increased, it would have a favourable impact on household income, etc.  They are mentioned without giving any hard figures.  It seems to me that the bank debt arrangement is much more significant.</p></speech>

Firstly, economy-wide investment remains at close to record low levels.  While the baseline scenario assumes a recovery in the investment-to-output ratio over the medium term, a more rapid 'normalisation' is possible.  Secondly, employment growth has surpassed even the most optimistic expectations over the past year or so.  Stronger-than-assumed employment growth would have a favourable impact on household income ...</blockquote>I believe the figure is dealt with but beyond getting into a &quot;He said, she said&quot; debate with the Senator, which I do not want to do-----</p></speech>

It seems that different economies in Europe have different productivity levels, many of which are divergent, and entering into a tight fiscal union in those circumstances is a recipe for disaster.  The twin-track Europe we have currently where Germany and France set the rules and the smaller countries in particular are forced to follow them is not in Ireland's interests.  They are different economies and different elements of the cycle but they are all being treated with the same tools.</p><p>  Deputy McGrath mentioned the inconsistencies in the prediction figures with regard to debt to GDP ratios and GDP growth.  Rather than being volatile around them, unfortunately, all of them erred on the wrong side in the past.  There are contradictions also.</p> <p>It talks growth but focuses on contraction.  One of the startling transactions is that current spending will continue to contract further and then remain static for another four years.  This is despite the fact the people have suffered a massively damaging spending blow.  Spend <i>per capita</i>will be reduced in real terms.<br />Since this Administration started, net employment has increased by 30,000 jobs but emigration has been ten times that number.  People on the edge of existence will want to know what growth prediction the Government believes is necessary to see a reduction in the level of contraction.  More specifics on this would be useful.</p></speech>

The connection between growth and budgetary correction level is probably between gross national product, GNP, and the amount of taxes that flow through the Exchequer.  It is quite a complicated question to answer.  If the economy grows very strongly in GNP terms with many people going back to work, paying income and expenditure taxes, no longer on social welfare payments, then this would be advantageous to us.  As confidence builds and as people spend, one gets more yields from excise and VAT.  For example, one sees quite a boost in excise from car sales in the first three months of 2014.</p><p>  In general terms, we need to make an adjustment of &euro;2 billion for the next budget.  After that, the growth projections we have in this document will carry forward beyond next year.  There should be no further adjustment then for 2016 to 2018, inclusive.  By 2018, we will have a structural balance.  The growth figures in this forecast get us into that position.</p><p>  We will have to do the full &euro;2 billion in cuts, based on the figures presented here.  If matters improve during the course of the year, we will see how it plays out and it should improve the situation.</p></speech>

Has the Government considered different ways by which household debt could be alleviated through budgetary measures?</p><p>  Up to 120,000 enterprises have closed over the past several years, which is a phenomenal figure.  Main Street Ireland will say the likes of flat taxes - taxes that are not progressive and do not fully reflect earning capability - are hitting consumer expenditure.  Is it not contradictory to forecast increases in consumer spending while attacking the ability of the consumer to spend through these taxes?</p></speech>

If the value of everything in the economy goes down by 20%, as it did with GDP, this then transfers over in the closure of many small businesses, particularly on the retail side.  It is beginning to restore again, particularly in Dublin.  One sees businesses reopening or starting up.  I hope we are at the start of a more optimistic cycle.  Not everything is repaired, however.</p><p>  As well as being involved in the troika programme, we have taken the economy sector by sector with a series of initiatives where we have restored tourism, agrifood and farming, in which we have enhanced inward investment and the financial services.  We are also repairing building, development and construction.  It is just tipping in the right direction but it has been very difficult.  We have had to do a big repair job on banking.  Retail is really a function of consumer sentiment.  The retail figures for the first three months of 2014 have been at their highest for several years.  We hope this will continue.</p><p>  It is also true that while volume is up in retail, the VAT receipts show there is much discounting in the sector.  One will know from walking any high street that there are sales all the time with discounts of up to 50%.</p><p>  On the strategy of how the tax code influences consumer spending, we moved to a property tax because it is set on fixed assets.  We made a commitment that we would not increase income tax.  It is income tax that generates consumer spending, helps retail and, in turn, creates jobs.  We have been following the Deputy&rsquo;s advice.  The problem is we had to do this when we were consolidating to move back from the brink of impending bankruptcy.  We have made much progress but I am the first to admit that it is still work in progress and much more has to be done over the next two years.</p></speech>

This stability programme indicates static spending for the four years involved.  Has the Minister identified what the population rate will be like in this time?  Is it a case that there are static figures that may not take into account population growth, meaning a reduced spend per person in the end?</p></speech>

We have gone through a period where we had to be very careful about the amounts we were dedicating to such expenditure because we had to consolidate on the expenditure side, as well as on the tax side.  We are still operating under expenditure ceilings which will make it difficult.  As well as the expenditure controls which the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin, exercises over different Departments, I am responsible for the expenditure ceilings within which Ireland must operate.  These are quite a restrictive set of rules.</p><p>  The Deputy asked me earlier how much the improvement on the deficit would be if growth were 1% better.  The rule of thumb is that for every 1% improvement in growth, the deficit is reduced by 0.5%.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.568" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="20:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014041500007#F00900"><p>The Government has focused on reducing the deficit through austerity.  It has reduced the ceiling of public service consumption and has increased taxes through flat taxes.  There is another idea, namely, reducing the deficit through growth.  That requires stimulus through investment and the taking out of flat taxes such as water and property charges.<br />For example, with the ambulance service, the number of paramedics <i>per capita</i>here is half the number in the North of Ireland or Scotland.  Our ambulance service has seen a reduction of 30% of ambulances available and where only 30% of them arrive on time.  Those life-and-death experiences in everyday life are directly related to the choices of spend per citizen as set out in this document.</p> <p>It is not a case of there being only one parameter within which that can be discussed.</p></speech>

We had a twin-track approach to get the deficit down and control the debt - and the troika programme was up in lights for everybody - but, in parallel with that, the Government ran a programme to grow every sector of the economy.  That is why I reduced VAT in the tourism industry from 13.5% and 9%; that is why we had The Gathering and that is why I abolished the travel tax this year.  We have restored the industry now and, therefore, that is a growth strategy for tourism.  The Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a programme in place under which volume in agrifood will increase by 40% between 2015 and 2020, principally because there has been a huge change in the Common Agricultural Policy with milk quotas no longer applying.  We will be able to go for volume at market prices rather than being restricted by quota to sustain prices.  There is a different model in this industry.</p><p>  With regard to FDI, every time a foreign company invests here, that feeds the demand side of the economy.  Intel said last week it has 5,500 people and it has put &euro;7 billion into the plant over the past three or four years.  This is low profile, demand side activity.  However, in the context of investment by the Government, there is a supply side to the economy and we had to concentrate on that, first, because it is worth doing and we can get a great deal out of it to get the economy to grow that way and, second, because we did not have large amounts to invest in new deal projects.  We did not have the resources to build great dams in the Mississippi basin or to follow a Roosevelt-type projection.  That would not work for Ireland anyway.  It worked for the US in the 1930s because it was a well enclosed economy.  The multiplier in Ireland is probably less than 1%, which means that anything we put into construction leaks out of the economy so fast we do not get a multiplier effect.  It is not that we are austerity freaks.  We did what we had to do to correct the fiscal imbalances but we deliberately stimulated the economy sector by sector more through taxation and supply side initiatives than by demand side initiatives.  If we had the resources, we would go down the demand route as well.  We have arrangements in place through the European Investment Bank and PPPs.  Bundles of schools and groups of health centres will be built.</p><p>  It is wrong to accuse the Government of simply having one string to its bow when we have put so much work in, which has clearly been successful, to repair the damaged sectors of the economy and to get them growing again.</p></speech>

He says on page 1 that the three pillars of the medium-term economic strategy are competitiveness, credit and public finances.  I would love debt resolution to be added to them.  It is probably the key driver of economic growth missing from the strategy.  I would love to see that factored in explicitly, if possible.   The Minister also referenced on page 1 improvements to the budgetary process, which are great.  I would like to give one final plug for the equality budgeting submission I sent to him.  Even if he thinks it is not possible to implement it in full, it would be incredibly useful on budget day when he and the Minster for Public Expenditure and Reform announce the budget if all Members, as well as having the literature we were given last year, had some form of distributional analysis, be it by income decile, gender, rural versus urban and so on.</p><p>  There is a fantastic graph on page 14 of the document, which breaks down the change in the deficit between 2013 and 2014 in the context of interest, revenue buoyancy, carryover, new policy measures and so on.  I began my proposal for budget 2015 this week and it would be incredibly useful to get the Minister's opinion and that of his officials as far ahead of time as possible as to what the new policy requirements, including carryover, revenue buoyancy and other factors will be and I acknowledge these will be estimates.  If we could get that a few weeks before budget day, it would be incredibly useful in the context of knowing what is required in terms of new measures as opposed to the overall package.</p><p>  We have been discussing a figure of &euro;2 billion.  Will this be generated from new policy changes or will it include carryover, revenue buoyancy and so on?</p></speech>

I cannot give the Deputy specifics but there is carryover from the Haddington Road agreement.  There is always a carryover on the revenue side but it is not large this year.  I recall seeing figures before Christmas and it was low.</p></speech>

We are following this lower than ECB target across the eurozone.  There are pros and cons to a higher or lower inflation rate.  Is there an optimal rate that the Minister would like?  Is Ireland, through whatever means, doing anything at the ECB or elsewhere in Europe to push the current eurozone inflation rate up or down?</p></speech>

Low inflation continues to improve our competitiveness but it hits the tax take hard.  Budgets are built on nominal growth - real growth plus inflation - and if there is hardly any inflation in the system, we are down to real growth to provide us with the extra impetus on the tax side.  We would like to be up at the ECB level of just under 2%, which is its mandate.  If we had a growth rate of 2.1%, as outlined in the paper, and 2% nominal growth, we would have a different set of figures and we would not be adjusting by &euro;2 billion.  As for how I feel about it myself, in European fora, I have expressed the view for two years that Europe should find ways of doing some quantitative easing.</p></speech>

As the Deputy knows, European inflation rates are very low.  I do not envisage a once-off correction changing, but I think it will go back up.  The European Central Bank policy is for a gradual increase in inflation while staying within its mandate of less than 2%.</p></speech>

There is speculation that it could do that in June, for example, but I have no information beyond what I read in the financial papers as to how realistic that might be.  That would obviously change the inflation figure if extra liquidity is put in and extra purchasing power is put in.  It will not go printing money, but it might buy bonds that other sovereigns print.</p></speech>

There have been some reasonably credible media reports that the ECB is keen to accelerate the sale to market interest rates rather than the subsidised ECB rate of the promissory note bonds.  Is the Minister coming under any pressure to accelerate that?  Is the ECB asking him to start selling these bonds off by a particular date?</p></speech>

As they reassert they come back into the figures, so it will go to 1.2%, 1.3% and so on.  That is the explanation for the table.</p><p>  On the promissory note, the way we organised the alternative to the promissory note was done on a lot of advice as to what would be legal and what would correspond to European law.  We are very pleased that a few weeks ago the European Central Bank's board of governors decided that the arrangement we had made was in accordance with that and was not monetary financing.  When we were negotiating it, the second issue was that the bonds which go from 25 to 40 years in duration have different maturity dates.  Through the Central Bank we have agreed a schedule of sale and I think we have to sell some small amount next year.  We might do that before the back end of this year.  That would be always under review.  The European Central Bank will always review the assets of any central bank within its remit, but we are under no pressure whatsoever.  It might be in our interest as time goes by to change the profile and bring it forward.</p><p>  The agreement is that we will sell in accordance with the profile, taking into account conditions of financial stability.  I think I am quoting that accurately - that is the key phrase.  The Central Bank always has the argument that it would be possible to affect the financial stability of a sovereign if there is a push to sell too fast.</p><p>  Since the Irish paper was put into the Central Bank last year, the nominal value has gone up by about &euro;4 billion.  I am not going to take profit out of that or ask the governor to take profit out of that because we would be accused of dumping on the market to achieve fiscal correction.  However, at some point in the future a profit will accrue and the point of sale will come back to the Exchequer.</p><p>  To answer the Deputy's question bluntly, we are under no pressure, but we would expect the European Central Bank to review the holdings of paper which the Central Bank has under this heading and in the normal investment portfolio, and advise on its disposal from time to time.  We are under no pressure, however.</p></speech>

The labour market figures contained in the SPU are obviously very welcome.  It is fantastic to see the unemployment rate decrease and the numbers at work increase.  One of the details hidden in the figures is the difference in the rates for men and women.  We all know the unemployment rate for men rocketed owing to the construction bubble.  However, one of the things the unemployment figures reveal is that the unemployment rate for women has not moved.  While the last figures I saw were a few months old, the rate for women is getting marginally worse, whereas all the increase we have seen in recent quarters is among men.  Many of the targeted budgetary issues to stimulate construction - for example, the tax relief on extensions to houses - are targeted towards men.</p></speech>

One obvious one, which is a bit of a sidebar but would reactivate many women, would be making child care tax deductible or establishing some sort of package on child care.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.596" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="20:55:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014041500009#H01100"><p>I have noticed the discrepancy the Deputy drew to our attention in the last set of figures.  What he has said is correct.  I cannot explain it to him.  It may be because so many women are involved in the public services, such as teaching, nursing, the Civil Service and local authority offices.  There are a disproportionate number of women in those areas of employment.  There have been redundancies - shedding of numbers - right across the public service.  I do not know whether that explains it, but it was a thought that struck me when I saw the figures.</p><p>  In addition, two of the growth areas have been agriculture and construction, with largely male employment.  As the economy begins to grow it will get more complex because as well as people coming off the live register, there will be people coming people from the schools and colleges who would have emigrated and people who had emigrated will come home.  In addition, in the case of people from eastern Europe who have established ties here, some of their family members will start coming back again because it would be a fruitful labour market.</p><p>  If we can correct some of the disincentives to work in the economy, participation rates will increase.  If some help could be given in the area the Deputy suggests, participation rates for young married women might increase.  That, coupled with the low entry point into the higher rate of income tax, is probably also a factor.</p></speech>

I wish to make an important technical point on the GDP-GNP reverse gap.  Effectively, GNP is significantly higher than GDP, which is having an impact on reaching the excessive deficit procedure targets.  The margin the last time was 3.7%.  In 2013 GDP growth was minus 0.3% and GNP was 3.4%, which represents a differential of 3.7%.  The Minister is projecting that in 2014 GDP will be 2.1% and GNP will be 2.7%, which is a 0.6% differential.</p> <p>When is it anticipated they will converge and we will return to normal GDP versus GNP?  The real economy is doing exceptionally well with regard to meeting targets based on GDP.  In his interaction with our partners in Europe, has the Minister examined the introduction of GNP as part of the measure?  It is far ahead of GDP, and GNP growth is clearly reflected in growth in employment.  It is having an impact and I would like the Minister's thoughts on it.</p></speech>

It helps the ratio to decrease if one can grow the GDP but it also helps if one can reduce the deficit through more tax, expenditure or growth.  If one were to substitute GNP one would gain on present growth levels but one would lose on the quantum because GDP is significantly higher in absolute terms than GNP.  The denominator is much bigger if GDP is used.  Switching to GNP-----</p></speech>

The differential in 2013 was so large that using GDP does not reflect the true state of the economy but, as the Minister mentioned, it is the measure taken in Europe with regard to meeting our excessive deficit targets.  When does the Minister anticipate that GDP will eclipse GNP again?</p></speech>

Earlier the Minister mentioned inflation and I wish to follow up on what Deputy Donnelly stated.  Between now and 2018 inflation will be below the 2% target to which the Minister referred.  Does he anticipate that the ECB will do something to deal with inflation?  How near are we to deflation?  I am focusing on nominal GDP growth with built-in inflation.  I am glad GNP is coming back in line because we have not had acknowledgement from Europe on how the economy has been doing because of the patent cliffs.</p></speech>

One of the factors in driving the European figures so low was the reduction in energy prices in recent times, and this will fall out of the figures shortly.  The inflation figure will not return to 2% but it will ease fears of deflation.  If one follows what Mr. Draghi states, he does not envisage deflation, but he is very conscious of the adverse effects of continuing low inflation on European economies.  He seems to stand ready to do something about it.  What this might be I am not quite sure.  We have not been briefed.  The point of contact will be through the Governor of the Central Bank.  The Council of Ministers has the same level of knowledge as anybody who reads the business pages and speculation from analysts.  We have no inside-track information.</p></speech>

According to one of the other tables included in the documentation, growth in Europe is running at half of what it is in the United States.  Last week there was commentary from the ECB in which it accepted that we were not engaged in monetary financing, but there is a sense that in comparison to the Fed, it is terrified of quantitative easing and any form of monetary financing.  Is there adequate debate on whether the ECB is fit for purpose, bearing in mind that Europe consistently lags behind the United States when it comes to quantitative easing?  Is it an area we should push harder?  We got a slight glance from the ECB, but ideologically Europe is terrified of quantitative easing.  Year on year the United States gets away with it and consequently has significantly lower unemployment and higher growth than we do in Europe.</p></speech>

It takes a very adverse view of politicians commenting on what it does.  Our representation at the European Central Bank is through the Governor of the Irish Central Bank and there is no political representation in any forum associated with the ECB.  We will never be in such a position, unless it is a specific Irish issue such as the promissory notes, on which I engaged in conversation with the authorities at the European Central Bank.</p><p>  I do not know about the comparisons with the United States.  We are at a different point in the cycle.  The US recovery preceded ours in Europe.  We are perched on the verge of a fairly strong European recovery but of course there are risks.  If one turns on the television this evening one will see what the Russians are doing in eastern Ukraine.  Suppose gas supplies to Europe were cut off in the winter.  One could see what that would do to growth in Europe.  We are living in a big bad world with many unknowns and risks, but we must travel hopefully and allow for the risk.  I hope the European Central Bank will do something for liquidity in Europe, because additional liquidity would stimulate demand and some demand stimulation is needed at present.  Whether it will, I do not know.  I would have thought there was movement by the Governor of the Bundesbank, Mr. Weidmann, in some things he said in the past three weeks, but how far he is prepared to move I am not sure.  There is a different legal system and historic background.</p> <p> Everybody will have read the stories about the Weimar Republic, where one had to fill a wheelbarrow with deutschemarks to buy milk and a loaf of bread in Berlin in the 1930s.  A generation of people, the grandfathers of the present active German population, lost all their savings.  They lost everything and were totally wiped out.  It is a family memory and a political memory in Germany.  The Germans are terrified of inflation.  That is the reason the European Central Bank was built on the basis of close to but not more than 2% inflation.  That is the mission statement on inflation in the European Central Bank.</p><p> It will not go for a walk on the wild side, but it might do something.</p></speech>

It is a little like the Minister talking about travelling in hope and taking a walk on the wild side.  He is quite good with the story.</p><p>  We ought not to undersell the achievement.  We should clearly note the 5,001 jobs that are being created and the positive effects that has had on families who have had a husband or wife back in employment.  That is very positive in the market.  The Minister has also pointed to the strong retail sales figures.  Deputy Donnelly referred to the imbalance between the number of males and females getting back into the workforce.  Looking at the figures in the retail sector, there is a great deal of female employment within that sector.  I agree with Deputy Donnelly's suggestion to look at child care.  That is a big enabler for getting women, especially young women, back into the workforce.  We know there is a review of policies relating to the construction industry coming down the line and we have seen the retail sales for the opening months of this year.  Is the Minister being conservative in his estimations of employment and the cost within that element?  That is my first question.  The second is different, so perhaps the Minister would reply to that first.</p></speech>

However, it is being repaired.  The first issue for the construction industry is that unless the cost of building a house is less than the price for which the builder can sell it, no house will be built.  That is the first thing to remember.  House prices in Dublin and commercial property prices had dropped well below their replacement value.  They are only coming back up now in the last six months.  I realise that there are parts of south Dublin where this does not apply, but in general around Dublin for the builder to build and sell his first house 12 months hence, he would probably be fairly satisfied to take his cost out and perhaps get 6% or 7% on it.  It has only barely turned.</p><p>  On the commercial side, one would have to get approximately &euro;35 per foot for commercial or office blocks in Dublin to break even, so rents would have to go beyond that.  They are &euro;38 to &euro;40 per foot now.  That is the reason one is seeing sites opening up and cranes again on the horizon.</p><p>  It is not rocket science.  It is very simple.  Until the price goes above the cost of producing the extra unit, nothing happens in a market.  It must move into that position.  I believe we are getting there fast.  I introduced the real estate investment trust, REIT, legislation and the third one was announced today.  It is a Canadian group and it wants 10,000 residential units in Dublin.  It is in the market to buy apartment blocks and refurbish them.  It is also in the market to build.  The National Asset Management Agency, NAMA, has its portfolio of builders ready to go and it advertised for joint ventures recently.  It got an enormous amount of offers from abroad, with foreign money that is prepared to finance builders in Dublin to build houses.</p><p>  It is at the repair stage, but it is only barely turning.  In rural areas there were almost 8,000 houses built last year but almost all of them were one-off houses.  If one is getting married, getting a site from one's father and if one intends to live there for a generation, whether the value of the house goes up or down is not as important as if one were buying in an estate.  The estates of houses are not yet there.  The one-off houses are.  We need get back to having reputable builders building estates of three-bedroom family homes, starting in Dublin, then moving to Cork and Galway and then on to the big towns around the country.  There is a supply shortage and many young families have been living in restricted apartments.  They want to break out and they need the supply.  We must drive that hard and I expect the Government to bring forward a significant policy on that in the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Is there a possibility of squeezing that?  Obviously there is a cost in the NTMA holding that &euro;18.5 billion.  We made a slight improvement because we conducted some buy-backs of our bonds and saved a couple of hundred million euro in that regard.  Is there an opportunity to squeeze that a little further?  If one looks after one's pennies, the pounds look after themselves.  Every &euro;10 million or &euro;15 million makes a difference to us.  If we conduct any further buy-backs, are there any trigger mechanisms that will impact on other bonds that we would have to redeem at the same time?  I will leave it at that as I have one last question to ask.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.629" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="21:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014041500011#K01300"><p>First, on the NTMA cash balances, in consultation with the NTMA we deliberately got the NTMA to build the cash balances so we had a precautionary buffer as we were going into the markets.  That worked out, but they are not needed now so they will be tapered down over the next couple of years.  The prudent position according to the NTMA, in its advice to me, is that we hold approximately 16 months cover for the deficit, which is a little below a year and a half.  The Deputy can do the sums on that to see what type of money is involved.  The Deputy will also have seen the figure the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has released for the first time.  It shows that while the gross debt is 124% of GDP, the net debt is now 98%.  That is not allowing for the value of bank shares or the like.  That is purely the cash on hand element of it.</p><p>  The NTMA is always looking at how it would sell, buy, swap and change.  There is a big repayment cliff in 2016 and its policy, which the NTMA has discussed with me, is to reduce that cliff so that by 2016 we will have dealt with it progressively over the remainder of this year and next year.  We are examining the possibility of repaying IMF debt because it is costing us more than European debt or debt we could raise on the market.  To answer the Deputy's question about whether any triggers would be activated, if we were to repay IMF debt, we would have to repay the debt to the European funds as well and the bilateral moneys we got from the UK, Denmark and Sweden.  On the other hand, however, it would not cost them anything to say, "If it is worth your while to repay, maybe we will let you go ahead."  We will see what can be done.</p></speech>

I am not asking him to answer me now.</p><p>  I flagged the following matter with the Chairman at a previous finance meeting and today's meeting is the only opportunity that I shall have to raise it with the Minister.  I also want to put on record the dissatisfaction of committee members about the salary of &euro;843,000 paid to Bank of Ireland's CEO, Richie Boucher.  Bank of Ireland's stated policy at this committee last week was that it would provide no mortgage debt forgiveness where a consumer has given up his or her home through voluntary surrender or assisted voluntary surrender leaving a shortfall on his or her mortgage.  The bank is also opposed to personal insolvency deals brought to them.  Bank of Ireland's policy of no debt forgiveness is wilfully forcing people into bankruptcy.  I believe that such a move is not in the interest of Bank of Ireland, its shareholders or the taxpayer.  I ask the Minister to take that clear sentiment expressed at the committee last week, when the CEO of Bank of Ireland was here, into consideration with regard to the bank's forthcoming AGM.</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland's activity has enhanced the value of the State's shareholding very much.  Last year, the State abstained on a similar resolution because the recommendations of the Mercer report to cut the cost base of Bank of Ireland had not been implemented.  Since then, principally through a reduction which was taken across the pension rights of all staff, particularly senior staff, the situation has improved dramatically.</p><p>  Let us look at the cost-cutting base.  If one takes the remuneration package, the reduction in Bank of Ireland is 48%.  If one takes the whole cost base of the bank, the reduction is 28%.  These are very strong figures coming from the Mercer report so I do not think I would be justified in abstaining again.</p><p>  From a shareholder's point of view, I do not want to get involved in quixotic gestures.  I know my comment will not help the Deputy in any way.  However, I refer him to what Mr. Justice Martin Nolan said when he directed the jury in the notable court case that is still proceeding.  He said that since the Lehman Brothers crash in 2008 - I am not quoting - they had been in bad order, and that it would be incredibly unfair and wrong to treat the individual bankers on the basis of legal issues that came from the crash.</p></speech>

I shall not get into comments flying back and forth because it would not be fair to anyone.  With all due respect, I ask him or one of his officials to look at the recording of the evidence that was given to this committee by the Bank of Ireland with an open mind.  They will see that the Bank of Ireland currently is not acting along the lines of Government policy.  I know it does not necessarily have to, but we have the personal insolvency legislation.  The bank has not been helpful in any way in implementing Government policy or legislation.</p></speech>

The macro issue is probably the greater issue with the Bank of Ireland.  One of the questions that was put to Mr. Boucher last week was whether any engagement had taken place between the Government or the State and the Bank of Ireland on the sale of the State's percentage in the bank.  Has any such discussion taken place?  Is there a plan to cash in?</p></speech>

I will sell it when I think we will make the maximum money from it.  We do not have to cash it in yet.  The economy is growing.  An economy with only two big banks would be very badly run altogether if they were not profitable in the next couple of years.  There is potential for their share values to be enhanced, so we will hold on for the moment.</p></speech>

From my perspective, it is simply about subjecting the Irish economy and the Irish people's economic situation to the surveillance and policing of the overlords in the European Union - the troika - to make sure they continue to wear the yoke of austerity that has been insisted on by them in order to pay off their European bankers and bondholders and save their financial system.  I do not want a gloss put on the matter without comment.</p><p>  If there is real recovery, then why have the people not felt it?  Ordinary working-class people have found themselves on a treadmill.  They have not noted a significant improvement in their living standards in the past three or six months, which has been the tune of the spin from the Government and the media.</p><p>  We have been told there has been a 50% increase in employment.  Every single job that is created is essential and welcome, but I want to make sure we are talking about reality.  Can the Minister comment on the analysis by some people that up to 50% of the increase in employment is a result of a recategorisation of workers - for example, by the use of various categories such as self-employed?  The jobs have been recategorised as job creation.</p><p>  Very many of the new jobs are in low-paid employment in low-paid sectors.  What is the implication of that situation for the economy into the future?  Has the Minister adjusted his income tax projections for the Exchequer for 2014 in view of the improved figures that were not expected by officialdom?  Has there been an upward estimate in income tax and even value added tax?  If there are more people at work, hopefully they will have the ability to spend more. </p></speech>

While there has been some recategorisation by the CSO, it does not affect the headline figures.  The CSO stands over the headline figures but there is some recategorisation within it.  The CSO has published the figures so the Deputy can check for himself.  The recovery is broad-based and across a lot of sectors.</p><p>  With regard to whether the improvement will flow into income tax, VAT or excise, there are about 850,000 people at work who do not pay any income tax.  They have no income tax liability.    </p> <p>That is more than one third of the people at work - an awful lot of people.  Our income tax system is very progressive and many low-paid people are exempt from income tax.  Some low-paid people who do not pay much, or any, income tax are part-time workers but the latest set of employment figures suggests that the increase in employment is through full-time workers.</p><p> I do not agree that the European semester is a device to penalise Ireland.  While we were in the programme, other countries were subject to the European semester.  France and Spain and other large countries get strong mentions in the European semester when they come before the ECOFIN meeting in June for peer review.  It is not a device to pressure small economies or small countries.</p><p> I think the Deputy agrees with the analysis that it is not possible to have a common currency zone without an architecture to underpin it.  We need a fiscal union to sustain a common currency and a banking union.  The Deputy will be pleased to hear that the European Parliament has passed the final element of the banking union.  The resolution legislation has gone through the European Parliament.  It has moved the agenda in the direction we have long advocated.  There will be no more bailouts by the European taxpayer; the legislation provides for the bail-in of banking assets and a fund put together through levies on the industry.  It is a red letter day in Europe and I hope it works when the full elements of the banking union come in next year and the year after.</p></speech>

That is why workers are not in the tax net.  The fact that the Minister does not think it significant enough to have a significant readjustment of income tax for 2014, in view of what is said to be 50,000 new jobs or 60,000 new jobs, suggests that the Minister expects many of the new jobs to be in the low-income and precarious category.</p></speech>

In some traditional sectors such as tourism, which we stimulated strongly, jobs are seasonal and the pay may be quite good but not for the full year.  That is one aspect.  In construction, wage rates held pretty well during the recession, and big sites are opening up in Dublin again.  People are working in the sites through Saturdays and late into the evening.  There will be significant incomes for building workers.</p></speech>

This runs counter to the claim of a progressive tax system overall.</p><p>  The argument is that the tax base needed to be widened under a fictional notion that there is some mysterious income people have outside of their wages from which they can pay property and water taxes.  This simply does not exist.  With regard to the treatment of the property tax and the water tax, as far as the Minister and the Exchequer are concerned, next year we hope people will be paying for water.  What difference will it make to the Exchequer figures in respect of the supply of water?  Will the Minister have to provide Exchequer funding for the supply of water?  Presumably it will not meet the full cost.</p></speech>

I heard the Minister reply to one of the earlier questions about tax breaks that brought a wall of money into the country.  I presume he was referring to property and real estate investment trusts.  What is the logic of facilitating a new wave of speculation by the same type of vulture that caused the disaster for which people have been paying so dearly over the past six years?  The Minister referred to the need for three-bedroom homes.  The Minister must be aware of the desperate situation of people being made homeless on a weekly basis through landlords increasing rents.  There are no local authority houses.  In the 1970s, the country was building 5,000, 6,000 and 7,000 social homes a year and now it builds a few hundred.  Can that situation be rectified?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.654" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="21:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014041500013#M01400"><p>I was referring to the exemption from capital gains tax for seven years for people who buy commercial property in Ireland.  That brought an awful lot of investment money into Dublin.  There was a major overhang of property in Dublin, which was under-used and not put to productive purposes.  There was not a cohort of people in Ireland with the resources to invest in it, even though the same rules applied to Irish people if they had the resources to invest.  A lot of foreign money came in.  It put resources that were under-used or not used back to use, which is very important in terms of office blocks.  The IDA tells me it is running out of the kinds of office block it needs in Dublin for some of the advanced industries.  Most of the investors paid the purchase price and brought in funds to upgrade the properties, enhance their value and refurbish apartments.  We can see the signs of it around town.  I have no interest in driving it above the overhang and I have said I will not renew that particular tax incentive beyond the end of 2014.  It worked while it worked.  It did the job.  Of all the sectors, the building, development and housing sector was the most damaged and became the second scapegoat sector.  Banking and building were the two scapegoat sectors in Ireland - many people would say justifiably so.  Every modern economy has a dynamic building and development sector.</p> <p>If we want houses to be built we need builders who can at least get a margin on the construction cost.  The property market is coming back to that point again.  In parts of Dublin there is now a good margin whereas in other parts of Dublin it is not quite at that point.</p><p> On the rental side, it is true that rents have been increasing in Dublin recently, and that is why we need greater supply, but they have increased by 6% or 7% having fallen 25% between 2008 and 2012.  They have increased a little but if we consider where they fell from we are still not into a proper market.  Housing in Dublin is 50% below the peak, therefore, there are not big cohorts of people rushing in to make big money on it at present, although it is beginning.  </p><p> On both the private housing and the social housing side the model was broken, and we need to build it again from the bottom.  That is starting now, and we will build it.  NAMA has promised me that it has building land and resources to put over 4,000 social houses into Dublin, principally through the housing agencies, and it will do that.  It has also offered many houses to local authorities but many local authorities will not accept them because they have their own internal rules about the percentage of social houses that can be in any estate.  Usually, there is a 20% rule in local authorities.  If the cohort of houses it offers is 50% of the estate, the local authority will only accept 20%.  In the housing emergency we are in I believe the new councils should examine those issues and try to remove the restrictions, even if they are only removed temporarily.  </p><p> I fully agree with the Deputy that there is a big problem with construction and development.  It is beginning to move again but there is a massive social need and while we curse the builders, if they do not build the social need will not be met.  We have to move on with it.</p></speech>

Both of those are too high.  Again, we have the ingredients for a property bubble, and we need controls on the way those institutions operate.  What worries me when I see large property supplements in papers is that many of these institutions will do it all over again unless the Minister controls them.</p></speech>

Somewhere between 3% and 4% for the next ten years would be admirable and would solve all our problems but it would have to be sustained, and we have to get a way from the boom and bust cycle.  I am examining a number of ideas.  All the levers would not be under my control but we are a long way from a property bubble at present.  We certainly have to think about the future but getting houses built that will serve as family homes, particularly in the larger cities and principally in Dublin, is vital.  We probably need between 20,000 and 25,000 houses nationally because nothing has been built for four years.  As well as dealing with the annual demand, there is a backlog feeding in.  There is a good deal of demand for mortgages now.  It is taking seven and eight days to get an appointment for mortgages, and it is principally public servants - teachers and so on - and also people in the IT industry.  They seem to be the main categories that are moving to buy houses.  I presume the other categories will follow as they have a greater sense of job security and a greater sense of countenance.</p></speech>

It concerns the future of NAMA.  The Minister appears to be disposed to an accelerated wind-down of NAMA, and there is a balance to be struck in assessing the factors that feed into that decision.  Obviously, there is a review under way within the Minister's Department.  The commercial property sector has recovered to some extent and conditions are somewhat benign but when will the review into the operation of NAMA be complete?  Has the Minister any thoughts at this stage on the future of the organisation and whether he is favourably considering accelerating the wind-down of NAMA?  Will it still be in place by 2020, which was originally envisaged?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.673" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/955" speakername="Michael Noonan" time="21:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FIJ2014041500014#N01900"><p>I have asked NAMA to do a review, and I have set it certain objectives.  I am quite neutral.  I am looking for data on which I can make decisions subsequently.  For example, I have asked it what would be the consequences of taking the entire residual NAMA book and doing what IBRC did with its book, namely, sell it off in a six months period at the end of 2015.  I want to see how that would pan out.  I have also asked it what would be the outcome if it had &euro;17 or &euro;18 billion of a residual book, which it divided into three thirds, timelined and sold off that way.  There is a simple equation.  Does it sell quick and have very little upside or does it hold out in the hope that property values increase so that there is a bigger return to the Irish taxpayer in 2025?  It is not as simple a sum as that, however, because NAMA is supported by NAMA bonds and the NAMA bonds are on the balance sheets of the main banks, and there are many of them on the balance sheet of AIB, which are a big drag on the balance sheet of AIB.  If it were to sell off quickly and redeem the bonds, it would have to factor in what that would do to the share value of AIB, and we might get our upside in selling the AIB shares.</p><p>  I will communicate fully with the Senator.  I am not trying to do anything in secret.  I have not made up my mind about it.  The legislation provides for a review of NAMA this year and that is what we are doing but I have asked it specific questions.  It has also approximately 2,500 acres of development land, principally in Dublin, and I have asked it for suggestions on how we would work that and whether it would be possible to use it as a break on the market, but there is probably not enough of it available.  The Senator will recall the various Bacon reports that advocated taking the heat out of the property bubble on several occasions from the late 1990s onwards, and none of them worked.  Their principal mechanism was using stamp duty but to my mind they only made it worse.  We should be looking at a different set of mechanisms this time.  We might have a discussion on it some day.</p></speech>

Will he agree that at this stage the public believe there are a great number of stealth taxes in the form of cost of living increases, increases in the cost of gas and other utilities, water charges to come, property tax, VHI and other medical insurances increases and their tax yield is falling?  Households are finding the complexity depressing.  What is the Minister's response?</p></speech>

The second category who were hit hardest are the people who were forced to emigrate and their families left at home who miss the company of their adult children.  The Government has decided that the proceeds of the recovery will be dedicated to growing the economy and creating jobs so that we would address first the problems of those who are hit hardest.  However, that is not to take away from the validity of what the Deputy says, that a great number of people have sacrificed an awful lot.</p></speech>

There is a golden rule that a house has an economic value of the inverse of the yield, in other words, if an investor buys the rent at a 7% yield, the house is worth 15 times the rent.  That is a stabilising force and the key stabilising force is fractional reserving.  One cannot create more than &euro;641 from &euro;100 initial deposit if the banks fractionally reserve at 13.5%.  This is a mathematical fact.</p></speech>

I noted the Minister's recent comments with regard to the property sector.  Deputy Mathews makes the point about rules on the valuation of property.  The Minister's comment this evening that the billed costs of a property have not come down during the shrinkage years of the property market because even when property values dropped the billed costs have not reflected the depreciation in the values.  There would seem to be another matrix besides the rent.  One would assume that the average house is valued at four times the average income of approximately &euro;38,000.  This means that the average purchase price should be somewhere around &euro;160,000 to &euro;180,000 at a maximum.  If we see the price of the average house moving beyond the ratio of four to five times the national industrial wage, we are in a property bubble.  It does not matter how much it costs to build a house and it could be that we are paying people too much to build houses if that is the difficulty-----</p></speech>

I have tabled two of the seven amendments on the list.  I indicate my intention to table further amendments to sections 4 and 5 on Report Stage.  I thank the Irish Cancer Society which has framed the proposed amendments for its continued interest in the issue.</p><p>  It is important to recognise different skin types and take the opportunity presented by the Bill to include members of the public with skins types 1 and 2.  While I have indicated my intention to introduce further amendments on Report Stage, I appeal today to the Minister to consider tabling amendments to this section.  I would support such an initiative on his part.  Perhaps he might use the opportunity in the intervening period before Report Stage to consider such amendments.  His imprimatur is an absolute guarantee of success in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p><p>  The wording of the amendments prepared by the Irish Cancer Society is eminently sensible and their application is undisputed.  They would protect people who may not realise how prone they are to the adverse effects of exposure to sunbed use.  There is a significant cohort of Irish people with skin types 1 and 2.  The amendments are not only about protecting but also informing the wider public of the dangers involved and ultimately dissuading them from using this equipment in the future.  I have the proposed wording of the Report Stage amendments.</p> <p>I can copy my amendments to the Minister for his consideration over the intervening period.  <br />I know this is going to be a relatively quick meeting.  However, I ask the Chairman to be patient with me as I read what I propose to table on Report Stage into the record.<blockquote><b>Prohibition on permitting the use of sunbeds by certain persons </b><br />4A (1) The owner, manager or employee of a sunbed business shall not sell the use of a sunbed on a sunbed premises to a person unless-- (a) the owner, manager or employee has assessed the person&rsquo;s skin type in accordance with the Fitzpatrick skin photo type classification system; or<br />(b) the person has provided the owner, manager or employee with a certificate from a medical practitioner that certifies that the medical practitioner has assessed the person's skin type in accordance with the Fitzpatrick skin photo type classification system and states the results of that assessment. (2) A person whose skin type is assessed as Type I or Type II under subsection (1)(a) or (b) shall not be permitted to use a sunbed on the sunbed premises. <br />(3)A person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2) commits an offence. </blockquote>Section 5 is similar and the wording is a repeat of 4A(1), except the latter section uses the term &quot;A person shall not sell&quot; instead of &quot;The owner, manager and employee ... shall not sell&quot;.<br />That is the gist of both amendments to sections 4 and 5.  That is the kernel of it and the intent is self-evident.  I do not expect the Minister to indicate at this point but I hope that over the intervening period he will give serious consideration - preferably favourable consideration - to their inclusion on Report Stage, and in his name if possible.</p></speech>

I should have asked the Minister the following question when discussing the section on regulation.  Can he clarify the sort of regulations he intends to have that will warn people about the dangers posed by sunbeds at the location of their use?  Will the regulations include a reference to the skin types that are most vulnerable to damage from the use of sunbeds?  How will they be enforced?  Using sunbeds is not the same as smoking cigarettes, which automatically carry a warning on every package, because warnings about sunbeds will be hidden behind closed doors.  I also thank the Irish Cancer Society for the work it has done on this matter. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.719" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="18:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014041500004#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill, which I welcome wholeheartedly.  I also thank him for the work he has done on the legislation.</p><p>  The legislation is directed at people using sunbeds who are under 18 years of age, but I worry about people who are over that age.  I also worry about people around 18 years of age who work in sunbed salons but do not understand how dangerous sunbeds are.  When a constituent of mine went to use a sunbed, the lady in attendance switched on the machine but just told him to get on to the sunbed.  She gave him no directions whatsoever.  He put the cleaning agent provided for the sunbed on his skin, believe it or not, and got very badly burned.  As a result he could not work or anything else.  Directions are given such as "Do not use a sunbed if you have had skin cancer in the past."  Unfortunately, what a person goes into any of these salons, he or she just signs a document without reading it, and I worry that such practices will continue.</p><p>  I know other members are worried about skin colour, and I have read the submission.  I too would like the Minister to look at the matter before we commence Report Stage.  I understand that there may be legal problems around this, but it has been legislated for in other countries.  Why can we not legislate for it here?</p><p>  I want the Minister to address the use of sunbeds by those over 18, maybe 19- to 21-year olds, because they are still young and they may not realise the dangers of sunbeds and that one can get badly burned.  We advised the constituent I mentioned earlier to go to a solicitor to see if he could pursue the matter legally.  That is the point I would like to make for older people.</p></speech>

It has received universal approval and acceptance, so I hope it will be embraced in terms of the message it sends out.</p><p>  I assume members will have seen the amendments suggested by the Irish Cancer Society.  I am not sure whether they have been circulated to everyone but I imagine that they were.  My query is about skin types 1 and 2.  We are banning sunbed usage for under 18s and it is a given that everyone will comply.  There could be legal obligations with regard to identifying people based on a skin type to determine whether he or she can use a sunbed, which I accept.  We will table amendments with the sole purpose of trying to tease out some way of addressing the matter through strong advertising and placing an obligation on people to inform users of sunbeds that if they have skin type 1 or 2 they are more likely and have a greater chance of contracting skin cancers such as melanoma.  I am not sure whether we can do this, but I understand the difficulties the Minister is faced with.  The amendments still merit tabling, if only to see if we can come up with an imaginative way to raise awareness of the dangers posed to individuals with skin types 1 and 2 among the broader public.  Also, the operators of sunbed premises should have a responsibility placed on them to inform each and every person who enters their premises of the risks involved.  I refer to the risks that are more prevalent in people with skin types 1 and 2 as identified under the Fitzpatrick skin type classification.  That is my purpose.  We live in a world with constraints, and people have civil liberties, rights and entitlements.  Equally, there is an obligation on the Minister, his Department, the HSE and everybody concerned to minimise the risks to individuals.  We should at least have an education programme.  There should be an obligation on people to inform others of the risks associated with using sunbeds.  </p><p>  When it comes to cigarettes, we do not expect every shopkeeper to tell the purchaser that cigarettes are bad for him or her.  Packets carry warnings that provide people with enough information that cigarettes are bad.  Anybody who buys cigarettes now but is not aware that they are bad for one's health has not been living in the same environment as the members and I for the past number of years.</p><p>  With regards to sun damage, an awful lot of people go on holidays every year.  Advertising campaigns have advised people to use sun cream, etc. with a high factor to protect them from the damaging effects of the sun.  However, people still insist on travelling to Spain, togging off and getting sunburnt in the hope of enhancing their tans.  Therefore, we must find clever ways to target groups of people.  The cohort of people that we wish to speak to may not be the kind who listen to us in general.  They are younger, full of the joys of life and confident, yet year in, year out one sees them on holidays pasting themselves with sun enhancers instead of sun protection.</p><p>  What if we are restricted in warning people due to a lack of legislation that targets groups with certain skin types?  I hope the Minister will introduce robust regulation to oblige users and suppliers to address the issue.</p></speech>

I would have very strong views on this issue.  I am a great believer in prevention being better than cure.  Healthy Ireland, the cross-Government initiative to improve the nation's health is very important and is the first of its type.  That picture of the Cabinet holding it up was alluded to at a WHO conference in Europe last week.  We are involved in many important public health initiatives around tobacco, as Deputy Billy Kelleher has alluded to, and around exercise, the challenges that obesity and overweight present, the challenges in this area and around alcohol abuse.</p><p>  We are continually accused of being a nanny state.  We have made it clear we are not a nanny state, that we believe in the constitutional rights of Irish citizens.  I have the highest respect and regard for the Irish Cancer Society and consider an ally in the fight against both cancer and other public health threats, but I do not believe we have the right under the Constitution to interfere with adults if they decide to engage in risky behaviours.  Therefore, I cannot ban adults from smoking cigarettes even though we know that one in two habitually develop cancer, which is a tobacco related illness.  Nobody is suggesting that we do that and nobody is suggesting that we ban alcohol.  I do not know how one would go about preventing people drinking excessively.  We can take a range measures such as minimum pricing of advertising and reducing the exposure of young people to alcohol but we will not ban alcohol.</p><p>  The whole issue around skin type is not as easy as it sounds.  Many doctors will have difficulty in deciding whether a person has type 2 or type 3 skin while they might find it easy to decide on type 1.  In any event, one is saying to me, as an Irish citizen with type 1 skin, that I do not have the same rights as persons with type 2, 3, 4 or 5.  I do not think that will wash with the Irish people.  We have to do what is sensible and reasonable and what people can adhere to without ending up needlessly being challenged in the courts.  We would then have to go back to the European Union which would involve more delay.  This Bill is a long time coming.  My predecessor, Mary Harney, tried to get this Bill through.  It has taken that length of time to get it to this Stage and I do not want it delayed any further.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Billy Kelleher about highlighting the dangers to people with skin types 1 and 2 and advertising and the education programmes that need to be undertaken.  Banning adults and discriminating against particular skin types is not an area I want to get into nor is it an area with which I want to be associated.  We all have equal rights to do the right thing and to make our mistakes as well.  We do our best to advise people not to make the mistakes.  We have a particular duty of care to children, for whom we cannot allow other to make mistakes.  When it comes to themselves I do not think we have the right to do that and I would not be supportive of this approach.  I say that as a doctor.  My job, as a doctor, as far as I was concerned was to advise people but the ultimate decision about their health is made by themselves.  They do so with the fullest information I could make available to them.  It is not, "do as you are told".  Life is not like that, and we all acknowledge that in our own way.  </p><p>  I have no problems with the amendments being tabled, that is Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's right.  We should talk to them again because, as Deputy Billy Kelleher has said, that would highlight the danger particularly to people in this area.  We will ensure that this health warning is displayed in all places where sunbeds are used, that a form is signed by customers using the sunbeds stating that they understand the risks to them, including the cancer risk, and that it has been explained properly to them to their satisfaction.  That form will have to be held by the operator for at least two years after treatment has ceased.  We are being very careful to warm people at every level about the dangers but, at the end of the day, an adult has the right to make the decision for himself or herself.  I believe we have to respect that.  We are not accepting this amendment  </p></speech>

There is a misnomer by some people in terms of exposure to harmful radiation be it from sunbeds or the sun.  In tandem with the Bill there is a need to engage in an extensive programme with the Department of Health and the Irish Cancer Society to raise awareness around the harm issue.  I take the Minister's point that the Irish Cancer Society makes a very strong case in respect of certain skin types.  While the Minister has made his point, some people just do not get the message.</p></speech>

Having said that, we will run an advertising campaign around the launch of this when the Bill is passed.  There is no doubt about that.  It would be timely if it was coming into the holiday season.  I would like if we could get this through before the First Holy Communion season begins because we want to make it absolutely clear to people that it will then be illegal to subject one's child to sunbed use, unless under medical direction for a particular health condition.  I saw a note here earlier stating that the chief medical officer, CMO, in 2009 advised that the higher risks for sections of the adult population could be dealt with by way of regulation rather than prohibition and that the national cancer control programme confirmed a similar view in 2011.  I hope I have made my position clear.  That is not in any way to denigrate any of the points made.  It is very useful to have had this discussion and I hope it generates more awareness around the dangers of sunbed use and not only sunbed use but, as Deputy Kelleher said, the dangers from ultraviolet light both here and abroad when one goes sunbathing if one does not use the proper protection.</p></speech>

I would hope that any media following this discussion would join in the effort of the dissemination of information for the widest possible public purposes.  That is very important.  I reserve the right to table the amendments which we have discussed.  This focus will be further served by its address again on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  In the meantime the reason I was particularly anxious that the Minister would not give us a definitive response this afternoon was that I wanted to leave as much room as possible for lobbying for his employment of the greatest mental agility possible in the intervening period.  We will not take that as an absolute position.  We will leave the door a little open and see where it brings us.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that the use of sunbeds will be restricted only in respect of those premises?  Is it not the case that regrettably, there still will be potential for people foolishly to employ their own facility or that of a neighbour, a friend or a member of their extended family if they have such in their possession?  The adoption of this amendment, which I do not oppose, more firmly directs the legislative impact on sunbed premises, as against the use of sunbeds in respect of those who are under 18.  I do not raise this point to be contentious but the Minister should say more than he has on this matter, because there is a much wider usage than simply in sunbed premises and I am anxious to hear what the Minister may believe he can do about that.  Perhaps he cannot do something at this point and perhaps other considerations will arise from this brief exchange.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.742" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/952" speakername="James Reilly" time="18:35:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014041500006#F01100"><p>Unfortunately, one cannot prohibit the use of sunbeds in private homes.  It is only in areas in which there is supervision and that means professional premises.  In addition, it affects those who hire sunbeds, as I am making it illegal to hire out a sunbed to anyone under the age of 18.  That is as far as I can go and that is the reason it is important to promulgate the message that hundreds of people die annually from malignant melanoma and that one's greatest risk is if one was exposed to ultraviolet light under the age of 12, which specifically relates to those of holy communion age.  In other words, if one engages in this practice, one is doing a desperate disservice to one's child's by exposing him or her to a shocking risk later in life.  As matters stand, one cannot do this at home but as I stated, it can be done in supervised areas.</p><p>  The Bill will bring within its scope sunbed use in commercial premises, as well as the sale and hire of sunbeds.  It will not be possible to regulate the use of sunbeds in private dwellings that have been purchased by a person over the age of 18.  The Constitution protects the dwelling of a citizen in this regard.  Similarly, with other harmful substances such as tobacco, it is not possible to enter a private dwelling unless a warrant from a court is obtained.  Responsibility with regard to activities in private dwellings rests with parents and it will be important to make parents aware of their responsibilities in such situations.  In this regard, it will be a requirement that information will be given to anyone who proposes to hire or to purchase a sunbed that will advise him or her of the health risk of using sunbeds and that those under 18 should not use them.  In February 2014, I called on parents to act responsibly when it comes to permitting or encouraging their children to use sunbeds.  I stated that while parents may think they are doing something positive by allowing their children to use a sunbed, as I have just pointed out, they are risking their children's health.  Parents must act responsibly to protect their children and there is no justifiable reason to allow the use of sunbeds by children under the age of 18 years of age in any setting.  However, I am constrained by the Constitution when it comes to private dwellings, just as one cannot prevent people from smoking at home where there are children.</p></speech>

Again, while I will not oppose the amendment, I hope that in the fullness of time - I do not question the Minister's resolve - the wider community resolve to address this matter more substantively ultimately will see a ban on its use, end of story.</p></speech>

Section 9(2) enables the Minister to prescribe as prohibited certain marketing practices for the purpose of protecting public health and to reduce the risk to health arising from the use of sunbeds.  It will be an offence for a person to offer a sunbed free of charge or to contravene the regulations under subsection (2).  Subsection (4) provides for a non-exhaustive definition for the use, sale or hire of a sunbed at reduced prices or free of charge, including the awarding of bonus points, loyalty card points or any similar benefit arising from the use, purchase, sale or hire of a sunbed.

In amendments Nos. 6 and 7 I seek to change the reference to the word &quot;safe&quot;.  Under the section heading of &quot;Training&quot;, section 14(1)(<i>a</i>) refers to &quot;training leading to a qualification in the safe use of sunbeds&quot;.  Section 14(3) goes on to provide that &quot;Prescribed training may include training on ... the safe use and operation of sunbeds&quot;.  It strikes me that through the employment of the word &quot;safe&quot; in association with the words &quot;use of sunbeds&quot;, one is giving out a bad message.  While members understand what is involved, many will not and there are others who are unscrupulous and who will use the referencing to aid and abet their own commercial interest, irrespective of the risk to those who will use the service provided.  I believe the use of the phrase &quot;safe use of sunbeds&quot;, against everything I already have said and, with respect, what the Minister has stated here this evening, is a contradiction.  It simply does not rest with me.</p> <p>This legislation does not bestow the word "safe" in terms of the use of sunbeds, rather it bestows authorisation in that respect over and above a particular age limit and within specified, confined areas of business practice.  We should change the word "safe" for all the reasons I suggested and employ the word "authorised".  That is the real intent of the legislation.  The purpose and intent of the legislation the Minister has brought forward, which I support fully, is weakened by employing the use of the word "safe" in this regard.  There is not a qualification in the safe use of sunbeds; there is a qualification certainly in the authorised use of sunbeds, FTB, for the time being until wiser days present.  </p><p> I hope the Minister will concur with my reasoning in this regard and accept the amendments that are intended only to ensure that the Bill has no weakness that others could exploit and that we hold to a language in regard to sunbeds that will allow us all come back at this at some point in time in the future.  It will be more difficult for us to wrestle with this issue following our having employed references such as "safe use".  That immediately places a further obstacle to the arguments we can consider on another day.  My appeal to the Minister is to accept what I hope are common-sense reasons behind changing the use of the word "safe" in regard to both of these subsections of section 14 and accepting the word "authorised", which I believe is more appropriate.  </p></speech>

The primary objective of the Bill is to protect children and those under 18 years of age from the risk of skin damage from the use of sunbeds in view of their increased risk of developing skin cancer, and we are all agreed on that.  It is also to regulate the use of sunbeds by those over 18 years of age so as to reduce their likelihood, among other things, of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and damaging their eyes from exposure to ultraviolet radiation and to generally promote a greater public awareness across all age groups with a long-term view to reduce the incidence of skin cancers.  The WHO has advised that without trained staff and adequate advice the potential for harm for the uninformed consumer is much greater.  The WHO has further noted that in a largely unregulated industry where training of staff is not mandatory, this increases the health risks considerably.</p><p>  I acknowledge the Deputy's point that the use of the word "safe" in the context of sunbeds is somewhat problematic but it is necessary in order to minimise the harm such equipment can do and for that reason I cannot accept the Deputy's proposed amendment, particularly because he used the word "authorised", which implies that we are authorising these premises which we are not.  What we are doing is mandating who can use them and who cannot and the training that must go with them.  If we were seek to authorise all these premises, we would be into a whole new raft of legislation.  I am not being difficult, we have considered this word and other words such as "appropriate" and words like that, but it comes back to the same problem.  They all give somewhat of a message that if we use the word "safe" that it is safe, whereas what we are saying is that it is safer at the end of the day to have them regulated, make sure they are hygienic and ensure that the customer is informed of the risk, but not safe in so far as people should not be using them at all.  However, we are limited by EU law and by where we find ourselves.  I know what the Deputy is trying to say and I share the sentiment, but we looked at this and certainly the word "authorised " is not one we could use because that implies authorisation and we are not authorising these premises.</p></speech>

There is no doubt in my mind, and I cannot believe there is a doubt in minds of others here, regarding the use of the word "safe" in this legislation in the context of the employment of sunbeds.  It is a contradiction in terms.  We are sowing the seed of further difficulties that will present when we will want to revisit this issue at some point in time in the future, which I believe we should.</p><p>  On the point the Minister made regarding the word "authorised", we are not talking about the authorisation of premises.  The inclusion of my amendment would read "the authorised use of sunbeds" - it is not about the premises.  The wording of the subsection is "training leading to a qualification".  Training is absolutely essential.  I understand fully what while sunbed use is allowed that those who are employed in its use by paying customers, or whatever the case may be, must have the highest qualification.  They must be the best informed possible in order to ensure the best protections that can be secured or available, but we are looking here at the authorisation of the use of sunbeds as against the premises.  I am not hung up on the word "authorisation" or the word "authorised" if that is something that presents a problem.  I am not prepared to accept that we are in any way restricted by EU this, that or the other.  This is about our moving forward our domestic legislation in order to protect those under the age of 18 in the first instance.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for its help and contributions.  I concur with the other members that our whole purpose here is to improve legislation.  No one has a monopoly on wisdom and it is important to remember that 850 new cases of melanoma occur in Ireland each year.  Our message to parents is they should not do anything that makes their child likely to be one of those cases in later life.  Each year, 150 Irish people die from melanoma and at present, 7,000 people in Ireland are living with this type of cancer.  Moreover, while the cost of treating it has ranged from &euro;6,000 to &euro;10,000 per patient, with newer treatments the cost now is more like &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000 per patient.  It is important that governments pay more than lip service to prevention.  They must pay for it because unless it is paid for now, our children will pay dearly for it down the road.</p><p>  There also is misinformation abroad, such as the claims that sunbeds can help with vitamin D deficiencies.  This is the reason these claims are prohibited unless they are prescribed in regulations.  As Minister for Health, I can state these measures and others being pursued in the public health arena are designed to promote healthy lifestyle choices among people in Ireland.  However, I reiterate what I said earlier, which is that as a doctor, as a politician and as a Minister for Health, I do not believe one should proscribe people from doing things.  They should be advised, informed and empowered to make the right decision but the decision is theirs, once they become adults themselves.  However, one has a duty of care to the children and they must be protected at all possible times.  I thank everyone for their participation in today's Committee Stage debate and look forward to the passage of the Bill later in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee I welcome the association's president, Mr. Liam O'Neill, and director general, Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy.<br />I draw witnesses&rsquo; attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other documents witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website following the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I now call on Mr.Duffy to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

We are particularly glad to do so in light of some of the comment prompted by our decisions.  At the first meeting we convened to set in motion the process of negotiations for the broadcast rights, Mr. O'Neill and I set down the objectives we hoped to achieve.  At the top of the list, receiving a necessary priority recognised by all of us in Croke Park, was the need to make our games available to Irish people living abroad.  This issue of accessibility to our games on live television has been over the years by far the single biggest issue raised with us when we spoke with our members outside Ireland.  In planning our negotiations of the new contracts, the GAA felt it had an obligation to Irish people living abroad to respond to their appeals on this issue if for no other reason than the fact that many of them while living at home had contributed to the association as members and were now continuing that work in GAA clubs abroad.</p><p>  There are now 392 affiliated GAA clubs overseas, double the number of a decade ago, and they are spread across the world in Britain and North America, continental Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Asia.  This is, in part, an indication of the popularity of Gaelic games and a reflection of the sheer size of the Irish family abroad and this expanding Irish family was the new reality facing the GAA as it approached the negotiations for new broadcast contracts.</p><p>  Few, if any, people in this room have not had personal experience of the sorrow that emigration brings. The most painful separation is that caused by the parting from family and friends but there is also the separation from one&rsquo;s culture.  It is fair to say that, for many Irish people, the GAA and its games are an important part of the daily Irish cultural experience.  Many Irish people love Gaelic games and, for those of them who live abroad, not being able to follow them through live television coverage in their homes is a privation.  It is this cultural yearning that we in GAA headquarters have been made constantly aware of with increasing intensity over recent years.  When Mr. O'Neill and I first convened to consider the new television rights contracts, we knew that we had to address this issue head on. </p><p>  This was the priority issue in our approach to the rights negotiations but we wished to achieve two other important objectives.  First, we needed to ensure our games would continue to be widely available on television and radio to our domestic audience.  Our home base of members and supporters, attached to their clubs and counties, constitute our single most important audience.  Second, we needed, as any responsible organisation must do, to protect the important part of our revenue generated by income from broadcast rights.  The GAA can only achieve its sporting and cultural goals if it retains its capacity to fund the work of its clubs at home and abroad.</p> <p>These were our objectives, and I will speak about the solutions we adopted to meet these objectives.</p><p> I will deal with the financial or revenue issue immediately as it can be very quickly addressed.  It is a simple fact that in revenue terms the total value of the new broadcast contracts is only marginally an improvement on the previous contracts.  Quite simply, finance was not the key priority in our negotiations.  </p><p> I will summarise the main elements of the agreements we reached with our broadcast partners, which were designed to meet our objectives of making our games accessible to our Irish audiences at home and abroad.  First, five more championship games have been made available for TV broadcast for the next three years - 45 versus 40 - compared to the period 2011 to 2014.  Second, RTE will broadcast the same number of games as under the previous contract, a total of 31.  We would also point out that RTE asked to broadcast 31 live games.  RTE has been granted exactly the number of games it wanted to broadcast.  Third, Irish people living in Britain will, for the first time, be able to watch matches live via Sky Sports, which will exclusively broadcast 14 games in total, eight of which are qualifier games.  To view these games will require a subscription to Sky Sports.  In a simulcast arrangement with RTE, Sky will broadcast live the all-Ireland football and hurling semi-finals and finals.  Fourth, Irish people in Australia will, for the first time, be able to watch live TV coverage of Gaelic games; they will be able to watch all 45 championship games free-to-air.  </p><p> The UK and Australia are by far the two most important destinations for Irish emigrants in recent years.  The GAA's experience confirms that more than half of the players transferring out of Ireland have gone to clubs in Britain, with Australia providing the next highest number.  In addition, millions of viewers in the UK and Australia will be able to watch our great games of hurling and Gaelic football for the first time on TV in their own homes.  Fifth, a new joint venture with RTE Digital will provide access to all championship games to Irish people all over the world by means of the Internet.  This is a hugely significant development for Irish people abroad.</p><p> Of the 18 most important championship games of the year - namely, the six provincial finals, the six all-Ireland quarter finals, four all-Ireland semi-finals and the all-Ireland finals in hurling and football - 16 will be broadcast free-to-air on RTE.  Only two quarter finals will not be free-to-air.</p><p> As a conclusion to this summary of the new TV broadcast contracts, Mr. O'Neill and I would like to point out that there has never been so much live TV coverage of Gaelic games.  In other words, the GAA has done all in its power in recent years to make its games available to its domestic audience while at the same time protecting for supporters the special experience of attending games. </p><p> With these new contracts, over 100 games will be broadcast free-to-air in each of the next three years, covering all levels of GAA competition - senior, minor, under-21, colleges and universities.  Over the years there has been a constant increase in live TV coverage of our games.  Therefore, we do not believe that the charge made against the GAA of disenfranchising its supporters is sustainable.  There is not a single weekend from the third weekend in May to the start of October on which live GAA championship matches will not be available on free-to-air terrestrial TV.  In fact, the new broadcasting contracts ensure free-to-air live TV coverage of GAA games on at least 40 of the 52 weekends of the year.</p><p> We would also point out that it has never been the case that all championship games have been broadcast live on domestic TV - far from it.  We have, at best, allowed only about half of our championship games to be covered on live TV, a fact that our critics have not taken into consideration.  We have always had to find the balance between live TV coverage and the need to encourage our supporters to attend GAA matches.  The presence of supporters at matches is the lifeblood of our games and is vital to the special atmosphere of the GAA matches.  There is nothing new in the fact that a very substantial proportion of our championship matches are not being broadcast live on TV - quite the contrary.  In order to follow the fortunes of their county team, supporters of Gaelic games have long been going to matches or following progress on radio or watching highlights on TV.  In this respect, the new TV contracts change absolutely nothing.</p><p> We have said that we set ourselves three objectives in approaching the negotiations on the new broadcast contracts, but, as everyone can appreciate - especially those who have ever been involved in commercial negotiations - objectives can, in whole or in part, be somewhat in competition with each other.  Specifically, we saw immediately that it would not be possible to fully satisfy our objectives with regard to making our games available on live TV to our domestic Irish audience and to our Irish audiences abroad.  I want to make a crucial point about our approach to these negotiations.  Due to the unfortunate return of Irish emigration and due also to the presence abroad of Irish people from previous phases of emigration, it is no longer tenable for the GAA to regard the Irish audience for Gaelic games as simply being Irish people living in Ireland.  There are now so many Irish people living abroad, so many Irish people who are GAA supporters and who want to see our games live on TV, that we simply must take them into consideration when negotiating broadcast contracts.  That being the case and in order for us to cater for these Irish people living abroad, the new contracts will see a relatively small reduction in the number of free-to-air games available to the Irish audience at home.  This was the balance we had to strike in seeking to meet the competing claims of our two very different audiences, the audience at home and the audience abroad.  It is simply not possible, in the current configuration of the delivery of television sport, for the GAA to ensure free-to-air coverage of all its games while at the same time making its games accessible to Irish people at home and abroad.  To put it another way, if we had decided that all TV coverage of our games was to be free-to-air, we would have had to abandon what we saw as our obligation to our Irish supporters abroad and we felt we could not do this.  We believe that we have achieved a balance in the allocation of broadcast rights that meets the needs of our supporters at home and abroad, a balance that we will seek to maintain into the future.  We will monitor the impact of these arrangements over the next three years and we want to make it absolutely clear today that it is the intention of the GAA that beyond 2017 our games will continue to be widely available free-to-air on TV to Irish audiences.</p><p> There has been a cynical reaction by some to the announcement of the new contracts.  Cynicism has always been the easy refuge of those who are afraid to engage in analysis and reasonable debate.   I refer to the cynical claim which would have it that the GAA went to Sky for the money; not only is this not true, but it also conveniently avoids noticing the recent announcement of a major investment by the GAA in redeveloping the Ruislip grounds in London, a project also made possible by financial support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The London redevelopment will serve not only the GAA but  also the whole Irish community in London.  It is a tangible example of the GAA&rsquo;s commitment to the Irish community abroad.  It is also a manifestation of our awareness that the GAA cannot treat our members and supporters abroad as second-class Irish citizens.  It is worth recalling that the investment in redevelopment in Ruislip is just one example of the manner in which the bulk of the GAA&rsquo;s revenue goes back out to GAA units to help fund their sporting, cultural and social missions.</p><p> We cannot overcome the barriers of physical separation and distance created by emigration, but new forms of communication allow us to create links that will mitigate that separation.  It is our hope that as this year&rsquo;s championships progress, the Irish at home, who have lost a small number of free-to-air TV games, will feel that giving up these few games is a small price to pay as they hear back how their family members and friends abroad are following Gaelic games live on TV or on the Internet.</p> <p>For the Irish abroad, for the next three years, watching GAA championship hurling and football matches live on television or on the Internet will make them feel a little closer to home.</p></speech>

The reason for the meeting is to give them an opportunity to explain the rationale behind the deal and it gives members the opportunity to convey the concerns heard on the ground when it was announced.

The reaction of some was as if all games had been taken away from free-to-air broadcasting, which is not true as the witnesses have explained.  Sometimes the facts get lost in this and the Government is blamed for many things.  It was blamed for this deal but, for anyone who does not understand, it is a deal between the GAA and the broadcasters.</p><p>  The 45 games that are free-to-air in Australia is a welcome development.  Could that have been made possible in another way without linking up with Sky?  With regard to the RTE digital deal, whereby people can access games on laptops and computers, is it free or will people pay subscriptions?  The presentation referred to a concern I have heard, that in three years' time more games will be taken away from free-to-air and given to Sky.  Since the deal was announced, there was speculation within the GAA, with the suggestion from Peter McKenna that there will be some negotiation with Sky in respect of deals for clubs getting discounts on subscriptions.</p></speech>

The RTE digital service across the world will be a subscription service as it is not feasible or financially viable to make it a free service.  The rates have not yet been fixed and we are in discussion with RTE so it has not yet been announced.</p></speech>

This will not be particularly profitable.  To make the service available all over the world will be expensive but we have not yet fixed rates.</p><p>  The Chairman asked whether we had to go with Sky.  We offered the opportunity to tender to every conceivable broadcast unit in the United Kingdom, including the BBC, ITV and Channel 4.  The BBC was only interested in teams involved in the Ulster championship and had no interest beyond that.  We received no bids from ITV or Channel 4.  The only broadcaster available to us, if we wanted to make the games available at home available to those in Britain, was Sky.  We were grateful that Sky showed an interest because there were no other bids on the table.  The BBC received the same tender documentation as Sky, as did ITV and Channel 4 but there was no interest.</p><p>  I hope I addressed the Chairman's question about three years time in my opening statement.  We are trying to achieve a balance.  It was carefully stated in our opening remarks that, this time, we have achieved a balance, looking after the needs of the domestic audience at home, who will see 31 live championship games and 100 live games over the course of the year, and the audience abroad.  We think we got the balance right but we will monitor it.  We have no intention of putting all our games on a subscription channel.  It is a matter of balance and we, along with the team in Croke Park, will work hard to achieve the balance.  We believe we have achieved it.</p><p>  With regard to the Chairman's final question, Sky is looking at a package for GAA clubs and, hopefully, progress will be made over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Every member of the committee is cognisant of the exceptionally good work the GAA does and the leadership it has shown in developing the sport at local and national level, including the investment the organisation makes.  Any comments I make at variance with where the witnesses are on the issue should not be seen as negative towards the wonderful work it does.</p><p>  Mr. Duffy says "if we had decided that all TV coverage of our games was to be free-to-air, we would have had to abandon what we saw as our obligation to our Irish supporters abroad".  We are all cognisant of the diaspora and their needs.  Could the reach to the diaspora not have been achieved through the RTE digital channel, which would not require taking certain games away from the free-to-air platform?  I understand that the coverage is free-to-air in Australia and access to the diaspora could have been achieved through that platform without abandoning the obligation.</p><p>  What unique access does Sky Sports have to the diaspora that other free-to-air broadcasters do not have?  I accept the point made but we must take into consideration the RTE digital platform and Channel 7 in Australia.  Could the GAA not have achieved the objective, particularly given that finance was not a key priority?  The witnesses emphasised that the benefit is marginal.</p><p>  We understand the need to trade off certain issues.  What about the people left at home?  What does the GAA say to the elderly club stalwart who lives in rural isolation and has participated in our national games, played the game, worked in the club, lined the fields and cut the grass but is unable to afford the Sky Sports package?  What does the GAA say to them if their county happens to be playing?  The big game for these people is when the county is playing.  What if it happens to be an event that is on the Sky platform?  What do the witnesses say to the family, the husband and wife with three kids who cannot afford the Sky package because of the economic circumstances?  They are left with Hobson's choice and the trade-off of going to the pub to watch the game and introducing children to pub culture or staying at home and not watching the game.  Some 14 games have been designated but people from the counties playing on a particular Saturday or Sunday are left with Hobson's choice.  It may be a trade-off too far.</p><p>  The witnesses' statement refers to cynical reaction by some to the announcement of the new contracts.  Perhaps the witnesses can expand on where the cynicism resides.  We have identified that this is a deal for three years.  In 2011, the GAA hierarchy told the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that it would not sell rights to a foreign channel as it was "contrary to the culture and national ethos of the association".  Two questions emanate from that.</p> <p>What has changed at the level of GAA hierarchy that would make a practice that was contrary to the culture and national ethos of the association acceptable now to the culture and ethos of the association?  Is Mr. Duffy not concerned that when the process of moving to a pay-per-view environment begins, the association will start to move away from the notion of volunteerism towards pay for play?  These questions need to be answered.  I am not necessarily criticising the decision the association has taken but these questions arise among the electorate, those who love the game, who have participated in it and want it to retain a connection with the culture about which Mr Duffy talked, and the core ethos of the voluntary sporting environment.  They want to see that continue.  They need to hear from Mr. Duffy and Mr. O'Neill today how they hope to preserve and maintain that ethos.</p></speech>

He did not say he was emperor of the island or of Ireland but of the Irish.  We have to consider the Irish at home and abroad.</p><p>  I am a primary school teacher and I will return to that work.  I live in a small community.  I know old and young people.  I will meet GAA people every day of my three years in office.  One month has already gone.  It is a fortnight today since the deal was announced.  I can look the Deputy in the eye and honestly say nobody has said a negative thing directly to me about it.  That is significant because of the number of people I meet.</p><p>  Apart from going to functions and meeting people in the normal course of events, I attended games in Thurles the week before last and the games in Croke Park on Sunday, where there was a wide representation of GAA people.  I spent yesterday playing with young children on the surface of Croke Park; 1,200 children played there yesterday.  Over the course of the year 12,000 children will play on the surface of Croke Park.  We are delighted to do that.  That is part of our reaching out to communities.</p><p>  We in the GAA have recognised for some time that we take our strength from communities.  From day one I pointed out to communities where clubs had been formed over 125 years ago - which are having big celebrations - that great communities were the first to form GAA clubs because they recognised something of value in the fledgling organisation and jumped in saying they wanted to be part of it.  The growth since then has been phenomenal.</p><p>  As Mr Duffy pointed out, it is a global organisation with a global responsibility.  When I meet young people, whether at home or abroad, they want to play and need to see our games.  That is why we want them at our games and why we offer such fantastic value to children, who come free to most games.  There is a minor charge because a ticket must be produced for some games.  Apart from that children are, and always will be, our focus.  The only reaction I got yesterday to the Sky deal was a thumbs-up from a family and the young people said "Well done Sky".  Children are looking forward to it because they know it will be good.  They know Sky is a byword for excellent production, coverage and hype of games and they look forward to it.</p><p>  Last October, I visited Australia for the Australasian Games, which cover New Zealand and the surrounding areas as well as Australia.  The message I heard there, as I have heard on every other visit was "Please see to it that we get our games".  Not only will the Irish in Australia be able to view the games but the millions of people who know of the association between the Australian Football League, AFL, and Gaelic games are interested in our Gaelic football and want to see it and enjoy it.  They now have a chance to do that.</p><p>  I spoke to a young man in Australia who told me two years ago he had to go to a pub to watch an all-Ireland final.  It was the early hours of the morning and the pub closed at three o'clock and he begged the barman to let him stay.  The barman said it was against the rules and he could not do it but he told him he could turn the television towards the window and the man could stand outside to watch it.  Can the committee picture our emigrants, our brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews or grandchildren, standing outside the window of a pub in Australia seeking to watch our games?  How glad will those people be and how glad are they now that they will have access to it?  How glad are they that not only did we go to the bother of providing the games on free-to-air, but we also have a partner there who will do that for us?  That is a huge success.</p></speech>

I accept absolutely the GAA's obligation to ensure that the diaspora is looked after but it could have gone ahead with the deal in Australia and with RTE in respect of its digital platform and it would still have had access to the diaspora, to the emigrants and would have resolved exactly the problem Mr O'Neill spoke about, without taking away the 14 games we are talking about.  Many things are getting thrown into the mix here but there is a distinction.</p></speech>

We are trying to deal with this as best we can.  I am not used to this form of questioning but I will do my best to answer the Deputy.  This is a package.  We had that person in Australia in mind.</p><p>  The central council delegate for Britain is Paul Foley.  I visited him in Cardiff last Saturday week and he told me that for years they were neglected, the broadcasters here did not make an effort to provide the games in Britain.  There is a huge Irish population in Britain.  I was with St. Colmcille's Club in Cardiff whose members said they were delighted that for the first time, the ladies particularly, will be able to tell their work colleagues this is their sport, and invite them to see it.  Millions of people will see it.  It will bring about a huge awareness of the value of Gaelic games on the island of Britain.</p><p>  Had we not thought of the emigrants we might not have considered the Sky package.  The Deputy needs to see this as a process.  It would be more fair to view it as a package rather than isolate one tiny point.  This was our aim at the start.  I have reached out and spent a good deal of time on the island of Britain, which the GAA in Britain acknowledges.  London is our biggest flagship abroad, along with New York.  They are our two biggest county boards abroad.  They were looking for help.  They wanted to be acknowledged and for us to show them that they are important to us.  While the other deal could have been done in Australia the fact that we placed the Irish abroad at the top of our agenda meant that we focused on the package that has now evolved.  One cannot isolate one incident.  We did not go to Sky.  Sky tendered and we responded.</p></speech>

This is a headline from <i>thejournal.ie</i>, 16 September 2013:<blockquote><br />GAA seeking to expand TV coverage of games for Irish people abroad<br />Director-General Paraic Duffy has confirmed the association are focusing on making the games more accessible around the world.</blockquote></p> <p>We will not make money from the Australian deal; it will probably cost us money overall.  Why would we make any arrangement other than a free-to-air deal when we are in a position to make that deal?  We are in a position to do this with Channel 7, the biggest in Australia, and it amounted to a golden opportunity but with no financial benefit in making the deal.  </p><p> As I stated, if the BBC had told us it would include 20 big championship games, including all-Ireland finals, semi-finals, etc. in free-to-air services in Britain, we would have jumped at the chance.  It did not make such an offer and neither did ITV nor Channel 4.  Sky indicated that it was willing to do so.</p></speech>

We tendered, as we have done for years, and the BBC indicated that it would like to show some games in the Ulster championship.  Every year the broadcasters receive the same treatment.  Sky was the interested party and I will tell the committee about it.  I got a text from a person in Ireland who indicated that this was a fantastic development, as his 85 year old father had for years gone to the pub to watch Irish games, but he will now be able to watch them on Sky.  There are 11 million households in Britain with access to Sky, which means that people can now watch games in their homes.  If we are genuine about spreading the games among the Irish abroad and giving them the best possible chance to watch a game, this is it.  We have received positive feedback from the GAA family abroad.  If there had been a free-to-air option, we would have taken it, but there was not.  Sky told us it wanted to show games.</p></speech>

I have the document in front of me.  At the time Eamonn Ryan was the Minister responsible for communications and there was a proposal to broadcast certain games free-to-air.  We indicated that it was the policy of the GAA to have key championship games available to all television viewers.  As I have stated in documents from both Mr. O'Neill and me, 16 of the 18 major games this year, from provincial finals upwards, will be broadcast free to air.  There is a balance to be found to meet the needs of emigrants and we have achieved it by keeping 16 of the big 18 games free to air.  What has changed since 2010?  We know from our own transfers that hundreds of thousands of young people have left Ireland and the demand from abroad to see our games is now far greater than it was in 2010.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned that all games would not be shown live on television.  I come from Monaghan and very few games involving such counties are shown live.  Our supporters are well used to watching highlights, listening to the radio or, more importantly, going to games.  We do not have the right and do not expect all of our games to be shown live on television.  No county has that right.</p></speech>

It is welcome for us to air this issue and, like Deputy Timmy Dooley, I acknowledge the contribution of the GAA for generations to Irish society in the development of national games and Irish culture.  I am a lifelong supporter of the GAA and a member, former player, administrator and chairman of a club that is over 102 years old.  That club does not have fancy bar facilities; we purely have playing facilities, a hurling wall and dressing rooms.  Having said that, I would not categorise myself as a cynic; I am a genuine GAA supporter who wants to see the organisation doing well.  The delegation should welcome genuine concerns being expressed by the membership which may not have an opportunity to express them at their level.  The GAA is a democratic organisation after all.</p><p>  The delegates have outlined the priorities behind this decision and argued that it will facilitate games being broadcast to the Irish Diaspora, which is a laudable objective that should be supported.  Like Deputy Timmy Dooley, I am concerned about how the decision was reached to do a deal with Sky pay-per-view channels.  Did the GAA actively pursue the BBC or Channel 4, for example, in order to provide coverages of games free to air in Britain?  Were documents merely sent and was it up to the broadcasters to show an interest?  Were there incentives to show games in Britain on a free-to-air system?  I am chairman of a local club and want to see this system working.  If I am wrong to raise my concerns, I will admit it.  When concerns were raised about jersey sponsorship, corporate boxes in Croke Park and live television broadcasting of matches, I supported the GAA's actions.  This time there seems to be a fundamental shift from the core ethos of the GAA, as it is the first time subscription services will be used.</p><p>  I raise these concerns for a number of reasons.  Deputy Timmy Dooley mentioned the 80 year old club stalwart; we all have such examples in our clubs.  Such persons typically do not have Sky subscriptions and do not want to go to the pub; as such they will be disenfranchised.  The GAA must accept this.  More games are being broadcast and there will probably be further chances to see a match, but if a supporter's county is playing in a qualifier or a quarter final, he or sh e may be disenfranchised as he or she will not be able to see the match, despite looking forward to it.  It is a credit to the GAA that it has progressed so much during the years in having matches covered live on television.</p><p>  There are also the expectations of players.  The GAA has argued that this is not a financial decision and although this may not be of major financial benefit to the GAA, we must be very careful.  The Gaelic Players Association has handled the issue very well with the GAA, but players are a product for a very beautiful game; therefore, will the expectation of payment arise in the future because television rights are being sold and people are paying to watch matches?  What will the GAA do to manage that expectation?</p><p>  The delegates know that volunteers in GAA clubs raise funds weekly to keep clubs going.  Despite the perception that the GAA has plenty of money, the delegates know that on the ground clubs do not have plenty of money and that people work very hard to keep them going and provide excellent facilities.  There is a perception - it may just be that - among the GAA supporting public that the organisation now has plenty of money; therefore, clubs will find it a little harder to sell the weekly lotto ticket and county draw ticket to keep going.  As there could be consequences, has the GAA considered the possibilities?</p><p>  The GAA has publicly stated any money derived from this process will go back to the clubs.  How will this happen?  Will it be given to county boards, allocated through grant schemes or other methods?  I am not a cynic, but I have genuine concerns.  I will be the first to put up my hand and say I was wrong if it turns out that way.  The GAA is a progressive organisation which deserves great credit for the stand it has taken during the years when various challenges were presented.  Croke Park was improved at a time when it was very difficult for the organisation to progress, but it has seen the rewards; therefore, it deserves all the credit it gets.  As a GAA supporter, I have genuine concerns about this fundamental shift and would like to be reassured by the delegation.</p></speech>

In the debate in the past few weeks one may sometimes have got the impression that nobody in Ireland had access to Sky.  There are 1.1 million households in Ireland with access to its services; therefore, it is not as if no one will see the games.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.828" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500007#F00200"><p>No, we did not offer incentives to the BBC to cover our games.  That was a reasonable position to take.  As far as the GPA and the issue of pay-for-play is concerned, it is important to make the point in terms of our relationship with Liam - I have handled the GPA in recent years - that one of the very first ordinances in the GPA's constitution is a commitment to the amateur status of the GAA.  In recent years in our dealings with it it has been absolutely faithful to it.  Pay-for-play is simply not an issue.  The GPA is as committed as we are to the amateur status of players and the organisation.</p><p>  In terms of money going back to clubs, it is very important to state that the overall value of the broadcast packages we have allocated is marginally higher than last time around.  The information can be accessed by anybody on a yearly basis in our annual accounts which show the total amount we receive in broadcast revenue.  One will be able to see at the end of the current financial year the difference between this year and the last year.  It is marginal.  We were not driven by financial gain but by having our games seen as easily as possible.</p><p>  I do not want to have to repeat the point over and over again, but there seems to be an idea that people are losing games that were shown in the past and that if one&rsquo;s county was playing a match, it was on television and now it will not be.  The vast majority of championship games are not shown on television.  Less than half of the games are shown.  It is not right to say that suddenly everyone has lost the right to watch games live.  If one is from Dublin, Kerry or one of the big counties, the games are always on television, but if one is from Monaghan, Laois, Carlow, Fermanagh or Longford, they were probably not shown in the first place.  It is important to keep a sense of perspective around this also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.829" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam O'Neill" time="13:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500007#F00300"><p>It is important to point out to Deputy Paudie Coffey that we welcome the opportunity and are delighted to be here.  We realise we are not just talking to the committee; we are also talking to a wider audience and some of the questions being answered are welcome.  We are happy with the process.</p><p>  When we say 86% of funds goes back to the organisation, we are not talking about handing cheques to clubs; that is not the way it works.  That is not the way the Government works either.  It works on projects through which it directs money for the greater good.  Everyone benefits from the policy.  We have a stadium in almost every county in Ireland and the upkeep cost is huge.  We have redevelopment projects.  In recent years we have ploughed huge resources into the provision of better facilities for supporters and players.  We have ploughed a huge amount of money back into clubs.  In the past ten years clubs have done an enormous amount of work for their communities, from which huge benefits have been derived.  We have enhanced communities.</p><p>  We have spent money abroad and not just in Ruislip.  We are contributing a fairly substantial figure to the development of the social centre at Gaelic Park in New York.  We have already contributed to Canton in Boston.  We support facilities in Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Cleveland and now have interest shown in Buffalo and Pittsburgh.  We will support all of these because that is important to us because people who want to play our games are important to us.  We also have two juvenile clubs in New York, Rockland in the north of the city and Shannon Gaels in Queens.  To show the power of the games abroad and how people abroad view them, following negotiations with Shannon Gaels, the city borough of Queens has offered a city park.  It is like Merrion Square being handed over to a club, which is unbelievable recognition.  The city borough recognises what our clubs abroad are doing for children, not only children of parents born in Ireland but also of people who were born in America and their friends and neighbours.  They value it.</p><p>  When I say we plough back the money, we spend a huge amount on player welfare.  We do not have an insurance scheme; we have a player injury benefit scheme, in which we invest a huge amount of money.  We invest a lot of money also in looking after communities through the community and well-being section headed by Mr. Colin Regan in Croke Park.  We have programmes such as the social initiative, the idea for which came from Mr. Martin McAleese and his wife when she was President.  The initiative started some years ago and we support it.  Every day we meet the old people to whom Deputy Timmy Dooley referred and bring them to our clubs.  We share our community centres with them, which we know is important and on which we spend money.  In partnership with the HSE, we also have a section on mental well-being.  We have an anti-suicide strategy, on which we work with the Department of Health and the HSE.  We work with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on child welfare issues.  A huge amount of our resources goes back into communities.  It is important to acknowledge this.</p><p>  It is fair to say pay-for-play has been taken off the agenda.  We do not view our players as a product; we value them.  Any time I speak to juvenile clubs, when I talk about under-age players, people at primary school level, whether we like it &ndash; we like it &ndash; I say we are in the business of child care.  We look after our children well.  We cherish them.  We cherish all of the family.  That is why we are trying as an organisation to wind back the history of the foundation of the organisation to where camogie and ladies&rsquo; football were formed separately from us.  We want to build one central organisation that will look after the family in the community and treat all young people equally.</p><p>  We have also made an offer about which Senator Eamon Coghlan is aware.  We have centres of excellence around the country.  We have identified that there could be a greater benefit from their use during the day when they are not used by us.  We have made an offer to Athletics Ireland to build athletics tracks at the centres in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We would be willing to do this.  We have facilities, in which we have invested a huge amount of resources.  We are looking after the wider community in a manner in which the organisation never had an opportunity to do before.</p></speech>

Well done to him.  We are well represented, although so far we have not troubled the GAA in championship terms very often.  We do intend to get over this.</p><p>  Like other Deputies, sometimes it feels that because we are asking detailed questions there is criticism of an organisation.  I do not think anybody could or should undervalue the great work being done by Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  It has given us and our predecessors a great deal and, undoubtedly, our successors in future generations will play and enjoy our unique Irish games.  It has given us great moments of glory and a feelgood factor that no other organisation could give.</p><p>  I understand the need for a commercial organisation.  Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael is a commercial organisation which is doing an awful lot of voluntary work, but, nonetheless, I understand it must make commercial decisions.  I accept that the decision on media rights between 2014 and 2017 had a mix of commercial considerations, although it has been said the amount of additional revenue is insignificant.  I have no doubt that commercial considerations were taken into account side by side with the need to maximise access to our beautiful games, whether in Ireland or for Irish people and others living abroad.  It is not so much a question of whether it is through a subscription channel or free-to-air.  What is important is whether the measure will be successful and the factors the GAA took into account are valid.  A report was produced by Mr. Paul Rouse, a lecturer in the school of history and archives at UCD and formerly of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; at RTE, on the impact of pay TV on sport.  It is a little out of date in that it was published in 2012 and based on 2007 data.</p> <p>He examined the Heineken Cup viewing figures for 2006 and 2007.  In 2006 the Heineken Cup semi-finals were covered by RTE and 62% of viewers watched them.  In 2007 it was covered by Sky Sports and only 25% of viewers watched it.  He also found that the first cricket test in 2004 between England and New Zealand had been covered by Channel 4.  On day five of its coverage it had over 1 million viewers.  The second test was carried by Sky Sports and there were only 85,000 viewers.  While many people have access to Sky, not many have access to Sky Sports.</p></speech>

The key point, however, is that all Heineken Cup games are shown on Sky.  Last weekend there were three Irish teams involved in the semi-finals and all three games were shown on Sky.  The point we have made is that, of our 18 biggest games, 16 will still be shown on RTE.  The Paul Rouse research has been quoted for several weeks, but it is not valid in the case of this issue.</p><p>  The viewing figures for GAA matches on RTE are by far the best of any sport in Ireland, including the Six Nations.  Two of the top six programmes on RTE last year involved GAA matches.  Thirty one of our championship games in the next three years will be shown free-to-air and I hope they will attract the same viewing figures.  Last year RTE did not cover all of the provincial finals.  This year it will cover all six.  There will be 100 live GAA games free-to-air in the next three years.</p></speech>

On the percentage of households reached by RTE and pay-TV sports channels, 99% had RTE 1 and RTE 2, 25% had Setanta, 25% had Sky Sports 1, while 17% had Sky Sports 3.  That is the scale involved.  If it was within the capability of RTE, TV3 and TG4 to handle all of the games, would we be having this discussion?</p></speech>

We want people to understand that with this media rights package we have more options.  We now know we can partner with a subscription channel, go digital and still use the tried and trusted methods that were available.  This deal means that the family in New York that wants to watch our games does not have to go to a pub at 9 a.m.  I have received correspondence from players with Shannon Gaels in New York on this issue who are delighted they will be able to bring in their neighbours for games in the morning and share a communal experience in their own home.  That strikes at the very core of everything that matters when abroad.  It means that people will watch the same game in real time around the world and be able to communicate simultaneously about a fantastic goal scored or so forth.</p><p>  One of the best reactions I received on the deal that will bring the games around the world on hand-held devices was in Bahrain at the GAA mid-east tournament.  A nurse from County Galway told me that being able to watch games abroad would be like a Band-Aid on a homesick heart.</p> <p>That is the core of what we have done here.  We have reached out to our people and done our best.  It is a package and we want people to view it as such.  That person's reaction is typical.</p></speech>

I have no questions but will make some brief points because people on my side have not been able to get a word in.  I welcome the deal.  The witnesses have illustrated some of the comments of those who have had to leave this island.  I will give an additional illustration of why this is good for those who left, whether by choice or not.  A family member told me by e-mail that the news of this deal was celebrated in the Irish club in Melbourne 24 hours after the GAA's decision and was the talk of the entire evening.  Whatever the reservations of politicians here in Dublin, the GAA is way ahead of us, because those who have left have made up their minds that it is very welcome.  On that basis I support it fully.</p><p>  Mr. Duffy referred to cynical comment.  I draw my own conclusions on this.  Some people have a hang-up about Rupert Murdoch and the sort of person he is.  I hope he does not take me to court for this, not that I care too much.  His dealings are his own.  From what I know about the man, I have full faith-----</p></speech>

I have great faith in the GAA's ability to negotiate with Rupert Murdoch, with a contract in one hand and a hurling stick in the other, which they would certainly need dealing with him.  I compliment the GAA on that.  The Deputies on the other side live in the beautiful countryside.  Clare is my favourite county.  I doubt there is a man or woman in any remote part of Clare who would not walk to hell to see Shane O'Donnell score a point for Clare in this year's final.  I doubt there is anybody in any remote part of County Dublin who would not walk to the nearest pub to see somebody like Eoghan O'Gara scoring a goal on Sky Sports.  That is the reality.  It is a great day.</p><p>  I am one who drifted away from the foreign game, to use that old phrase.  One Saturday a few years ago - not that I spend much time in pubs - I reached a conclusion that when I was watching league football all the people I was watching were millionaires and multimillionaires.  I sobered myself up and said never again would I watch people running around who were paid so much and were more concerned about the gel in their hair than scoring goals.  I gave up on it.  I am with the GAA.  I compliment the witnesses and I have no questions.</p></speech>

We have made a major contribution to the GAA.  Over the weekend I listened to a debate on this.  Like Deputy Coffey, we all come from very small GAA clubs which are struggling to raise funds and are finding it very difficult.  People on the ground are asking what is in it for them and they may not see the bigger picture.  Over the weekend I heard the expectation Deputy Coffey expressed.  People asked what members would receive at local level.  There is an expectation that money will trickle down to the local clubs from this deal.  I have a very open mind on this because I have seen what happens in Australia.  People raise issues with me about it and they feel the GAA might be on the slippery slope.  The witnesses said they would monitor it over the next three years.  If they find there are unintended consequences, what process will they put in place for people to be able to say they do not agree with this?  What consultation did the GAA do with its members before it concluded this deal?</p></speech>

It is being broadcast on a pay-per-view channel, so the people watching it are paying for it.  I support what the GAA is trying to do in reaching out to the disapora.  It is very laudable and good.  The GAA's president and ard sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir summed up the impact emigration has had on clubs.  I have one minor concern.  The success of this will depend on the expectation that is lifted in the countries in which the pay-per-view channel will be made available for our diaspora.  As people's expectation builds they may feed back to their subscribers or television channels that they are delighted to get the GAA in Melbourne or wherever and they want more of it.  The 14 games are ones that would otherwise not be aired.  People are anxious that there might be a temptation to release more after three years.  Neither we nor the GAA want to see a move away from the terrestrial, free element to a pay-per-view situation.</p><p>  Could the witnesses repeat the RTE digital information?</p> <p>I missed the answer; perhaps it was not clear enough or I did not pick it up properly.  Were the RTE digital channels considered with a view to seeing whether the games could be made available as a live stream on the Internet?  For argument's sake, taking out the 14 games Sky has, the most desirable games are the all-Ireland semi-finals in hurling and football and the all-Ireland finals.  I wish to ask about the relationship with TV3 and where it now fits in.  It has a role in the marketplace.  How will this be filled?</p><p> To recap, with regard to the expectations of people abroad will more pressure be brought to bear to release more games, particularly at the higher level?  Were the RTE digital channels considered?  How does TV3 fit into the situation?  What the GAA is trying to do in terms of taking its games to people outside of the country who otherwise cannot see them is something I support.</p></speech>

I commend the GAA on this branch out to reach the diaspora throughout the world.  The Gaelic Athletics Association is unique as a sports body when one considers the amateur ethos going back to its foundation 135 years ago by Maurice Davin and Michael Cusack.  It has come a long way since then.  I am delighted to hear the comments by the President with regard to the GAA going into negotiations or deliberations with the Athletic Association of Ireland.  It is a golden opportunity for the GAA to return to its roots when athletics was included in the early days.</p><p>  As a young boy, every Sunday I went to Croke Park and pulled wires with my father, Bill Coghlan, under the stewardship of Se&aacute;n &Oacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;in, when we worked on the sound system.  I had a dream of playing there.  I never had an opportunity to do so but I ran there in primary school sports.  The GAA is the lifeblood of our community.  It defines every town and parish in the country.  The country owes much to the GAA for what it has done for Irish society.  However I am a realist and we are in the 21st century.  This is a venture into the world domain to show our wonderful Gaelic games throughout the world.  The GAA is competing with other sports on an international basis for television exposure.  It is all about marketing, exposure, the big picture and tourism.  In particular it is about the exposure our country, through the medium of the GAA, will get throughout the world.  I remember marketing 101 in college when our professor entered the room in a wheelchair and the first statement he made was if one wants to make a monkey famous one puts the monkey on TV for long enough.  This is what will happen with the GAA and the brand of the sport throughout the world.</p><p>  A number of people have been discommoded because 14 games will not be shown free-to-air, but as the witnesses indicated not all of the games are shown on TV anyhow.  In recent weeks people in conversation with me have made certain comments.  They wonder whether this deal with Sky Sports will dictate the schedule of GAA games in future.  In other words, they wonder whether there will be Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Saturday night football.  They wonder whether it will affect the players who are amateur in terms of their relationships with their employers and getting off work for midweek games.  Will the GAA benefit from the advertising revenue which Sky sells?  Will the GAA benefit from subscriptions which Sky receives from people signing up to Sky Sports packages?  Well done to the GAA.  It will be great for Ireland and the youth of Ireland if the GAA decides to goes back to its roots.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.875" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500010#J00300"><p>With regard to what is in it for the clubs from their perspective if each of the 2,000 clubs received &euro;1,000 each it would amount to &euro;2 million.  Some clubs would welcome the &euro;1,000 but for others it would make very little difference.  With regard to supporting our clubs we ran a national draw on St. Patrick's day.  The GAA at national level provided all of the prizes and made all of the arrangements.  All the clubs had to do was sell tickets and keep the money.  It raised &euro;2.5 million for the clubs.  This money went directly to them and they had no costs.  No money was sent back to Croke Park.  We are concerned about our clubs.</p><p>  At the most recent meeting of the management committee we decided, because we had increased our income from this revenue, to return more than &euro;500,000 to all of the clubs.  We returned all of the membership fees they paid last year, which was &euro;1 or &euro;2 per member.  These cheques will issue in the coming weeks.  We are very concerned about putting money into our clubs.  As the uachtar&aacute;n stated earlier we must use all of our income across the board as best we can for the association and we will continue to do so.</p><p>  To answer Deputy O'Donovan's question on consultation these are commercial arrangements.  In January, the uachtar&aacute;n and I, having decided on a strategy, went to the management committee comprising 15 people, including four provincial chairmen, a representative from each province from central council and a number of external people appointed to the board.  We explained to them where we were in the negotiations and our aspirations and we got approval to go ahead.  It was not a question of two people deciding this is what we would do; we obtained the approval of the elected and appointed management committee which runs the association from year to year.  I am sure the issue will be debated at congress and central council and I am sure not everybody will agree, but from the feedback the uachtar&aacute;n and I have received to date I am confident the overwhelming majority of the membership is supportive of what we have done and what we are trying to achieve.  I want to make it very clear it was done with the blessing of the management committee as it was a very valid question.</p><p>  Deputy O'Donovan also made a point about Melbourne.  We are making 45 games available free to air and this is as good as it can be.  We want to maintain this because we feel a huge responsibility.  Many of the people who have gone to Australia are young people who were playing or attending our games before they went.  We felt a huge responsibility towards this group in particular.  We are not doing this for the money.  We are making 45 games available free to air on Channel 7.  It is fantastic for us and for the emigrants and we will try to maintain it.</p><p>  Concerns about the future have been raised.  I understand them and they are valid.  A total of 16 of our 18 big games are still free to air.  We want to maintain a balance.  Mr. O'Neill and I examined this very carefully throughout the negotiations and we believe we have a balance.  Almost all of the big games are available.  With regard to the future, the model is that this year, as well as Sky showing its own 14 games, in simulcast with RTE it will show two all-Ireland finals, two football semi-finals and two hurling semi-finals.  There is room to develop the simulcast in future.  If the number of games is increased I hope it can be done on this basis.  We are determined to maintain the balance.</p><p>  TV3 was disappointed to lose the rights.  We had a very good relationship with it in recent years.  It is a very professional organisation.  I have spoken to Mr. David McRedmond several times since and I am confident we will have a relationship with TV3 again.  It is important to us.</p><p>  I know of Senator Coghlan's long interest in the GAA and I knew his father as chairman of Bord Luthchleas na h&Eacute;ireann, BLE.  Senator Coghlan made a very good point on spreading the sports.  We are giving people across the board the chance to see our games.  The uachtar&aacute;n made the point earlier that anyone who sees hurling loves the game and that people in Australia identify easily with Gaelic football because of the Aussie rules game.</p><p>  It is important to make the point that 14 games is five more than last year, so with regard to losing free-to-air games it is a net loss of nine games.  There will be no issues with regard to scheduling games and this is clearly understood by Sky and ourselves.  We have no intention of playing games Wednesday, Thursday or Friday evenings for the reasons the Senator gave and I will not dwell on it.  As far as advertising revenue is concerned Sky will pay us a fee for the games and we are not involved in that side of it.</p></speech>

I travelled from west Cork this morning but I was caught out in Dublin by the traffic restrictions due to the protest.  I welcome the uachtar&aacute;in and ard-sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir of the GAA.</p><p>  Some of the lads here do not have inter-county experience but I was a club player for the bones of 20 years.  I was very glad to have won a Cork county senior football medal which I treasure.  I would like to touch on the following aspect again, namely, the voices that were not heard and where I come from views were divided on the deal.  I welcome the deal and view it as a positive approach.  However, I understand how the negotiations could be sensitive and kept reasonably close.  I listened carefully to the answer given to Deputy Phelan's query on the management structure.  Does the delegation envisage bringing a decision or a suite of decisions before congress on, perhaps not the minutiae, but the parameters of a commercial broadcasting deal with the GAA?</p><p>  One of the biggest problems, and one of the reasons there has been so much conversation about this matter, is due to what I call an apparent consultation lacuna, for want of a better word.  The GAA is an organisation that operates on a decision-making basis that ranges from the club, through the delegate structure and right up to congress but it cannot apply that to this decision.  Does it envisage changing that scenario?  The GAA was caught out because a potential win for the association, the games, supporters, etc., became controversial.  Does the GAA's communications strategy need to be addressed?  There was a lot of hyperbole about the decision.  There are pros and cons for any balanced decision.  Can the organisation learn something from the communications element of the decision?  </p><p>  Has the GAA assessed the impact the contract could have on games?  Gaelic games are a minority sport abroad.  Pay-per-view or subscription television, particularly by Sky, have completely changed some minority sports into commercial sports and beyond what was envisaged when the deal was originally made.  For example, the sport of darts has completely changed with such a development.  Has the GAA considered the possible impact of a contract?  Has there been any discussion about its potential?  This matter has been touched on already.  The appetite for the games to be broadcast abroad, and within Irish communities, will become insatiable.  They will want every county's games broadcast and they will demand access to them.  In trying to satisfy demand, will it lead to further issues for the GAA?  Will the matter need to be brought to congress?  </p></speech>

The GAA is a fantastic organisation.  A lot of my questions have been asked and the delegation has answered them extremely well.</p><p>  I come from a very strong GAA family, grew up around it and have seen the work of its fantastic community and what that generates.  The only fear that we would have, and Deputies O'Donovan and Harrington have touched on the matter, is that the situation might change.  Deputy Dooley read a press release from 2010 which stated that the GAA would not opt for pay-per-view but times have changed.  I agree that times change and it is fantastic that the people living abroad have been acknowledged, which was something that needed to be done, but fears remain.  An Post attended here before the committee not long ago.  On that occasion it talked about installing customer paypoints in Tesco branches which has led to a fear that post offices would disappear but An Post has said that will not happen.  Can the GAA say that it will not move away from amateur status in 2017 if, as Deputy Harrington has said, there is a demand?  Obviously the GAA depends on volunteers but if its amateur status changed the organisation would become more like the way rugby is now and like darts did when it moved to Sky.  Unfortunately, these days sports is more about money.</p></speech>

I welcome the ard-sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir and the uachtar&aacute;in of the GAA.</p><p>  Is the TG4 coverage on Saturdays set to continue?  The delegation has told us that RTE has got the 31 matches that it sought and the 100 live GAA matches will continue over three years.  The delegation did say the figures clearly.  Can it confirm the figures?  </p><p>  I second what was said by Deputy McEntee.  I wonder sometimes at the criticism levelled at the GAA when it does things like this.  The GAA is an incredible organisation and nothing like it exists anywhere else.  Let me refer to the credit that I get from my constituency in Northern Ireland, a lot of whom would be Unionists.  As TCD graduates they were absolutely delighted and charmed by the welcome they received when they played the rugby matches in Croke Park, which makes an impact on people.</p><p>  With regard to the GAA's work in communities, I recall the opening of a new field in Summerhill a couple of years and the rector, who was a woman, and the parish priest jointly opened a facility that would benefit the entire community.  I repeat that an incredible amount of work is done by the GAA.  What about people going to matches and the people who are left behind?  I was in Aughrim last year for a first round match and saw that a huge number of buses had travelled from north Meath ferrying supporters.  It felt like nearly everybody from the county had travelled to Aughrim for the match.  The GAA does not leave people out or behind.  </p><p>  With regards to the diaspora, Tommy Drumm drops in here from time to time and works in Perth.  I am sure that he will be delighted, as a former captain, that his sport has recognised the diaspora.  Now that he works abroad he will be able to see the matches.</p><p>  Sometimes I feel that the criticisms levelled at the GAA do not take into account all of the work that it does.  The last critique was on the damage that the GAA was allegedly doing by taking sponsorship from alcohol companies.  I thought that the criticism should have been more properly directed at the banks and accountants - the people who got the country into trouble - rather than an organisation which has served us so splendidly. </p><p>  I wish to refer to another matter.  We have discovered that the first Cathaoirleach of the Seanad was Dr. George Sigerson who gave the Sigerson Cup to the GAA.  We left him out of our history so it is time that the Seanad and the GAA got together and acknowledged the first Cathaoirleach even though he only served for 24 hours.  In addition to being a great supporter of the GAA he was in fact the first Cathaoirleach.</p><p>  I commend the work that the GAA has been doing on so many layers of Irish society and wish it every success.  The moneybags men have taken over the many sports that people have mentioned.  They will do serious damage to the sport of rugby, particularly in England.  However, I do not think they pose a danger because the GAA is such a democratic and participatory organisation.  I am sure that the money will be seen to filter down to clubs up and down the country and used to run the under-11s games, etc.  </p><p>  I welcome what was said by Senator Eamonn Coghlan about using the fields for athletics, if they are free.  The gates are mostly left open in the places that I have seen around.  Those who doubt the GAA should, in the next couple of months, go to the exhibition matches, before the championship starts, which are held in small villages and so on.  It is there that one will see the real heart of the organisation.</p><p>  I do not expect to be allowed into Croke Park for free.  I do not see any political or economic case to support the right to watch matches for free either.  We pay a television licence fee and have so-called free-to-air.  If a match is on a pay channel either one does not watch it or one pays.  One cannot run an organisation like the GAA without money.  I think that the GAA gives incredible value for money.  It is a naive interpretation of a property right to assume that one has a right to go into Croke Park or watch matches for free.  It is that expectation which has informed some of the debate.  There is also a mood of anger against a lot of institutions which should not be directed at the GAA for the work that it does.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.879" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/968" speakername="Pat Deering" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500011#K00400"><p>I also welcome an uachtar&aacute;in agus an ard-sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir.  As the Chairman will probably know, I started my career as a club mentor in my club and graduated through the ranks to become club secretary, club chairman and eventually county board chairman a few short years ago.  Therefore, I am well aware of the issues.</p><p>  I hail from a small county like Carlow which unfortunately does not appear regularly on television.  </p> <p>I welcome the deal, as it is an opportunity for unfortunate emigrants from my county and all others to see what we can produce from time to time.  The opportunity may arise this summer if we are fortunate enough to take part in the Leinster championship match against Wexford which I believe is one of the games that will be screened on Sky.  I am sure there are plenty of Carlow people around the world who would like to have the opportunity to see our hurlers progress in the future.  While I welcome the deal in principle, I understand from working in the GAA for many years that all of the money generated comes back to the clubs.  My club, like every other throughout the country, has benefited from that principle which I would like to see continue indefinitely.  The major concern among the vast majority at the grassroots, although the consultation process was explained, is that they have a say in the way things are done.  They would like to have the opportunity to discuss issues at club level and progress to have them discussed at congress.  They believe one has overshot the runway in not discussing the issue at grassroots level, although I take the point that it was discussed.  If it had been done in that way, there might have been more positivity.  I do not say there is negativity towards it in my part of the country; it has not been an issue and I do not think it is.  It is a major benefit for the organisation in general.  If the ordinary person at the grassroots had been more directly involved in the consultation process, they would have been happier.  </p><p> Our Gaelic games are the best in the world and we need to show them to the world.  Hurling is top class.  Last year we had the best All-Ireland hurling championship in many years and the football championship is also great.  The world needs to see our games, especially our unfortunate emigrants who do not have an opportunity to see games.  That issue needs to be discussed further.  In recent years other competing sports have developed substantially because they went down that road.  We need to be able to compete on that level.</p><p> In regard to what should happen in the future, it is important that we do not close out games free to air indefinitely.  A balance needs to be struck.  In general, I welcome the deal.  However, I hope smaller counties will benefit more substantially from whatever finances are generated.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.881" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam O'Neill" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500012#L00200"><p>There has been tremendous positivity in the last few comments which we welcome.  As Deputy Noel Harrington will be aware, there is a view on everything we do, whether at club level or anywhere else.  This will probably be known as the most divisive piece of work I have handled so far in my time as president, but actually it is not.  The process of change in society and the GAA is such that a minor change made in the Sc&oacute;r competition generated far more heat for me than this issue.  That is how life works.  Sometimes it is the small issue that creates the difficulty.  I have been subjected to no personal criticism, but much of the criticism will come from Cork.  We have a suite of decisions and this issue will be discussed up and down the country.  That is the way the organisation works.  Were we caught out by the reaction?  I think politicians should know how things are sometimes handled at the main terrestrial station and, yes, we did not expect it, but that issue has been dealt with it.  We expressed our view and will move on and hope to have a good working relationship with it.  The interesting thing about the demand from abroad is that we expect continued growth abroad.  It would have been inconceivable when the men from Cork started a hurling club in Riyadh almost 30 years ago that we would be in a position to have a county championship in the Middle East, with 40 teams taking part.  That is phenomenal growth and, of course, this will drive further growth.  A fortnight ago we welcomed a team from the townships of South Africa to various places around the country to play games.  On the way back home they won a section of the Dubai Gaelic games tournament.  We envisage, based on figures given and the drive to take Gaelic football to the townships, that within a short number of years up to 10,000 native South Africans could be playing Gaelic football.  They love the sport.  It is in tune with the way they move and they really enjoy it.  That is the consequence.  If the demand arises, we will handle it.  </p><p>  We have already made a decision that we will not control the growth of the GAA abroad from here.  We could not possibly do that.  We have established an international development committee and those who live outside Ireland will chart the growth of the GAA outside Ireland for us.  When the European county board started in 1999, there were four clubs and it was thought there would be a fifth.  There are now more than 70.  Within the past two years in Galicia in Spain four clubs started of their own volition; we had nothing to do with them.  They want to play Gaelic games.  It is interesting to note that the only place in the world where the GAA is officially part of the curriculum is Brittany in France because it saw its value.  We do not have it on the curriculum, which is unbelievable.  It is part of the curriculum in Brittany because it sees the value of our games.  We expect to see continued growth in that area.</p><p>  TG4 is doing really well.  It carries 62 games live there is deferred coverage of 22.  It carries the Electric Ireland minor finals, which are back as Gaeilge agus t&aacute; &aacute;thas an domhain orainn faoi sin.  T&aacute;imid an-bhu&iacute;och do TG4 as t&uacute;s &aacute;ite a thabhairt don teanga i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  B&iacute;mid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag lorg slite chun comhoibri&uacute; leo chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.      </p><p>  In regard to fear about the money generated, I understand from where Deputy Helen McEntee is coming.  All of this stuff has been going through our minds.  This package has not rested lightly on us.  Mr. Duffy handled the consultation issue.  We consulted our management committee.  I also asked the three presidential candidates if they were okay with it.  I wanted to make sure we were not doing anything that would damage the organisation.  The two of us have more than 30 years experience in the GAA.  We love it more than anything else in our lives and would not be in the positions we are in if we did not and we would not do anything that would harm the organisation.  We took all factors into consideration.  This is probably the most difficult decision making process in which I have ever been involved.  I have worried about it every night since and will continue to worry.  Until I see it as a success, I will worry about it because our names are associated with it.  We did not do it lightly.  Sometimes in leadership roles one has to make the hard call.  We are in the positions and it fell to us to make the call.  As we will forever be associated with it, we hope we have made the right decision.  We are not so confident or arrogant to think we have definitely made the right one.  We do not know, but we hope it will be proved in the future that we made the brave call and that Gaelic games will continue to flourish, not only on this island but around the world.  I made the point that Brian Boru was the "Emperor of the Irish".  We look after the Irish at home and abroad.  Every Irish person matters to us and we want everyone who wants to be a part of the Gaelic games family - boy, girl, man, woman - wherever they live to enjoy the experience of watching teams to develop our games.</p></speech>

Deputies Pat Deering, Noel Harrington and Helen McEntee have strong associations with the GAA and all of them expressed a fear that it is important to understand.  In 2010 we said we would always keep our games on terrestrial channels.  We could not deal with things on this occasion in the way we did in 2010 because Ireland is different.  There are far more people abroad than ever before.  The Gaelic games family abroad is far bigger than ever before.  We could not ignore them, which is reason we chose to do it in the way we did.  The key issue is that we have to have a balance in protecting the interests of our domestic audience and meeting the needs of the Irish abroad.  I do not think anything that has been said today could seriously question the fact that we have looked after both groups.  There will 100 games shown live at home; 45 will be shown free to air in Australia; and there will be 20 big games carried on Sky Sports in Britain.  </p><p>  I will make one final point about Sky Sports because in many ways today has been about why we empowered Sky Sports.  Sky Sports' production values are the highest of any organisation in the world and I believe it will bring much to the presentation of our games, which is good for everybody.  Deputy Pat Deering made a point about bringing our games to the world.  Sky Sports will help us do this and its standards will reflect well on our association.</p></speech>

To sum up, both today's debate and the interest expressed in the lead-up to it demonstrated again the importance of the witnesses' organisation throughout every town and village in the country.  Deputy Colreavy observed that counties Sligo and Leitrim do not bother Croke Park too often.</p></speech>

I believe Aer Lingus's profits also rose that year, as there are only 25,000 people in County Leitrim.  Moreover, there was no need for Sky then, because everyone was present, no one had been left in County Leitrim and the door had been shut.</p></speech>

In the days immediately after the announcement, there was a considerable amount of quick or emotive reaction.  Today's proceedings gave the witnesses the chance to articulate the rationale behind the announcement.  It also gave members the opportunity to convey the concerns and I believe this also will inform the GAA in three years' time.  Consequently, this has been a useful exercise.  I also note the witnesses readily agreed to appear before the joint committee on receipt of the first communication therefrom, for which I thank them.  I wish them well in the season ahead, as well as all the counties, wherever members may be from.</p><p>  In the absence of other business, is it agreed to adjourn until 9.30 a.m. tomorrow, when representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will appear before the committee regarding prosecutions in respect of the Go Safe speed detection vehicles?
