It is not sufficient to leave them in silent mode.  They need to be switched off, as otherwise they will interfere with the broadcasting equipment, which means that we will not be able to broadcast the proceedings.<br />Members will be aware that the European Commission recently published a communication on the voting rights of EU citizens living abroad and the impact of procedures in various countries in that regard.  The Commission has criticised Ireland for not providing voting rights for its citizens living in other member states.  With Ireland, Denmark, Cyprus, Malta and the United Kingdom have also been cited for disenfranchising voters who have exercised their right to free movement within the European Union.  At this meeting, one of a series of meetings, we will hear the distinct perspectives on the non-Government side of the House.  Fianna F&aacute;il has nominated Deputy Timmy Dooley who is no stranger to the committee to present its views.  Sinn F&eacute;in will be represented by Ms Lynn Boylan who is a member of its Ard Comhairle, while an Independent's view will be presented by Deputy John Halligan.<br />Before we begin, I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.</p> <p>They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p> We have agreed that the order of speakers will be Ms Lynn Boylan, followed by Deputy John Halligan and Deputy Timmy Dooley.  Each of our presenters has approximately five minutes to make his or her contribution, after which we will take questions from members.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.8" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Lynn Boylan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041500003#B00200"><p>I am grateful to the committee for the invitation to outline Sinn F&eacute;in's proposals on voting rights for Irish people living outside the State.  While Sinn F&eacute;in welcomes the communication from the European Commission addressing the consequences of disenfranchising European citizens, our position on voting rights for Irish citizens living outside the State predates this communication and extends beyond EU member states, because it is based on the principle of equal citizenship.  The current legislative disenfranchisement of citizens residing outside this State produces an unequal and two-tier citizenship.  Sinn F&eacute;in supports full voting rights for all Irish citizens of voting age in presidential elections, regardless of their place of residence.  This would give effect to Articles 2 and 3 of the Constitution, as amended by the Good Friday Agreement.  Emigrant citizens are effectively disenfranchised immediately on their departure and dual citizens living in the North cannot exercise their constitutional right to vote.</p><p>  Currently an anomaly exists whereby Irish citizens living outside the State may stand for the Presidency and serve as President if elected but they may not vote for presidential candidates.  For this reason we support the introduction of an express constitutional guarantee of a right to vote in presidential elections for all Irish citizens of voting age.  While the method by which this right is exercised is a matter for ordinary legislation rather the Constitution, care should be taken to ensure that Northern Unionists may also exercise this right should they so choose, without requiring them to compromise their identity or ethos.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in welcomed the Constitutional Convention's report on voting rights in presidential elections for Irish citizens living outside the State.  Seventy-eight percent of delegates to the convention were in favour of extending voting rights.  We also note, however, that the four-month deadline within which the Government was expected to respond has now passed.  We urge the Taoiseach to arrange a debate in the D&aacute;il on the matter and ask that such a debate be extended to include consideration of Oireachtas representation for Irish citizens living outside the State.</p><p>  With regard to voting rights for the Oireachtas, Sinn F&eacute;in's position is twofold.  In respect of diaspora representation, we regard the diaspora as fundamental to the Irish nation both historically and today.  If we can ask our emigrant citizens and people of Irish ancestry to support Ireland financially and in the peace process, and to otherwise maintain and promote our cultural heritage abroad, it is not unreasonable to offer those passport holders who care enough to register and vote a limited form of representation in the Oireachtas.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that such representation should take the form of a reserved constituency, which would neutralise any concerns people may have about swamping of electoral results by our large diaspora population.  This would require an amendment to Article 16 of the Constitution.  Sinn F&eacute;in does not support time limits on diaspora voting, and would instead require citizens in the diaspora to regularly register their intention to vote.</p><p>  In regard to Irish citizens living in the North, we recognise that the Oireachtas is not the Parliament of a united Ireland, but Northern citizens are nevertheless affected directly and indirectly by many of the decisions and laws made by the Oireachtas.  For this reason, Northern citizens should have the right to appropriate representation in the Legislature as a form of equal treatment for their identity, ethos and aspirations, which is guaranteed by the Irish Government under the Good Friday Agreement.  We propose that democratically elected MPs for Northern constituencies be accorded automatic membership of the D&aacute;il, where they could exercise full rights of representation on matters they consider relevant to their constituents, subject to reasonable parameters appropriate to their non-residence in this State as set out in legislation.  MPs who choose not to take their seats should nevertheless be afforded attendance and speaking rights on matters of direct concern to their home constituencies.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in's position on the Seanad is that the diaspora and Northern citizens should be represented in a reformed Seanad that is fully inclusive, representative and accountable.  We see this as taking the form of specified diaspora and Northern representation.</p><p>  Sinn F&eacute;in fully supports the extension of voting rights to Irish citizens living outside the State.  We are obliged to extend voting rights not only under our EU obligations but also under the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.  The public will to make such a change has been demonstrated in numerous polls and in the Constitutional Convention.  What is now required is the political will to make the change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1094" speakername="John Halligan" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041500003#B00300"><p>I wish to make it clear before I begin that while I was nominated by the Technical Group I do not necessarily represent the views of its members by virtue of its composition.</p><p>  More than 120 of the 196 nations in the world have enfranchised their citizens who live abroad.  Many of the nations which deny the vote are either military dictatorships or given to elections that are neither fair nor free.  Ireland falls into neither category, yet it remains one of only three EU member states to completely deny emigrants the basic democratic and civil right to vote.  It is estimated that up to 500,000 Irish people who left the country as a result of our economic problems are disenfranchised.  In the past two years alone, more than one quarter of the population have been affected by the emigration of a close family member.  Without the right to elect a national representative, either at home or elsewhere in the world, these new emigrants are denied meaningful access to our democratic process.  Up to 500,000 Irish people, by being denied the right to vote in D&aacute;il elections, are effectively denied their right to free movement.  Concern has repeatedly been expressed at EU level that such a practice risks turning our emigrants into second-class citizens.  Not only will many feel let down because they were forced to leave what they regard as a bankrupt country and a political system that failed them, but they are also denied any involvement in a future political system.</p><p>  Internationally, there has been an accelerating trend towards allowing overseas citizens to vote, even among countries with particularly high levels of emigration.  We live in an interconnected and globalised society where, with the development of social media, Irish emigrants are in touch with home on a daily basis.  It is unjust and a further insult to the people who had to emigrate from this country for economic reasons that they are now denied a say in the political process.</p><p>  The Constitutional Convention took a small step in the right direction when it recommended the right to vote in presidential elections to citizens outside the State.  We now need to follow the example of our European counterparts and allow our citizens, wherever they may reside, the right to parliamentary representation.  Given that voters living in this country are not asked to pass a current affairs examination, the argument that people living abroad do not have sufficient links with their home country and are not interested in politics simply does not hold up.  If they are that disinterested, they will not vote anyway.  Studies in other countries that allow their emigrants to vote show that emigrants do not generally vote in a way that is radically different from those at home.  Surely the option should available for them.</p><p>  It has been estimated that Ireland has the largest diaspora in the world relative to its domestic population.  The number of Irish passport holders living in Northern Ireland and overseas equates to about 36% of all those who are entitled to be Irish citizens.</p> <p> The number of Irish passport holders living in Northern Ireland and overseas equates to approximately 36% of all of those entitled to be Irish citizens.  The point has been made repeatedly that given the volume of the diaspora, the process of opening up the voting system to emigrants would be complicated and overwhelming.  However, other nations have come up with a range of solutions to these challenges.  Some countries disallow voting after a certain period of time.  For example, the United Kingdom limits the vote to the first 15 years of living abroad.  France reserves seats in Parliament for representatives elected specifically to represent those living abroad.  There is a diverse range of solutions to every argument against allowing our emigrants to vote, but it is crucial that we find some way of giving recognition to the Irish abroad.  If one speaks to many of those living abroad, one will find their opinion is that in order to have a say, they should have a vote in the democratic process here.</p><p> Last year, the National Youth Council of Ireland published the results of a qualitative study on the experience and impact of emigration on Ireland's youth.  The majority who took part in the study said they intended to return to Ireland after a period of time, provided they could get a job.  This emigrant voice is an integral part of Ireland's future and it must continue to be heard in the political life of the country.  These people contribute too much to be denied a voice.  They deserve more than The Gathering.  They deserve to have their say.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/976" speakername="Timmy Dooley" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041500004#C00200"><p>I will outline the Fianna F&aacute;il position on this matter.  We believe Irish citizens abroad should have a say in the political life of Ireland.  We support voting rights for Irish citizens abroad for presidential elections and believe that these citizens and our diaspora should be represented in Seanad &Eacute;ireann.</p><p>  With regard to Irish citizens who reside in the European Union, we believe we must find some way to ensure the rights derived from their citizenship - not just of Ireland but of the European Union - are respected.  The European Commission proposal to make it easier for Irish citizens within the Union to retain their voting rights in Irish elections is a welcome development.  However, the implementation of this proposal must be examined carefully before any rash decisions are taken merely in order to meet the concerns expressed by the Commission.</p><p>  It must be acknowledged that Ireland is unusual in our increasingly globalised world in not allowing the majority of its overseas citizens any say in the political process.  Members of the armed forces and the diplomatic services are able to vote in D&aacute;il elections, while only NUI and Trinity College graduates can vote in Seanad elections.  Beyond these exceptions, only those who are ordinarily resident in Ireland may vote.  We believe it is vital for democracy that Irish citizens who are entitled to vote in our elections can vote.  If people engage in the most important act of our democratic tradition, that of voting, this will enhance our democracy by consolidating the legitimacy of our parliamentary democracy.</p><p>  The Council of Europe's report on Europeans living abroad advocates a broader sense of citizenship and nationality that embraces rights and responsibilities beyond a simple set of national feelings.  Writing citizenship into the voting system rather than tying it to geography gives a deeper sense of what it means to come from a particular country.  These citizen studies show that those living abroad do not vote radically differently from citizens based in their country of origin.  Currently, approximately 115 countries and territories, including almost all developed nations, have systems in place to allow their citizens abroad to vote.  This number is growing.</p><p>  Even countries with high numbers of citizens abroad, such as Italy, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, have recently allowed their expatriates to vote.  If we look at those countries and examine the systems they have invoked, we can learn from them.  If Ireland is to embrace its citizens abroad, we must look at the logistics of how our voting system can be made work to embrace the opinions of these citizens.  Sixty-five of the countries mentioned allow for external voting for everyone, while approximately 25 place restrictions on voting based on factors such as whether the person intends to return permanently or how long he or she has been away.  As committee members know, citizens of the US can vote no matter how long they stay away, while citizens of Britain are disqualified after 15 years.  Some countries, like France, reserve seats in their parliaments for citizens who live abroad, while others vote in the constituencies in which they used to live.  Last week, we heard from European colleagues in regard to the methods they employ to connect the diaspora to the specific places for which they will vote.  Other countries only allow for votes in national or presidential elections.</p><p>  On the issue of a form, Fianna F&aacute;il supports the idea of having a permanent, independent electoral commission which would be in charge of running all elections and referendums.  I would like to see the Government set up this kind of commission immediately.  The electoral system can be significantly improved and, as politicians, we must embrace change in this regard.  With few exceptions, polling is carried out in the same manner today as it was 90 years ago.  Much has changed in those 90 years and our voting procedures should change also.  We should not be afraid to embrace new ways of doing things in this regard, if that results in greater participation and an enhanced democratic process.  </p><p>  Voting procedures are not the primary reason turnout in our elections is lower than in other countries, but voting should certainly be made more accessible.  Fianna F&aacute;il has made a number of proposals in this regard in its policy document, Real Political Reform.  These proposals include ideas such as a review of Article 16.4.1&deg; of the Constitution, which contains the requirement for polling to be, as far as practical, on one day.  This should be amended to allow for a more flexible approach.  We would support a standard polling procedure as found in some parts of Europe, where polls are open on Friday and Saturday.  Counting could then take place on Sundays.  The predominant model of voting should remain voting in person, but greater flexibility should be allowed for casting a ballot in advance or through our embassies abroad.  There is already provision for this for citizens who live on our islands.  This provision could be expanded to include our embassy network, in order to allow Irish citizens abroad to vote.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il agrees with the European Commission recommendations that in instances in which member states' policies limit the rights of nationals to vote in national elections based exclusively on a residence condition, member states should enable their nationals who make use of their right to free movement and residence within the European Union to demonstrate a continuing interest in the political life in the member state of which they are nationals, including through an application to remain registered on the electoral roll, and by doing so to retain their right to vote.  We believe this recommendation could be facilitated through our embassy network within the European Union.  It would also ensure that Irish citizens living and working outside Ireland but within the European Union would register with the local embassy.  The register should be required to be updated on an annual basis.  Citizens seeking to vote from abroad should be obliged to select the constituency to which they have the closest connection.  This is important to prevent fraud and would act as a control measure.  Nonetheless, Fianna F&aacute;il accepts that all relevant applications could be submitted electronically.  We also accept the European Commission's fourth recommendation, that member states inform citizens abroad by appropriate means and in a timely manner about the conditions and practical arrangements for retaining their right to vote in national elections.  Again, this would have to be facilitated through our embassy and consular network.</p><p>  Fianna F&aacute;il is broadly supportive of the recommendations outlined by the European Commission and hopes the Government will use this opportunity to implement a reform of our electoral system which will broaden participation, establish an independent electoral commission and, for the first time, grant substantial voting rights to all our citizens within the European Union, and consider extending this right to citizens further afield.</p></speech>

I welcome those who have made presentations.</p><p>  Deputy Dooley touched on the concept of "abroad" and I noticed in Ms Boylan's presentation a different focus in regard to the North.  Deputy Dooley mentioned Irish citizens living within the European Union, which one might consider to be less "abroad" than other parts of the world.  Do the witnesses believe there should be a difference between how Irish citizens within Northern Ireland or the European Union are considered and those in the rest of the world?  Could this be a stepping stone to getting the vote for Irish citizens abroad?</p><p>  What is the witnesses' view on European Union citizens in any European country, including Ireland, voting in our national elections?</p> <p>Those of us canvassing in the local elections meet people who have EU passports but cannot vote here.  What is good for the goose, etc.  Deputy Dooley may have included the point about the difference between citizen and diaspora but I may have misheard it.  A fourth or fifth generation Irish person may have another passport.  Is it proposed that anyone with any links to Ireland should have a right to vote?  I believe that was the Spanish position.  Given that we have the largest diaspora in the world is the right it confined to passport holders?  Ms Boylan mentioned the registration process which possibly answers that question.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041500005#D00200"><p>I too welcome the guests and witnesses and congratulate them on their submissions.  In respect of dual citizenship is it presumed that all Irish citizens abroad, in Europe, the US, Australia or wherever, would have the right to vote whether they had an Irish passport or not?  The three witnesses might clarify that.  If they do not have the right to vote how would the witnesses determine who should and should not vote?  These people would retain their rights to vote in their adoptive countries.  How would that be affected by membership of the EU?  Within the EU the presumption is that they would have the right to vote in the country in which they reside and in this country.</p><p>  Ms Boylan referred to politicians from Northern Ireland having the right to participate in these Houses.  How would that affect groups who might decide to abstain?  Given that we are trying to give representation to a broader spectrum of Irish people would their abstention diminish their influence?</p><p>  The embassy voting system proposal is quite good.  It is normal that we would expect that the embassies could be used for voting abroad.  I would have serious reservations about changing the method of voting based on our previous experience.  A move in that direction would not necessarily be of any great benefit to the diaspora or us.  I strongly urge that we avoid moving in that direction notwithstanding advances in technology and the need to modernise.  The basic elements of democracy are well founded and historically tested.  That they are old, or in some cases, old-fashioned, does not mean that they are out of date or no longer valid.</p></speech>

It is good from a number of perspectives that members of our diaspora would have the right to vote.  I also agree with using the embassies.  That makes sense.  Electronic registration should be allowed, to enable people to indicate their interest.  How far would we go down the generations?  We would have to go to the first generation to have left the country.  I think we would have to stop at that generation, albeit subsequent generations claim their Irishness.</p></speech>

It becomes messy.  It is difficult to administer and where is the cut-off?  Could a third-generation person, who has a very romanticised and distant concept of the homeland, vote and influence the outcome of elections here?  I think not.  I would stop at the first generation but I will be interested in the panel's response to that question and to how it will be administered.</p></speech>

We will be taking this debate in conjunction with the Irish in Britain group who made a very interesting submission insofar as they raise very stark figures.</p></speech>

The broader diaspora there is between 3 and 4 million.  We do not know the figures for Scotland.  Across the world the diaspora is probably between 40 and 60 million people.</p><p>  In order for this committee to make a serious recommendation to the Parliament will each of the witnesses define his or her party's position on what constitutes citizenship?  We will have to prepare a report that is very specific and need to know who we are talking about.  Who does each party argue has the right to vote?  How do they define citizenship?  While the embassies could be used in Europe because there is, I think, one in each of the 28 member states it is more complicated for the diaspora who are scattered.  It is well documented that we are very poorly represented by embassies and consulates in other countries, such as Denmark.  How do we, on the one hand, enfranchise a diaspora that we deem Irish on the basis of citizenship but on the other hand, have a large diaspora whom the process cannot encompass?  Do we then create a two-tier citizenship or are the benefits of citizenship to be unfairly distributed?  It is not difficult in Europe and America where there are great numbers of Irish people but there are many also scattered throughout isolated parts of Africa.  One finds Irish people all over the world.  How do the witnesses define citizenship in order to allocate voting rights?</p> <p>Do any of the witnesses agree that while the convention has looked at presidential elections - many speakers referred to it - it is really a cop-out with regard to what the European Commission said?  The Commission is not talking about presidential elections; it is talking about general elections or national elections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1037" speakername="Se&aacute;n Crowe" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2014041500006#E00200"><p>We always seem to begin a conversation about what we cannot do.  First, what is most important to establish is whether we agree with the idea and if it is a good idea.  We should really start the conversation from there, not by saying why we cannot do something.  We can all come up with obstacles, some of which have been mentioned previously.  Fraud is one issue.  Logistics is another issue to which everyone refers.  Concern has been expressed to the effect that the vote might influence the Government in this country.  I invite comments in that regard.  I accept that reference was made to it in some contributions.</p><p>  Reference was made to the Irish in Britain.  A quote from President Michael D. Higgins suggests that the Irishness now emerging will be informed by the experience of the Irish abroad.  That is the type of inclusive language we need to use in the debate.  One probably does have to put up barriers in terms of where one starts, but do the witnesses agree that first we must try to include the diaspora?  It could be a starting point.  Ultimately, we might confine it to passport holders, or it might depend on how long a person has lived abroad.  We can discuss the detail later.</p><p>  The witnesses stated that 78% of delegates at the Constitutional Convention were in favour of giving votes to the diaspora.  Opinion polls all point in the same direction.  We are not just out of step with the rest of the world in terms of how countries give their diaspora a vote, but it appears we are also out of step with the feelings of Irish people.  Reference was made to the Good Friday Agreement and to people in the North.  Is it the impression of the witnesses that such an approach was envisaged in the Agreement - that people would be brought into this House and that it would not be a cold place for Northern Nationalists or Unionists?  The situation has not developed that way.  I am a member of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  We were to involve people in discussions.  It is important that that element of the Agreement is also developed.</p><p>  People say they are Irish when they leave, but when does one lose one&rsquo;s Irishness?  Is it right that one would lose one&rsquo;s Irishness after six months, 12 months, 20 years or 100 years &ndash; whatever length of time one is out of the country?  One could even narrow the confines in terms of who would be allowed to vote.  Do the witnesses accept that if we could tap into the 70 million people who consider themselves to have an Irish background, it would be a good thing for this country?  We are great at asking people for money and remittances.  I refer to The Gathering, for example.  However, do the witnesses agree that the potential of those people is also an issue to be considered in the debate?</p></speech>

We are talking about two criteria.  One is citizenship, which is based on nationhood &ndash; in reality, a 19th century principle that precedes the European Union and the idea of a transnational identity.  The second is the other pre-EU principle, which is that of subsidiarity.  In other words, decision making is brought down to the lowest possible level so that the person who is going to be most affected by the decision should have a say in how the decision is made.  In reality, we have two competing principles.  One of the things we are trying to do is to reconcile those principles.  I am not clear how that can be done to the extent that it has been discussed by the committee - not necessarily by the three witnesses, but by other people who have come before us.</p><p>  I note that for the sake of argument Deputy Halligan talked about Irish citizens &ndash; I ask him to correct me if I am wrong &ndash; having a say in presidential elections and Seanad elections but not D&aacute;il elections, for example.</p></speech>

Does she mean Irish citizens abroad?  Deputy Byrne asked the same question.</p><p>  In terms of specific Northern representation, I might be behind the curve, but for the sake of argument, how many people from the South are represented in the Northern Irish Assembly?  To what extent can we talk about parity of esteem?  To what extent should we look at subsidiarity - in other words, that the people who are most affected by decisions are the ones who make the decisions?</p><p>  When we talk about Irish citizens abroad, are we not to some extent moving away from the principle that the EU stands for, which is a community of interests?  Does Ms Boylan suggest that we should give rights to Irish people resident in the EU?  None of the witnesses said whether there should be a difference between Irish citizens who are resident in other EU countries and Irish citizens who are resident in the US, China, Japan or wherever else.  To what extent is this about the European Union, our membership of it and our citizenship within the European Union, and to what extent is Ms Boylan talking about the interests of Irish citizens who live outside Ireland?</p><p>  I am personally conflicted on the issue of nationhood.  To me, moving towards more European involvement is about the community of the European Union and less about nationhood, but then perhaps that is my particular perspective.</p></speech>

It is in the region of 40 million to 70 million if one is to include everybody who left Ireland.</p><p>  A couple of issues arise.  One is that we should be careful how we decide to define an Irish citizen.  The Chairman said that we do not have a problem with someone representing our country in football games because their grandfather was born in Ireland.  We tend to cherish the person who puts on a green jersey and sings the national anthem.  We probably give such a person more recognition that we would give to someone who was born in this country but is unable to vote because he or she had to leave the country through no fault of his or her own.</p><p>  Deputy Crowe hit the nail on the head.  First, we need to accept that there is a problem - namely, that we are disenfranchising millions of Irish people around the world.  It is a complex situation.  It might be that we decide to give the vote to everybody who holds an Irish passport.  Someone suggested that we could trace family heredity.  I have family members in America who have been there for two or three generations.  One could ask whether we should go down through the generations and give them a vote.  I am not too sure about that.  I am open to hearing the opinion of others in that regard.</p> <p>We all accept that we need to stop disenfranchising our citizens.  Many members will have relations living in other countries who are still interested in what happens in Ireland.  Without getting into the blame game for our bad economic situation, as we could have the same 20 years from now, hundreds of thousands of people have had to leave our country through no fault of their own.  If we asked them if they would like to have a say in how the country is run, they would give a resounding &ldquo;Yes&rdquo;.  We owe it to those people.  I accept that it would be extremely difficult and complicated to give the vote to the 70 million people around the world who claim Irish ancestry.  Legislatively, it would probably collapse on top of us.  However, a person born in this country who has an Irish passport should be given the vote.</p><p> I specifically did not mention the Seanad because ordinary people do not have a vote in its elections anyway.</p></speech>

However, we have to start on the premise that we are wrongfully disenfranchising our citizens, as Europe has told us.  I agree that we need to include the greater diaspora.  We cannot just give the vote to Irish citizens in Europe while excluding those in America and Australia.</p></speech>

Citizenship cannot be exclusive but must be based on equality.  Sinn F&eacute;in&rsquo;s policy is that a European citizen resident in Ireland for five years should be afforded the right to vote in national elections.  One would need a compelling argument as to why it cannot be extended to D&aacute;il elections if it is extended to presidential and Seanad elections.</p><p>  There are many ways around the issue of those in the diaspora overruling the people living in Ireland.  Many other countries have figured out the mechanics of this.  Sinn F&eacute;in proposes that the diaspora vote would go to a reserved constituency, which would prevent such swamping.</p><p>  Under Article 2, people in the North have the right to belong to the Irish nation.  They are slightly different, however, so it is not just a case of broadening it out to citizens of EU member states.  That is why we would treat them separately.  At the moment, they are treated differently from Northern Unionists who vote for the British Parliament.</p></speech>

The question arises on how we treat Irish citizens residing in the EU as opposed to those outside it.  Should an Irish citizen be only allowed one vote for the European Parliament?  What about the Irish citizen residing in Australia?  There are mechanics that can be worked out.  The principle is that citizens who wish to avail of a franchise that will allow them some capacity to determine the governance of a jurisdiction they feel is important to them should be facilitated.  I take Senator Hayden&rsquo;s point about the guiding principles of the European Union and the shared nature of the way in which we do our business rather than an attachment to nationhood.  I am of a similar mind to Deputy Halligan on this.</p><p>  As for the swamping effect of a potential 400,000 Irish voters in England and Wales, the experience in countries such as Italy, the Dominican Republic and Mexico, which allow their diasporas to vote, shows that there is actually a low take-up of this entitlement.  I feel those who left the country more recently will be the ones who will take up the vote, rather than the 60 million people in the United States who could potentially have an Irish passport and claim some ancestry from the old sod.  I do not have concerns about swamping or the external vote overtaking the domestic vote.</p><p>  As Deputy Crowe said, we have to start somewhere and set the ball rolling.  Our view is that we should start with presidential and Seanad elections.</p> <p>We have a view about the composition of the Seanad and how it is elected.  In doing so we give a greater participation to the citizens of the State and those outside.  That would allow for broader access to the voting system and it could, therefore, be extended in a way that would cover what Senator Hayden mentioned.</p><p> Deputies Durkan and Byrne raised the issue of what we would do in the event of our not having an embassy.  We must provide some other methodology by which people can cast their votes.  If they have registered electronically, for example, we must afford them some kind of postal process or otherwise that allows for the vote to be cast.  Deputy Durkan has clearly said he would like to retain the peann luaidhe.  Notwithstanding that, I have always been a firm believer that electronic voting and i-voting should not be ruled out.  While I accept that we had a difficult experience, it has been made to work in other countries and it should not prevent our revisiting the system.  I do not suggest it is a priority, but we need to examine it.</p></speech>

In the same way as Deputies here come up from the country on a Tuesday and return on a Thursday, she goes to Paris for the meetings of the National Assembly but lives in the United Kingdom.

There would be proportional representation in those constituencies and six people might run for the three seat in the North American constituency.

Although we have not set out a very concrete proposal, we think the reserved constituency is the preferred method because it prevents swamping.  The logistics of representation for the different countries or areas can be decided once we get broad agreement on whether we are in favour of extending the vote or not.</p></speech>

I have tabled two of the seven amendments on the list.  I indicate my intention to table further amendments to sections 4 and 5 on Report Stage.  I thank the Irish Cancer Society which has framed the proposed amendments for its continued interest in the issue.</p><p>  It is important to recognise different skin types and take the opportunity presented by the Bill to include members of the public with skins types 1 and 2.  While I have indicated my intention to introduce further amendments on Report Stage, I appeal today to the Minister to consider tabling amendments to this section.  I would support such an initiative on his part.  Perhaps he might use the opportunity in the intervening period before Report Stage to consider such amendments.  His imprimatur is an absolute guarantee of success in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p><p>  The wording of the amendments prepared by the Irish Cancer Society is eminently sensible and their application is undisputed.  They would protect people who may not realise how prone they are to the adverse effects of exposure to sunbed use.  There is a significant cohort of Irish people with skin types 1 and 2.  The amendments are not only about protecting but also informing the wider public of the dangers involved and ultimately dissuading them from using this equipment in the future.  I have the proposed wording of the Report Stage amendments.</p> <p>I can copy my amendments to the Minister for his consideration over the intervening period.  <br />I know this is going to be a relatively quick meeting.  However, I ask the Chairman to be patient with me as I read what I propose to table on Report Stage into the record.<blockquote><b>Prohibition on permitting the use of sunbeds by certain persons </b><br />4A (1) The owner, manager or employee of a sunbed business shall not sell the use of a sunbed on a sunbed premises to a person unless-- (a) the owner, manager or employee has assessed the person&rsquo;s skin type in accordance with the Fitzpatrick skin photo type classification system; or<br />(b) the person has provided the owner, manager or employee with a certificate from a medical practitioner that certifies that the medical practitioner has assessed the person's skin type in accordance with the Fitzpatrick skin photo type classification system and states the results of that assessment. (2) A person whose skin type is assessed as Type I or Type II under subsection (1)(a) or (b) shall not be permitted to use a sunbed on the sunbed premises. <br />(3)A person who contravenes subsection (1) or (2) commits an offence. </blockquote>Section 5 is similar and the wording is a repeat of 4A(1), except the latter section uses the term &quot;A person shall not sell&quot; instead of &quot;The owner, manager and employee ... shall not sell&quot;.<br />That is the gist of both amendments to sections 4 and 5.  That is the kernel of it and the intent is self-evident.  I do not expect the Minister to indicate at this point but I hope that over the intervening period he will give serious consideration - preferably favourable consideration - to their inclusion on Report Stage, and in his name if possible.</p></speech>

I should have asked the Minister the following question when discussing the section on regulation.  Can he clarify the sort of regulations he intends to have that will warn people about the dangers posed by sunbeds at the location of their use?  Will the regulations include a reference to the skin types that are most vulnerable to damage from the use of sunbeds?  How will they be enforced?  Using sunbeds is not the same as smoking cigarettes, which automatically carry a warning on every package, because warnings about sunbeds will be hidden behind closed doors.  I also thank the Irish Cancer Society for the work it has done on this matter. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.84" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1004" speakername="Mary Mitchell O'Connor" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014041500004#D00300"><p>I thank the Minister for introducing the Bill, which I welcome wholeheartedly.  I also thank him for the work he has done on the legislation.</p><p>  The legislation is directed at people using sunbeds who are under 18 years of age, but I worry about people who are over that age.  I also worry about people around 18 years of age who work in sunbed salons but do not understand how dangerous sunbeds are.  When a constituent of mine went to use a sunbed, the lady in attendance switched on the machine but just told him to get on to the sunbed.  She gave him no directions whatsoever.  He put the cleaning agent provided for the sunbed on his skin, believe it or not, and got very badly burned.  As a result he could not work or anything else.  Directions are given such as "Do not use a sunbed if you have had skin cancer in the past."  Unfortunately, what a person goes into any of these salons, he or she just signs a document without reading it, and I worry that such practices will continue.</p><p>  I know other members are worried about skin colour, and I have read the submission.  I too would like the Minister to look at the matter before we commence Report Stage.  I understand that there may be legal problems around this, but it has been legislated for in other countries.  Why can we not legislate for it here?</p><p>  I want the Minister to address the use of sunbeds by those over 18, maybe 19- to 21-year olds, because they are still young and they may not realise the dangers of sunbeds and that one can get badly burned.  We advised the constituent I mentioned earlier to go to a solicitor to see if he could pursue the matter legally.  That is the point I would like to make for older people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.85" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/983" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HE12014041500004#D00400"><p>I intend to move amendments that will be in line with Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's amendments based on those circulated by the Irish Cancer Society.</p><p>  We all welcome the legislation.  It has received universal approval and acceptance, so I hope it will be embraced in terms of the message it sends out.</p><p>  I assume members will have seen the amendments suggested by the Irish Cancer Society.  I am not sure whether they have been circulated to everyone but I imagine that they were.  My query is about skin types 1 and 2.  We are banning sunbed usage for under 18s and it is a given that everyone will comply.  There could be legal obligations with regard to identifying people based on a skin type to determine whether he or she can use a sunbed, which I accept.  We will table amendments with the sole purpose of trying to tease out some way of addressing the matter through strong advertising and placing an obligation on people to inform users of sunbeds that if they have skin type 1 or 2 they are more likely and have a greater chance of contracting skin cancers such as melanoma.  I am not sure whether we can do this, but I understand the difficulties the Minister is faced with.  The amendments still merit tabling, if only to see if we can come up with an imaginative way to raise awareness of the dangers posed to individuals with skin types 1 and 2 among the broader public.  Also, the operators of sunbed premises should have a responsibility placed on them to inform each and every person who enters their premises of the risks involved.  I refer to the risks that are more prevalent in people with skin types 1 and 2 as identified under the Fitzpatrick skin type classification.  That is my purpose.  We live in a world with constraints, and people have civil liberties, rights and entitlements.  Equally, there is an obligation on the Minister, his Department, the HSE and everybody concerned to minimise the risks to individuals.  We should at least have an education programme.  There should be an obligation on people to inform others of the risks associated with using sunbeds.  </p><p>  When it comes to cigarettes, we do not expect every shopkeeper to tell the purchaser that cigarettes are bad for him or her.  Packets carry warnings that provide people with enough information that cigarettes are bad.  Anybody who buys cigarettes now but is not aware that they are bad for one's health has not been living in the same environment as the members and I for the past number of years.</p><p>  With regards to sun damage, an awful lot of people go on holidays every year.  Advertising campaigns have advised people to use sun cream, etc. with a high factor to protect them from the damaging effects of the sun.  However, people still insist on travelling to Spain, togging off and getting sunburnt in the hope of enhancing their tans.  Therefore, we must find clever ways to target groups of people.  The cohort of people that we wish to speak to may not be the kind who listen to us in general.  They are younger, full of the joys of life and confident, yet year in, year out one sees them on holidays pasting themselves with sun enhancers instead of sun protection.</p><p>  What if we are restricted in warning people due to a lack of legislation that targets groups with certain skin types?  I hope the Minister will introduce robust regulation to oblige users and suppliers to address the issue.</p></speech>

I would have very strong views on this issue.  I am a great believer in prevention being better than cure.  Healthy Ireland, the cross-Government initiative to improve the nation's health is very important and is the first of its type.  That picture of the Cabinet holding it up was alluded to at a WHO conference in Europe last week.  We are involved in many important public health initiatives around tobacco, as Deputy Billy Kelleher has alluded to, and around exercise, the challenges that obesity and overweight present, the challenges in this area and around alcohol abuse.</p><p>  We are continually accused of being a nanny state.  We have made it clear we are not a nanny state, that we believe in the constitutional rights of Irish citizens.  I have the highest respect and regard for the Irish Cancer Society and consider an ally in the fight against both cancer and other public health threats, but I do not believe we have the right under the Constitution to interfere with adults if they decide to engage in risky behaviours.  Therefore, I cannot ban adults from smoking cigarettes even though we know that one in two habitually develop cancer, which is a tobacco related illness.  Nobody is suggesting that we do that and nobody is suggesting that we ban alcohol.  I do not know how one would go about preventing people drinking excessively.  We can take a range measures such as minimum pricing of advertising and reducing the exposure of young people to alcohol but we will not ban alcohol.</p><p>  The whole issue around skin type is not as easy as it sounds.  Many doctors will have difficulty in deciding whether a person has type 2 or type 3 skin while they might find it easy to decide on type 1.  In any event, one is saying to me, as an Irish citizen with type 1 skin, that I do not have the same rights as persons with type 2, 3, 4 or 5.  I do not think that will wash with the Irish people.  We have to do what is sensible and reasonable and what people can adhere to without ending up needlessly being challenged in the courts.  We would then have to go back to the European Union which would involve more delay.  This Bill is a long time coming.  My predecessor, Mary Harney, tried to get this Bill through.  It has taken that length of time to get it to this Stage and I do not want it delayed any further.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Billy Kelleher about highlighting the dangers to people with skin types 1 and 2 and advertising and the education programmes that need to be undertaken.  Banning adults and discriminating against particular skin types is not an area I want to get into nor is it an area with which I want to be associated.  We all have equal rights to do the right thing and to make our mistakes as well.  We do our best to advise people not to make the mistakes.  We have a particular duty of care to children, for whom we cannot allow other to make mistakes.  When it comes to themselves I do not think we have the right to do that and I would not be supportive of this approach.  I say that as a doctor.  My job, as a doctor, as far as I was concerned was to advise people but the ultimate decision about their health is made by themselves.  They do so with the fullest information I could make available to them.  It is not, "do as you are told".  Life is not like that, and we all acknowledge that in our own way.  </p><p>  I have no problems with the amendments being tabled, that is Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in's right.  We should talk to them again because, as Deputy Billy Kelleher has said, that would highlight the danger particularly to people in this area.  We will ensure that this health warning is displayed in all places where sunbeds are used, that a form is signed by customers using the sunbeds stating that they understand the risks to them, including the cancer risk, and that it has been explained properly to them to their satisfaction.  That form will have to be held by the operator for at least two years after treatment has ceased.  We are being very careful to warm people at every level about the dangers but, at the end of the day, an adult has the right to make the decision for himself or herself.  I believe we have to respect that.  We are not accepting this amendment  </p></speech>

There is a misnomer by some people in terms of exposure to harmful radiation be it from sunbeds or the sun.  In tandem with the Bill there is a need to engage in an extensive programme with the Department of Health and the Irish Cancer Society to raise awareness around the harm issue.  I take the Minister's point that the Irish Cancer Society makes a very strong case in respect of certain skin types.  While the Minister has made his point, some people just do not get the message.</p></speech>

Having said that, we will run an advertising campaign around the launch of this when the Bill is passed.  There is no doubt about that.  It would be timely if it was coming into the holiday season.  I would like if we could get this through before the First Holy Communion season begins because we want to make it absolutely clear to people that it will then be illegal to subject one's child to sunbed use, unless under medical direction for a particular health condition.  I saw a note here earlier stating that the chief medical officer, CMO, in 2009 advised that the higher risks for sections of the adult population could be dealt with by way of regulation rather than prohibition and that the national cancer control programme confirmed a similar view in 2011.  I hope I have made my position clear.  That is not in any way to denigrate any of the points made.  It is very useful to have had this discussion and I hope it generates more awareness around the dangers of sunbed use and not only sunbed use but, as Deputy Kelleher said, the dangers from ultraviolet light both here and abroad when one goes sunbathing if one does not use the proper protection.</p></speech>

I would hope that any media following this discussion would join in the effort of the dissemination of information for the widest possible public purposes.  That is very important.  I reserve the right to table the amendments which we have discussed.  This focus will be further served by its address again on Report Stage in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  In the meantime the reason I was particularly anxious that the Minister would not give us a definitive response this afternoon was that I wanted to leave as much room as possible for lobbying for his employment of the greatest mental agility possible in the intervening period.  We will not take that as an absolute position.  We will leave the door a little open and see where it brings us.</p></speech>

Is it not the case that the use of sunbeds will be restricted only in respect of those premises?  Is it not the case that regrettably, there still will be potential for people foolishly to employ their own facility or that of a neighbour, a friend or a member of their extended family if they have such in their possession?  The adoption of this amendment, which I do not oppose, more firmly directs the legislative impact on sunbed premises, as against the use of sunbeds in respect of those who are under 18.  I do not raise this point to be contentious but the Minister should say more than he has on this matter, because there is a much wider usage than simply in sunbed premises and I am anxious to hear what the Minister may believe he can do about that.  Perhaps he cannot do something at this point and perhaps other considerations will arise from this brief exchange.</p></speech>

It is only in areas in which there is supervision and that means professional premises.  In addition, it affects those who hire sunbeds, as I am making it illegal to hire out a sunbed to anyone under the age of 18.  That is as far as I can go and that is the reason it is important to promulgate the message that hundreds of people die annually from malignant melanoma and that one's greatest risk is if one was exposed to ultraviolet light under the age of 12, which specifically relates to those of holy communion age.  In other words, if one engages in this practice, one is doing a desperate disservice to one's child's by exposing him or her to a shocking risk later in life.  As matters stand, one cannot do this at home but as I stated, it can be done in supervised areas.</p><p>  The Bill will bring within its scope sunbed use in commercial premises, as well as the sale and hire of sunbeds.  It will not be possible to regulate the use of sunbeds in private dwellings that have been purchased by a person over the age of 18.  The Constitution protects the dwelling of a citizen in this regard.  Similarly, with other harmful substances such as tobacco, it is not possible to enter a private dwelling unless a warrant from a court is obtained.  Responsibility with regard to activities in private dwellings rests with parents and it will be important to make parents aware of their responsibilities in such situations.  In this regard, it will be a requirement that information will be given to anyone who proposes to hire or to purchase a sunbed that will advise him or her of the health risk of using sunbeds and that those under 18 should not use them.  In February 2014, I called on parents to act responsibly when it comes to permitting or encouraging their children to use sunbeds.  I stated that while parents may think they are doing something positive by allowing their children to use a sunbed, as I have just pointed out, they are risking their children's health.  Parents must act responsibly to protect their children and there is no justifiable reason to allow the use of sunbeds by children under the age of 18 years of age in any setting.  However, I am constrained by the Constitution when it comes to private dwellings, just as one cannot prevent people from smoking at home where there are children.</p></speech>

Again, while I will not oppose the amendment, I hope that in the fullness of time - I do not question the Minister's resolve - the wider community resolve to address this matter more substantively ultimately will see a ban on its use, end of story.</p></speech>

Section 9(2) enables the Minister to prescribe as prohibited certain marketing practices for the purpose of protecting public health and to reduce the risk to health arising from the use of sunbeds.  It will be an offence for a person to offer a sunbed free of charge or to contravene the regulations under subsection (2).  Subsection (4) provides for a non-exhaustive definition for the use, sale or hire of a sunbed at reduced prices or free of charge, including the awarding of bonus points, loyalty card points or any similar benefit arising from the use, purchase, sale or hire of a sunbed.

In amendments Nos. 6 and 7 I seek to change the reference to the word &quot;safe&quot;.  Under the section heading of &quot;Training&quot;, section 14(1)(<i>a</i>) refers to &quot;training leading to a qualification in the safe use of sunbeds&quot;.  Section 14(3) goes on to provide that &quot;Prescribed training may include training on ... the safe use and operation of sunbeds&quot;.  It strikes me that through the employment of the word &quot;safe&quot; in association with the words &quot;use of sunbeds&quot;, one is giving out a bad message.  While members understand what is involved, many will not and there are others who are unscrupulous and who will use the referencing to aid and abet their own commercial interest, irrespective of the risk to those who will use the service provided.  I believe the use of the phrase &quot;safe use of sunbeds&quot;, against everything I already have said and, with respect, what the Minister has stated here this evening, is a contradiction.  It simply does not rest with me.</p> <p>This legislation does not bestow the word "safe" in terms of the use of sunbeds, rather it bestows authorisation in that respect over and above a particular age limit and within specified, confined areas of business practice.  We should change the word "safe" for all the reasons I suggested and employ the word "authorised".  That is the real intent of the legislation.  The purpose and intent of the legislation the Minister has brought forward, which I support fully, is weakened by employing the use of the word "safe" in this regard.  There is not a qualification in the safe use of sunbeds; there is a qualification certainly in the authorised use of sunbeds, FTB, for the time being until wiser days present.  </p><p> I hope the Minister will concur with my reasoning in this regard and accept the amendments that are intended only to ensure that the Bill has no weakness that others could exploit and that we hold to a language in regard to sunbeds that will allow us all come back at this at some point in time in the future.  It will be more difficult for us to wrestle with this issue following our having employed references such as "safe use".  That immediately places a further obstacle to the arguments we can consider on another day.  My appeal to the Minister is to accept what I hope are common-sense reasons behind changing the use of the word "safe" in regard to both of these subsections of section 14 and accepting the word "authorised", which I believe is more appropriate.  </p></speech>

The primary objective of the Bill is to protect children and those under 18 years of age from the risk of skin damage from the use of sunbeds in view of their increased risk of developing skin cancer, and we are all agreed on that.  It is also to regulate the use of sunbeds by those over 18 years of age so as to reduce their likelihood, among other things, of developing skin cancer, premature ageing and damaging their eyes from exposure to ultraviolet radiation and to generally promote a greater public awareness across all age groups with a long-term view to reduce the incidence of skin cancers.  The WHO has advised that without trained staff and adequate advice the potential for harm for the uninformed consumer is much greater.  The WHO has further noted that in a largely unregulated industry where training of staff is not mandatory, this increases the health risks considerably.</p><p>  I acknowledge the Deputy's point that the use of the word "safe" in the context of sunbeds is somewhat problematic but it is necessary in order to minimise the harm such equipment can do and for that reason I cannot accept the Deputy's proposed amendment, particularly because he used the word "authorised", which implies that we are authorising these premises which we are not.  What we are doing is mandating who can use them and who cannot and the training that must go with them.  If we were seek to authorise all these premises, we would be into a whole new raft of legislation.  I am not being difficult, we have considered this word and other words such as "appropriate" and words like that, but it comes back to the same problem.  They all give somewhat of a message that if we use the word "safe" that it is safe, whereas what we are saying is that it is safer at the end of the day to have them regulated, make sure they are hygienic and ensure that the customer is informed of the risk, but not safe in so far as people should not be using them at all.  However, we are limited by EU law and by where we find ourselves.  I know what the Deputy is trying to say and I share the sentiment, but we looked at this and certainly the word "authorised " is not one we could use because that implies authorisation and we are not authorising these premises.</p></speech>

There is no doubt in my mind, and I cannot believe there is a doubt in minds of others here, regarding the use of the word "safe" in this legislation in the context of the employment of sunbeds.  It is a contradiction in terms.  We are sowing the seed of further difficulties that will present when we will want to revisit this issue at some point in time in the future, which I believe we should.</p><p>  On the point the Minister made regarding the word "authorised", we are not talking about the authorisation of premises.  The inclusion of my amendment would read "the authorised use of sunbeds" - it is not about the premises.  The wording of the subsection is "training leading to a qualification".  Training is absolutely essential.  I understand fully what while sunbed use is allowed that those who are employed in its use by paying customers, or whatever the case may be, must have the highest qualification.  They must be the best informed possible in order to ensure the best protections that can be secured or available, but we are looking here at the authorisation of the use of sunbeds as against the premises.  I am not hung up on the word "authorisation" or the word "authorised" if that is something that presents a problem.  I am not prepared to accept that we are in any way restricted by EU this, that or the other.  This is about our moving forward our domestic legislation in order to protect those under the age of 18 in the first instance.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for its help and contributions.  I concur with the other members that our whole purpose here is to improve legislation.  No one has a monopoly on wisdom and it is important to remember that 850 new cases of melanoma occur in Ireland each year.  Our message to parents is they should not do anything that makes their child likely to be one of those cases in later life.  Each year, 150 Irish people die from melanoma and at present, 7,000 people in Ireland are living with this type of cancer.  Moreover, while the cost of treating it has ranged from &euro;6,000 to &euro;10,000 per patient, with newer treatments the cost now is more like &euro;50,000 to &euro;100,000 per patient.  It is important that governments pay more than lip service to prevention.  They must pay for it because unless it is paid for now, our children will pay dearly for it down the road.</p><p>  There also is misinformation abroad, such as the claims that sunbeds can help with vitamin D deficiencies.  This is the reason these claims are prohibited unless they are prescribed in regulations.  As Minister for Health, I can state these measures and others being pursued in the public health arena are designed to promote healthy lifestyle choices among people in Ireland.  However, I reiterate what I said earlier, which is that as a doctor, as a politician and as a Minister for Health, I do not believe one should proscribe people from doing things.  They should be advised, informed and empowered to make the right decision but the decision is theirs, once they become adults themselves.  However, one has a duty of care to the children and they must be protected at all possible times.  I thank everyone for their participation in today's Committee Stage debate and look forward to the passage of the Bill later in the D&aacute;il Chamber.</p></speech>

This meeting is being broadcast on the UPC channel and we have been asked to make sure they are switched off in order that they do not interfere with the coverage.  Apologies have been received from Senator Terry Brennan.<br />The only item on the agenda is a discussion with the Gaelic Athletic Association, GAA, about its recently announced agreement with Sky television and other current issues.  On behalf of the committee I welcome the association's president, Mr. Liam O'Neill, and director general, Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy.<br />I draw witnesses&rsquo; attention to the fact that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The opening statement and any other documents witnesses have submitted to the committee will be published on the committee website following the meeting.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br />I now call on Mr.Duffy to make his opening remarks.</p></speech>

We are particularly glad to do so in light of some of the comment prompted by our decisions.  At the first meeting we convened to set in motion the process of negotiations for the broadcast rights, Mr. O'Neill and I set down the objectives we hoped to achieve.  At the top of the list, receiving a necessary priority recognised by all of us in Croke Park, was the need to make our games available to Irish people living abroad.  This issue of accessibility to our games on live television has been over the years by far the single biggest issue raised with us when we spoke with our members outside Ireland.  In planning our negotiations of the new contracts, the GAA felt it had an obligation to Irish people living abroad to respond to their appeals on this issue if for no other reason than the fact that many of them while living at home had contributed to the association as members and were now continuing that work in GAA clubs abroad.</p><p>  There are now 392 affiliated GAA clubs overseas, double the number of a decade ago, and they are spread across the world in Britain and North America, continental Europe, Australia, the Middle East and Asia.  This is, in part, an indication of the popularity of Gaelic games and a reflection of the sheer size of the Irish family abroad and this expanding Irish family was the new reality facing the GAA as it approached the negotiations for new broadcast contracts.</p><p>  Few, if any, people in this room have not had personal experience of the sorrow that emigration brings. The most painful separation is that caused by the parting from family and friends but there is also the separation from one&rsquo;s culture.  It is fair to say that, for many Irish people, the GAA and its games are an important part of the daily Irish cultural experience.  Many Irish people love Gaelic games and, for those of them who live abroad, not being able to follow them through live television coverage in their homes is a privation.  It is this cultural yearning that we in GAA headquarters have been made constantly aware of with increasing intensity over recent years.  When Mr. O'Neill and I first convened to consider the new television rights contracts, we knew that we had to address this issue head on. </p><p>  This was the priority issue in our approach to the rights negotiations but we wished to achieve two other important objectives.  First, we needed to ensure our games would continue to be widely available on television and radio to our domestic audience.  Our home base of members and supporters, attached to their clubs and counties, constitute our single most important audience.  Second, we needed, as any responsible organisation must do, to protect the important part of our revenue generated by income from broadcast rights.  The GAA can only achieve its sporting and cultural goals if it retains its capacity to fund the work of its clubs at home and abroad.</p> <p>These were our objectives, and I will speak about the solutions we adopted to meet these objectives.</p><p> I will deal with the financial or revenue issue immediately as it can be very quickly addressed.  It is a simple fact that in revenue terms the total value of the new broadcast contracts is only marginally an improvement on the previous contracts.  Quite simply, finance was not the key priority in our negotiations.  </p><p> I will summarise the main elements of the agreements we reached with our broadcast partners, which were designed to meet our objectives of making our games accessible to our Irish audiences at home and abroad.  First, five more championship games have been made available for TV broadcast for the next three years - 45 versus 40 - compared to the period 2011 to 2014.  Second, RTE will broadcast the same number of games as under the previous contract, a total of 31.  We would also point out that RTE asked to broadcast 31 live games.  RTE has been granted exactly the number of games it wanted to broadcast.  Third, Irish people living in Britain will, for the first time, be able to watch matches live via Sky Sports, which will exclusively broadcast 14 games in total, eight of which are qualifier games.  To view these games will require a subscription to Sky Sports.  In a simulcast arrangement with RTE, Sky will broadcast live the all-Ireland football and hurling semi-finals and finals.  Fourth, Irish people in Australia will, for the first time, be able to watch live TV coverage of Gaelic games; they will be able to watch all 45 championship games free-to-air.  </p><p> The UK and Australia are by far the two most important destinations for Irish emigrants in recent years.  The GAA's experience confirms that more than half of the players transferring out of Ireland have gone to clubs in Britain, with Australia providing the next highest number.  In addition, millions of viewers in the UK and Australia will be able to watch our great games of hurling and Gaelic football for the first time on TV in their own homes.  Fifth, a new joint venture with RTE Digital will provide access to all championship games to Irish people all over the world by means of the Internet.  This is a hugely significant development for Irish people abroad.</p><p> Of the 18 most important championship games of the year - namely, the six provincial finals, the six all-Ireland quarter finals, four all-Ireland semi-finals and the all-Ireland finals in hurling and football - 16 will be broadcast free-to-air on RTE.  Only two quarter finals will not be free-to-air.</p><p> As a conclusion to this summary of the new TV broadcast contracts, Mr. O'Neill and I would like to point out that there has never been so much live TV coverage of Gaelic games.  In other words, the GAA has done all in its power in recent years to make its games available to its domestic audience while at the same time protecting for supporters the special experience of attending games. </p><p> With these new contracts, over 100 games will be broadcast free-to-air in each of the next three years, covering all levels of GAA competition - senior, minor, under-21, colleges and universities.  Over the years there has been a constant increase in live TV coverage of our games.  Therefore, we do not believe that the charge made against the GAA of disenfranchising its supporters is sustainable.  There is not a single weekend from the third weekend in May to the start of October on which live GAA championship matches will not be available on free-to-air terrestrial TV.  In fact, the new broadcasting contracts ensure free-to-air live TV coverage of GAA games on at least 40 of the 52 weekends of the year.</p><p> We would also point out that it has never been the case that all championship games have been broadcast live on domestic TV - far from it.  We have, at best, allowed only about half of our championship games to be covered on live TV, a fact that our critics have not taken into consideration.  We have always had to find the balance between live TV coverage and the need to encourage our supporters to attend GAA matches.  The presence of supporters at matches is the lifeblood of our games and is vital to the special atmosphere of the GAA matches.  There is nothing new in the fact that a very substantial proportion of our championship matches are not being broadcast live on TV - quite the contrary.  In order to follow the fortunes of their county team, supporters of Gaelic games have long been going to matches or following progress on radio or watching highlights on TV.  In this respect, the new TV contracts change absolutely nothing.</p><p> We have said that we set ourselves three objectives in approaching the negotiations on the new broadcast contracts, but, as everyone can appreciate - especially those who have ever been involved in commercial negotiations - objectives can, in whole or in part, be somewhat in competition with each other.  Specifically, we saw immediately that it would not be possible to fully satisfy our objectives with regard to making our games available on live TV to our domestic Irish audience and to our Irish audiences abroad.  I want to make a crucial point about our approach to these negotiations.  Due to the unfortunate return of Irish emigration and due also to the presence abroad of Irish people from previous phases of emigration, it is no longer tenable for the GAA to regard the Irish audience for Gaelic games as simply being Irish people living in Ireland.  There are now so many Irish people living abroad, so many Irish people who are GAA supporters and who want to see our games live on TV, that we simply must take them into consideration when negotiating broadcast contracts.  That being the case and in order for us to cater for these Irish people living abroad, the new contracts will see a relatively small reduction in the number of free-to-air games available to the Irish audience at home.  This was the balance we had to strike in seeking to meet the competing claims of our two very different audiences, the audience at home and the audience abroad.  It is simply not possible, in the current configuration of the delivery of television sport, for the GAA to ensure free-to-air coverage of all its games while at the same time making its games accessible to Irish people at home and abroad.  To put it another way, if we had decided that all TV coverage of our games was to be free-to-air, we would have had to abandon what we saw as our obligation to our Irish supporters abroad and we felt we could not do this.  We believe that we have achieved a balance in the allocation of broadcast rights that meets the needs of our supporters at home and abroad, a balance that we will seek to maintain into the future.  We will monitor the impact of these arrangements over the next three years and we want to make it absolutely clear today that it is the intention of the GAA that beyond 2017 our games will continue to be widely available free-to-air on TV to Irish audiences.</p><p> There has been a cynical reaction by some to the announcement of the new contracts.  Cynicism has always been the easy refuge of those who are afraid to engage in analysis and reasonable debate.   I refer to the cynical claim which would have it that the GAA went to Sky for the money; not only is this not true, but it also conveniently avoids noticing the recent announcement of a major investment by the GAA in redeveloping the Ruislip grounds in London, a project also made possible by financial support from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  The London redevelopment will serve not only the GAA but  also the whole Irish community in London.  It is a tangible example of the GAA&rsquo;s commitment to the Irish community abroad.  It is also a manifestation of our awareness that the GAA cannot treat our members and supporters abroad as second-class Irish citizens.  It is worth recalling that the investment in redevelopment in Ruislip is just one example of the manner in which the bulk of the GAA&rsquo;s revenue goes back out to GAA units to help fund their sporting, cultural and social missions.</p><p> We cannot overcome the barriers of physical separation and distance created by emigration, but new forms of communication allow us to create links that will mitigate that separation.  It is our hope that as this year&rsquo;s championships progress, the Irish at home, who have lost a small number of free-to-air TV games, will feel that giving up these few games is a small price to pay as they hear back how their family members and friends abroad are following Gaelic games live on TV or on the Internet.</p> <p>For the Irish abroad, for the next three years, watching GAA championship hurling and football matches live on television or on the Internet will make them feel a little closer to home.</p></speech>

The reason for the meeting is to give them an opportunity to explain the rationale behind the deal and it gives members the opportunity to convey the concerns heard on the ground when it was announced.  There was initial surprise and emotion but today's meeting gives us the chance to tease out the issue.  The reaction of some was as if all games had been taken away from free-to-air broadcasting, which is not true as the witnesses have explained.  Sometimes the facts get lost in this and the Government is blamed for many things.  It was blamed for this deal but, for anyone who does not understand, it is a deal between the GAA and the broadcasters.</p><p>  The 45 games that are free-to-air in Australia is a welcome development.  Could that have been made possible in another way without linking up with Sky?  With regard to the RTE digital deal, whereby people can access games on laptops and computers, is it free or will people pay subscriptions?  The presentation referred to a concern I have heard, that in three years' time more games will be taken away from free-to-air and given to Sky.  Since the deal was announced, there was speculation within the GAA, with the suggestion from Peter McKenna that there will be some negotiation with Sky in respect of deals for clubs getting discounts on subscriptions.</p></speech>

The RTE digital service across the world will be a subscription service as it is not feasible or financially viable to make it a free service.  The rates have not yet been fixed and we are in discussion with RTE so it has not yet been announced.</p></speech>

This will not be particularly profitable.  To make the service available all over the world will be expensive but we have not yet fixed rates.</p><p>  The Chairman asked whether we had to go with Sky.  We offered the opportunity to tender to every conceivable broadcast unit in the United Kingdom, including the BBC, ITV and Channel 4.  The BBC was only interested in teams involved in the Ulster championship and had no interest beyond that.  We received no bids from ITV or Channel 4.  The only broadcaster available to us, if we wanted to make the games available at home available to those in Britain, was Sky.  We were grateful that Sky showed an interest because there were no other bids on the table.  The BBC received the same tender documentation as Sky, as did ITV and Channel 4 but there was no interest.</p><p>  I hope I addressed the Chairman's question about three years time in my opening statement.  We are trying to achieve a balance.  It was carefully stated in our opening remarks that, this time, we have achieved a balance, looking after the needs of the domestic audience at home, who will see 31 live championship games and 100 live games over the course of the year, and the audience abroad.  We think we got the balance right but we will monitor it.  We have no intention of putting all our games on a subscription channel.  It is a matter of balance and we, along with the team in Croke Park, will work hard to achieve the balance.  We believe we have achieved it.</p><p>  With regard to the Chairman's final question, Sky is looking at a package for GAA clubs and, hopefully, progress will be made over the coming weeks.</p></speech>

Every member of the committee is cognisant of the exceptionally good work the GAA does and the leadership it has shown in developing the sport at local and national level, including the investment the organisation makes.  Any comments I make at variance with where the witnesses are on the issue should not be seen as negative towards the wonderful work it does.</p><p>  Mr. Duffy says "if we had decided that all TV coverage of our games was to be free-to-air, we would have had to abandon what we saw as our obligation to our Irish supporters abroad".  We are all cognisant of the diaspora and their needs.  Could the reach to the diaspora not have been achieved through the RTE digital channel, which would not require taking certain games away from the free-to-air platform?  I understand that the coverage is free-to-air in Australia and access to the diaspora could have been achieved through that platform without abandoning the obligation.</p><p>  What unique access does Sky Sports have to the diaspora that other free-to-air broadcasters do not have?  I accept the point made but we must take into consideration the RTE digital platform and Channel 7 in Australia.  Could the GAA not have achieved the objective, particularly given that finance was not a key priority?  The witnesses emphasised that the benefit is marginal.</p><p>  We understand the need to trade off certain issues.  What about the people left at home?  What does the GAA say to the elderly club stalwart who lives in rural isolation and has participated in our national games, played the game, worked in the club, lined the fields and cut the grass but is unable to afford the Sky Sports package?  What does the GAA say to them if their county happens to be playing?  The big game for these people is when the county is playing.  What if it happens to be an event that is on the Sky platform?  What do the witnesses say to the family, the husband and wife with three kids who cannot afford the Sky package because of the economic circumstances?  They are left with Hobson's choice and the trade-off of going to the pub to watch the game and introducing children to pub culture or staying at home and not watching the game.  Some 14 games have been designated but people from the counties playing on a particular Saturday or Sunday are left with Hobson's choice.  It may be a trade-off too far.</p><p>  The witnesses' statement refers to cynical reaction by some to the announcement of the new contracts.  Perhaps the witnesses can expand on where the cynicism resides.  We have identified that this is a deal for three years.  In 2011, the GAA hierarchy told the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources that it would not sell rights to a foreign channel as it was "contrary to the culture and national ethos of the association".  Two questions emanate from that.</p> <p>What has changed at the level of GAA hierarchy that would make a practice that was contrary to the culture and national ethos of the association acceptable now to the culture and ethos of the association?  Is Mr. Duffy not concerned that when the process of moving to a pay-per-view environment begins, the association will start to move away from the notion of volunteerism towards pay for play?  These questions need to be answered.  I am not necessarily criticising the decision the association has taken but these questions arise among the electorate, those who love the game, who have participated in it and want it to retain a connection with the culture about which Mr Duffy talked, and the core ethos of the voluntary sporting environment.  They want to see that continue.  They need to hear from Mr. Duffy and Mr. O'Neill today how they hope to preserve and maintain that ethos.</p></speech>

He did not say he was emperor of the island or of Ireland but of the Irish.  We have to consider the Irish at home and abroad.</p><p>  I am a primary school teacher and I will return to that work.  I live in a small community.  I know old and young people.  I will meet GAA people every day of my three years in office.  One month has already gone.  It is a fortnight today since the deal was announced.  I can look the Deputy in the eye and honestly say nobody has said a negative thing directly to me about it.  That is significant because of the number of people I meet.</p><p>  Apart from going to functions and meeting people in the normal course of events, I attended games in Thurles the week before last and the games in Croke Park on Sunday, where there was a wide representation of GAA people.  I spent yesterday playing with young children on the surface of Croke Park; 1,200 children played there yesterday.  Over the course of the year 12,000 children will play on the surface of Croke Park.  We are delighted to do that.  That is part of our reaching out to communities.</p><p>  We in the GAA have recognised for some time that we take our strength from communities.  From day one I pointed out to communities where clubs had been formed over 125 years ago - which are having big celebrations - that great communities were the first to form GAA clubs because they recognised something of value in the fledgling organisation and jumped in saying they wanted to be part of it.  The growth since then has been phenomenal.</p><p>  As Mr Duffy pointed out, it is a global organisation with a global responsibility.  When I meet young people, whether at home or abroad, they want to play and need to see our games.  That is why we want them at our games and why we offer such fantastic value to children, who come free to most games.  There is a minor charge because a ticket must be produced for some games.  Apart from that children are, and always will be, our focus.  The only reaction I got yesterday to the Sky deal was a thumbs-up from a family and the young people said "Well done Sky".  Children are looking forward to it because they know it will be good.  They know Sky is a byword for excellent production, coverage and hype of games and they look forward to it.</p><p>  Last October, I visited Australia for the Australasian Games, which cover New Zealand and the surrounding areas as well as Australia.  The message I heard there, as I have heard on every other visit was "Please see to it that we get our games".  Not only will the Irish in Australia be able to view the games but the millions of people who know of the association between the Australian Football League, AFL, and Gaelic games are interested in our Gaelic football and want to see it and enjoy it.  They now have a chance to do that.</p><p>  I spoke to a young man in Australia who told me two years ago he had to go to a pub to watch an all-Ireland final.  It was the early hours of the morning and the pub closed at three o'clock and he begged the barman to let him stay.  The barman said it was against the rules and he could not do it but he told him he could turn the television towards the window and the man could stand outside to watch it.  Can the committee picture our emigrants, our brothers and sisters, aunts and uncles, nieces and nephews or grandchildren, standing outside the window of a pub in Australia seeking to watch our games?  How glad will those people be and how glad are they now that they will have access to it?  How glad are they that not only did we go to the bother of providing the games on free-to-air, but we also have a partner there who will do that for us?  That is a huge success.</p></speech>

I accept absolutely the GAA's obligation to ensure that the diaspora is looked after but it could have gone ahead with the deal in Australia and with RTE in respect of its digital platform and it would still have had access to the diaspora, to the emigrants and would have resolved exactly the problem Mr O'Neill spoke about, without taking away the 14 games we are talking about.  Many things are getting thrown into the mix here but there is a distinction.</p></speech>

We are trying to deal with this as best we can.  I am not used to this form of questioning but I will do my best to answer the Deputy.  This is a package.  We had that person in Australia in mind.</p><p>  The central council delegate for Britain is Paul Foley.  I visited him in Cardiff last Saturday week and he told me that for years they were neglected, the broadcasters here did not make an effort to provide the games in Britain.  There is a huge Irish population in Britain.  I was with St. Colmcille's Club in Cardiff whose members said they were delighted that for the first time, the ladies particularly, will be able to tell their work colleagues this is their sport, and invite them to see it.  Millions of people will see it.  It will bring about a huge awareness of the value of Gaelic games on the island of Britain.</p><p>  Had we not thought of the emigrants we might not have considered the Sky package.  The Deputy needs to see this as a process.  It would be more fair to view it as a package rather than isolate one tiny point.  This was our aim at the start.  I have reached out and spent a good deal of time on the island of Britain, which the GAA in Britain acknowledges.  London is our biggest flagship abroad, along with New York.  They are our two biggest county boards abroad.  They were looking for help.  They wanted to be acknowledged and for us to show them that they are important to us.  While the other deal could have been done in Australia the fact that we placed the Irish abroad at the top of our agenda meant that we focused on the package that has now evolved.  One cannot isolate one incident.  We did not go to Sky.  Sky tendered and we responded.</p></speech>

This is a headline from <i>thejournal.ie</i>, 16 September 2013:<blockquote><br />GAA seeking to expand TV coverage of games for Irish people abroad<br />Director-General Paraic Duffy has confirmed the association are focusing on making the games more accessible around the world.</blockquote></p> <p>We will not make money from the Australian deal; it will probably cost us money overall.  Why would we make any arrangement other than a free-to-air deal when we are in a position to make that deal?  We are in a position to do this with Channel 7, the biggest in Australia, and it amounted to a golden opportunity but with no financial benefit in making the deal.  </p><p> As I stated, if the BBC had told us it would include 20 big championship games, including all-Ireland finals, semi-finals, etc. in free-to-air services in Britain, we would have jumped at the chance.  It did not make such an offer and neither did ITV nor Channel 4.  Sky indicated that it was willing to do so.</p></speech>

We tendered, as we have done for years, and the BBC indicated that it would like to show some games in the Ulster championship.  Every year the broadcasters receive the same treatment.  Sky was the interested party and I will tell the committee about it.  I got a text from a person in Ireland who indicated that this was a fantastic development, as his 85 year old father had for years gone to the pub to watch Irish games, but he will now be able to watch them on Sky.  There are 11 million households in Britain with access to Sky, which means that people can now watch games in their homes.  If we are genuine about spreading the games among the Irish abroad and giving them the best possible chance to watch a game, this is it.  We have received positive feedback from the GAA family abroad.  If there had been a free-to-air option, we would have taken it, but there was not.  Sky told us it wanted to show games.</p></speech>

I have the document in front of me.  At the time Eamonn Ryan was the Minister responsible for communications and there was a proposal to broadcast certain games free-to-air.  We indicated that it was the policy of the GAA to have key championship games available to all television viewers.  As I have stated in documents from both Mr. O'Neill and me, 16 of the 18 major games this year, from provincial finals upwards, will be broadcast free to air.  There is a balance to be found to meet the needs of emigrants and we have achieved it by keeping 16 of the big 18 games free to air.  What has changed since 2010?  We know from our own transfers that hundreds of thousands of young people have left Ireland and the demand from abroad to see our games is now far greater than it was in 2010.</p><p>  The Deputy also mentioned that all games would not be shown live on television.  I come from Monaghan and very few games involving such counties are shown live.  Our supporters are well used to watching highlights, listening to the radio or, more importantly, going to games.  We do not have the right and do not expect all of our games to be shown live on television.  No county has that right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.175" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1092" speakername="Paudie Coffey" time="12:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500006#E00600"><p>I welcome the ard-sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir and the uachtar&aacute;n Cumann Luthchleas Gael.  It is welcome for us to air this issue and, like Deputy Timmy Dooley, I acknowledge the contribution of the GAA for generations to Irish society in the development of national games and Irish culture.  I am a lifelong supporter of the GAA and a member, former player, administrator and chairman of a club that is over 102 years old.  That club does not have fancy bar facilities; we purely have playing facilities, a hurling wall and dressing rooms.  Having said that, I would not categorise myself as a cynic; I am a genuine GAA supporter who wants to see the organisation doing well.  The delegation should welcome genuine concerns being expressed by the membership which may not have an opportunity to express them at their level.  The GAA is a democratic organisation after all.</p><p>  The delegates have outlined the priorities behind this decision and argued that it will facilitate games being broadcast to the Irish Diaspora, which is a laudable objective that should be supported.  Like Deputy Timmy Dooley, I am concerned about how the decision was reached to do a deal with Sky pay-per-view channels.  Did the GAA actively pursue the BBC or Channel 4, for example, in order to provide coverages of games free to air in Britain?  Were documents merely sent and was it up to the broadcasters to show an interest?  Were there incentives to show games in Britain on a free-to-air system?  I am chairman of a local club and want to see this system working.  If I am wrong to raise my concerns, I will admit it.  When concerns were raised about jersey sponsorship, corporate boxes in Croke Park and live television broadcasting of matches, I supported the GAA's actions.  This time there seems to be a fundamental shift from the core ethos of the GAA, as it is the first time subscription services will be used.</p><p>  I raise these concerns for a number of reasons.  Deputy Timmy Dooley mentioned the 80 year old club stalwart; we all have such examples in our clubs.  Such persons typically do not have Sky subscriptions and do not want to go to the pub; as such they will be disenfranchised.  The GAA must accept this.  More games are being broadcast and there will probably be further chances to see a match, but if a supporter's county is playing in a qualifier or a quarter final, he or sh e may be disenfranchised as he or she will not be able to see the match, despite looking forward to it.  It is a credit to the GAA that it has progressed so much during the years in having matches covered live on television.</p><p>  There are also the expectations of players.  The GAA has argued that this is not a financial decision and although this may not be of major financial benefit to the GAA, we must be very careful.  The Gaelic Players Association has handled the issue very well with the GAA, but players are a product for a very beautiful game; therefore, will the expectation of payment arise in the future because television rights are being sold and people are paying to watch matches?  What will the GAA do to manage that expectation?</p><p>  The delegates know that volunteers in GAA clubs raise funds weekly to keep clubs going.  Despite the perception that the GAA has plenty of money, the delegates know that on the ground clubs do not have plenty of money and that people work very hard to keep them going and provide excellent facilities.  There is a perception - it may just be that - among the GAA supporting public that the organisation now has plenty of money; therefore, clubs will find it a little harder to sell the weekly lotto ticket and county draw ticket to keep going.  As there could be consequences, has the GAA considered the possibilities?</p><p>  The GAA has publicly stated any money derived from this process will go back to the clubs.  How will this happen?  Will it be given to county boards, allocated through grant schemes or other methods?  I am not a cynic, but I have genuine concerns.  I will be the first to put up my hand and say I was wrong if it turns out that way.  The GAA is a progressive organisation which deserves great credit for the stand it has taken during the years when various challenges were presented.  Croke Park was improved at a time when it was very difficult for the organisation to progress, but it has seen the rewards; therefore, it deserves all the credit it gets.  As a GAA supporter, I have genuine concerns about this fundamental shift and would like to be reassured by the delegation.</p></speech>

We are both club members.<br />This is not a pay-per-view service.  Sky is a subscription channel, which it is important to remember.  In the debate in the past few weeks one may sometimes have got the impression that nobody in Ireland had access to Sky.  There are 1.1 million households in Ireland with access to its services; therefore, it is not as if no one will see the games.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.193" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500007#F00200"><p>No, we did not offer incentives to the BBC to cover our games.  That was a reasonable position to take.  As far as the GPA and the issue of pay-for-play is concerned, it is important to make the point in terms of our relationship with Liam - I have handled the GPA in recent years - that one of the very first ordinances in the GPA's constitution is a commitment to the amateur status of the GAA.  In recent years in our dealings with it it has been absolutely faithful to it.  Pay-for-play is simply not an issue.  The GPA is as committed as we are to the amateur status of players and the organisation.</p><p>  In terms of money going back to clubs, it is very important to state that the overall value of the broadcast packages we have allocated is marginally higher than last time around.  The information can be accessed by anybody on a yearly basis in our annual accounts which show the total amount we receive in broadcast revenue.  One will be able to see at the end of the current financial year the difference between this year and the last year.  It is marginal.  We were not driven by financial gain but by having our games seen as easily as possible.</p><p>  I do not want to have to repeat the point over and over again, but there seems to be an idea that people are losing games that were shown in the past and that if one&rsquo;s county was playing a match, it was on television and now it will not be.  The vast majority of championship games are not shown on television.  Less than half of the games are shown.  It is not right to say that suddenly everyone has lost the right to watch games live.  If one is from Dublin, Kerry or one of the big counties, the games are always on television, but if one is from Monaghan, Laois, Carlow, Fermanagh or Longford, they were probably not shown in the first place.  It is important to keep a sense of perspective around this also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.194" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam O'Neill" time="12:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500007#F00300"><p>It is important to point out to Deputy Paudie Coffey that we welcome the opportunity and are delighted to be here.  We realise we are not just talking to the committee; we are also talking to a wider audience and some of the questions being answered are welcome.  We are happy with the process.</p><p>  When we say 86% of funds goes back to the organisation, we are not talking about handing cheques to clubs; that is not the way it works.  That is not the way the Government works either.  It works on projects through which it directs money for the greater good.  Everyone benefits from the policy.  We have a stadium in almost every county in Ireland and the upkeep cost is huge.  We have redevelopment projects.  In recent years we have ploughed huge resources into the provision of better facilities for supporters and players.  We have ploughed a huge amount of money back into clubs.  In the past ten years clubs have done an enormous amount of work for their communities, from which huge benefits have been derived.  We have enhanced communities.</p><p>  We have spent money abroad and not just in Ruislip.  We are contributing a fairly substantial figure to the development of the social centre at Gaelic Park in New York.  We have already contributed to Canton in Boston.  We support facilities in Chicago, Philadelphia, San Francisco and Cleveland and now have interest shown in Buffalo and Pittsburgh.  We will support all of these because that is important to us because people who want to play our games are important to us.  We also have two juvenile clubs in New York, Rockland in the north of the city and Shannon Gaels in Queens.  To show the power of the games abroad and how people abroad view them, following negotiations with Shannon Gaels, the city borough of Queens has offered a city park.  It is like Merrion Square being handed over to a club, which is unbelievable recognition.  The city borough recognises what our clubs abroad are doing for children, not only children of parents born in Ireland but also of people who were born in America and their friends and neighbours.  They value it.</p><p>  When I say we plough back the money, we spend a huge amount on player welfare.  We do not have an insurance scheme; we have a player injury benefit scheme, in which we invest a huge amount of money.  We invest a lot of money also in looking after communities through the community and well-being section headed by Mr. Colin Regan in Croke Park.  We have programmes such as the social initiative, the idea for which came from Mr. Martin McAleese and his wife when she was President.  The initiative started some years ago and we support it.  Every day we meet the old people to whom Deputy Timmy Dooley referred and bring them to our clubs.  We share our community centres with them, which we know is important and on which we spend money.  In partnership with the HSE, we also have a section on mental well-being.  We have an anti-suicide strategy, on which we work with the Department of Health and the HSE.  We work with the Department of Children and Youth Affairs on child welfare issues.  A huge amount of our resources goes back into communities.  It is important to acknowledge this.</p><p>  It is fair to say pay-for-play has been taken off the agenda.  We do not view our players as a product; we value them.  Any time I speak to juvenile clubs, when I talk about under-age players, people at primary school level, whether we like it &ndash; we like it &ndash; I say we are in the business of child care.  We look after our children well.  We cherish them.  We cherish all of the family.  That is why we are trying as an organisation to wind back the history of the foundation of the organisation to where camogie and ladies&rsquo; football were formed separately from us.  We want to build one central organisation that will look after the family in the community and treat all young people equally.</p><p>  We have also made an offer about which Senator Eamon Coghlan is aware.  We have centres of excellence around the country.  We have identified that there could be a greater benefit from their use during the day when they are not used by us.  We have made an offer to Athletics Ireland to build athletics tracks at the centres in collaboration with the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport.  We would be willing to do this.  We have facilities, in which we have invested a huge amount of resources.  We are looking after the wider community in a manner in which the organisation never had an opportunity to do before.</p></speech>

Well done to him.  We are well represented, although so far we have not troubled the GAA in championship terms very often.  We do intend to get over this.</p><p>  Like other Deputies, sometimes it feels that because we are asking detailed questions there is criticism of an organisation.  I do not think anybody could or should undervalue the great work being done by Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael.  It has given us and our predecessors a great deal and, undoubtedly, our successors in future generations will play and enjoy our unique Irish games.  It has given us great moments of glory and a feelgood factor that no other organisation could give.</p><p>  I understand the need for a commercial organisation.  Cumann L&uacute;thchleas Gael is a commercial organisation which is doing an awful lot of voluntary work, but, nonetheless, I understand it must make commercial decisions.  I accept that the decision on media rights between 2014 and 2017 had a mix of commercial considerations, although it has been said the amount of additional revenue is insignificant.  I have no doubt that commercial considerations were taken into account side by side with the need to maximise access to our beautiful games, whether in Ireland or for Irish people and others living abroad.  It is not so much a question of whether it is through a subscription channel or free-to-air.  What is important is whether the measure will be successful and the factors the GAA took into account are valid.  A report was produced by Mr. Paul Rouse, a lecturer in the school of history and archives at UCD and formerly of &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; at RTE, on the impact of pay TV on sport.  It is a little out of date in that it was published in 2012 and based on 2007 data.</p> <p>He examined the Heineken Cup viewing figures for 2006 and 2007.  In 2006 the Heineken Cup semi-finals were covered by RTE and 62% of viewers watched them.  In 2007 it was covered by Sky Sports and only 25% of viewers watched it.  He also found that the first cricket test in 2004 between England and New Zealand had been covered by Channel 4.  On day five of its coverage it had over 1 million viewers.  The second test was carried by Sky Sports and there were only 85,000 viewers.  While many people have access to Sky, not many have access to Sky Sports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.201" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy" time="12:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500008#G00200"><p>As we have absolutely no problem in accepting criticism, it is not an issue.</p><p>  Mr. Paul Rouse&rsquo;s research dealt with the Heineken Cup.  The key point, however, is that all Heineken Cup games are shown on Sky.  Last weekend there were three Irish teams involved in the semi-finals and all three games were shown on Sky.  The point we have made is that, of our 18 biggest games, 16 will still be shown on RTE.  The Paul Rouse research has been quoted for several weeks, but it is not valid in the case of this issue.</p><p>  The viewing figures for GAA matches on RTE are by far the best of any sport in Ireland, including the Six Nations.  Two of the top six programmes on RTE last year involved GAA matches.  Thirty one of our championship games in the next three years will be shown free-to-air and I hope they will attract the same viewing figures.  Last year RTE did not cover all of the provincial finals.  This year it will cover all six.  There will be 100 live GAA games free-to-air in the next three years.</p></speech>

On the percentage of households reached by RTE and pay-TV sports channels, 99% had RTE 1 and RTE 2, 25% had Setanta, 25% had Sky Sports 1, while 17% had Sky Sports 3.  That is the scale involved.  If it was within the capability of RTE, TV3 and TG4 to handle all of the games, would we be having this discussion?</p></speech>

Up to 11 million homes have access to Sky.  The key point was that the three other stations could not do this.</p></speech>

We want people to understand that with this media rights package we have more options.  We now know we can partner with a subscription channel, go digital and still use the tried and trusted methods that were available.  This deal means that the family in New York that wants to watch our games does not have to go to a pub at 9 a.m.  I have received correspondence from players with Shannon Gaels in New York on this issue who are delighted they will be able to bring in their neighbours for games in the morning and share a communal experience in their own home.  That strikes at the very core of everything that matters when abroad.  It means that people will watch the same game in real time around the world and be able to communicate simultaneously about a fantastic goal scored or so forth.</p><p>  One of the best reactions I received on the deal that will bring the games around the world on hand-held devices was in Bahrain at the GAA mid-east tournament.  A nurse from County Galway told me that being able to watch games abroad would be like a Band-Aid on a homesick heart.</p> <p>That is the core of what we have done here.  We have reached out to our people and done our best.  It is a package and we want people to view it as such.  That person's reaction is typical.</p></speech>

I have no questions but will make some brief points because people on my side have not been able to get a word in.  I welcome the deal.  The witnesses have illustrated some of the comments of those who have had to leave this island.  I will give an additional illustration of why this is good for those who left, whether by choice or not.  A family member told me by e-mail that the news of this deal was celebrated in the Irish club in Melbourne 24 hours after the GAA's decision and was the talk of the entire evening.  Whatever the reservations of politicians here in Dublin, the GAA is way ahead of us, because those who have left have made up their minds that it is very welcome.  On that basis I support it fully.</p><p>  Mr. Duffy referred to cynical comment.  I draw my own conclusions on this.  Some people have a hang-up about Rupert Murdoch and the sort of person he is.  I hope he does not take me to court for this, not that I care too much.  His dealings are his own.  From what I know about the man, I have full faith-----</p></speech>

I have great faith in the GAA's ability to negotiate with Rupert Murdoch, with a contract in one hand and a hurling stick in the other, which they would certainly need dealing with him.  I compliment the GAA on that.  The Deputies on the other side live in the beautiful countryside.  Clare is my favourite county.  I doubt there is a man or woman in any remote part of Clare who would not walk to hell to see Shane O'Donnell score a point for Clare in this year's final.  I doubt there is anybody in any remote part of County Dublin who would not walk to the nearest pub to see somebody like Eoghan O'Gara scoring a goal on Sky Sports.  That is the reality.  It is a great day.</p><p>  I am one who drifted away from the foreign game, to use that old phrase.  One Saturday a few years ago - not that I spend much time in pubs - I reached a conclusion that when I was watching league football all the people I was watching were millionaires and multimillionaires.  I sobered myself up and said never again would I watch people running around who were paid so much and were more concerned about the gel in their hair than scoring goals.  I gave up on it.  I am with the GAA.  I compliment the witnesses and I have no questions.</p></speech>

We have made a major contribution to the GAA.  Over the weekend I listened to a debate on this.  Like Deputy Coffey, we all come from very small GAA clubs which are struggling to raise funds and are finding it very difficult.  People on the ground are asking what is in it for them and they may not see the bigger picture.  Over the weekend I heard the expectation Deputy Coffey expressed.  People asked what members would receive at local level.  There is an expectation that money will trickle down to the local clubs from this deal.  I have a very open mind on this because I have seen what happens in Australia.  People raise issues with me about it and they feel the GAA might be on the slippery slope.  The witnesses said they would monitor it over the next three years.  If they find there are unintended consequences, what process will they put in place for people to be able to say they do not agree with this?  What consultation did the GAA do with its members before it concluded this deal?</p></speech>

It is being broadcast on a pay-per-view channel, so the people watching it are paying for it.  I support what the GAA is trying to do in reaching out to the disapora.  It is very laudable and good.  The GAA's president and ard sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir summed up the impact emigration has had on clubs.  I have one minor concern.  The success of this will depend on the expectation that is lifted in the countries in which the pay-per-view channel will be made available for our diaspora.  As people's expectation builds they may feed back to their subscribers or television channels that they are delighted to get the GAA in Melbourne or wherever and they want more of it.  The 14 games are ones that would otherwise not be aired.  People are anxious that there might be a temptation to release more after three years.  Neither we nor the GAA want to see a move away from the terrestrial, free element to a pay-per-view situation.</p><p>  Could the witnesses repeat the RTE digital information?</p> <p>I missed the answer; perhaps it was not clear enough or I did not pick it up properly.  Were the RTE digital channels considered with a view to seeing whether the games could be made available as a live stream on the Internet?  For argument's sake, taking out the 14 games Sky has, the most desirable games are the all-Ireland semi-finals in hurling and football and the all-Ireland finals.  I wish to ask about the relationship with TV3 and where it now fits in.  It has a role in the marketplace.  How will this be filled?</p><p> To recap, with regard to the expectations of people abroad will more pressure be brought to bear to release more games, particularly at the higher level?  Were the RTE digital channels considered?  How does TV3 fit into the situation?  What the GAA is trying to do in terms of taking its games to people outside of the country who otherwise cannot see them is something I support.</p></speech>

I commend the GAA on this branch out to reach the diaspora throughout the world.  The Gaelic Athletics Association is unique as a sports body when one considers the amateur ethos going back to its foundation 135 years ago by Maurice Davin and Michael Cusack.  It has come a long way since then.  I am delighted to hear the comments by the President with regard to the GAA going into negotiations or deliberations with the Athletic Association of Ireland.  It is a golden opportunity for the GAA to return to its roots when athletics was included in the early days.</p><p>  As a young boy, every Sunday I went to Croke Park and pulled wires with my father, Bill Coghlan, under the stewardship of Se&aacute;n &Oacute; S&iacute;och&aacute;in, when we worked on the sound system.  I had a dream of playing there.  I never had an opportunity to do so but I ran there in primary school sports.  The GAA is the lifeblood of our community.  It defines every town and parish in the country.  The country owes much to the GAA for what it has done for Irish society.  However I am a realist and we are in the 21st century.  This is a venture into the world domain to show our wonderful Gaelic games throughout the world.  The GAA is competing with other sports on an international basis for television exposure.  It is all about marketing, exposure, the big picture and tourism.  In particular it is about the exposure our country, through the medium of the GAA, will get throughout the world.  I remember marketing 101 in college when our professor entered the room in a wheelchair and the first statement he made was if one wants to make a monkey famous one puts the monkey on TV for long enough.  This is what will happen with the GAA and the brand of the sport throughout the world.</p><p>  A number of people have been discommoded because 14 games will not be shown free-to-air, but as the witnesses indicated not all of the games are shown on TV anyhow.  In recent weeks people in conversation with me have made certain comments.  They wonder whether this deal with Sky Sports will dictate the schedule of GAA games in future.  In other words, they wonder whether there will be Monday, Wednesday, Friday or Saturday night football.  They wonder whether it will affect the players who are amateur in terms of their relationships with their employers and getting off work for midweek games.  Will the GAA benefit from the advertising revenue which Sky sells?  Will the GAA benefit from subscriptions which Sky receives from people signing up to Sky Sports packages?  Well done to the GAA.  It will be great for Ireland and the youth of Ireland if the GAA decides to goes back to its roots.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.240" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;raic Duffy" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500010#J00300"><p>With regard to what is in it for the clubs from their perspective if each of the 2,000 clubs received &euro;1,000 each it would amount to &euro;2 million.  Some clubs would welcome the &euro;1,000 but for others it would make very little difference.  With regard to supporting our clubs we ran a national draw on St. Patrick's day.  The GAA at national level provided all of the prizes and made all of the arrangements.  All the clubs had to do was sell tickets and keep the money.  It raised &euro;2.5 million for the clubs.  This money went directly to them and they had no costs.  No money was sent back to Croke Park.  We are concerned about our clubs.</p><p>  At the most recent meeting of the management committee we decided, because we had increased our income from this revenue, to return more than &euro;500,000 to all of the clubs.  We returned all of the membership fees they paid last year, which was &euro;1 or &euro;2 per member.  These cheques will issue in the coming weeks.  We are very concerned about putting money into our clubs.  As the uachtar&aacute;n stated earlier we must use all of our income across the board as best we can for the association and we will continue to do so.</p><p>  To answer Deputy O'Donovan's question on consultation these are commercial arrangements.  In January, the uachtar&aacute;n and I, having decided on a strategy, went to the management committee comprising 15 people, including four provincial chairmen, a representative from each province from central council and a number of external people appointed to the board.  We explained to them where we were in the negotiations and our aspirations and we got approval to go ahead.  It was not a question of two people deciding this is what we would do; we obtained the approval of the elected and appointed management committee which runs the association from year to year.  I am sure the issue will be debated at congress and central council and I am sure not everybody will agree, but from the feedback the uachtar&aacute;n and I have received to date I am confident the overwhelming majority of the membership is supportive of what we have done and what we are trying to achieve.  I want to make it very clear it was done with the blessing of the management committee as it was a very valid question.</p><p>  Deputy O'Donovan also made a point about Melbourne.  We are making 45 games available free to air and this is as good as it can be.  We want to maintain this because we feel a huge responsibility.  Many of the people who have gone to Australia are young people who were playing or attending our games before they went.  We felt a huge responsibility towards this group in particular.  We are not doing this for the money.  We are making 45 games available free to air on Channel 7.  It is fantastic for us and for the emigrants and we will try to maintain it.</p><p>  Concerns about the future have been raised.  I understand them and they are valid.  A total of 16 of our 18 big games are still free to air.  We want to maintain a balance.  Mr. O'Neill and I examined this very carefully throughout the negotiations and we believe we have a balance.  Almost all of the big games are available.  With regard to the future, the model is that this year, as well as Sky showing its own 14 games, in simulcast with RTE it will show two all-Ireland finals, two football semi-finals and two hurling semi-finals.  There is room to develop the simulcast in future.  If the number of games is increased I hope it can be done on this basis.  We are determined to maintain the balance.</p><p>  TV3 was disappointed to lose the rights.  We had a very good relationship with it in recent years.  It is a very professional organisation.  I have spoken to Mr. David McRedmond several times since and I am confident we will have a relationship with TV3 again.  It is important to us.</p><p>  I know of Senator Coghlan's long interest in the GAA and I knew his father as chairman of Bord Luthchleas na h&Eacute;ireann, BLE.  Senator Coghlan made a very good point on spreading the sports.  We are giving people across the board the chance to see our games.  The uachtar&aacute;n made the point earlier that anyone who sees hurling loves the game and that people in Australia identify easily with Gaelic football because of the Aussie rules game.</p><p>  It is important to make the point that 14 games is five more than last year, so with regard to losing free-to-air games it is a net loss of nine games.  There will be no issues with regard to scheduling games and this is clearly understood by Sky and ourselves.  We have no intention of playing games Wednesday, Thursday or Friday evenings for the reasons the Senator gave and I will not dwell on it.  As far as advertising revenue is concerned Sky will pay us a fee for the games and we are not involved in that side of it.</p></speech>

I travelled from west Cork this morning but I was caught out in Dublin by the traffic restrictions due to the protest.  I welcome the uachtar&aacute;in and ard-sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir of the GAA.</p><p>  Some of the lads here do not have inter-county experience but I was a club player for the bones of 20 years.  I was very glad to have won a Cork county senior football medal which I treasure.  I would like to touch on the following aspect again, namely, the voices that were not heard and where I come from views were divided on the deal.  I welcome the deal and view it as a positive approach.  However, I understand how the negotiations could be sensitive and kept reasonably close.  I listened carefully to the answer given to Deputy Phelan's query on the management structure.  Does the delegation envisage bringing a decision or a suite of decisions before congress on, perhaps not the minutiae, but the parameters of a commercial broadcasting deal with the GAA?</p><p>  One of the biggest problems, and one of the reasons there has been so much conversation about this matter, is due to what I call an apparent consultation lacuna, for want of a better word.  The GAA is an organisation that operates on a decision-making basis that ranges from the club, through the delegate structure and right up to congress but it cannot apply that to this decision.  Does it envisage changing that scenario?  The GAA was caught out because a potential win for the association, the games, supporters, etc., became controversial.  Does the GAA's communications strategy need to be addressed?  There was a lot of hyperbole about the decision.  There are pros and cons for any balanced decision.  Can the organisation learn something from the communications element of the decision?  </p><p>  Has the GAA assessed the impact the contract could have on games?  Gaelic games are a minority sport abroad.  Pay-per-view or subscription television, particularly by Sky, have completely changed some minority sports into commercial sports and beyond what was envisaged when the deal was originally made.  For example, the sport of darts has completely changed with such a development.  Has the GAA considered the possible impact of a contract?  Has there been any discussion about its potential?  This matter has been touched on already.  The appetite for the games to be broadcast abroad, and within Irish communities, will become insatiable.  They will want every county's games broadcast and they will demand access to them.  In trying to satisfy demand, will it lead to further issues for the GAA?  Will the matter need to be brought to congress?  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-04-15a.242" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1180" speakername="Helen McEntee" time="13:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TRJ2014041500011#K00200"><p>I thank both gentlemen for their contributions today and for the work that they do for the organisation.  The GAA is a fantastic organisation.  A lot of my questions have been asked and the delegation has answered them extremely well.</p><p>  I come from a very strong GAA family, grew up around it and have seen the work of its fantastic community and what that generates.  The only fear that we would have, and Deputies O'Donovan and Harrington have touched on the matter, is that the situation might change.  Deputy Dooley read a press release from 2010 which stated that the GAA would not opt for pay-per-view but times have changed.  I agree that times change and it is fantastic that the people living abroad have been acknowledged, which was something that needed to be done, but fears remain.  An Post attended here before the committee not long ago.  On that occasion it talked about installing customer paypoints in Tesco branches which has led to a fear that post offices would disappear but An Post has said that will not happen.  Can the GAA say that it will not move away from amateur status in 2017 if, as Deputy Harrington has said, there is a demand?  Obviously the GAA depends on volunteers but if its amateur status changed the organisation would become more like the way rugby is now and like darts did when it moved to Sky.  Unfortunately, these days sports is more about money.</p></speech>

I welcome the ard-sti&uacute;rth&oacute;ir and the uachtar&aacute;in of the GAA.</p><p>  Is the TG4 coverage on Saturdays set to continue?  The delegation has told us that RTE has got the 31 matches that it sought and the 100 live GAA matches will continue over three years.  The delegation did say the figures clearly.  Can it confirm the figures?  </p><p>  I second what was said by Deputy McEntee.  I wonder sometimes at the criticism levelled at the GAA when it does things like this.  The GAA is an incredible organisation and nothing like it exists anywhere else.  Let me refer to the credit that I get from my constituency in Northern Ireland, a lot of whom would be Unionists.  As TCD graduates they were absolutely delighted and charmed by the welcome they received when they played the rugby matches in Croke Park, which makes an impact on people.</p><p>  With regard to the GAA's work in communities, I recall the opening of a new field in Summerhill a couple of years and the rector, who was a woman, and the parish priest jointly opened a facility that would benefit the entire community.  I repeat that an incredible amount of work is done by the GAA.  What about people going to matches and the people who are left behind?  I was in Aughrim last year for a first round match and saw that a huge number of buses had travelled from north Meath ferrying supporters.  It felt like nearly everybody from the county had travelled to Aughrim for the match.  The GAA does not leave people out or behind.  </p><p>  With regards to the diaspora, Tommy Drumm drops in here from time to time and works in Perth.  I am sure that he will be delighted, as a former captain, that his sport has recognised the diaspora.  Now that he works abroad he will be able to see the matches.</p><p>  Sometimes I feel that the criticisms levelled at the GAA do not take into account all of the work that it does.  The last critique was on the damage that the GAA was allegedly doing by taking sponsorship from alcohol companies.  I thought that the criticism should have been more properly directed at the banks and accountants - the people who got the country into trouble - rather than an organisation which has served us so splendidly. </p><p>  I wish to refer to another matter.  We have discovered that the first Cathaoirleach of the Seanad was Dr. George Sigerson who gave the Sigerson Cup to the GAA.  We left him out of our history so it is time that the Seanad and the GAA got together and acknowledged the first Cathaoirleach even though he only served for 24 hours.  In addition to being a great supporter of the GAA he was in fact the first Cathaoirleach.</p><p>  I commend the work that the GAA has been doing on so many layers of Irish society and wish it every success.  The moneybags men have taken over the many sports that people have mentioned.  They will do serious damage to the sport of rugby, particularly in England.  However, I do not think they pose a danger because the GAA is such a democratic and participatory organisation.  I am sure that the money will be seen to filter down to clubs up and down the country and used to run the under-11s games, etc.  </p><p>  I welcome what was said by Senator Eamonn Coghlan about using the fields for athletics, if they are free.  The gates are mostly left open in the places that I have seen around.  Those who doubt the GAA should, in the next couple of months, go to the exhibition matches, before the championship starts, which are held in small villages and so on.  It is there that one will see the real heart of the organisation.</p><p>  I do not expect to be allowed into Croke Park for free.  I do not see any political or economic case to support the right to watch matches for free either.  We pay a television licence fee and have so-called free-to-air.  If a match is on a pay channel either one does not watch it or one pays.  One cannot run an organisation like the GAA without money.  I think that the GAA gives incredible value for money.  It is a naive interpretation of a property right to assume that one has a right to go into Croke Park or watch matches for free.  It is that expectation which has informed some of the debate.  There is also a mood of anger against a lot of institutions which should not be directed at the GAA for the work that it does.  </p></speech>

As the Chairman will probably know, I started my career as a club mentor in my club and graduated through the ranks to become club secretary, club chairman and eventually county board chairman a few short years ago.  Therefore, I am well aware of the issues.</p><p>  I hail from a small county like Carlow which unfortunately does not appear regularly on television.  </p> <p>I welcome the deal, as it is an opportunity for unfortunate emigrants from my county and all others to see what we can produce from time to time.  The opportunity may arise this summer if we are fortunate enough to take part in the Leinster championship match against Wexford which I believe is one of the games that will be screened on Sky.  I am sure there are plenty of Carlow people around the world who would like to have the opportunity to see our hurlers progress in the future.  While I welcome the deal in principle, I understand from working in the GAA for many years that all of the money generated comes back to the clubs.  My club, like every other throughout the country, has benefited from that principle which I would like to see continue indefinitely.  The major concern among the vast majority at the grassroots, although the consultation process was explained, is that they have a say in the way things are done.  They would like to have the opportunity to discuss issues at club level and progress to have them discussed at congress.  They believe one has overshot the runway in not discussing the issue at grassroots level, although I take the point that it was discussed.  If it had been done in that way, there might have been more positivity.  I do not say there is negativity towards it in my part of the country; it has not been an issue and I do not think it is.  It is a major benefit for the organisation in general.  If the ordinary person at the grassroots had been more directly involved in the consultation process, they would have been happier.  </p><p> Our Gaelic games are the best in the world and we need to show them to the world.  Hurling is top class.  Last year we had the best All-Ireland hurling championship in many years and the football championship is also great.  The world needs to see our games, especially our unfortunate emigrants who do not have an opportunity to see games.  That issue needs to be discussed further.  In recent years other competing sports have developed substantially because they went down that road.  We need to be able to compete on that level.</p><p> In regard to what should happen in the future, it is important that we do not close out games free to air indefinitely.  A balance needs to be struck.  In general, I welcome the deal.  However, I hope smaller counties will benefit more substantially from whatever finances are generated.</p></speech>

As Deputy Noel Harrington will be aware, there is a view on everything we do, whether at club level or anywhere else.  This will probably be known as the most divisive piece of work I have handled so far in my time as president, but actually it is not.  The process of change in society and the GAA is such that a minor change made in the Sc&oacute;r competition generated far more heat for me than this issue.  That is how life works.  Sometimes it is the small issue that creates the difficulty.  I have been subjected to no personal criticism, but much of the criticism will come from Cork.  We have a suite of decisions and this issue will be discussed up and down the country.  That is the way the organisation works.  Were we caught out by the reaction?  I think politicians should know how things are sometimes handled at the main terrestrial station and, yes, we did not expect it, but that issue has been dealt with it.  We expressed our view and will move on and hope to have a good working relationship with it.  The interesting thing about the demand from abroad is that we expect continued growth abroad.  It would have been inconceivable when the men from Cork started a hurling club in Riyadh almost 30 years ago that we would be in a position to have a county championship in the Middle East, with 40 teams taking part.  That is phenomenal growth and, of course, this will drive further growth.  A fortnight ago we welcomed a team from the townships of South Africa to various places around the country to play games.  On the way back home they won a section of the Dubai Gaelic games tournament.  We envisage, based on figures given and the drive to take Gaelic football to the townships, that within a short number of years up to 10,000 native South Africans could be playing Gaelic football.  They love the sport.  It is in tune with the way they move and they really enjoy it.  That is the consequence.  If the demand arises, we will handle it.  </p><p>  We have already made a decision that we will not control the growth of the GAA abroad from here.  We could not possibly do that.  We have established an international development committee and those who live outside Ireland will chart the growth of the GAA outside Ireland for us.  When the European county board started in 1999, there were four clubs and it was thought there would be a fifth.  There are now more than 70.  Within the past two years in Galicia in Spain four clubs started of their own volition; we had nothing to do with them.  They want to play Gaelic games.  It is interesting to note that the only place in the world where the GAA is officially part of the curriculum is Brittany in France because it saw its value.  We do not have it on the curriculum, which is unbelievable.  It is part of the curriculum in Brittany because it sees the value of our games.  We expect to see continued growth in that area.</p><p>  TG4 is doing really well.  It carries 62 games live there is deferred coverage of 22.  It carries the Electric Ireland minor finals, which are back as Gaeilge agus t&aacute; &aacute;thas an domhain orainn faoi sin.  T&aacute;imid an-bhu&iacute;och do TG4 as t&uacute;s &aacute;ite a thabhairt don teanga i gc&oacute;na&iacute;.  B&iacute;mid i gc&oacute;na&iacute; ag lorg slite chun comhoibri&uacute; leo chun an Ghaeilge a chur chun cinn.      </p><p>  In regard to fear about the money generated, I understand from where Deputy Helen McEntee is coming.  All of this stuff has been going through our minds.  This package has not rested lightly on us.  Mr. Duffy handled the consultation issue.  We consulted our management committee.  I also asked the three presidential candidates if they were okay with it.  I wanted to make sure we were not doing anything that would damage the organisation.  The two of us have more than 30 years experience in the GAA.  We love it more than anything else in our lives and would not be in the positions we are in if we did not and we would not do anything that would harm the organisation.  We took all factors into consideration.  This is probably the most difficult decision making process in which I have ever been involved.  I have worried about it every night since and will continue to worry.  Until I see it as a success, I will worry about it because our names are associated with it.  We did not do it lightly.  Sometimes in leadership roles one has to make the hard call.  We are in the positions and it fell to us to make the call.  As we will forever be associated with it, we hope we have made the right decision.  We are not so confident or arrogant to think we have definitely made the right one.  We do not know, but we hope it will be proved in the future that we made the brave call and that Gaelic games will continue to flourish, not only on this island but around the world.  I made the point that Brian Boru was the "Emperor of the Irish".  We look after the Irish at home and abroad.  Every Irish person matters to us and we want everyone who wants to be a part of the Gaelic games family - boy, girl, man, woman - wherever they live to enjoy the experience of watching teams to develop our games.</p></speech>

Deputies Pat Deering, Noel Harrington and Helen McEntee have strong associations with the GAA and all of them expressed a fear that it is important to understand.  In 2010 we said we would always keep our games on terrestrial channels.  We could not deal with things on this occasion in the way we did in 2010 because Ireland is different.  There are far more people abroad than ever before.  The Gaelic games family abroad is far bigger than ever before.  We could not ignore them, which is reason we chose to do it in the way we did.  The key issue is that we have to have a balance in protecting the interests of our domestic audience and meeting the needs of the Irish abroad.  I do not think anything that has been said today could seriously question the fact that we have looked after both groups.  There will 100 games shown live at home; 45 will be shown free to air in Australia; and there will be 20 big games carried on Sky Sports in Britain.  </p><p>  I will make one final point about Sky Sports because in many ways today has been about why we empowered Sky Sports.  Sky Sports' production values are the highest of any organisation in the world and I believe it will bring much to the presentation of our games, which is good for everybody.  Deputy Pat Deering made a point about bringing our games to the world.  Sky Sports will help us do this and its standards will reflect well on our association.</p></speech>

To sum up, both today's debate and the interest expressed in the lead-up to it demonstrated again the importance of the witnesses' organisation throughout every town and village in the country.  Deputy Colreavy observed that counties Sligo and Leitrim do not bother Croke Park too often.</p></speech>

I believe Aer Lingus's profits also rose that year, as there are only 25,000 people in County Leitrim.  Moreover, there was no need for Sky then, because everyone was present, no one had been left in County Leitrim and the door had been shut.</p></speech>

In the days immediately after the announcement, there was a considerable amount of quick or emotive reaction.  Today's proceedings gave the witnesses the chance to articulate the rationale behind the announcement.  It also gave members the opportunity to convey the concerns and I believe this also will inform the GAA in three years' time.  Consequently, this has been a useful exercise.  I also note the witnesses readily agreed to appear before the joint committee on receipt of the first communication therefrom, for which I thank them.  I wish them well in the season ahead, as well as all the counties, wherever members may be from.</p><p>  In the absence of other business, is it agreed to adjourn until 9.30 a.m. tomorrow, when representatives of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na will appear before the committee regarding prosecutions in respect of the Go Safe speed detection vehicles?  Agreed.  Tomorrow's meeting will be on a slightly different topic.</p></speech>
