O'Callaghan.  The Government has noted the intention of the Minister for Education and Skills to nominate a new chair to the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board.  The purpose of the board is to support the needs of the former residents of residential institutions, as endorsed in a unanimous motion of D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann in the aftermath of the publication in 2009 of the Ryan report.  The person nominated is Mr. David J. O'Callaghan, former Secretary General of the Department of Defence and current chair of the Irish Red Cross.  His appointment is subject to consideration by this committee.  This is set out in the policy brief prepared by the clerk and circulated to members.</p><p>  I welcome Mr. O'Callaghan.  Before he makes his presentation I wish to inform him by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If the witness is directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in respect of a particular matter and he continues to so do, he will be entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of his evidence.  Mr. O'Callaghan is directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and he is asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, he should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  The statement Mr. O'Callaghan submitted in advance will be published on the committee's website today.  Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I have been informed that laptops and iPads are interfering with the broadcasting equipment and I ask members to turn them off, if possible.</p></speech>

I welcome the opportunity to address it in my capacity as chairman designate of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund Board.  As I only recently became aware of this appointment, I am still coming to grips with its challenges and how best I can give leadership and direction in the position.</p><p>  In the context of my background and experience, I served in the Civil Service for 40 years.  I started in the Office of the Revenue Commissioners in 1964 and served there in various capacities until 1993.  My experience in that office was mainly in the areas of information technology operations, human resources management and industrial relations.  I transferred to the Department of Defence on promotion to the position of assistant secretary in 1993.</p> <p>I was promoted to Secretary General in the Department of Defence in 1995 and served in that capacity until my retirement in 2004.  As Secretary General, I gained substantial experience in all the competencies associated with senior management in a Government Department and especially in the areas of policy development and implementation, corporate governance, managing critical relations and organisation development.  </p><p> Since my retirement I have chaired several public boards, including the integrated ticketing project board from 2006 to 2011 and the education sector implementation group under the Croke Park agreement between 2010 and 2013.  I am currently chairman of the management board of the national directorate for fire and emergency management and I am chairman of the Irish Red Cross Society.</p><p> All in all, this experience has given me a keen appreciation of the importance of good corporate governance in the direction, control leadership and development of an organisation.  I appreciate the necessity of directing a board to be open, accountable and focused which, in the case of the Residential institutions Statutory Fund Board, is to provide an efficient and effective service to the former residents of institutions.  </p><p> I believe that a board should committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance and that a solid corporate governance framework enables efficient and effective decision making with clear responsibilities, leading to achieving the organisation's objectives.  Key areas of focus for the board should include developing strategy, monitoring financial performance and ensuring standards of conduct and accountability.</p><p> I regret that Sylda Langford, the outgoing chairperson, was obliged to resign due to planned surgery which would limit her availability to perform her functions.  From what I gather the board members and staff of the board, under her direction, have successfully laid the groundwork for the fund to open for the receipt of applications from the start of last month.  I gather it has received about 1,000 applications to date.</p><p> I will build on that work to ensure that the board members and the chief executive officer and her staff will work together to deliver on what is required under the 2012 Act in a considered, timely and effective manner.  As four of the nine board members will be people who were resident in institutions, the board and staff have available to them insight and advice which will be of valued assistance.  </p><p> Under the Act, the board has two key functions, one, to make arrangements for the provision of approved services to support the needs of former residents and, two, to pay a grant to former residents in order that they may avail of an approved service.  The board will be required to do its work in a manner that promotes the principles of equity, consistency and transparency.    The board must also promote an understanding of the effects of abuse on former residents among those involved in the provision of approved services and publicly available services to former residents as well as carrying out evaluations of the effectiveness of services.</p><p> I realise that I have a lot to learn about the operation of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund but, subject to ratification, I will fulfil my responsibilities as chairperson by working closely with the chief executive and staff, relying on the expertise, judgment and support of the other eight members of the board and the support and assistance of our sponsoring Department, the Department of Education and Skills.</p><p> I thank the members for their attention.  I look forward to the challenge presented to me by this appointment and I sincerely hope and trust that the former residents will truly benefit from the implementation of the Residential Institutions Statutory Fund.</p></speech>

I thank the previous chairperson, Ms Sylda Langford, for her work and effort and it is disappointing that she had to stand down at this time.  With Mr. O'Callaghan's qualifications and experience, he is well placed to make sure that the proper governance, oversight and management is brought to this role.  I have no doubt he will be successful in that role and  I wish him well.  He is eminently qualified for it.</p><p>  I have a few questions.  Will Mr. O'Callaghan elaborate on the overall size of the fund?  There is still an amount outstanding in respect of what was committed by the religious organisation and he might update us on that.  He indicated that the fund opened for applications a month ago and that approximately 1,000 have been submitted.  What number of application does he estimate will be received?  He might indicate the nature of the applications that have been submitted. </p></speech>

I pay my respects to and congratulate Ms Sylda Langford on the work she undertook and on which she succeeded in delivering.  It is a pity that health issues determined that she could not continue with the work and, hopefully, she will be of assistance to Mr. O'Callaghan, having regard to the experience that she gained over the years.  She has a wealth of information on which, hopefully, he will be able to draw.</p><p>  I meet some of the victims who have survived institutional abuse who are often in distress even to this day.  Some of them are living in local authority housing and some of them have mental health and physical health issues.  Part of the remit for the fund is to provide assistance in terms of housing.  If a person is living in the Dublin City Council area or other local authority areas, can the fund intervene and encourage the local authority to upgrade that person's premises in a speedier manner or can it fund the cost of an adaption if a council cannot do so?  During recent years the local authorities have struggled to deal with applications for adaptions, which are often required by the elderly survivors of institutional abuse.  That is one of the key areas where I have come across problems to date.  Obviously, there are educational issues for the victims or their families with which the fund can assist.  Mr. O'Callaghan might expand on the educational issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. David O'Callaghan" time="13:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014021200004#E01100"><p>That type of adaptation of local authority housing comes directly within the provisions of the Act.  We can assist with that type of difficulty.  My understanding is that we have liaison officers in the local authorities who are dedicated to liaising with our fund and through them we can deal with those problems.</p></speech>

That probably concludes this session.  Like everybody else, I wish Mr. O'Callaghan well in his new position.</p></speech>

With me is Ms Patricia Murphy, who works on the pensions policy side in the Department of Social Protection.  Also here is Mr. Niall Egan.  He works on the working age policy side.</p><p>  First, I will give some background to the State pension age changes.  My colleagues in the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation will provide further information on the employment aspects.  The State pension is a key social welfare payment and accounts for some 30% of social welfare expenditure.  It is the fundamental basis for the Irish pension system and it is a very valuable benefit.  A number of changes have been introduced to the State pension over the last number of years, which include the changes to State pension age.  From January 2014, State pension age has been standardised at 66, in 2021 it will increase to 67 years and in 2028 it will increase to 68 years of age.  There is a strong underlying policy basis to these changes.  They are underpinned by demographic changes and concerns regarding the sustainability of pensions.  The need for State pension age increases have been set out in a number of policy documents including the Green Paper in 2007 and the national pensions framework in March 2010 and most recently the OECD Review in April 2013.  The latter noted the significant challenge of funding additional pension spending as a result of population ageing.  The demographic changes show very positive trends.  More people are living to pension age and, when people reach pension age, they are living longer.  However, that does create concerns for the future sustainability of the pension schemes.  Specifically, the ratio of the working age population to pensioners will decrease from 5.3 at present to 2.3 by 2050.  The number of older people will increase from 12% of the population in 2012 to an estimated 23% in 2050.  In the mid-1990s, life expectancy for males was 73 and for females 78.5.  Today, for those aged 65, life expectancy is approximately 82 years for men and 85 for women.  That will rise to 84.1 and 87.4, respectively, in 2030.  These demographics clearly show that in order for our pension system to be financially sustainable into the future, it is critical that people are able to provide for themselves in retirement.</p><p>  I will focus on the change from 65 to 66 in January 2014.  The State pension age was standardised at age 66 with the abolition of State pension transition.  It is helpful to know the background to this scheme.  The existence of the State pension transition is historical and relates to the qualifying age for the contributory State pension which, up until the early 1970s, was set at 70 years of age.  The transition State pension which was then known as the retirement pension was introduced at that time to bridge the gap for employees who had to retire at 65.  The qualifying age for the contributory State pension was subsequently reduced over time to 66 years, which left the transition State pension effective for just one year.  The State pension transition scheme has been criticised over the years because in order to qualify for it an individual had to retire from the workplace.  That acted as a barrier to people continuing in employment.</p><p>  Also, in reality, the numbers availing of the transition State pension have been quite low.  The Department has analysed its award figures for the transition State pension scheme in 2011 and 2012 in order to assess the impact of its abolition.  The following is the position.  In 2011, a total of 12,052 people were awarded the transition State pension.  However, of the  12,052, only 12.3%  came from employment, while 48.5% transferred from a different social welfare payment and the remainder were primarily a combination of people already retired, paying credits or were self-employed.  In 2012, a total of 11,130 people were awarded the transition State pension and of these, 12.5% came from employment with 50.6% coming from another social welfare payment.  Further checks were undertaken and similar trends were identified for 2006 and 2007.</p><p>  That would indicate that a significant number of people have already left employment well in advance of pension age, many moving into other social welfare schemes.  What is clear is that people make up their own minds depending on their individual circumstances.  That is also evidenced by the fact that effective retirement age &ndash; the age at which people actually retire - in Ireland is 63.3 years.  It also reflects the fact that there is no statutory retirement age in Ireland.  Retirement age and pension age are two separate concepts.  The age at which an individual retires is a matter for agreement within each contract of employment and the employer and employee relationship.</p><p>  Having made the changes to the transition State pension I wish to focus on new arrangements for older jobseekers in terms of income supports and transitioning from work into retirement.  All the Department's short-term schemes are payable to age 66.  Individuals who exit the workforce prior to pension age may seek the support of either the jobseeker's benefit or the jobseeker's allowance schemes.  In order to qualify for either of these payments an individual must be genuinely seeking and available for full-time employment.  Both of those conditions will continue to apply to older jobseekers.  In 2013 administrative changes were introduced for older workers aged 62 years to support and add to the transition measures already in place.  Under existing legislation, where an individual has at least 156 paid social insurance contributions and is 65 years of age they will continue to receive jobseeker's benefit until their 66th birthday.  The provision extends the duration of jobseeker's benefit for recipients who are 65 years of age.</p><p>  Ordinarily, people in receipt of a jobseeker's payment must also engage with the Department's activation measures and can face sanctions if they fail to do so.  On foot of the changes now introduced, the requirement to engage with the Department's activation process has been eased for jobseekers aged 62 and over.  The individuals will no longer be required to engage with the Department's activation process and sanctions such as penalty rates will not be applied should they decide they do not wish to engage with the activation process.  However, this group will still be able to avail voluntarily of an array of supports, which are available from the Department if they wish to return to work, training or education.  In addition, special arrangements have been made so that the majority of older people in receipt of a jobseeker's payment will only have to sign on with their local office once a year and their payments will be paid directly into their bank accounts.</p><p>  Changes were introduced to occupational pensions in the Social Welfare and Pensions (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2013 as a precaution to ensure that links between State pension and occupational pension schemes can be properly administered.</p> <p>The legislation provides for a variety of situations to ensure pension scheme trustees can act appropriately in administering their scheme and will not be prevented by any conflict between the Pensions Act and scheme rules from making necessary arrangements to amend the scheme.  The legislation facilitates the cessation of a bridging pension which, depending on the wording of individual pension scheme rules, could otherwise be paid indefinitely and it can also determine the correct rate of occupational pension payable in the case of an integrated pension.  The legislation gives trustees discretionary amendment power to make whatever change is appropriate but ensures no scheme member will be worse off as a result of the change.</p><p> In the longer term the increases in State pension age which have also taken place in many other countries reflect the fact that the structures of our society are changing.  The State must prepare to ensure it will be able to continue to sustain pension payments in the future.  That means that people need to participate in the workforce for longer and contribute more towards their pension.  The OECD, in its recent review of the Irish pension system, supports longer working and more flexible retirement arrangements.  An interdepartmental group has been set up and is looking at the issue of working and retirement and a number of measures are under consideration.  I am also aware that some employers are responding to the changes made by, in some instances, increasing the retirement age to 66 years and, in other instances, awarding one year fixed term contracts.</p><p> I hope I have given members an overview of the pension age changes.  I look forward to hearing their views and would welcome any question they may wish to ask.</p></speech>

My Department welcomes the opportunity to have this discussion with it.  I am joined by Ms Deirdre Sweeney of the Equality Tribunal which recently transferred from the Department of Justice and Equality to my Department and by my colleagues, Mr. Dermot Sheridan and Ms  Siobh&aacute;n O'Connell, from the employment rights policy unit.  I am speaking on behalf of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation.</p><p>  As my colleague from the Department of Social Protection, Dr. Quinn, has pointed out, the increase in State pension age is linked with broader public policy issues and is taking place against a backdrop of fundamental shifts in the demographics of the population.  As a society, we are ageing which, ultimately, will lead to a shrinking ratio of working population to pensioners.  People are living longer.  Older people are healthier and more active and have valuable contributions to make to society, either from within the workforce or in other aspects of their lives.  Our colleagues have also referred to the issues around improving the long-term sustainability and adequacy of pension systems and the public finances.  All of these issues are interlinked and one of the key policy responses is to encourage longer working lives, a goal of which my Department is fully supportive.  Encouraging people to stay in the workforce beyond what society may view as a normal retirement age is as much about cultural change as it is about removing more tangible obstacles to working longer.  We need to challenge societal norms around retirement or retirement age and other cultural issues or societal attitudes to older people to promote the many positive aspects of their remaining in the workforce.  Addressing that issue is very much a societal challenge.</p><p>  In addressing the specific issue of the implications for employees of the increase in the State pension age, it is important to clarify for the committee the statutory position on retirement ages.  Apart from certain public sector employees where certain statutory retirement ages may apply, in our legislation there is no statutory retirement age for employees.  A contract of employment will generally contain a retirement age, although not always, but this is a matter of contract between the relevant parties.  Consequently, there is absolutely no prohibition on employers and employees setting down a retirement age beyond the normal retirement age or the age at which the State pension is payable.  An employer and an employee are free to agree to a retirement age of 60 years, 70 or any other number they choose.  In general, employment rights legislation which is administered by my Department does not contain an upper age limit.  The upper age limit for bringing claims under the Unfair Dismissals Acts 1977 to 2007 was removed by a provision in the Equality Act 2004.  It is now the case that a person of any age, if dismissed, may take a case under the Unfair Dismissals Acts, unless she or he has reached what is considered to be the normal retirement age for employees in similar employment, if there is one.  In such circumstances the burden of proof is on the employer to prove the normal retiring age.  Furthermore, the upper age limit of 66 years for receipt of statutory redundancy payments was removed by the Protection of Employment (Exceptional Collective Redundancies and Related Matters) Acts 2007.</p><p>  The key issue that arises around compulsory retirement at a given age is whether this entails discrimination on age grounds.  Therefore, the more usual avenue for redress for employees compulsorily retired is to take a claim under the Employment Equality Acts to the Equality Tribunal.  I must draw the committee's attention to the fact that policy responsibility for these Acts remains with the Minister for Justice and Equality.  However, the Equality Tribunal, the independent statutory body responsible for investigating and mediating on complaints made under the Acts, has recently been brought under the umbrella of the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation in the context of the creation of a streamlined workplace relations service.  Essentially, this will bring the Equality Tribunal, the rights commissioner service and, in the first instance, the activity of the Employment Appeals Tribunal together in a single adjudication mechanism in the same organisation with the Labour Relations Commission, LRC, and the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, to form the workplace relations commission, from which appeals will go to the Labour Court as heretofore.</p><p>  While section 34(4) of the Employment Equality Acts provides that it is not unlawful for an employer to fix a compulsory retirement age for employees, the Equality Tribunal has in recent decisions interpreted these Acts in the light of rulings of the European Court of Justice in cases concerning Framework Directive 2000/78/EC which prohibits discrimination in employment and occupation on various grounds, including age.  In these cases the European Court of Justice has found that terminating someone's employment on the basis of his or her chronological age is considered as direct discrimination under EU law.  However, the court has further found that this discrimination can be justified if it arises as the result of a legitimate aim in a state's social or employment policy.  If an employer chooses to defend the mandatory retirement age before the tribunal, he or she faces the challenge of objectively justifying that retirement age.  In a number of cases heard by the Equality Tribunal employees have successfully challenged the retirement age set by their employers.</p><p>  In terms of scale of the impact of the changed State pension age, it is worth recalling the figures quoted by my colleague.  Of the 11,000 individuals awarded the State pension - transition in 2012, only 1,390 came from persons who were in employment, the remainder being already retired, on another social protection payment scheme or self-employed.  In the broader scheme of things, that is a significantly reduced figure of employees who will be impacted on by the increase in the State pension age this year.</p><p>  With regard to how employers are responding to the change in the State pension age and its implications for them and their employees, it is too early to form a definitive picture.  However, it is our understanding from our discussions with IBEC and employer representatives that while many employers are defending their right to set a normal retirement age within their enterprise which would normally still be 65 years, a significant proportion of employers are trying to facilitate employees who wish to continue working beyond their 65th birthday.  Some employers have already changed the retirement age for their employees, while others have indicated that they intend to change it for all employees.  As mentioned, others have awarded one year fixed term contracts to see people through the additional age.  That is not surprising because to refer to a UK study, when the United Kingdom had a default retirement age, an employer had to remind an employee one year in advance of the retirement age.  The employee had to apply formally and receive a written response from the employer on whether he or she was allowed to stay in the job.  The study found that, apart from a few very exceptional cases, employees were committed to staying on.  We hope that is the picture emerging here.</p><p>  My Department will continue to work closely with the other relevant Departments on these issues through the interdepartmental committee on working and retirement, chaired by our colleagues in the Department of Social Protection.  As Dr. Quinn advised, that group is considering a range of measures to address the need for longer working in the context of demographic change.  My Department will also keep lines of communication open with both employer and employee representative organisations to ensure we have an understanding of what is actually happening on this issue since it was crystallised in practice from 1 January this year.</p><p>  I hope that gives the committee a broad sense of the employment aspects involved.  I look forward to hearing members' views and responding to questions, as needed.</p></speech>

There was no political debate, no public consultation and no cost-benefit analysis of the measure.  There was no consideration given to the significant labour market issues involved.  Neither was there thought given to issues of fair play, equity or minimising the hardship on those worst affected.</p><p>  Citizens are being deprived of a benefit they earned and paid for.  No information was given to the workers who are to lose &euro;12,000, &euro;24,000 or &euro;36,000, in today's money and depending on their age.  Almost 15% of salary was paid on behalf of these workers in pay related social insurance, PRSI, including the employer and employee contributions, throughout their working lives.  Many of these workers also worked and paid taxes through all that time.  They are now victims of a decision made by people who will suffer no loss but rather will continue to enjoy good pensions, at age 65 and younger.  There is no equity or justice in this decision and it will be damaging to social cohesion in Ireland.</p><p>  Apologists for this measure suggest that as people are living longer, it is desirable that they should work longer.  Congress holds that people should be free to work longer if they wish but should not be obliged to work longer in order to avoid poverty.  No provision has been made to facilitate workers remaining in employment after age 65.  Congress asked the Department of Social Protection, which sponsored the legislation, if it would continue to terminate its employees at age 65 regardless of whether they qualify for a State pension, and we never got an answer to that question.  Neither officials from the Department of Social Protection nor from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation have given any signal to private sector employers whether to retain or dump their employees at 65 regardless of pension entitlement.  This measure is not designed to help older workers to stay in employment.  It is to deny them an entitlement.</p><p>  Employers and unions were given no opportunity to consider the other complex labour market issues involved.  IBEC was concerned that the lack of clarity concerning the legality or otherwise of sacking a person at 65 could lead to litigation.  Congress was more concerned that a worker terminated with no State pension entitlement might picket his or her employer.  Other labour market issue that were ignored included the effects on morale and productivity of workers either being retained in, or forced out of, employment against their will; the labour market rigidities involved in conferring rights on older workers to keep their jobs; whether a worker in the construction and related sectors can work safely at heights and in inclement conditions up to the age of 68; and the effect on youth unemployment and worker morale of older workers holding down positions which otherwise might provide opportunities for advancement.</p><p>  Pension planning is a long-term discipline.  It has been a long-standing public policy that citizens should plan their pension provision over the long term.  These measures make nonsense of the advice of the Pensions Board on financial planning for retirement.  Up until now, most occupational schemes were integrated with the social welfare system.  One knew what one would get, one knew what one had to contribute and one knew what one's employer had to contribute to give one replacement income at age 65.  In the case of some workers, this decision wipes away three years of that legitimate expectation and makes nonsense of the ability of anybody to plan for retirement.  Making major pension changes in such an <i>ad hoc</i> way is not only a cruel injustice to individual workers but a denial of the right of legitimate expectation.  Long-term damage done will be done to pensions in general.  Why would anyone agree to pay into a pension scheme, either public or private, if the rules can be changed at the eleventh hour to withdraw an entitlement already earned and paid for?</p><p>  Congress accepts that the pension age will rise throughout Europe.  However, Ireland is going further and faster in this regard than any other country in the EU.  We believe that pension reform must be long-term and hurrying these measures without proper consideration or debate is wrong in principle and potentially disastrous in practice.  These changes will not save the State much in the short to medium term but will impose severe financial hardship on individuals in the first three years in what should be best the best years of their retirement.</p><p>  We asked the Government and its predecessor to postpone these changes and to increase the pension age in a fairer and more gradual way.  Congress suggested that someone who reaches 65 this year could lose one month's pension entitlement, someone who reaches 65 next year could lose two months, etc.  We could have reached the same end game but spread the pain much more fairly across the workforce.  The lack of public debate on this issue has meant that so far, nobody has attempted to explain to the Irish public why we must have the highest pension age in Europe.</p><p>  I want to say something about the principles of pension reform.  Pension reform should be based on the following principles.  Pension reform should be long term.  It should not be hurried.  It should do as little violence as possible to the right of legitimate expectation.  Pension reform should, as much as possible, protect accrued benefits already earned and paid for.  It should involve consultation with stakeholders so that related matters such as labour market policy issues can be considered in advance.  Pension reform should be based on the principle of equity.  Losses and hardship should not be imposed on certain categories of worker while elites remain immune.  Pension reform should give workers and their employer sufficient time to adjust their expectations and financial plans.</p><p>  The troika did not impose this measure.  Long before the advent of the troika, successive reports, published by the well-pensioned elites, rehearsed spurious demographic and other arguments to attack the modest public pension provision of private sector workers.  No doubt the troika demanded the raising of the pension age, but congress does not believe they it would have been so prescriptive.</p><p>  This is a Government decision.  The decision to change the eligibility criteria to take &euro;1,500 per annum from the pensions of those, mainly women workers, who spent some time out of the workforce was not the troika's either.  That was a very Irish decision.  There is something incongruous about politicians and public officials making decisions which hurt other citizens but in no way impact on their own comfortable arrangements.</p><p>  A 59 year old private sector worker, who started work at 16 and who has had 15% of his or her income paid in PRSI since then, will lose circa &euro;24,000, in other words, two years' pension.  Such a person will now get his or her pension at age 67 after 51 years in work, assuming his or her employer does not sack him or her at 65 which the employer is entitled to do.  In today's terms, using the average industrial wage as a benchmark, circa &euro;362,000 in PRSI contributions would have been paid on the worker's behalf.</p><p>  As I gave the committee this paper in advance and the next statement is not quite true, I want to withdraw it.  I stated that any politician who went along with this measure, who is aged 59, will not be asked to wait till age 67 and then settle for a pension of &euro;12,000 per annum but that is not quite true.  For any veteran politicians here who were elected in the election before last, it is certainly true.</p><p>  Congress challenged this measure to no avail last years.  We have no expectation that the cosseted elite who brought this about will do anything to mitigate the injustice.  This question will only be revisited when private sector workers who have been attacked by this measure wake up and realise what has been done to them.</p><p>  When the committee was told earlier that those at 65 are already on some sort of pension entitlement since age 63, the question is not whether they are on an entitlement or not.  The question is whether it is a means-tested entitlement.  That is the crucial issue.  It makes the injustice worse to say that only a small number of people will bear the brunt of this.</p></speech>

It is evident from the last speaker how much anger there is about changes that have been made.  I suppose when any change is being made to people's long-standing entitlements, there needs to be a sense of fairness and respect for legitimate expectation.  I guess the difficulty in this area is that there is a dramatic change in the number of those who are working and those who are drawing down benefits.  As was said earlier, it has moved from a position where there were six working for every one person drawing down the pension and, by 2050, there will be two for every person drawing down the pension.  I suppose we all have to be clear around this table on putting in place the right strategies for the future.</p> <p> I understand that those who will now not qualify for the transitional State pension or State pension as early as expected can avail of a jobseeker's payment.  Dr. Quinn pointed out in her presentation the arrangements that apply.  The individuals will not be subject to the same activation measures as others.  However, what arrangement will apply to somebody who is not required to retire at 65 but who has an option to do so under his or her contract?  One might retire voluntarily at 65 having always believed one would do so.  Is a person in such circumstances automatically able to transfer to a jobseeker's payment?  Will he be affected by the usual rules applying to jobseekers, which stipulate one is not paid for the first few weeks?  Will one be able to proceed to the jobseeker's payment only if one is required to retire at the age in question?  I am not sure.  I was asked a question about this last week and would like to have the matter clarified.</p><p> It would be remiss of me in the week that is in it and given the announcement of the Aer Lingus strike yesterday not to raise the issues associated with the entitlements of staff who have paid into pension schemes in the expectation that they would be able to draw down benefits at the relevant time and that their employer would continue to honour the contractual rights.  One of the most significant issues that was missed and which we have been discussing today concerns the changes that have been made in the pensions legislation that was before the Oireachtas before Christmas.  We raised at the time the fact that the Bill was silent on circumstances where there is not a double insolvency.  The legislation was very clear about what happens when there is a double insolvency - when both the scheme and employer are insolvent &ndash; but was silent on circumstances where a scheme is insolvent and the employer is still making a profit.  Many schemes are insolvent at present given what has happened in the financial markets in recent years.  The OECD is very clear on this and has made a recommendation that there should be a minimum amount of funding, in the order of 90%, in place before a scheme can be closed where a company is still in a healthy financial position, yet that was not provided for in the legislation.  We are seeing the result of this in the Aer Lingus context.  Staff are fighting and there is considerable angst over whether an employer who is financially viable would be able to walk away from a scheme and leave employees without entitlements that they paid for and always expected to be in place.  The Bill did not address that.  Are there measures afoot to deal with these kinds of circumstances and to ensure we are living up to the OECD's recommendation in that respect?</p><p> A key aspect of pension planning was to involve the putting in place of an auto-enrolment scheme for all workers so they would all be enrolled automatically in a scheme from the earliest age possible and thereafter make contributions along with the employer and State, depending on their earnings.  The employee might make a small contribution initially but at least he or she would begin saving at the earliest possible age.  Unfortunately, what happens is that most of us do not think about pensions until we are in our 40s, at which time we must invest a huge amount of income to try to build up a private pension.</p><p> When the arrangement was announced by the last Government, in 2010, the intention was that it would be put in place in 2014.  With the economic crisis, the decision was wisely postponed so as not to place an additional burden on employees and employers.  What is the current position?  Has a timescale been set?  The Minister for Social Protection indicated last year that it is still the Government's intention to have such a scheme but she did not give a timescale.  What is the current thinking?

When we discussed that legislation, it was guillotined, like so many other Bills.  These Bills were rushed jobs and we did not get to discuss fully the implications of the proposed changes.  There was some minor discussion.  I raised concerns on Second Stage of the social welfare and pensions legislation and submitted amendments.  However, the way the business was done in the House meant we did not discuss the implications that Mr. Fergus Whelan rightly pointed out would affect those on low pay and often those working on sites, for example.  There are not many working on sites now.  Such people are the ones who opted to retire at 65 and are now being asked to continue working until 68.  People who have made arrangements for their pensions now suffer the consequences of going on a reduced payment for six months because the jobseeker's benefit and allowance are being rowed back.  Previously, the individuals would have managed to get the State transitional pension.</p><p>  Can Dr. Quinn answer the question that Mr. Fergus Whelan was putting?  Were the consequences of these changes examined?  Is Europe out of touch with Ireland, or are we out of touch with the changes and the speed with which we have introduced changes supposedly because of an increase in the life expectancy of the retired?  The logic given to us at the time for the measures introduced was that the social insurance fund would be depleted in the future and that, because people are living longer into old age, there should be a change to the retirement age.  Was no alternative considered, such as getting rid of the tax relief on private pensions or increasing the PRSI payments made by employees or employers to levels similar to those that obtain in Europe?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.48" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1032" speakername="Joan Collins" time="13:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014021200008#J00300"><p>I thank the speakers for their contributions and explanations.  I would certainly err on the side of adopting the views Mr. Whelan is expressing.  That is the way I felt about the whole process as it was going through.  What is the position on workers losing &euro;12,000, &euro;24,000 or &euro;36,000?  Is it the case?  Could Dr. Quinn clarify the matter?</p><p>  What was the impact on the pensions of women and carers?  Is the Department examining the arrangement whereby one must have continuous contributions over 20 years?  This has affected and will affect women.  How many women are affected and what were the implications?</p><p>  A point was made on someone who is 62 and in receipt of a jobseeker's payment.  A 65 year old man came into my office some days ago as he had been told he had to go on a T&uacute;s course.  He was a little shocked as he was just waiting for material to come through on his pension.  These kinds of stipulations are not necessary and there is no point to them.  I do not agree with having to have an elderly man in such circumstances do a T&uacute;s course or take up a JobBridge placement.  The man felt under pressure to do the course because he was afraid his jobseeker's benefit or allowance would be cut.</p><p>  An important point that Mr. Fergus Whelan made was that a person who wants to work for longer should do so by choice and not be forced to do so.  He should not be forced out of a job either way.  An argument is made that the average age will increase and that we must divvy out the money with this in mind.  We should be protecting our pensions as much as possible.  A point was made that in the 1970s the State pension age was reduced from 70 to 65.  Is that because all the people were dying younger?  I do not know.</p> <p>In any event I do not think that is a viable argument.  We should have a society that protects our pensions and pensioners in the future.  We have to examine that aspect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.50" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1132" speakername="Marie Moloney" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014021200009#K00200"><p>My questions are similar to those of Deputy Collins.  I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  When I heard about the changes, I approached the Minister about the jobseeker's benefit for someone who was on a transition pension, so that it would be extended for 12 months.  In fairness, she agreed to it, so I welcome that move.  However, as we progress onwards what will happen to a person who reaches the age of 67?  What will happen in the year in between?  Will such people be obliged to apply for the jobseeker's allowance?  If they have received a lump sum from the company they worked for, that will obviously affect them adversely.  Will they be using up their lump sum for a year?</p><p>  Mr. Whelan referred to women and I will make a bigger issue of that matter.  I have tabled an Adjournment matter in the Seanad next week on this issue, concerning the years 1968 to 1994.  A woman applying for a pension today would have been about 20 in 1968.  She would have given up her job to rear her children.  In 1994, homemaker's credits were introduced so today's women will all be looked after to that extent.  They will be able to claim credits for the time they rear their children.  However, from 1968 to 1994 there were no homemaker's credits.  Women were also affected by the marriage bar and had to give up working.  We are talking about a small cohort of women.  They are women who went to work before their children were born, were laid off, and then resumed work afterwards.  Some of them may now be on a widow's pension, while others may not have gone back to work once their children were reared.  There were various reasons why some of them may not even have entered employment until after their children were reared, so they will not be affected.</p><p>  The cohort of women to which I refer are applying for pensions, so they are affected due to the fact that they left work to rear their children.  If homemaker's credits can be given to women from 1994, why not from 1968?  It would be easy to identify those women because they have been paid the children's allowance.  I am pressing this matter strongly with the Minister and I will not give up on it easily.  </p><p>  It was said that people have an option to continue working after 65 if they want to, and the European Court ruling was mentioned, but that is not happening on the ground.  I know for a fact that women who were home helps were forced retire at 65 and had no choice.  They were told to go and that was it.  It is not as straightforward as saying that one can challenge it.  How long does it take to go through the Labour Court?  A person may have left work for a year before that court will hear a case and reinstate them.  </p><p>  I have a lot more to say but it is not fair to take all the time.  I would appreciate hearing the witnesses' responses to those questions.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.52" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Orlaigh Quinn" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EDJ2014021200009#K00400"><p>I thank the members for their questions and will try to answer all of them.  I will ask my colleagues to join in as well.  Senator Power referred to the sense of fairness and the anger involved.  Comments were also made about a lack of consultation.  In 2007, we started looking at pension reform in the Green Paper.  Since then there has been an enormous amount of consultation.  I personally met over 500 people when we did consultation tours around the country.  Some 340 groups gave us papers and presentations, and the retirement age was a significant part of that process.  We have had a large number of consultations since then.  I find it hard to accept therefore that we have not had a public debate on this issue.  It has been taking place.</p><p>  I accept that the changes came in very quickly, which is not desirable in terms of pensions.  It is good to give a long lead-in for any pension changes.  However, given the economic recession we faced and the need to achieve savings, a huge number of different areas were examined, and this was just one of them.</p><p>  The issue of demographic factors and their future effect was also raised, but this is happening right now.  Between 2008 and today we have had more than 100,000 additional pensioners on the social welfare books.  Our costs have increased from &euro;5.5 billion to &euro;6.5 billion.  It is not something that is going to happen in 2030 or 2050 - we are dealing with such growth every single year.</p><p>  Senator Power asked a question about people who voluntarily choose to retire at 65.  They will come under the same rules and conditions that apply to all our schemes.  If one voluntarily leaves work there is a nine week period during which one would not qualify for a social welfare payment.  If a person has to leave work as part of their contract, they immediately benefit.  In the main, they would go on to a jobseeker's benefit, so the question of their assets would not arise because they would have sufficient stamps to qualify for that.</p></speech>

I will go through the questions as they were raised.  A question was raised about the entitlements of Aer Lingus staff and defined benefit changes.  I do not want to comment on a particular scheme when discussions are ongoing.  However, the pension changes we made towards the end of the year did not just focus on double insolvencies, they also gave options to trustees to restructure schemes.  There are elements, therefore, that facilitate such restructuring.  I do not particularly want to comment on any one scheme.</p><p>  A specific question was asked about debt on employer legislation and members of this committee will be familiar with the debate that took place when that legislation was going through.  The Minister clearly went through all the reasons why the decision was made not to go down that road, both in terms of unintended consequences and the competitive advantage it might give to some employers over others.  There were a series of reasons why debt on employer legislation was not proceeded with, including focusing on schemes which at that time were already in debt.  Many of those arguments were discussed in the Oireachtas at that time.</p><p>  Senator Power also asked about future plans for auto-enrolment.  We have had the OECD report which is being examined by the Cabinet sub-committee on pensions.  There has not yet been a decision on a timescale, but the Minister has said she will make announcements on this matter fairly shortly.  We are expecting that to happen.</p><p>  Deputy &Oacute; Snodaigh asked about implications for the low paid and we will focus on all the available social welfare schemes.  That also applies to some of the questions concerning women, but I can come back to that matter.</p><p>  We did look at all the alternatives concerning pension sustainability, which are on the table.  They include tax reliefs and other alternatives.  The process of pension reform is ongoing.  Many of the discussions involve political decisions and I cannot comment on them.  However, I can say that they are all being examined in great detail.  </p><p>  The Social Insurance Fund is under water at the moment and all our projections are lined up.  At the moment, I think it is &euro;1.3 billion and our projections would suggest &euro;3 billion in terms of the future impact of that funding.  We are providing an additional &euro;190 million in the social welfare budget, without making any changes, just to cater for the additional numbers coming into the State pension every year.</p><p>  Deputy Joan Collins asked about the impact on women and carers.  Women and carers do get credits so it should not impact on their records.  Senator Moloney commented on that in terms of averaging what it would cost and she asked why we would not bring it back prior to 1994.  Approximately 46,000 people do not have a pension, so there is a major cost involved in bringing that back.</p> <p>I do not have the figure in front of me.  I think it was of the order of &euro;300 million, but I can confirm this for the Senator.  It was hugely significant.</p></speech>

Obviously, some of the changes are happening now, while others will happen in the future.  There is an interdepartmental group in place and we are looking at a range of options.  Somebody mentioned people working and how the age used to be 70 years.  There has been a huge growth in the number of older people working.  Between 1998 and 2013, the number of people aged between 60 and 64 years who were working increased from 35% to 45%.  All of our research suggests this has an impact on the younger population because countries which have very high youth employment rates also have very high numbers of older workers.  I do not think one can say that just because one has older workers, one will knock out younger workers.  In a recession one can see some of this, but we are really trying to focus on the future, pension sustainability and how we manage to keep older workers in work.  I must also mention that all of our research suggests there are huge health and social impacts if people work for longer.  Data from the longitudinal study - the TILDA research - very much support this finding in terms of the impact on people's mental and physical well-being.</p></speech>

There is nothing in the changes to facilitate older people working.  It is not a question of giving a pension to women who do not have one.  What has happened is that working women who took some time out of the workforce and expected to receive a pension of &euro;12,000 per year have had &euro;1,500 deducted from it as of last September.  It is not a question of giving people more.  It is taking money from people who had a legitimate expectation of receiving it.</p></speech>

In respect of defined benefit and defined contribution schemes, the Department, the Labour Court, the Labour Relations Commission on the industrial relations side and others are engaged in that dispute.  Therefore, we will not go into the detail of it, but it is an extremely complex issue of which everybody is aware and which is being worked on in ensuring there is a positive outcome.</p><p>  Deputy Joan Collins spoke about people not being forced out of a job and mentioned that it should be voluntary.  It raises the issue of whether one can legislate and simply deal with this problem by requiring employers to keep everybody in place until they are 66 years, 67 or 68.  It might seem to be a straightforward option, but it turns out to be very complicated for a number of reasons, one of which is that the Court of Justice of the European Union has accepted that it is legitimate for an employer to have a mandatory retirement age if there is justification for it.  It must have regard to public policy aims.  The United Kingdom had something approaching it where it had a default retirement age which it only introduced in 2006 and removed in 2011.  If one was to try to do this, some of the arguments would concern the expectations of other employees in terms of their length of service, the structure that was in place and when they might expect advancement or promotion which would constitute a legitimate reason for an employer to have a retirement age in order that those coming behind would be motivated to stay with the company, particularly if they had received a huge level of training and the company had invested a huge amount of money in them.  Obviously, it is very important to say companies are changing and the responses we are receiving in discussions with IBEC suggest many employers are adding one year, changing their retirement age to adjust or offering a one year fixed contract.  </p><p>  The other issue that arises for companies is that it is not black and white where a company move to defend its retirement age.  If one looks at the terminology used in the legislation, one might think it is almost plain sailing for an employer and that he or she can set a mandatory retirement age, but it must be objectively justified.  When cases have come before the Equality Tribunal, it has interpreted in accordance with the most recent CJEU case law which states it is not automatic.  The test is a hard one.  The bar is high and it quite difficult for employers to objectively justify having a mandatory retirement age.  Quite a number of cases have occurred in which it has found in favour of employees rather than employers.  As cases go through, employers are learning what is and is not permissible.  Senator Marie Moloney has made the legitimate point that it can take a very long time, which is true.  It can take a long time before cases are heard, which is probably why we are trying to set up the new workplace relations commission, the principal aim of which is to deal with cases much more quickly in order that if people have issues, they can have their cases heard much more quickly.  The aim is to have cases heard within three months.</p> <p>Even the issues considered legitimate at EU level such as allowing an employer to promote access to employment for young people by setting a retirement age or workforce planning-----</p></speech>

Certain countries impose mandatory retirement ages.  Another reason is to ensure a mix of generations among staff in a company.  It has also been pointed out that in the absence of a mandatory retirement age the only way an employer would be able to retire more elderly employees was to challenge their competence through a performance management system.  The question arises of whether people want to work until they reach 70 or 75 years only to be told they no longer have the capacity to do their job.  Issues arise in regard to the dignity of workers if that is the way they are treated.</p></speech>

It is too early for us to form a judgment in terms of how it will pan out in Ireland, but it is not a simple matter to legislate away for employers the objective criteria that could apply.  It could be on health and safety or other grounds that it is appropriate for them to have a mandatory retirement age that is under 65 or 64 years.  It is hard to legislate this away because of all the other criteria which even the European court is finding are legitimate.</p></speech>

In the private sector, when people reach their 65th birthday, under most contracts of employment, as they stand, the employer is free to run them out the door.  I acknowledge the European dimension, but that is the practice.  However, in certain grades in the public service there are public servants who are not established and do not have long service.  The practice in some organisations is that they are regarded as having reached 65 years on the last day before they turn 66.  They can, therefore, be employed for a year longer than their private sector equivalents, which is good.</p></speech>

The further retirement age is extended, the less opportunity there is at the other end.  That is one of the contradictions.  We are trying to encourage people to leave the unemployment queues, especially young people, but, at the same time, their working life is being extended.  The later retirement age is, the more the State benefits from PRSI payments and its liabilities are lowered.  In the past those whose contracts terminated on their 65th birthday may have been entitled to a contributory or non-contributory pension, but nowadays they are in receipt of a much reduced payment and that has not fully emerged.  The State contributory pension is &euro;42 more per week than jobseeker's benefit.  The household benefits package also needs to be taken into account in calculations, but everybody does not qualify for it because it is means-tested.</p><p>  These changes have happened quickly and people who reached 60 years in recent years would have had an expectation regarding the amount they would have to survive on at thee age of 65, 66 or 68 years.  Those who were better paid had the opportunity and were encouraged through tax relief to set aside money for a private or occupational pension.  They had something to fall back on, but the lowest paid are dependent on their PRSI payments and will struggle most with the effects of this change.  That was argued at the time in 2011, but it is only now that the consequences are hitting.  Are my figures correct?  Are those whose contracts terminate at the age of 65 years in receipt of substantially lower payments than previously?</p></speech>

The people who have no occupational pension will be hit hard, but there is a slight chance they will pass a means test.  The general workers in the private sector who worked and tried to put aside money for their pensions which have been decimated will be badly hit by this change because they paid their PRSI contributions in the expectation that their pension would be paid.  They will not receive this pension and the means-tested benefit.  They will, therefore, have no social welfare cover for those three years.</p></speech>

Therefore, as the State pension age moves up, the age of retirement will move up.  Depending on the time at which they entered, some public servants have no age of retirement and could work indefinitely, while it is set at 70 years for others.  It depends on the time at which they entered and the arrangements they have in place.  When they leave, if there is a gap before their pension is paid, the employer has discretion to pay a bridging pension.  Many employees retire at 60 years and receive their pension, but they are required to sign on for these years.  It is not just an issue for those aged 65 and 66 years.  This has been happening for many years as people retired as part of their contractual arrangements at 60 years, but the employer made up the difference in their pension.  A significant number of public sector workers leave early owing to their contractual arrangements, but again, typically, they sign on for jobseeker's allowance and the employer - in this case the public sector - makes up the difference.</p><p>  Deputy Aengus &Oacute; Snodaigh referred to youth employment.  There is no relationship between young and older workers.  They are not transferable from one to the other and all of our OECD research suggests this.  We are moving to a situation where we will have fewer than two people per pensioner working and our older population will be needed in the workforce because the position will not be sustainable.  Currently, there are 5.3 workers to every pensioner and the number is heading towards 2.3.  All of the work we are trying to do is aimed at trying to prepare for this change and support older workers.  I fully accept that, depending on a person's occupation, he or she may not be able to work.  However, that is where we need to make arrangements and specify between different age cohorts.  The age of retirement used to be 70 years in Ireland when the type of employment was manual and much more physically demanding.</p><p>  The Deputy's figures are correct regarding the jobseeker's payment of &euro;188 per week and a pension of &euro;230 per week.  That is where some of the savings were achieved with this measure because if people who are now claiming until 66 years remain in work, they pay additional tax and PRSI contributions and, from an employer perspective, they may also help its private pension fund because they are not claiming and are also helping the sustainability of the fund.  That is where the difference is and the savings were made because of the gap between the two payments.</p></speech>

Will Dr. Quinn indicate whether the dependant adult allowance will move in line with it also?  Mr. Whelan said one could work up to the day before one's 66th birthday.  However, I understand that when one is calculating for a social welfare pension - a State pension - it relates to the last full tax year before one's 66th birthday.  One could have worked up to September or October and one could be 66 years of age but that is of no value to one from January to September or October because it is the last full tax year before one's birthday which is taken into consideration.  One will have paid almost one year's stamps which are of no value.  Could we not move the goalposts there and at least take the contributions up to a person's 66th birthday?</p></speech>

It is difficult to have this discussion without looking at the broader pensions reforms, but one of the areas at which we are looking is total contributions.  That is where one would count what a person has paid rather than looking at an average or the way a scheme is worked.  It is something on which we are working and at which the Minister has looked.  Pretty much like a private sector pension scheme, for every year one pays into the social welfare system, one would get a payment with suitable time periods for credits for women who have caring roles.  It would address some of those issues the Senator raised earlier about homemakers.</p></speech>

Again, it is very much on the basis of giving notice in terms of pension changes because some people may lose due to this particular approach while others may gain.  We were trying to give notice.  Whether to bring it forward is still under consideration.</p></speech>

There is a consequence in terms of employment and unemployment, depending on the figures.  That might have been one of the reasons the retirement age was changed from 70 to 65 years - that is, to try to create employment at the other end.  Obviously, it does not create employment in the case of public sector because of the public sector embargo, but in the private sector, companies will look to see if their employees have entitlements when they reach their retirement age and will extend working contracts for people if they are not entitled to a pension at 66.</p></speech>

There was certainly discussion, but at no point were we able to get any clear answers in that process in regard to the labour market issues we talked about and many of the issues we talked about today.  Quite frankly, I believe private sector workers have been done over very badly in this.  The only way to bring a bit of justice back to the situation is to push it out and to do it in a more gradual way.  To put it at its most crude, if one twin was born before midnight and the other twin after midnight, one gets a full year's entitlement while the other loses a full year's entitlement.  That is a very crude way to do it.  Everywhere else in Europe is doing it much more gradually.  I suggested a way in my submission.  That was put to the Department and was, in the usual fashion, pushed aside as being of no relevance.  No country is going as far and as fast as we are.  We should slow this down and should not go to 68 years.  We should go to 67 and should do so in a much more gradual fashion so that the load is spread more evenly and does not just fall on a small number of workers because of their age.</p></speech>

It is extraordinarily difficult to set that in any of our social welfare schemes.  In terms of how we compare with other member states, other member states have similar issues but due to their demographics they have had much longer to prepare.  Effectively, Ireland lost a generation in the 1950s, so our profile is very different from other member states and, as a result, the impact on our public finances will hit much faster than in other member states.</p></speech>

This significant level of investment will address critical infrastructure deficits, aid economic growth and job creation and provide much-needed social infrastructure.  The Exchequer capital plan has, by necessity, been reduced in recent years to contribute to fiscal consolidation.  However, it is important to note that since the publication of the 2012-16 capital framework no further cuts have been made to the capital programme.  The overall capital budget for 2014 is &euro;3.3 billion and is focused on the sectors prioritised in the 2011 capital review, namely, health, education and jobs.</p><p>  Through the use of proceeds from the sale of State assets and the recovering public private partnership market, the Government is progressing additional projects which were not included in the original five year framework.  The Exchequer capital programme will be augmented by a &euro;2.25 billion infrastructure stimulus package announced b the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howling in July 2012.  While the main emphasis of the package will be on a &euro;1.5 billion public private partnership programme, &euro;850 million from the proceeds of the sale of State assets and the national lottery licence will also be invested through the Exchequer in other growth enhancing projects.</p><p>  In June 2013, as a follow-on from the 2012 package, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Howlin announced an additional Exchequer investment of &euro;150 million to fund school development projects, local and regional road maintenance and retrofitting of local authority homes.  In budget 2014, the Minister announced that &euro;200 million from the proceeds of the national lottery licence transaction will be used for capital projects and programmes in 2014.</p><p>  The Department of Public Expenditure and Reform will undertake a review of the public capital programme in 2014 which will culminate in the setting of the Government's capital investment framework for the period ahead.  This will be done in parallel with the comprehensive review of current expenditure.  Alongside setting a new capital investment framework, the review will also examine the scope for the utilisation of other non traditional funding sources to augment investment in employment intensive projects that can help promote economic growth.</p><p>  The ministerial order before the committee is a technical instrument.  Its purpose is to allow the D&aacute;il to approve formally the expenditure by Departments and agencies in the current financial year of capital moneys carried over from the previous year.  The capital carryover facility forms an integral part of the five-year rolling multi-annual capital envelopes introduced in 2004.  The multi-annual system is designed to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of the management by Departments and agencies of capital programmes and projects.  It recognises the difficulties inherent in the planning and profiling of capital expenditure and acknowledges that for a myriad of reasons, capital projects may be subject to delays  The carryover facility allows for a portion of unspent moneys which would have been lost to the capital programmes and projects concerned, under the annual system of allocating capital, to be made available for spending on programme priorities in the subsequent year.</p><p>  The introduction of the multi-annual capital investment system has been a major positive factor in the roll-out of the capital programme.  It will ensure that resources that would otherwise have been surrendered to the Exchequer are now available for spending by Departments in the following year.  The multi-annual capital system has given greater medium term financial security to Department and implementing agencies.  This in turn has facilitated better medium term planning of programmes and projects.  It has also helped to eliminate the potential for wasteful spending on non-essential works in order to ensure that the full capital allocations were spent before the end of the calendar year.</p><p>  The Exchequer and Audit Departments Act 1866 generally requires the surrender of unspent Exchequer moneys to the Central Fund at the end of each financial year.  Section 91 of the Finance Act 2004 gives legal effect to capital carryover and allows the carryover of unspent voted Exchequer capital to the following year of up to 10% of the capital by Vote, by deferring the surrender requirement, subject to certain conditions.  Among those conditions are that the amounts of capital carryover by Vote be specified in the annual Appropriation Act of the year from which the carryover is proposed.  The actual decision in principle on the amounts of carryover by Vote are therefore determined in the Appropriation Act.</p> <p>The actual decision, in principle, on the amounts of carryover by Vote are therefore determined in the Act.  The D&aacute;il again has the opportunity to endorse the amounts in its decision on the Revised Estimates volume which shows the capital carryover amounts separately in the relevant Votes. </p><p> The carryover amounts provided for in the Appropriation Act are required to be confirmed in an order to be made by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform by 31 March of the following year, after approval of the order by the D&aacute;il, to allow expenditure to take place.  The order sets out the amounts by subhead consistent with the amount by Vote specified in the Appropriation Act. </p><p> Capital carryover within a Vote does not have to be spent on the same subhead or programmes where the savings occurred.  It may be spent on a different programme depending on progress and priorities.    </p><p> The committee will be aware that the old annual Estimates process has been replaced with a modern, multiannual framework.  The new framework allows for full transparency about the allocations available to each Department over the coming three-year period.  It has opened the way for structural, medium-term planning and prioritisation within each area, across all programmes, with full public input and parliamentary oversight.  It also makes it easier to assess what exactly Departments have achieved, and what they are aiming to achieve, with the public funds that are granted to them by the D&aacute;il.  It is not enough to know how much Departments are looking to spend.  We need to know, and the public needs to know, what exactly is being delivered for that expenditure.  </p><p> The Government is determined that every area of public service should be accountable for performance and results.   This will apply to Ministers and their Departments, as well as to all offices and agencies.</p><p> The 2014 draft order sets out the subheads or programmes under which Departments and agencies propose to spend in 2014 the capital carryover amounts specified by Vote in the 2013 Appropriation Act.  The total amount proposed in the draft order for 2014 is &euro;132.596 million, which amounts to 3.9% of the 2013 forecast outturn.  The total 2014 gross Exchequer capital provision allocated in budget 2014 amounts to &euro;3.339 billion.  The capital carryover of &euro;132.596 million will bring the total Exchequer capital available for spending in 2014 to &euro;3.472 billion. </p><p> The main priority areas for spending of the capital carryover of &euro;132.596 million are as follows.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is allocating &euro;72 million in total: &euro;50 million to support the quality of life measures under the Leader Axes of the Rural Development Programme 2007-2013; &euro;15 million for local authority housing provision; and &euro;7 million to support the continued implementation of the mortgage to rent scheme.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation is allocating &euro;23 million in total: &euro;17 million for the science and technology development programme; &euro;3 million to Enterprise Ireland for grants to client companies; and &euro;3 million to the IDA to help it to meet its extended remit.  Also, &euro;16.8 million will be spent by Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on afforestation premia as well as funding new forest planting.  The Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources will spend &euro;8.5 million to provide continued funding for the better energy programme.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport will spend &euro;4.8 million on the maritime transport area, in particular on harbour improvement works.  The Department of Children and Youth Affairs will allocate &euro;2.576 million for continued works on the Oberstown project which the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, announced late last year.  The Prison Service will allocate &euro;2.4 million on the new Cork Prison and other capital building works.  A total of &euro;2.52 million will be spent by the Departments of Social Protection, Defence and Foreign Affairs and Trade on the roll-out of the new Intreo offices, Defence Forces building and the upgrading of ICT equipment regarding the Passport Service.</p><p> Departments and agencies have delegated responsibility to manage their capital programmes and projects within the terms of the delegated capital sanction as set down by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The availability of these capital carryover amounts in 2014 will assist them within this framework in tackling economic and social infrastructural priorities in their areas.</p><p> I commend the Order to the select sub-committee and thank members for their attention.</p></speech>

I always say at this stage that everybody supports the principle behind the motion.  I agree that this motion is a good idea because it provides that funds available for a variety, and in some cases, good reasons that were not spent in 2013 can be carried over into 2014 for expenditure.</p><p>  Rather than make a speech I shall ask some questions in response to the rider provided.  We agree with the principle behind the motion.  I accept that funding forms part of the appropriations account that we approved during Christmas week and that it was referred to in the Revised Estimates.  All of the figures have been built into everything that we have seen up to now.  To an extent these are not new figures but we must go through this legal procedure in order to finalise the issue.  </p><p>  I shall take a quick look through the voluminous amount of charts supplied.  I thank the Minister of State for the information.  Does he have a figure for the amount of money that was surrendered by the Departments because it could not be carried over?  On reading the documentation I can see that  &euro;10 million was surrendered by the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine which could not be carried over; &euro;11 million was surrendered by the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources; and Youth Justice surrendered &euro;7.8 million.  A significant amount of moneys was unspent and, under different subheadings, only 10% can be carried forward.  Some of the amounts unspent were more than 10% of the 2014 expenditure and, therefore, could not be carried forward.  Some of it was surrendered to the Department and so could not to be carried forward here today.</p><p>  I read through the charts as quickly as I could when the Minister of State was speaking.  Let me give more examples.  The Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government surrendered &euro;2.5 million that was for landfill remediation, &euro;7.5 million that was for farm grants and &euro;375,000 that was for the Marine Institute; the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine surrendered about &euro;10 million in total; the Department of Communications, Energy and Natural Resources surrendered about &euro;12 million; the Department of Transport, Tourism surrendered less than &euro;1 billion; Youth Justice surrendered &euro;7.8 million; and the Prison Service surrendered approximately &euro;4 million.  I apologise for not getting my homework done sufficiently in advance.  Definitely, some &euro;50 million was surrendered.  I ask the Minister of State to give us the figure for the amount of money that was not carried forward.  </p></speech>

I shall just read out my note.  Of the moneys unspent but not carried - these mostly represent a number of small underspends across a range of Votes as outlined by the Deputy - some Departments have unspent capital in excess of the 10% limit for carry over.</p><p>  Unlike current expenditure, capital tends to be lumpy in nature.  It is difficult to predict precisely when capital moneys will need to be drawn down of which there are many examples in my Department.  Let me give a flood defence scheme as an example.  If the profiling for capital expenditure is &euro;21 million for a three-year period, such a scheme may not be consistent with three years and may take longer periods to complete.  It is all based on when contracts come in.  One could be in dispute with a contractor.  For instance, something could happen at the end of a contract while working on a snag list.  </p><p>  The figures related to capital expenditure in 2013 demonstrate that carryover is working.  Departments are able to retain a small but reasonable amount to help progress within the year.  It very much depends when the bills come in.  It is not a question of those being lost, as I understand, when the total amount of carryover, from last year to this year, is only 3.5% in total.  That is well within the 10% maximum provided for in the original legislation.</p></speech>

I have two technical questions before I move on to my substantive question.  In the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport there is a carry-forward of &euro;1.8 million for a payment for the SAR helicopter contract.  There is a related question in respect of the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government, as shown on page 9 of the notes received.  On page 10 of the notes some &euro;7 million will be allocated to support the continued implementation of the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  Wearing my public expenditure hat, will the Minister of State please explain the reason these are considered capital expenditure as opposed to current expenditure?  I would have thought the mortgage-to-rent scheme was current expenditure.  The reason I ask about the payment, in respect of the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, for a helicopter contract is that I understand in normal Government accounting practice that Garda cars are always taken as current expenditure even though the Minister of State and I may think they should be capital because they could last five years and yet could be crashed the first morning one goes out.  Effectively, the full amount has to be provided in current expenditure in the year it is spent.  Will the Minister of State explain why the helicopter contract is capital expenditure?</p></speech>

A capital asset is defined as "an asset intended for use on a continuing basis with an expected life of more than one year."  Capital expenditure also covers capital funding grants, for example, the forestry premium are grants to enhance the productivity capacity of the economy.  I will get the information on the helicopter question for the Deputy.  I know a little about the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  The &euro;7 million supports the continued implementation of the mortgage-to-rent scheme.  That, presumably, is a system that is being put in place.  Is it not the case that the local authorities are being asked to run this scheme?</p></speech>

The detailed question is on the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  More than half of the carry-forward of &euro;132, some &euro;72 million, comes from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  I think my figures are correct.  The appropriation account for 2012 was a total of &euro;107 million and again, more than &euro;43 million, 40%, came from the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government.  We are finding, year in, year out, that the Department is not using the money.  The standard answer is that if is not easy to time contracts and work.  However, there must be some reason this is happening in the Department.  On one occasion the Minister, Deputy Brendan Howlin, expressed unease, following the difficulty in securing the funding, that it was not properly drawn down.  Some 12 months ago we were told that the &euro;43 million was for water services schemes that had not progressed as quickly as they might.  In the note provided in respect of one of charts, it is stated that of the &euro;72 million, &euro;44.868 million of the carry-over is under heading B3 - water services investment, major public water supply.  The note states that the savings on the water investment programme of &euro;48 million were due, in part, to the slow drawn-down of activity in the water programme.  Will the Minister of State ask the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government to forward to the committee a list of what works were expected to be carried but were not completed and the reason &euro;45 million allocated for water services was not spent in 2013?  The reason I raise the issue is that the same thing happened the previous year.</p><p>  There is a systemic problem in the Department.  It may be that some schemes were budgeted to proceed but did not proceed or it may be that Irish Water was coming on board and some of the local authorities did not want to have to provide matching funding to the Government grant and, perhaps, held back.  Given that it is a recurring theme I would appreciate a breakdown of the &euro;44 million which is made up of individual amounts for various projects which did not go ahead and which had been built into the water services investment programme for the year.</p></speech>

Clearly it appears the lion's share of the carryover is in that Department.  He is also right in saying that the amount of carryover in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government is greater this year than last year, at &euro;72 million as opposed to &euro;43 million the previous year.  Clearly, the profile of the areas last year <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> this year is totally different.  Does the Deputy have the note on Vote 25?</p></speech>

Is it the case that the housing section in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government has the money an account and deals with mortgage-to-rent approaches on a case-by-case basis?  For instance, an individual who is with a particular bank might seek this option and go to the Department to determine whether the money can be drawn down.</p></speech>

The committee has received a number of Commission proposals in relation to EDF including COM (2013) 445, Council Regulation on the implementation of the European Development Fund and COM (2013) 660, Council Regulation on the Financial Regulation applicable to the 11th European Development Fund.  The committee will hear today about how these different proposals relate to each other.  We will then discuss the Government structures in place for the EDF and how the EDF is linked to the Irish aid programme and other EU external relations instruments.  Members will be aware that the EDF dates back to 1957 when the Treaty of Rome made provision for its establishment, with a view to granting technical and financial assistance, initially to African countries which at that time were still colonialised and with which some member states have historical links.</p><p>  The first EDF operated from 1959 to 1964.  The EDF for 2014-2020 will be the 11th such fund.  During the same period, EU external relations have developed and deepened to include programmes of assistance for pre-accession countries, the European neighbourhood policy and co-operation with third countries in terms of development co-operation and for the promotion of democracy and human rights worldwide.  Irish aid programmes have also grown and developed during this period.  It is important that all of these programmes and funds do not operate in isolation from each other but that linkages between them maximise the benefits that can be achieved.  Therefore, part of this discussion will centre on these synergies and linkages.</p><p>  The committee will engage today with officials from the Department of Foreign Affairs of Trade, Mr. John O'Grady, Ms Deirdre Lyster and Mr. Tony Cotter, multilateral section of Irish Aid, all of whom I welcome.  I now invite Mr. Cotter to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.228" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Cotter" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014021200002#A00500"><p>I thank the Chairman and members of the committee for inviting us here today to discuss the 11th European Development Fund, EDF.  The EDF is the main instrument for delivering EU development assistance to the African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, group of states.  The European Union funds its development co-operation programmes through the Union&rsquo;s external relations financial instruments on the one hand and the EDF on the other.  The external relations instruments are funded through the EU budget and the EDF is funded through direct assessed contributions by member states.  Each EDF is concluded for a multi-annual period and the 11th EDF will cover the period 2014 to 2020.  Total funding for the 11th EDF will amount to &euro;30.5 billion.  Ireland&rsquo;s contribution, based on a contribution key of 0.94%, will be &euro;286.775 million.</p><p>  The EDF legislative package consists of four main components, the first of which is the internal agreement, which was negotiated under the Irish Presidency, has been signed by all member states and is in the process of being ratified by them.  The internal agreement sets out the overall funding that will be provided within the multi-annual period of the EDF and individual member states&rsquo; contribution share-key to the fund.   The second part of the legislative package is the implementation regulation, which sets out how the EDF will be administered, including the responsibilities of the EDF committee, of which Ireland is an active member.  The implementation regulation also establishes objectives and eligibility criteria, the general framework for allocating funds, programming and implementation.  Negotiations on the text of the implementation regulation are ongoing within the ACP working group in Brussels. </p> <p>The third component of the EDF legislative framework is the financial regulation.<b></b>The regulation determines the detailed rules for the payment of the contribution of member states to the fund, as established by the internal agreement.  The text of the financial regulation has been negotiated by the Brussels-based African, Caribbean and Pacific, ACP, working group and will be formally adopted once all EU member states have formally ratified the internal agreement.  The overarching principle of the proposal on the financial regulation is maximum alignment with the financial regulation applicable to the general budget of the Union and its rules of application.</p><p> The fourth and final part of the legislative package is the overseas association decision, which establishes a partnership to support the overseas countries and territories' sustainable development as well as to promote the values and standards of the EU in the wider world.  The overseas association decision was agreed under the Lithuanian Presidency in December 2013.</p><p> The EDF operates in each of the ACP countries on the basis of a multi-annual country strategy paper, CSP, which is jointly agreed with the partner country government and with other stakeholders, including EU member states.  The CSP is operationalised by annual action programmes, AAPs, which detail the sectors and projects being targeted on a yearly basis.  These CSPs, AAPs and other financial proposals to be funded from the EDF are discussed at the EDF committee, which meets regularly in Brussels and where Ireland is represented.</p><p> The EDF is subject to annual review by the European Court of Auditors.  The Court of Auditors checks that EU funds, including those spent on development activities, are correctly accounted for and spent in compliance with the relevant rules and legislation, with due consideration for achieving best value for money, irrespective of where the funds are spent.  The EDF consistently achieves an annual statement of assurance from the Court of Auditors.</p><p> The European Parliament is responsible for discharging the EDF&rsquo;s accounts, further to the Court of Auditors annual review.  The Parliament discharged the accounts for the year ending 2011 in 2013 and the procedure to review the accounts for year ending 2012 is under way.</p><p> Irish Aid engages very actively with the EDF.  The geographical focus and aims of the EDF are closely aligned with those of Irish Aid.  The EDF is the primary EU funding instrument for sub-Saharan Africa and has a strong focus on poverty eradication and on fragile and conflict-affected states.  Current European Commission proposals envisage over 91% of the 11th EDF funding being allocated to Africa, which includes significant allocations for our key partner countries.  For example, Mozambique is set to receive &euro;734 million, Ethiopia &euro;712 million, Tanzania &euro;626 million, Uganda &euro;578 million, Malawi &euro;560 million, Zambia &euro;484 million, Sierra Leone &euro;376 million and Liberia &euro;279 million.</p><p> Acting together enables all member states, including Ireland, to benefit from the EU&rsquo;s wide geographical representation in third countries that is unmatched by any individual member state.  We can, through our support for EDF programmes, complement the work Irish Aid is already doing, especially in the social sectors, and also contribute to programmes where Ireland does not have a comparative advantage, such as infrastructure and private sector development.</p><p> EDF programmes significantly complement Irish Aid&rsquo;s work in our programme countries.  For example, in Malawi, the focus on water and sanitation in the 2013 EDF annual action programme is crucial to improving nutrition and complements the scaling-up nutrition work with which Ireland has been centrally involved.  Similarly in Tanzania<b>, </b>where Irish Aid&rsquo;s programme has a strong focus on agriculture, the EDF-supported southern agriculture growth corridor initiative, SAGCOT, aims to promote the participation of smallholder farmers in the development of agriculture value chains.</p><p> Irish Aid has been a long-standing supporter of Ethiopia&rsquo;s<b></b>productive safety nets programme.  As chair of the PSNP donor working group in 2010, Ireland fully supported an allocation of &euro;58 million under the 2010 EDF annual action plan to the programme.  It was designed to reduce the vulnerability of 8.29 million chronically food insecure people through conditional transfer of resources for labour intensive public works, and unconditional transfers in direct support of labour poor households.</p><p> Ireland&rsquo;s engagement with and oversight of the European Development Fund is managed through our membership of the European Development Fund committee.  In the context of discussions at the committee, we obviously take a particular interest in the eight Irish Aid partner countries supported by the EDF.  In advance of meetings, we consult our missions in partner countries to ensure that, to the greatest extent possible, there is complementarity between the EDF and the approach of Irish Aid&rsquo;s bilateral programmes in our partner countries.</p><p> The EDF's programming is also informed by<i></i>An Agenda for Change<i>, </i>the EU development co-operation policy that was adopted in 2012.  A key aim of the policy is that the EU should sharpen the sectoral and geographical focus of its aid programmes.  This is resulting in a concentration of aid on those sectors, countries and regions where the EU has comparative advantage.  Also, the application of the concept of differentiation will ensure aid resources are allocated to those countries most in need.  Ireland has consistently articulated support for the differentiated type of approach.  In the context of the 11th EDF, it will see an increase in resources allocated to the least developed and low income countries, reduced funding for middle income countries and an increased geographical focus on sub-Saharan Africa.  As well as seeking to ensure the relevance of the EDF's policy and programming approaches to Ireland's bilateral development priorities, Irish Aid engages in issues of oversight and governance of the EDF through our participation in the EDF committee.</p><p> The EDF has also been subject to a number of major external assessments of its performance.  The European Commission carried out a performance review of the EDF in 2011.  It acknowledged the difficulty in directly attributing development results and, more particularly, progress towards achieving the millennium development goals, MDGs, precisely to the various funding sources.  It concluded that the EDF had made a very substantial contribution to assisting ACP countries in progressing the MDGs.</p><p> The UK&rsquo;s multilateral aid review, also in 2011, concluded that the EDF represents very good value for money for UK aid.  It is one of only nine funding mechanisms, out of the 43 multilateral organisations assessed, that attained the categorisation.  The review highlighted the EDF's ambitious objectives, strong financial accountability processes, clear and transparent resource allocation procedures based on need and performance, and long programming cycles offering a high degree of predictability and a full range of instruments.<br /><b></b>The OECD Development Assistance Committee's, DAC, peer review of EU aid in 2012 also reported positively on the EDF.  It highlighted its flexibility and adaptability to changes in the political and economic climate.  I am aware the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Foreign Affairs and Trade met the DAC peer review team last week and the team spoke positively of the engagement.  </p><p> Irish Aid is increasingly conscious of the potential which EDF funds may have for Irish business.  Obviously the EDF budget is very significant.  We are starting a one year pilot project with IBEC.  The intention is to furnish IBEC with early information on programmes approved by the EDF committee and IBEC, in turn, will transmit the information to Irish businesses.  The aim of the pilot project is to raise awareness among Irish companies of the potential available for EDF programmes.  The wish and hope is that, in due course, Irish companies will successfully tender for EDF contracts.  Perhaps we can speak further about that aspect later in this session.</p> <p>In conclusion, I hope I have provided a useful, if brief, overview of the legislative package governing the 11th EDF.  I also hope I have demonstrated the synergies between the EDF and Ireland&rsquo;s bilateral programme and outlined the governance arrangements that underpin the EDF.  I thank the committee for this opportunity to talk about the process of implementing the 11th EDF, its governance and how its aims and objectives align closely with those of Irish Aid.  We will do our best to answer questions members may have.</p></speech>

I welcome his off-script comments at the end when he spoke about the possibilities that may emerge for our economic development and for business working in conjunction with the EDF.  That is welcome.  If Sir Humphrey from "Yes Minister" was looking for EU jargon, he would have looked at this programme.  Mr. Cotter had to make the presentation within the constraints of how it is framed and using different terminology.  It is quite confusing.</p><p>  Mr. Cotter is positive about the benefits of this mechanism of disbursing EU funding.  I accept it fully and Mr. Cotter makes the point well that acting together enables all member states, including Ireland, to benefit from the EU's wide geographical representation in third countries, which is unmatched by any individual member state.  That is welcome.  Mr. Cotter mentioned cases in which we do not have the capacity or in which Irish Aid work can be complemented.  The school in UCC dealing with developmental issues appeared before the committee and seems to have a great reach in regard to medicine, education, sanitation, agricultural development and the transfer of knowledge.  Can Mr. Cotter see a role for the school in UCC contributing to, and benefiting from, the EDF programme?</p><p>  In his concluding remarks, Mr. Cotter mentions that the 11th EDF would see an increase in resources allocated to the least developed and low-income countries.  That is where the focus should be and I welcome that development.  An agenda for change was adopted only in 2012 and it is possibly too early to determine whether it has been successful or if it has given an edge to particular policies.  If there has been any feedback or review of the policy, I would like to hear it.  Do all EU member states contribute to the EDF?  Does this programme come within the remit of the European Commissioner for international development?</p></speech>

Over the past five years, a number of assessments have come up with positive conclusions on the performance of the EDF.  Some of the reviews referred to the fact that EU aid remains fragmented between EU instruments, the EDF and the budget and between national, regional, thematic and horizontal levels of action in the EU and member states' bilateral programmes.  I am making the same point as Deputy Brendan Smith.  They are saying that things are positive but that there are difficulties.  If there is to be anything positive from today's meeting and Mr. Cotter's report, it is that we would like to hear how we can improve the system.</p><p>  There are concerns about multinational companies and the view that they are getting away with tax dodging due to a lack of financial transparency or a lack of political will.  There has been mention of the so-called double Irish arrangement and the allegation that by designating its office in Ireland in Cork, Mr. Cotter's county, Apple pays a tax rate equivalent to 1.9%.  What can we do about that?  Christian Aid estimates that tax dodging by wealthy multinational companies costs poor countries &euro;160 billion a year and many of them are among the least developed countries.  Do the witnesses agree that the EU must, as part of the package, fully commit to tax justice?  We must also look towards mutually beneficial trade.  I want to hear that we are trying to remove the loopholes in European law and in Irish law.  What role can the committee play in this respect?</p><p>  One of the big concerns is biofuels.  The EU has been positive in providing some leadership but the concern of many developing countries is that European countries are going to these developing countries, including many countries the EDF is funding, and using fertile land that had previously been used for growing food.  This increases the price of food locally.  There is a contradiction in what we are doing.  What can we do about this?  Everyone wants to see more sustainable policies and to deal with climate change but we have a crazy system of countries buying carbon credits.  It does not do anything to help our planet.  It only encourages wasteful products and practices.  Do the witnesses agree that Ireland needs to give greater leadership in this area?  We are talking about pulling back on the previous agreement, particularly in respect of biofuels.</p><p>  Haiti has been rocked by political instability, earthquakes and hurricanes.  Can the witnesses give an overview of the EDF's involvement in that country and what is emerging?</p></speech>

I am a relatively new member of the committee and I often wondered to what extent we had an input into how the money we gave to Europe was spent on aid.  I was surprised it is such a significant figure.  In the overall context it may not be huge but it is a big lump out of our total budget.  It seemed very important to me that it complements our bilateral programmes and I am pleased to see it does.</p><p>  Mr. Cotter made a point in connection with trade and informing IBEC about the value of the EDF money.  Although it is important to stay away from the idea of aid for trade, it seems this is a good idea and I suspect other countries have been doing it for years.  It is good that we get in and let people know as quickly as possible.  Many Irish companies would be ideally placed to tender for these projects.  We should be in there with other EU countries, who have probably been doing it for years.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.235" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1005" speakername="Maureen O'Sullivan" time="14:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014021200004#C00600"><p>I have now got my head around the acronyms, CSP, ACP and EDF, but I do not know how the witnesses keep going.  The point about aid is whether it makes a difference.</p> <p>It comes down to how we measure that effectiveness.  As the witnesses know, AWEPA is involved with that and monitors Irish Aid in two countries.  What was said about the performance review the European Commission did was a little bit alarming.  It gave a general acknowledgement of the good but also referred to the difficulty of directly attributing development results and, more particularly, towards the millennium development goals.  It could give the impression this money continues to go in but that we are not really sure of the effect of this money.  There are goals which can be measured.  For example, if we give money to educate a certain number of girls, we can go to the schools and get the results.  There is a greater need to look at the effectiveness of this money.  Considerable amounts of money are going into some of these countries.  Does this include direct funding to governments?  While the other might be more manageable to measure, sometimes the direct funding that goes to governments is not.  I know there are concerns about funding and administration costs and ensuring they are within reason.</p><p> I refer to emergency funding.  Looking at what is happening in the Central African Republic and in so many other places, how is that dealt with?  I am glad to see I am no longer a sole voice on biofuels and tax justice.</p></speech>

When one hears eurosceptics, etc., one should argue that they should look at the humanity of the European Union, as a 28 nation group.  It is prepared to put &euro;30.5 billion into the alleviation of hunger and development programmes, mainly throughout Africa, but also in the Caribbean and in the Pacific.  It is a flag the EU should wave very high.  I am very proud we are a member of the EU and that all 28 affiliated nations contribute, as part of their social responsibility to mankind, substantial sums of money.</p><p>  Having said that, I cannot help but see Irish Aid's influence in the documentation, and I might embarrass officials by saying that.  It is quite incredible that we, as a small country, have impressed our neighbours in Europe with how we have professionalised the delivery of aid over many decades.  Although I may be wrong, I would argue that it is clearly replicated in the formula being produced and the spending assigned to the various countries.  It is fascinating to see so much money is going to our programme countries.  I see the hand of the Irish working away in the background in the formulation of policy.  </p><p>  What is really fascinating is our contribution as a nation - &euro;286.77 million - and our programme countries include Tanzania, Mozambique and Ethiopia.  Our total contribution is &euro;286.77 million and the total payment alone to Mozambique's development programme is &euro;734 million.  It is vastly in excess of what we, as a nation, are doing.  Before I read this documentation, I was going to ask about the degree of collaboration between Irish Aid programmes and the European Union.  </p><p>  I refer to the United Nations framework proposals post-2015.  As enthusiastic as I am about the collaboration between Ireland and Europe, how do the witnesses think things will pan out when it comes to the United Nations programme post-2015?  We may not have the same clout.  Do the witnesses think the programmes will merge in some way on the world scene?</p><p>  I really like this employment enhancement scheme.  It sounds very productive and the witnesses might give us a little more insight into it.  Presumably, there are labour intensive projects where people are fed or some money is given to those labouring under these schemes.  </p><p>  This committee met the OECD delegation, which spoke about reviewing our work in Malawi.  The partners reviewing us are Portugal and Austria.  I think we reviewed Portuguese aid programmes.  I did not know the DAC also monitors EU-funded development programmes.</p><p>  This is a fantastic report and I congratulate all involved in the monitoring and preparation of the programme at EU level.  Our officials have a hand in not only preparing and working on the programmes but also in monitoring the spending and reviewing the work going on.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.238" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="14:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014021200005#D00300"><p>I congratulate Mr. Cotter on looking so well after hiding out in Clare for the past year.  I presume that only applies to him and that his two colleagues were hiding out elsewhere during the course of the championship.</p><p>  The extent to which there is accountability for spending has become hugely important in this country and throughout the European Union.  My colleague, Deputy Olivia Mitchell, mentioned aid for trade but we are not supposed to go there.  To what extent do other European countries benefit or otherwise from trade with the counties to which the European Union donates aid?  We are not supposed to go there but it might be no harm to inquire into that.  It is not that I am, in any way, parochial but it is no harm to inquire occasionally.</p><p>  Like, I am sure, all of my colleagues, I have experience, in the context of immigration issues, of dealing with the embassies of the some of the African countries which are beneficiaries and some of them are not very helpful to people who were their own people.  I would like that to be borne in mind.  From time to time, we have occasion to deal with these embassies which are perfunctory, to say the least, and, at worst, downright rude and uncaring towards their own people and unwilling to accept any kind of remonstration at all, so I would like that to be borne in mind.</p><p>  I refer to aid for trade.  There is a strong Chinese influence in African countries and there is a doubt about the extent to which they abhor aid for trade.  I am anxious to know if we, as Europeans, are being treated equally.</p><p>  Deputies Eric Byrne and Olivia Mitchell mentioned the substantial fund we contribute in quite difficult circumstances.  The position here should be to look at the European Union's commitment to the European Development Fund, which is considerable.  It is hugely important there is full accountability and a clear indication of good spending, good practice and efficacy in terms of distribution and administration and those for whom it is intended benefit directly.  It would be one thing if the budget was a small but it is a very large one of &euro;30.5 billion and it can have a huge impact.</p> <p>If it is administered badly it can have a negative impact not only on the economies of the donor countries but on public perception.  Does the same standard of accountability apply to aid from the European Development Fund as to bilateral aid? </p><p> The third component of the European Development Fund framework is financial regulation.  The regulation determines the detailed rules for the payment of the contributions from member states to the fund as established by the internal agreement.  The text of the financial regulation has been negotiated by the Brussels-based African, Caribbean and Pacific working group and will be formally adopted once all the new members have been formally notified.  Has everybody agreed to contribute?  Does everybody agree that the contribution should be subject to scrutiny and accountability?</p><p> Other members have referred to the number of acronyms.  One paragraph is full of acronyms, and while it may save ink, that is all it does.  I believe in using the full description instead of referring to the African, Caribbean and Pacific countries as ACP, the annual action programmes as AAPs and the European Development Fund as the EDF.  I would prefer that we revert to using the words in full.  That is not a criticism of the presentation.</p><p> Some African countries are particularly vulnerable at present.  When aid is being approved from the European Development Fund, is account taken of the country's Government and governance?  The annual action programme were designed to reduce the vulnerability of 8.29 million chronically food-insecure people through conditional transfer of resources for labour-intensive public works and unconditional transfers in direct support of labour-poor households.  I think a case can be made for co-financing in cases in which the country in question can afford to contribute.  Some countries have a wealth of natural resources and cognisance should be taken of that when distributing aid.  We should encourage countries that are able to make a contribution to do so in accordance with the incoming aid.  That would be reassuring to the European Union.  It would also give recipient countries an opportunity to identify the area in which aid is most appropriate.</p></speech>

It is difficult to come up with an original question.  The budget for the 11th EDF is &euro;30.5 billion.  How does that compare with the budget for the tenth EDF?</p><p>  I agree that it is important that the Court of Auditors check and monitor the EU funds.  How is the aid provided to recipient countries monitored?  Was the previous aid programme effective in the countries referred to in Mr. Cotter's report?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.241" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tony Cotter" time="15:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2014021200006#E00300"><p>The team will do its best to answer the questions.  I will explain the history of the EDF before I deal with questions on fragmentation.  Back in 1957, during the process of establishing a European Community, France and Germany were particularly anxious to have a fund for development in their extra-territorial territories.  The other members states at that time which did not have such territories were not as enthusiastic, and the compromise that was arrived at was the establishment of the EDF but outside the <i>acquis communautaire</i>.  In other words, it was an intergovernmental arrangement rather than a community arrangement.  The EDF is the only EU instrument that is intergovernmental in nature.  As the Deputy might know, there have been proposals in the past to bring the EDF into the community spend, but that issue will be revisited again in 2020 when the Cotonou Agreement comes up for negotiation.</p><p>  The agenda for change was referred to in the context of fragmentation and this is all about the European Union focusing on a select number of priority areas in each individual country so that there is greater impact for the EU spend in those countries.</p><p>  I agree with Deputy Durkan, who raised the issue of jargon in the context of EU legislation.  EU legislation is somewhat like the Holy Trinity; it is a bit of a mystery.  One would want to be an international lawyer to comprehend the EU legislation.  In general terms, the overall objective of this legislation, which is intergovernmental in nature, is to make it compatible with EU law and to make the financial regulations instruments as similar and as close as possible to the regulations that apply to European Union funds.</p><p>  The principle of differentiation will see increased resources for low-income fragile countries, which are a particular priority for Irish Aid.  I am pleased to say that differentiation will mean an increase in resources under the 11th EDF allocation to least developed and low-income countries, from 79.5% under the tenth EDF to 85.3% under the 11th EDF, and a decrease in resources allocated to upper-middle-income countries from 5.3% to 2%.  The 11th EDF is going in the right direction in that it is concentrating on countries with the least income and on fragile states.  That is very welcome from an Irish perspective.</p><p>  Accountability is very important.  There is a concern on the part of all member states to ensure that there is accountability.  As Deputies have pointed out, the EDF budget is very significant.  In response to Senator Mullins, the budget for the six years of the tenth EDF was &euro;22 billion.  It is important that there is proper accountability for this funding.  That is a matter of interest not only for Ireland but for the other member states, such as Germany, which contributes &euro;5.2 billion to the EDF, and France, which contributes &euro;5.4 billion to the EDF.  We rely on European Union mechanisms such as the European Court of Auditors, which conducts an annual audit on the EDF to ensure the money is properly accounted for and spent in compliance with the rules and legislation.</p> <p>Overall, the EDF, compared with other EU bodies, has a good record and has consistently gained an annual statement of assurance from the European Court of Auditors.  The European Union has also introduced a result-oriented mechanism which essentially means it engages external evaluators to make site visits to projects, to assess and monitor the projects and report back on their efficiency and effectiveness.  Also the European Union has a separate independent evaluation office which conducts evaluations of the work and projects conducted under the EDF.  </p><p> The EDF is also subject to a discharge by the European Parliament on foot of the annual report of the European Court of Auditors.  The European Parliament has an annual look at the European Development Fund and has an opportunity to debate and comment on the report furnished by the European Court of Auditors.  Member states are also very conscious to ensure maximum value for money so far as the EDF spend is concerned.  The EDF committee in Brussels regularly reviews and monitors the performance of the Commission to ensure that as far as possible the EDF fund is administered in the best way possible.  </p><p> On trade generally and the impact of the EDF spend, as Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned, there are some aspects of the EDF spend which can be measured by the number of children in school, the number graduating to secondary school and the number of children leaving school.  These can be directly assessed.  One advantage of the EDF is the extent to which it gets involved in infrastructural projects.  At one stage I had the pleasure of hosting Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan in Zambia.  I will take Zambia as an example of where the EDF can have an impact but which may be more difficult to measure.  Zambia is a land-locked country, surrounded by nine other African countries.  It has no direct access to the sea which means that its raw materials and its exports have to come by road.  Air transport is too expensive.  Zambia did inherit a railway system but it has fallen into disrepair.</p></speech>

Imports to Zambia come by road and exports go out by road.  The primary exports for Zambia are copper and maize.  The routes used by Zambia are east to Mozambique; and from Mozambique, south east to Durban, south to Capetown or west to Namibia.  The European Union uses the EDF to improve the roads system in these African countries in order to facilitate commerce and trade.  Doing this increases the attractiveness of these countries for foreign direct investment and for private sector investment.  So far as the spend on infrastructural areas is concerned it can have an immeasurable impact on the development potential of these countries but may not be as directly measurable as other areas.</p><p>  I was asked if all member states contribute to the EDF.  The answer is "yes".  All member states contribute to varying degrees to the EDF.   </p></speech>

As our percentage for the EU budget is 1.14%, the general feeling is that the 0.94% agreed for the EDF in financial terms was a very good result for Ireland.</p><p>  On the issue of trade, one very strong principle of Ireland's approach to development is that all our development aid is untied.  That is a strong and central principle of Irish Aid and will be maintained in the future.  It is a principle that is respected and acknowledged by the African countries where we have bilateral programmes.  Other countries do not follow that principle.  That is not to say that trade does not have a role where development is concerned.  The whole development context has changed in the past 15 years.  </p><p>  In 2000 when the millennium development goals, MDGs, were introduced the largest development spend by far was overseas development aid, ODA.  In the 15 years since, there has been a significant change in the sense that ODA is no longer the largest element of development funding.  It is important funding for least-developed and fragile countries because, in many instances, those countries cannot attract funding otherwise.  In the past 15 years there has been a change in the sense that countries, such as China, India and Brazil, have come on to the field.  There has been a huge increase in domestic income.  African countries have significantly and exponentially increased their domestic income.  Huge charitable organisations such as the Clinton Foundation and the Gates Foundation, have entered the playing field so that there is a totally different environment now so far as development is concerned.  Certainly there is a role for private sector involvement and foreign direct investment provided rules, principles and ethics are followed by companies going into the developing countries.  That is very important.</p><p>  There was a reference to taxation and capital flight from developing countries.  As I have mentioned, domestic revenue is increasingly important and it is increasingly recognised that countries themselves have a responsibility for their own development and, in that respect, must maximise to the greatest extent possible their domestic income.  Irish Aid, for its part, provides assistance for capacity building of revenue systems in developing countries.  An example, is our own Revenue Commissioners who have gone into Rwanda to help the revenue authorities in that country to improve its capacity.</p><p>  Capital flights from developing countries remains a major obstacle.  However, there is increased international co-operation to try to combat that particular activity.  At G20 and other levels there is a recognition that other measures must be taken to combat capital flight from developing countries.  In that respect Ireland has a good record, in the sense that under the Irish Presidency, we were instrumental in negotiating the EU accounting and transparency directive so as to require multinational companies, based in Europe, to report on the payments they make to developing countries for access to oil, gas and minerals.  It is important that those payments are open and transparent and that the populations in the developing countries are aware these payments are being made.  Other efforts are being made to complement co-operation between member states to promote better exchange of information on taxation issues and so on.</p><p>  There was a reference to China.  I can speak about China in relation to my experience in Zambia.  It was very involved in Zambia and is very involved in Africa generally.  It is involved in a very strategic way and in a long-sighted way from its own perspective.  One attraction for Zambia is raw material, particularly, copper.  I mentioned that Zambia's exports leave the country through Mozambique, Namibia or South Africa. </p> <p>From any of those countries, the boat in most instances is headed towards China.  I read recently that China currently has a 25 year store of copper.</p><p> The other major area in which China is involved is land.  Again, Zambia is a particular attraction for China because its agricultural potential is immense.  Zambia is approximately ten times the size of Ireland and has a population of 13.5 million.  Some 65% of Zambian land is arable, but only 14% is being cultivated.  Irrigation multiplies the productivity of land by a factor of nine or ten.  Less than 1% of arable land in Zambia is irrigated, despite the fact Zambia has the fifth highest source of fresh water in the world.  Agricultural potential in Zambia is huge and China has recognised that and is beginning to purchase land there because it does not have sufficient arable land of its own to feed its growing population.  The Chair will be interested to know that the chief executive of the biggest agricultural processing business in Zambia, the first indigenous company to launch on the London stock exchange, is a constituent of his and lives in Ogonnelloe.  It is incredible the number of Irish people one meets when one travels through Africa.  China's engagement is very strategic and I have outlined that.</p><p> A question was asked regarding employment and the EDF.  I already mentioned the EDF spend on roads and road infrastructure.  This funding by its nature creates local employment.  Expenditure on major infrastructure projects such as roads, transport, bridges, customs facilities and so on creates employment opportunities locally.  There is, therefore, an opportunity for Irish companies to engage in this.  The amount spent under the EDF is significant.  All of these contracts are published in the <i>Official Journal of the European Union </i>and<i></i>it is open to businesses to tender for them and Irish companies can do so successfully.  From my time in Zambia, I am aware that the Sisk group was very successful there and in Zimbabwe, South Africa and a number of other countries.  There is a precedent whereby Irish companies have done this.  What we wish to do is to raise awareness of this potential among the Irish business community.  Obviously there are challenges in this.  It is not simply a case of walking in, submitting a tender and getting a contract.  One must become familiar with the local situation on the ground, but despite the challenges, there is potential.  We want to make the Irish business community aware of the potential so that Irish companies will be successful in tendering for EDF contracts in the future.</p><p> Reference was made to the school in UCD.  There is always a role and potential for schools and colleges to make a contribution in the developing world.  Irish Aid has a scheme in place to foster partnerships between educational entities here and in the developing world and these can have a pragmatic and practical influence.  Similarly, the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland has a programme in place in sub-Saharan Africa, which provides training to surgeons in these African countries.  This important programme ensures surgeons in these countries can get appropriate training <i>in situ</i>rather than having to leave their country and come to a developed country for their training and becoming part of a brain drain.  There is potential in the area of educational facilities, which have a role to play in developing countries.</p></speech>

Therefore, of all the money we give towards the European Development Fund, the amount that goes to the countries we have chosen as partner countries is relatively small.  My other concern regarding the fund is that as our funding and budget for Irish Aid decreases, the amount we are committed to giving to the European fund increases.  Therefore, the money this country has discretion over, whether we give it to Tr&oacute;caire, Concern or an NGO or whether we target it as we wish towards a programme such as the AIDS programme in Zambia or education in one of the partner countries we have chosen, is limited.  My concern is that what we control of our overseas aid budget has diminished enormously in the past number of years.  The figures Mr. Cotter has provided, &euro;286 million is close to 40% or 50% of our overseas aid budget.  It is simply a matter of writing a cheque and out the door it goes to Europe, but only &euro;40 million odd of it goes to the countries we are most concerned with.  I am concerned that we are not in control of our aid budget any more.</p></speech>

The question is who will ensure it is implemented and when will we see the practical and positive results.  In other words, when will we see the new reporting by companies.  In the same context, are there plans to extend the directive beyond the extractive industries?</p></speech>

I would think that being part of the European Union makes us part of a bigger bloc and much more.  We are part of the &euro;30.5 billion of aid.  I presume the degree to which we control the spend is shared among our EU colleagues and, accordingly, benefits should accrue to us in terms of our membership of the European Union.  I would not concede for a moment that we have little or no influence.  We have considerable influence over what happens to the money we contribute.</p><p>  The development of road networks is important in terms of transport and infrastructure.  In regard to the TanZam railway, what would be the cost and benefit of restoring that?  Is there a cost benefit analysis for that?  This is rail as opposed to road infrastructure, but both are required.  What would be the benefit of restoring the railway, for both the European aid programme and the country to which we are donating?</p><p>  Mr. Cotter is correct with regard to Chinese investment in land and we have seen that at first hand.  How does European Union aid compare with Chinese aid or that of other donors worldwide?  The European Union is positive, supportive and has the right idea and motives, but perhaps not every other country may have.  To what extent does the European Union get credit for its aid and do we expect comparative reciprocal arrangements to those of other countries providing aid in Africa?</p></speech>

In the early 1970s or late 1960s the Americans built the road which ran alongside the railway.  I understand the Chinese were building a narrow gauge railway at the time.  Is the road still there?  Is the railway still there?  Is that one of the projects funded?</p></speech>

They all had an agenda in the past.  One of the positive things about Ireland's aid is that we have no hidden agenda.  Mr. Cotter said our aid is untied.  My argument is that it should not be untied in the sense that we want to see these countries emerging with the elimination of poverty, clean water and so on.  However, we also want to have inclusive and more equitable societies and so on.  If we are ticking boxes in any way in respect of what we are trying to do in these countries, these are the things we should aspire to.</p></speech>

I fully agree with Deputy Crowe on untied aid.  Other countries will give aid but there will be conditions such as that the development specialist expertise should come from that country.  There are other conditions to ensure that a certain benefit will accrue to the country that is giving the aid.  When I use the term "untied", I mean we give all our aid untied.  There are no conditions or expectations that development specialists or Irish personnel will be employed on foot of that aid.  That is what I meant.  I fully agree with Deputy Crowe that the entire purpose of our development assistance is to eradicate poverty and to promote sustainable development, good governance, human rights and the rule of law.</p></speech>

There is a long-standing tradition from Ireland and we have taken a particular policy approach.  Our consistent policy approach has been that our aid is untied.  As I have said, that is respected and acknowledged worldwide.  Separately, and on a different track, that does not prevent us from seeking business opportunities for our business enterprises and this can complement the development assistance that is given.</p><p>  I did not realise that I would encourage so much interest in railways.  Anyway, in 1964 when Zambia got its independence, it inherited a very good rail network from the Chinese.  Remarkably, Zambia has approximately 73 different dialects and languages and there is no word for maintenance in any of those languages or dialects.  The railway system which the country inherited in 1964 has fallen into disrepair.  Consideration is being given to moneys being spent to develop that railway system, because, like the road system, a modern up-to-date railway system would be of immense benefit to Zambia in getting in imports and getting out exports.  Consideration is being given to that at this stage.</p><p>  Senator Daly asked a more difficult question.  The allocations I referred to in my opening remarks for the programme countries and the allocations that our programme countries get under the European Development Fund are country-specific.  However, those countries also benefit from the regional spend on infrastructure projects, such as roads, energy systems, transport systems, all of which assist these countries and make them more attractive for foreign direct investment and business.</p><p>  We believe that the European Union gives us advice on a global stage and by working together it is possible to get the maximum impact from a development spend.  I set out in my opening statement how we see the EDF spend complementing our national spend.  However, I am unsure whether I can answer all the reservations raised.</p></speech>

In so far as the accounting and transparency directive is concerned, it is an EU accountancy and transparency directive and it will be implemented and monitored by the EU mechanisms.</p><p>  I cannot be specific on the areas under consideration for expansion in the directive, but I assure the committee that there is increasing recognition at international level of the need to stop the illicit flight of capital from developing countries.  I am aware that it has been discussed in such august surroundings as the G7, the G20, the European Union and the United Nations.  There is an increasing international focus on the importance of addressing the matter and I am satisfied that in the time ahead we will see an expansion of the measures.</p></speech>

As our aid budget drops, our EU commitment remains static because we are tied in at 0.94%.  Therefore, as a country, our discretionary spending is dropping.  That is my concern.  Deputy Durkan seemed to be implying that if we had written one entire cheque to the EU it would be fine, but I do not believe that is a good foreign policy for the country.</p></speech>

This is something that we acknowledge and it could not have happened without public or political support.  Reference was made to the percentage of our spend.  We are one of the top ten donors in the world per head of population.  As a country, comparatively speaking, we have a high per head of population spend.</p></speech>

Anyway, we see the European Union spend as complementing our national spend.  Given the size of the European Union budget and the areas where it can get involved, such as the infrastructural and other projects to which I have referred, it is an important spend for developing countries.  This is because developing countries, as well as requiring support in respect of their social sectors - which, by and large, we concentrate on - must also have the benefit of the infrastructural spend on the roads, railways, bridges, customs facilities and all of the other areas which make them more attractive for foreign direct investment.  We see the two spends as complementary rather than being in opposition to one another.  I am unsure whether I can go further than that.</p></speech>

Under section 86 the authority will engage in a consultation process with regard to the regulation, monitoring and operation of legal partnerships and multidisciplinary practices, MDPs.  This consultation will feed into the exercise of the regulatory power of the new authority regarding business structures.  It is envisaged that the authority will conduct the initial consultation process within six months following its establishment and not within 18 months as in the published Bill.  The report of the section 86 public consultation process, once completed, will be presented to the Minister who will have it laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas.  The Minister will also at that time furnish the report to Cabinet, along with details of the proposed date of commencement of the legal partnerships and multidisciplinary practices provided for under sections 72 and 74.</p><p>  Section 86 also envisages that the authority may carry out other periodic consultations on the regulation, monitoring and operation of legal partnerships and MDPs.  The authority under section 87 will carry out a separate public consultation process in respect of the manner in which a barrister may hold clients&rsquo; moneys and whether the current restrictions on barristers receiving instructions on a contentious matter directly from a person who is not a solicitor should be retained or removed.  This consultation process is now to be completed within 12 months of the establishment of the new regulatory authority.  The Bill, as members know, originally published prescribed a period also of 18 months with the relevant report to be laid before both Houses of the Oireachtas by the Minister within 30 days.</p></speech>

MDPs involving lawyers are not permitted in the following EU member states: Bulgaria, the Czech Republic, Cyprus, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, Greece, Hungary, Ireland &ndash; at present, Latvia, Liechtenstein, Lithuania, Luxembourg, Malta, the Netherlands, Poland, Portugal, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia, Spain, Sweden and Scotland.  I do not know the rationale.</p><p>  This Bill was supposedly driven by the troika and the need to reduce costs because certain sectors of the Irish economy were too costly and so on.  This does not address that problem.  The regulatory impact analysis conducted in respect of this Bill does not include any analysis of the proposals to introduce the MDPs.  It makes assertions that the evidence does not back up.  The report of the Competition Authority, which was intended to lead up to this Bill, did not recommend MDPs.  The regulatory impact assessment cites Scotland and New South Wales as examples of jurisdictions that have them but fails to mention the critical point that barristers are not permitted to participate in MDPs in those areas.</p><p>  As a Deputy from Donegal North East, a mainly rural constituency, I am concerned.</p> <p>One of the benefits of the current position is that one can go to a solicitor in the nearest town to deal with a range of challenges.  That solicitor can access the service of the best-placed person within the Bar Council.  That is an option for a person living outside the main urban bases.  The difficulty in what the Minister suggests is that the best and brightest could be sucked into corporatised structures.  For a State of 4.5 million people, I do not understand the requirement for this at all, although there are allegations of economies of scale.</p><p> There is also the issue of legal practitioners and indemnity.  There is a need for clarity in this regard and if there is a multidisciplinary practice with a legal practitioner and others, the question of liability arises.  In other jurisdictions difficulties arise when a range of people cover a multitude of bases.  The Enron scandal was an example as people who were supposed to do audits were also involved in consultancy.  I really do not know why there is a big drive towards this or why there is a demand.  The phrase "one-stop shop" sounds good but it is a one-stop shop for big business and will not apply to Charlie Joe in Donegal, Mary in Galway or Mickey in Tralee who may have a complicated health, financial or family law issue.  I must oppose this in its entirety as very little detailed research has been done.  I know it is a compromise that clearly arises from the differences in Cabinet that there will be consultation.  We can have regard to the concerns of the Law Society and the Bar Council, with an objective analysis of their opinion on the current state of play and what is proposed, and we would take the current state of play any day of the week.</p><p> We understood that one of the primary objectives of the Bill is to reduce costs for people.  I have indicated to the Minister on numerous occasions that the mediation Bill later in the year will do more to reduce costs than this Bill.  I do not know what is the public interest in moving forward with these multidisciplinary practices.  I will speak in more detail on the concerns of relevant stakeholders as we move forward.  It is not just the Bar Council that has concerns, as the Law Society has a range of opinions on indemnity, clarification of the types of practising solicitors and the background and the definition of partners.  There is a range of recommendations that have been submitted to the Minister and this committee.  The Free Legal Advice Centres, the North Side Community Law Centre and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are among the stakeholders telling us we should oppose these multidisciplinary practices.</p><p> In a corporate structure, a barrister would become answerable to many others, including shareholders, other partners, boards of management, high-paying clients and so on, rather than giving regard to the best interest of clients, and courts will no longer be a priority.  There is also a real risk that should such corporate structures be introduced, the market will substantially contract, allowing only the largest firms access to the best of the Bar, thereby substantially transforming the character of access to justice for all the citizens of the State.  It will be similar to football leagues in that the biggest firms with the deepest pockets will hire the best players and charge fees out of the range of all but powerful big business interests, leaving the ordinary workers outgunned on every occasion.  There will be reduced opportunities to devil, which is the term for barristers serving their time and moving up the experience ladder.  There is a range of issues but that is the initial statement about the concerns.  We can probe other issues as we go through the sections.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.284" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="10:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014021200004#C00200"><p>Let us speak of what is involved with multidisciplinary practices.  I am very disappointed by the contribution from Deputy Mac Lochlainn, although I do not mean that in a personal sense.  I believed his party presented itself as being interested in reform not in maintaining structures in the State which we have had for over 100 years or representing the vested interests within the legal profession.  His contribution, referencing what is essentially the Bar Council brief, reflects that council's approach of <i>non mutare</i>, or no change.  We are living in a world different from the 18th century.  This legislation is not about serving the legal profession but the general public by ensuring people have access to legal services and there is a wide range of business structures through which legal services can be provided.  We are trying to ensure that practising lawyers have options on how to provide legal services and earn a living, and that regardless of the mechanisms through which legal services are provided, there should be appropriate regulatory provisions in place and independent oversight.</p><p>  There is nothing about the &quot;one-stop shop&quot; or multidisciplinary practice that is so uniquely complex as to make it impossible to have appropriate regulatory oversight.  There is nothing to make it compulsory for any individual legal practitioner, barrister or solicitor to provide services through multidisciplinary practice.  The legal system currently allows solicitors to be sole traders or partners; there can be small firms with two or three partners and large firms with 50, 100, 200 or more partners.  The large firm argument is that multidisciplinary practices will suck up all the good lawyers but have the five big legal firms sucked up all the good lawyers?  There are many good lawyers outside the big five firms practising in a broad range of areas, with some in general practice and others engaged in niche specialties.</p><p>  Some lawyers like to practise in big firms and others like to practise in small firms.  With solicitors, some like to practise as individual sole traders and some like to practise with partners.  Barristers are all effectively individual sole traders and they cannot operate in partnership, although some have taken to acquiring premises together in which they have offices and out of which they share expenses.  They cannot share fees.  Some parts of rural Ireland do not go near the Bar library and to all intents and purposes the people may operate a legal practice but cannot advertise it as such.  There is a range of restricted practices.</p><p>  Many members of the general public who have legal issues need financial or other matters resolved.  They may have to visit a lawyer, accountant, a surveyor or engineer, among others.  They pay money for the lawyer to write to the accountant, who would write to the surveyor, and there would be individual meetings that incur unnecessary expense.  The attraction of a one-stop shop for members of the public, where there is a particular type of legal issue on which people need assistance, is that they can all be met in one room.  Perhaps one would not have to pay for multiple consultations or for people who should work together to send letters to each other.</p><p>  This is about the public interest and understanding that the manner in which our legal system has developed is an historical accident.  Our legal system did not develop based on any great plan but rather it reflected the manner in which the legal system developed in colonial times in the United Kingdom and England in particular through the 17th and 18th century.  Divisions were created between barristers and solicitors, with formations devised.  Ireland was differentiated as in England barristers can have chambers but in Ireland - at least in theory - they do not.  In practice, some are operating to all intents and purposes through chambers.</p> <p>Multi-disciplinary practices are working, for example, in New South Wales.</p><p> What we are doing is looking at options.  The difficulty is with a conservative profession, the most conservative wing of that profession is the Bar, where everything is seen as a threat and as being malevolent, nothing is seen as being in the public interest.  There are a myriad young barristers in the country who cannot get work because they are dependent on the goodwill of their seniors or their relationship to some solicitor or some senior long-standing junior counsel to feed themselves, but who have enormous legal skills.  Is there any reason they should not be employees in a solicitor's firm for a number of years and ply their legal skills there, with the option in the future to be single operators in some specialist area?  In what way is that contrary to the public interest?  It may be disruptive within the realms of the Bar but in what way is it contrary to the public interest?  I cannot identify a public interest problem with that.  If solicitors and barristers are working together in a practice, or barristers operating truly as partners in the sense that not only do they share the premises and the expenses but, depending on the luck when fees are coming in, may share the profits and their fees, in what way does that create a public interest issue, if appropriate regulatory oversight and the principles prescribed by the legislation, to which members of the legal profession must adhere, are in place, and a failure to adhere to them could result in a disciplinary intervention?  </p><p> We are trying to provide options.  Just as in the context of the Bar and the solicitors profession I have no doubt that following the enactment of this legislation when multi-disciplinary practices are established, for many years a majority of lawyers will continue to operate within the legal business structures that currently exist for lawyers but some will choose to do it differently.  Where they do, it will be to the benefit of the public and will generate competition and insights and ensure those who have particular skills can utilise them and the professions can work together.  Why is it that we think a one-stop-stop in other areas of life is a very good idea but in this context it is not a good idea?  </p><p> I wish to deal with some of the specifics.  In its 2006 report, the Competition Authority observed that: &quot;The ban on the formation of multi-disciplinary practices prevents the supply of inter-related services together in a way which may generate synergies known as economies of scope.  It prevents professional service providers from catering for clients who have a set of inter-related needs, and from integrating their supply with providers of complementary services&quot;.  It further stated: &quot;The prohibition also limits the ability of clients to benefit from a one-stop-shop that hinders innovations which might otherwise result from the combination of different services, and it would allow for new products or services to be developed to the benefit of clients&quot;.  The Legal Services Bill 2011 addresses that issue.  In the UK, legal services are now being provided through a whole range of alternative business structures, including the co-operative movement, in order to provide ready access to the general public to legal services at lower cost and to provide that access through different locations, maybe high street locations rather than high-end office locations.  </p><p> What are the benefits of multi-disciplinary practices to the legal profession?  If one is a small solicitor's firm operating in a rural part of Ireland and nearby  a small accountancy firm is operating and one is constantly interacting with the other because they serve the same area with, largely, the same clients, why should not one be able to operate a single business providing that service, the synergies and complementarity that come with it?  On the disciplinary issue, in the context of a strong regulatory framework, an independent legal services regulatory authority and appropriate codes of practice, there is no difficulty or mystery as to how one ensures that the appropriate ethical principles and obligations of lawyers are complied with, including the lawyers' obligation as an officer of the court to behave in a particular manner.  </p><p> Deputy P&aacute;draig Mac Lochlainn recited the part that comes directly from the bible of the Bar Council submission about barristers.  It is not phrased this way but the implication is that they might be corrupted by having to ply their trade within a corporate structure.  I have more faith in the ethics of members of the Bar than that.  At the end of this process if barristers find themselves in a position where there are part of a multi-disciplinary practice, they will have to comply with the legal ethics and principles prescribed by the legislation with the appropriate codes of practice that are consistent with the legislation, not the restrictive codes that are currently in place to provide a block on how one sells one's legal services.  Should they fail to comply with the ethical requirements what will happen?  If there is misconduct we will have an independent process to adjudicate on that.  </p><p> Enron has been mentioned.  This is one of the great myths that it is of some relevance to this particular issue.  Enron is of no relevance to this issue.  The circumstances that led to the problem with Enron had nothing to do with the existence of multi-disciplinary practices.  The failures of Enron were not related to the conduct of lawyers but rather of corporate governance, an accountancy failure of regulation.  That is the key.  The Enron problem arose in respect of a large incorporated publicly quoted entity with a range of different business areas and subsidiaries in associated companies.  The overall Enron entity, to which the share price was pinned, managed to portray itself as profitable in circumstances in which, clearly, it was not and it inflated the share price on the markets.  At the same time it used various accounting devices to hide what were large scale losses.  It did this through the use of the accounts of its subsidiary and regional operations.  It appeared that the accounting firm, which was the Enron auditor, was at worst either complicit in the accounting devices of Enron or at best was negligently oblivious to them on an extraordinary scale.  However, the source  of the problem was not the professional conduct of lawyers but accountants supervising the accounts of a corrupted corporation.  I do not know why Enron is brought into this debate, other than as some spectre to hang over of a threatening nature to indicate that if we have multi-disciplinary practices, everyone will be automatically corrupted by the existence of the structure.  </p><p> The issue of the relationship between the Enron case and multi-disciplinary practices is very specifically addressed by Mr. Paul Paton in a 2010 article in the <i>Fordham Law Review</i>in which he said:<blockquote>If accounting firms were willing to sacrifice audit integrity in order to secure more lucrative consulting arrangements, the argument went, then certainly lawyers working for MDPs controlled by accountants would be pressured to compromise their integrity and independence for financial gain.  Such a position, however, fails to acknowledge one hard truth: Enron resulted from the improper behaviour of many professionals, including lawyers, acting in separate accounting or law firms [he emphasises the lawyers were acting in separate law firms, not in multi-disciplinary practices] rather than from an inherent flaw in the multi-disciplinary practice arrangements.  Rather than pointing to Enron as a justification for banning MDPs, regulators and others should instead consider how best to structure incentives for the ethical behaviour of lawyers and others within all professional service firms, whatever the configuration of the firm.  Simply banning outright a business model for delivering legal and other professional services fails to address the more complex questions of how best to reward independent, ethical, and candid advice, regardless of the conduit through which that advice is delivered.  </blockquote>What we envisage is ethical, independent and appropriate conduct with a sophisticated regulatory oversight independent of the legal profession.  There is nothing the Deputy has said or presented which indicates there is a public interest reason for not proceeding with multi-disciplinary practices.  All of the arguments are public interest reasons for doing so.</p><p> The Deputy has cited what exists in other parts of Europe.  We recently passed our insolvency legislation.</p> <p>In other parts of Europe, there is not a precedent for the personal insolvency arrangement which allows arrangements to be entered into between debtors and creditors to resolve debt in circumstances where there is secured debt.  We set a precedent in that regard and I am proud of that.  That provision in our legislation is now forcing financial institutions to enter into arrangements without debtors having to engage in the formal structural approach set out in the persona insolvency legislation because the institutions know that if they do not so engage they may be forced to do so under the personal insolvency arrangement.  They realise that if they do not co-operate in that engagement, the option of bankruptcy, with a very limited term, may be sought.</p><p> The rest of Europe is talking about replicating our insolvency legislation.  One of the officials in my Department who is principally responsible for helping to draft that legislation is currently, at the request of European Commission, assisting with the drafting of similar insolvency legislation for another EU state.  I do not mind if we are a trailblazer on the legal services Bill in dealing with an appropriate provision to establish multidisciplinary practices to enhance the public's ability to gain access to legal services.  However, I do not accept what is suggested in this regard.  There is no member of the Law Library, for example, who would be compelled to join a multidisciplinary practice.  There will be many members of the library with niche expertise in their individual areas who will want to continue to work as they do, with the option of being recruited by individual solicitors when there are clients in need of their niche expertise.  There will be areas of work in respect of which one could not possibly join a solicitors' firm because the firm would not have the volume of work to justify employing one on an annualised basis as opposed to for an individual case.  However, there will be circumstances where solicitors and barristers may work together to the benefit of their clients and their own business arrangements.  Members of the Bar will join in.  I do not understand the fear that exists within the Bar on that issue.</p><p> The Deputy has raised some important issues regarding the Law Society.  It was always the provision in this Bill that in advance of the creation of multidisciplinary practices, the legal services regulatory authority would engage in a consultative process to ensure any regulatory measures or codes of practice that need to be put in place would be considered and put in place.  We would ensure they had the insights needed for anything that may need to be done in the area of financial oversight.  On Committee Stage, as we go through the legislation, we are tidying up provisions in the Bill based on where we got to some weeks ago.</p><p> Owing to my interest in this Bill, I am very interested in all the submissions we have received, and I have paid very careful attention to them.  The Law Society has made some very constructive suggestions for fine-tuning the legislation with regard to some regulatory matters.  We will be taking these on board on Report Stage.  Very recently I received a submission from the Law Society following the publication of the amendments we are dealing with today.  It raised some issues and this is why the consultative process is so important.  We are dealing with a new area.  Just as the consultative process helped to improve the insolvency Bill, it will help to improve this one.</p><p> It is disappointing that a party that presents itself as reformist in the context of this Bill is simply presenting the arguments of those who are utterly opposed to reform, and particularly opposed to changing anything with regard to the manner in which legal services are delivered.  It is opposed, apparently, to giving the public greater access to legal services, should it require them, and to the possibility that the cost of legal services may decrease if there is greater competition.  I refer also to the desire to cut off the possibility of members of the legal profession who are qualified, ethical and well trained providing legal services through alternative business mechanisms in a manner that might produce economies of scale, reduce their overheads and enable them to pass the reduction in their overheads on to clients by way of reduced costs.</p></speech>

The Minister referred to the bible of the Bar Council in regard to responding to a couple of quotes.  The Bar Council is pleased to learn it is now in the hallowed company of the Irish Congress of Trade Unions.  The references the Minister made came from its submission.  The Bar Council and the Irish Congress of Trade Unions are now in a conservative camp together, apparently.</p><p>  With regard to vested interests resisting change, I do not believe one can include the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, the free legal advice centres and the Northside Community Law Centre in that category.  I respectfully disagree with the Minister.  While I defer to his greater knowledge of legal matters, I believe we need to keep the debate in focus.  A range of people, some of whom the Minister would argue are conservative and others of whom I would certainly argue are very progressive, have legitimate criticisms and concerns in regard to the multidisciplinary practices and business partnerships.  We are clearly not going to change the Minister's mind on this.  If we are to engage in the consultation process, we must acknowledge the many legitimate criticisms from a range of stakeholders, including some of those vested interests to whom the Minister referred.  If we are to go down this road, the Minister should listen to all the constructive criticisms and try to include as many protections as possible to deal with legitimate concerns that have been put to him.  Deputy Shatter, being the Minister, gets to make the law along with his majority in the Government but he should try to strengthen the legislation by acknowledging constructive criticism if he is to go down the road proposed.</p></speech>

I did not hear the Minister's introductory speech entirely.  With regard to multidisciplinary practices and alternative business structures, has the Minister received conclusive proof that legal costs will reduce for the consumer?</p><p>  The Minister mentioned competition.  If there are a number of multidisciplinary practice structures that manage to corner the market using a number of specialists in a particular field, could this lead to price inflation or prevent people from exercising the choice that might otherwise exist when tapping into services?  This question points to the main problem that has been brought to my attention in regard to multidisciplinary practices.</p><p>  Am I correct in understanding that the alternative business structures are such that non-legally qualified people could be providing the legal service?  Is the Minister seeking to have people who would not be qualified to practice, either at the Bar or as a solicitor, providing legal services through certain mechanisms to the consumer?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.290" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="10:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014021200006#E00500"><p>I will respond briefly because we have explored a number of matters already.  I do not understand why Deputy Collins believes a new, alternative model by which legal services can be provided will result in the concentration of all services through that model.  According to that theory, there could be a small number of solicitors' firms with expertise only in particular areas.  The existence of an alternative structure through which to give legal advice does not, in itself, create a monopoly of expertise in a particular legal area within that structure.  I do not understand the Deputy's argument and do not know where it is coming from.</p><p>  The objective is that one will be able to gain access to legal advice through alternative business models.</p> <p>At present, for example, if one visits a solicitor's firm one will consult with a solicitor.  In some instances, one might meet a legal executive whom the solicitor might authorise to talk to one about something.  However, if such a legal executive speaks to or engages with one, one would expect it to be under the supervision of the solicitor.  There is not a suggestion that one will create multidisciplinary practices in which there is a range of individuals who have no legal qualification but who are pretending to be lawyers, because that is not the way this should work.  There is an interesting issue in that in its recent proposed amendments, the Law Society suggested some small amendment that might be made to the legislation to provide a protection in that regard.  Again, I greatly appreciate the constructive engagement we are having in that context as we tease through the Bill.  Consequently, there is no suggestion that one can create a multidisciplinary practice and then throw up a series of unqualified people who pretend to be lawyers and who give people advice, any more than a solicitor's firm would throw up a whole range of unqualified people who pretend to give people advice but do not have the qualifications to do it.  There is no particular reason this should emerge to any greater extent from a multidisciplinary practice than out of a solicitor's firm.  If one has in place the correct regulatory structures, it will not.  Of course a multidisciplinary practice, just like barristers or solicitors, probably will employ non-lawyers, secretarial assistants and people to do other back-up work.  That is part of the way the law has operated for many years.</p><p> I do not understand why the creation of multidisciplinary practices should make it more expensive to get legal advice.  One of the great things about human beings in different walks of life who have expertise is they wish to ply their trade.  Lawyers - and I am one - on occasion like to think that what we do is terribly mysterious and that we do something so mysterious that the rest of the world does not understand it.  Whether one is a lawyer, an engineer, a doctor, a plumber or a landscape gardener, one has an expertise in one's life and one sells that service to assist individuals who need it.  Moreover, one earns a living by getting paid for what one does.  It is no more mysterious than that, and providing an alternative mechanism through which one can deliver legal services is simply what it says on the tin, an alternative mechanism.  The world, strangely, has not collapsed in England with all the reforms that have been introduced there in the past three or four years, to which Members of this House, the public and the legal profession in Ireland appear to be oblivious.  A revolution is taking place an hour's flight away in the provision of legal services but what is interesting about that revolution is that it is still only a small proportion of practising qualified lawyers, in respect of a small proportion of the business mechanisms through which legal services are provided, who are using the new mechanisms.  They are there, they are being used and they are providing opportunities, legal assistance and advice.  However, many lawyers, because they are happy with the economics and the architecture of the way they have been doing business in decades past, have not changed.  Nevertheless, I am providing the opportunity for change and evolution.</p><p> Finally, what is really interesting in this regard is that one Maeve Hosier has written a marvellous PhD thesis entitled "The Regulation of the Legal Profession in Ireland", which should be compulsory reading for us all.  It sets out the history of the legal profession and how it evolved.  It evolved continually until approximately 1870 and then went into paralysis and nothing has changed since.  The only thing that has changed subsequently was as a result of the enactment of the Courts Act 1971, when the then Minister for Justice, Des O'Malley, conferred rights of audience on solicitors in all the superior courts.  That is the only fundamental change effected since approximately 1870 to the manner in which the Irish legal profession operates.  It is extraordinarily curious that people think the world stopped in 1870.</p></speech>

This section originally was contained in section 74 of the published Bill, which also contained a number of other provisions relating to the role of the managing legal practitioner in a multidisciplinary practice.  The role of the managing legal practitioner has been developed further and now is set out in section 77.  It should also be noted that sections 72 and 73 of the published Bill and the definitions in Part 7 remain unchanged.</p><p>  Amendments Nos. 157, 158, 167 and 168 are part of a cluster of amendments that provide a series of regulatory safeguards with regard to how legal services will be protected in MDPs and how consumers will be protected.  Amendment No. 158 deals with notification of commencement and cessation.  Under section 75, a multidisciplinary practice is obliged to notify the legal services regulatory authority, LSRA, of its intention to commence or cease the provision of legal services.  This section is based on a similar provision in the legislation on MDPs in New South Wales and will ensure the LSRA must be informed of the existence and operation of all multidisciplinary practices in Ireland.</p><p>  I will now turn to amendment No. 167 regarding the power of the authority to specify measures.  Section 83 provides that the LSRA may issue directions to the managing legal practitioner or to the practice where it is satisfied that a provision of or regulations made under this Part are not being complied with.</p> <p>The section also provides that the multidisciplinary partnership, MDP, or the managing legal practitioner may appeal a direction of the authority to the High Court within 21 days.  In such cases the High Court may confirm the direction of the authority or revoke or vary the direction.</p><p> With regard to amendment No. 168, application to High Court to suspend or cease providing legal services, section 84 provides that the authority may apply to the High Court for an order requiring an MDP or managing legal practitioner to comply with a direction.  These powers escalate up to and including seeking a direction of the High Court that the MDP sees provision of legal services.</p><p> Amendment No. 169 to section 85 now provides that the Legal Services Regulatory Authority shall make regulations with regard to the operation and management of a legal partnership or a multidisciplinary practice.  As previously mentioned, the authority would engage in a public consultation process under section 86 with regard to the regulation, monitoring and operation of legal partnerships and MDPs.  This consultation will feed into the exercise of the regulatory power of the new authority regarding business structures.</p><p> Effectively, what we are dealing with is the important regulatory oversight provisions which I referenced in my earlier comments with regard to MDPs to ensure that as with other structures through which legal services are currently delivered such as solicitors' practices, sole traders or partnerships, the appropriate regulatory oversight and the appropriate regulations are ultimately put in place following on from a consultative process.</p></speech>

For an amendment to be discussed on Report Stage it must be notified on Committee Stage and this is the most appropriate time to do it.  I am not certain that I want to do it but I seek clarification.</p><p>  The Minister outlined the development of the legal professions in Ireland and the pace of change since 1870.  It is probably not accurate to say there has been no change since 1870, although any changes that have occurred have been glacial in their speed, but one of the few changes that occurred was an insertion in the code of conduct for barristers to the effect that no professional code shall operate to prevent a practising barrister from sharing any facility, premises or costs of practice, including capital or operating costs.  That is to facilitate quasi chambers or at least barristers grouping together and sharing resources as it is more economical and, therefore, it would be hoped the economies of scale can be passed on to consumers.  It is to the broad benefit of everybody concerned but this Bill envisages that barristers will remain in the Law Library, which would probably be the great majority, but equally there will be employed barristers - that is clearly provided for - and barristers in the service of the State.  </p><p>  I am not entirely clear, and clarification would be welcome, as to whether the Minister envisages that if this Bill is enacted there will be barristers who are in independent practice, namely, they are not working for the State.  They may be in employment as waiters or whatever, as is the case with many young barristers, but they are not employed to provide legal services.  They are independent barristers and therefore would receive instructions from solicitors or members of the public in non-contentious issues, which is a provision of the Bill, but who may operate in chambers.  It is important to point out that chambers are not partnerships; they are a collective of sole practitioners.  Is it the case that there will be sole practitioners operating in chambers who are not members of the Law Library?  Is it envisaged in the Bill that all independent barristers will have to remain members of the Law Library?  If it is envisaged that there will be a variety of methods by which people can practice or choose whether to be members of the Law Library, should an amendment be considered to the effect that no professional code shall operate to prevent a practising barrister from sharing any facility, premises or cost of practice, including any capital or operating costs, or to require a practising barrister to share any facility, premises or cost of practice, including capital or operating costs, with one or more other practising barristers?</p></speech>

It is the intention of the Bill that a barrister can do exactly what the Deputy is proposing, namely, that there will be no obligation to be a member of the Law Library as such, that they can ply their trade as a barrister, that they can operate an office, alone or with others, as a barrister, that they would adhere to the professional principles, and that they will be on a roll of barristers maintained by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  It would be desirable if there was only one roll being maintained as opposed to the necessity for two, but we seem to be in a space where there will be a need for two.  I am happy to examine the legislation in the context of what Deputy McNamara is saying to ensure there is no issue or difficulty of any description but the specific provisions in the Bill dealing with the roll of practising barristers to be maintained by the Legal Services Regulatory Authority envisages exactly that.</p></speech>

Section 76(2) provides that a partner of a multidisciplinary practice may share with another partner in the MDP fees or income arising from the provision of services by the practice.</p><p> Section 76(3) is an important subsection which provides that a person may be a partner in a multidisciplinary practice notwithstanding that he or she does not provide legal services or services other than legal services.  Essentially, this permits a partner in an MDP to provide investment to the practice.  Section 76(4) provides for the prohibition of certain legal practitioners from being a partner in an MDP, for example, where he or she is subject to an order of the High Court, suspension or striking off.</p><p> I am giving ongoing consideration to matters such as who can be a partner in an MDP, how best to provide for possible conflicts of interest and the delineation of who can provide legal services or be designated as a managing legal practitioner in an MDP, and I expect to return to these matters further at Report Stage.</p><p> With reference to amendment No. 161, managing legal practitioner, many of the provisions contained in section 77 were previously contained in section 74 of the Bill as published.  Section 77 provides that an MDP must have a managing legal practitioner who is responsible for the management and supervision of the provision of legal services by the practice.  The managing legal practitioner is given specific statutory obligations to ensure that the multidisciplinary practice is managed to ensure that the provision of legal services by the practice complies with the Act and the stated professional principles.  These obligations relate to the professional independence and integrity of legal practitioners acting in the best interests of clients, maintaining proper standards of work, compliance with duties owed to the court and the confidentiality of client affairs.</p><p> We have further developed the role of the managing legal practitioner based on the New South Wales legislative model.  Section 77 will also now provide that an MDP must inform the authority where it does not have a managing legal practitioner in place for seven days or longer.  The MDP cannot provide legal services cannot provide legal services until a managing legal practitioner is in place.  Under section 77(4), the managing legal practitioner will be required, where he or she has reason to believe there is non-compliance, to take necessary steps to ensure compliance and to remedy any defaults.</p><p> I would point out that the Legal Service Regulatory Authority will not be regulating the activities of participants in an MDP who are providing services other than legal services.  Where accountants, architects or other providers operate in an MDP, they will be subject to their own regulatory or professional supervisory bodies.  Of course, lawyers in these entities will also be governed by the enhanced conduct, disciplinary and legal cost provisions of the Bill.</p><p> With reference to amendment No. 162, section 78 provides that nothing in this Part prevents an act or omission by a legal practitioner who is a partner in or an employee of a multidisciplinary practice that is in contravention of this Part from being found to amount to misconduct under section 45.</p><p> Amendment No. 163 deals with the operation of multidisciplinary practice.  Section 79 requires the MDP to have written procedures binding on all partners and employees within the practice to ensure compliance with the requirements of the Act and adherence to the professional principles set out in section 9(5) of the Bill.  This includes an obligation on all to comply with the directions of the managing legal practitioner and any procedures that are set out in regulations governing the operation and management of the MDP.</p><p> Returning to my conversation with Deputy Mac Lochlainn at the start of this, these are the crucial and important provisions to ensure proper regulatory oversight and to ensure that the concerns that he raised with regard to MDPs are appropriately and comprehensively addressed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.347" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="11:05:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014021200010#K00200"><p>I thank the Chairman and I am sorry for delaying everyone.  I shall move on to the prohibition on inducement, which is section 79(3) in the amendments that we are discussing.  Section 79(3) has a requirement prohibiting anyone from inducing or causing a lawyer in a multi-disciplinary practice from acting in a non-compliant manner.  Section 79 (4) requires that accounting, receipts and fees records for legal services and other services be kept separate.</p><p>  Next we have a non-disclosure provision.  Section 79(5) has a non-disclosure provision where a lawyer cannot disclose the affairs of a client to another person in an MDP, without the express consent of the client concerned.  I wish to say something about the matter.  I think I am right to attributing this to at least one of the submissions from the Law Society that logically pointed out that if one is running an MDP as a one-stop-shop then clearly the person who is the lawyer would need to be able to communicate with other professionals in the MDP with regard to the issue under discussion.  </p><p>  The intent of the section, as drafted, is clear.  One may go into an MDP and one may only want the services of the lawyer.  One may not want the services of the other professionals, one will want to be able to consult that lawyer and one may not want one's business discussed with other professionals.  On the other hand, if one is using what I describe as the one-stop-shop and one expect one's lawyer and accountant in the MDP to consult together there will be a simple signing of the written consent and those consultations would take place.  It allows a lawyer operating with an MDP what I describe as providing traditional legal services that other professionals they are working with would not have access to confidential information.  Where one is using it as the one-stop-shop, because one is dealing with a number of professionals, that would be explained, and one would sign a consent and there would be no question of information being dealt with within the firm in a manner that the client was unhappy with. </p><p>  We will have a further look at the way this is framed.  In the context of concerns that people have expressed about MDPs and how they might operate, in a sense we are being quite conservative in the manner in which we are dealing with the matter to ensure that all of the multiple protections are in place and that people are fully informed, in the context of their consulting with the practice and that, I suppose, a formal consent is provided to the sharing of information with regard to an individual's circumstances, within the practice, between a legal professional and others operating in other areas to which the practice is engaged.  As I say, we are working through this but that is the intent of the amendment, as prescribed.  </p><p>  I shall move on to the issue of inspection.  The entitlement of a person to inspect an MDP or obtain information from a partner or employee, in an MDP, regarding the provision of services other than legal services under an enactment or rule of law is upheld under section 79(6).  For example, a regulator, a professional body or a public body may have a right to inspect the premises in which a particular person or member of a particular profession carries out their business.  The Legal Service Regulator Authority will have its own, separate powers of inspection under the Bill to which I shall be returning on Report Stage.</p><p>  I shall now turn to Government amendments Nos. 164, 165 and 166 that deal with the letter of engagement, professional indemnity insurance and the saver for compensation fund.  Section 80 is again based on a provision in the legislation on MDPs in New South Wales.</p> <p>I should point out, in referencing the New South Wales legislation, that the enormous benefit is that MDPs have been operating there for some years.  They have teased out initial teething problems and have addressed matters by way of legislation in a manner that is practical to ensure that MDPs can fully and properly work and that there is appropriate oversight.  There is a very useful touchstone of expertise with regard to the workings of MDPs and when I visited Australia some time ago I had very detailed conversations in that regard with the relevant authorities there.  </p><p> Section 80 provides for client protection at the point of engagement through the provision of a letter of engagement which specifies what services are being provided, including which of the services being provided by a legal practitioner are legal and/or non-legal.  Again, I am conscious that there are law firms which provide services that could be regarded as legal services or as financial services and there may be a grey area in that context.  However, if one has a detailed letter of engagement detailing services then it is quite clear what are regarded as legal services within the MDP and what are regarded as non-legal services.  The letter of engagement also has to specify which of the services are to be covered by the compensation fund.  I know that the Law Society was concerned that a myriad of inappropriate claims might be made against the compensation fund in circumstances in which it was alleged that something was a legal service when it was not.  All of these matters can be adequately and properly dealt with through the regulatory structure.  The legal services regulatory authority itself, in the context of regulations it will inevitably make following the consultation process, may address these issues further.  The letter of engagement serves as an indicator of our awareness of this issue and of the need for clarity and agreement at the starting point for both client and legal practitioner - that is, agreement between a client and a solicitor or a client and the MDP as to what services are legal and what services are to be otherwise designated.  </p><p> Section 81 provides that professional indemnity insurance must be held by an MDP to cover all of its services.  In a saving provision, section 82 provides that nothing in this part of the Bill shall be construed as extending the obligations of the Law Society in relation to dishonesty arising in an MDP on the part of a legal practitioner who is not a practising solicitor. </p><p> In concluding my introduction to the proposed amendments to part 7 of the Bill, I am happy to acknowledge the views and concerns that have been conveyed to me by the Law Society on an ongoing basis with regard to certain of its provisions.  These and other aspects of the Bill in relation to which views have been similarly received will be taken into consideration as part of the preparatory process for the Bill&rsquo;s forthcoming Report Stage.  However, the provision being made in this part of the Bill for the regulated introduction of legal partnerships and multidisciplinary practices remain fundamental to the Bill&rsquo;s delivery of alternative legal business structures in support of greater competition in the provision of legal services in the State to the benefit of legal practitioners and the consumers of their services alike.  Some have made submissions suggesting that we should remove from the Bill the provisions concerning legal partnerships - for example, between barristers and barristers or MDPs - but if we were to do that, we would be fundamentally changing the Bill in the area of seeking to ensure a multiplicity of optional business structures through which legal services can be provided.</p></speech>

The Law Society recommended that a requirement be introduced for non-legal-practitioner partners to be members of regulated professions such as accountants, actuaries, architects and so forth.  This would fit the ethos of what an MDP is supposed to be - namely, a multidisciplinary practice, rather than a vehicle for unqualified persons to provide legal services.</p><p>  The next recommendation relates to the proposed new section 76.  The Law Society recommends that bodies corporate be prohibited from acting as non-legal-practitioner partners in MDPs.  It also recommends that the provisions of section 76(4) as proposed by the Minister's amendments be extended to cover all legal practitioners restricted, suspended or struck off before the commencement of the Act, which is an important point.  Regarding the proposed section 77, it is the recommendation of the Law Society that the regulations and requirements of MDPs with regard to client moneys and client accounts be no less rigorous than those imposed on solicitor firms.  Regarding the proposed new section 80 dealing with the letter of engagement, the Law Society recommends that clear definitions of legal services and non-legal services with regard to MDPs be put in place.  The society notes that in both sections 80 and 82, the relevant section in the Solicitors Acts regarding compensation for loss due the dishonesty of a solicitor should be section 21 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1960 as substituted by section 29 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994, as amended by section 16 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 2002.  I ask the Minister to respond to those issues.</p></speech>

I received it a few days ago and went through it personally, as did my officials.  I referenced it earlier as a constructive and helpful document in the continuing development of the Bill.  Indeed, I addressed some of the issues the Deputy has just mentioned.  I do not want to delay the committee by going into each of the issues, but suffice to say it is a very helpful and constructive submission and we are looking at it carefully.  There are some issues which give rise to concern where there is no need for concern.  There is certainly some additional tidying up that we can do on the Bill.  I very much welcome the fact that we received the submission.</p> <p>We will constructively engage with it, to the extent of ensuring the objectives of the legislation are fully achieved and that we have what is the right and appropriate regulatory structure in place in this area with no room for ambiguity or concerns.  I have no doubt we will return to the issues on Report Stage.</p><p> I could do what the Deputy is inviting me to do because I have extensive notes on the document, but it would delay the meeting for the next hour if we went through each of them.

If one takes a family law practice, I could well see a solicitor&rsquo;s firm practising in family law, interested in dispute resolution dealing with people with very difficult parentage disputes over children with regard to custody and access issues or relationship issues, deciding that it would be a good idea for someone to create a family law practice in which one had two well-qualified family counsellors, a family mediator who might help mediate disputes in order that people would not have to go to court, and a number of lawyers.  The practice might equally decide to bring in a pension expert to provide advice.</p><p>  I am speculating.  In the context of people dealing with family counselling, I am not sure there is an overall professional organisation that provides a disciplinary oversight of family counsellors.  One of the issues is whether an individual is properly qualified and experienced.  There is not a qualification, as one would have in the accountancy profession.  I have some concerns about the idea that one would restrict it in the manner suggested.  I can see the attraction of the approach in the context of disciplinary matters but I must be careful as we think this through that we do not create other difficulties.</p><p>  In the mediation area, Members might be familiar with the heads of the mediation Bill we published.  Further work is being done on that.  There is no overall national body, for example, that is engaged in regulatory oversight of mediators.  There are different types of commercial mediation groups which teach mediation to people from different walks of life.  I would have thought, for example, that if one takes a commercial multidisciplinary lawyers' practice, one would have a number of lawyers who have become either arbitrators or mediators but one also has non-lawyers who become arbitrators and mediators.  The Bar has an organisation of joint barristers and arbitrators to provide alternative dispute resolution measures.  One could ask whether in the absence of an overarching regulatory body for mediators one would exclude a mediator from being part of a multidisciplinary practice.</p><p>  The situation is perhaps more complex than the Law Society perceived it.  I can well understand why it made that proposal in a regulatory framework context.  In some areas it is important that one has that oversight.  We are reflecting on the issue.  Whether it is the family law area or the commercial law area I do not want to exclude the possibility of engagement by other professionals whose skills are complementary to the service provided and who could provide those skills to the benefit of the public within an overall one-stop shop framework.  It seems to be there are well-qualified, well-trained individuals working in the community who could be excluded from being part of a multidisciplinary practice on the basis of what the Law Society has proposed.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.396" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="11:20:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014021200012#M03100"><p>I move amendment No. 172: <blockquote><br />In page 67, between lines 22 and 23, to insert the following:<div>&ldquo;PART 8<br />OBLIGATIONS OF PRACTISING BARRISTERS</div><b>Roll of practising barristers</b><br /><b>76.</b> (1) The Authority shall&mdash;(a) set up and maintain a roll of practising barristers (in this Part referred to as the &ldquo;roll&rdquo;), and<br />(b) within six months of the commencement date, enter on the roll the name of, and additional information in respect of, every person who is, on the commencement date, a practising barrister.(2) The Authority shall make a copy of the roll available at its principal office during normal working hours to members of the public for inspection free of charge.<br />(3) If the roll is kept in an electronic or other non-written form, the Authority may comply with its obligation under <i>subsection (2) </i>by making it publicly available on its website.<br />(4) An entry on the roll shall, in respect of each practising barrister&mdash;(a) contain such information as is required by this Part,<br />(b) contain such additional information as may be prescribed under <i>subsection (5)</i>,<br />(c) specify whether he or she is a member of the Law Library, and<br />(d) specify whether he or she is in the full time service of the State.(5) The Authority may, having regard to the objectives specified in <i>section 9(4)</i>, prescribe additional information in relation to the professional qualifications and areas of expertise of the practising barrister concerned that is to be contained in an entry on the roll.<br />(6) In this Part&mdash;<br />&ldquo;additional information&rdquo;, in relation to a practising barrister, means the additional information relating to him or her that is prescribed under subsection (5);<br />&ldquo;commencement date&rdquo; means the date on which this section comes into operation.&rdquo;.</blockquote>Part 8 makes the Legal Services Regulatory Authority, and not the Bar Council, responsible for the keeping of the roll of practising barristers.  This is a policy decision based on the fact that the Bar Council does not wish to be held responsible for maintaining a roll or collecting a levy payment from barristers who do not come under its aegis as members of the Law Library.  This Bill will comprehend suitably qualified persons who have been duly called to the Bar and who practise as barristers outside the so-called traditional practise model of membership of the Law Library.  Non-Law Library members such as in-house counsel, partners in a legal firm or a multidisciplinary practice and other sole practitioners will, therefore, come under the roll of practising barristers.  I wish to recall, as previously indicated, that I will be returning on Report Stage to the interpretation provisions in section 2 as it relates to important terms such as those of &ldquo;practising barrister&rdquo; and &ldquo;legal services&rdquo; in order to reflect the Bill&rsquo;s development, including during this current Committee Stage consideration process.</p><p>  I would now like to take the committee as briefly as possible through the Part as presented to the committee today.  Section 76, inserted by amendment No.172, provides that the new Legal Services Regulation Authority will set up and maintain a publicly accessible roll of practising barristers.  Every suitably qualified person who intends to so practice will be required to apply to the authority to have their name entered on the roll in accordance with section 77.</p><p>  Section 78, based on section 79 in the published Bill, deals with the variation of entries on the roll.  The section provides for the removal of a person&rsquo;s name from the roll for a variety of serious disciplinary related breaches, or where requested by the person, or upon the death of the person.  The section is essentially <i>pro forma</i> and has only been amended to reflect the fact that the authority and not the Bar Council will be in charge of the roll.  I will also have to make a small correction to this section on Report Stage to remove the reference to section 38(10), which was deleted at last month&rsquo;s committee sitting and so should be referenced no longer.</p> <p>New sections 79 and 80 provide that unqualified persons and persons whose names are not properly on the roll of practising barristers will face sanction if they attempt or pretend to practise as barristers.  This ensures that equivalent provisions to those already in place for solicitors under the Solicitors Acts are also in place for barristers.  </p></speech>

The roll of practising barrister is now being taken under the aegis of the new regulatory authority which creates a difficulty in that the Bill acknowledges the existence of the Law Library and the Bar Council and therefore, the logic must follow that the Bar Council should continue to be entitled to insist that its members operate within the confines of a code of conduct that prohibits practice with a legal partnership employment or MDP structure.  How do we deal with that conundrum?</p></speech>

This brings us back to<i> nonemus mutare</i>, or we will not be changed.  That is the special plea from the Bar, saying &quot;do nothing, change nothing, do not allow members of the barrister's profession to operate as partners, do not allow them to open chambers, do not allow them to share fees, do not allow for any change of any description because this is our motto: <i>nonemus mutare</i>&quot;.  It is a special plea from the Bar to remove the provisions already in the Bill that seek to stop the continuation of the restrictive practices which are currently incorporated within the Bar's code of practice.</p></speech>

It has a code of practice in place.  How do we deal with that conundrum?  I ask the Minister to respond to that point.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.401" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014021200013#N00400"><p>I presume it will exist.  In my early college years when I did not know what it was I wanted to do, I studied philosophy and I always found Descartes extremely interesting.  One of the great Cartesian principles, in wondering what the world is really about is, &quot;I think, therefore I am&quot;.  I think the Bar Council exists, therefore it will be.  It will have its code, which will have to be in compliance with the legislation enacted by the Houses of the Oireachtas to the extent that there is any oversight for ensuring that restrictive practices are not enforced.  Currently, there are restrictive practices.  Those restrictive practices prevent members of the Bar forming partnerships with other members of the Bar.  They also prevent members of the Bar forming partnerships with solicitors.  The restrictive practices prevent a person who is a barrister from remaining a barrister if he or she is employed in a solicitors firm.  We had the bizarre situation recently where a well-known English firm of solicitors decided to set up offices in Ireland.  The firm wanted to employ solicitors in Ireland as well as individuals with particular legal expertise and, as I understand, employed a barrister.  The barrister wanted to continue to do what the barrister had always done, which is to provide expert legal services and be entitled to appear in court but if the barrister had remained a barrister while in the employ of a solicitors firm, he or she might have been struck off by the Bar.  The barrister did a very simple, chameleon-like thing and because the rules now provide for it was able to transmogrify from being a barrister into being a solicitor within a short number of weeks.  <i>Ergo</i>, the barrister who was a barrister is now a solicitor and can continue to do exactly what the barrister did, which is to give legal advice and appear in court.</p><p>  This legislation, based on the perspective of providing additional competition and removing barriers to competition, having regard to providing alternative means to deliver and receive legal services, makes it clear that a specific element of the Bar's code of practice will no longer be legal in this State.  It is as simple as that.  The Bar will continue to exist and flourish, I have no doubt and I wish everyone well in that context because members of the Bar perform an extremely important role in providing legal services.  Despite some perceptions to contrary, I have the greatest of respect for lawyers in both professions who have great expertise, who do very interesting and challenging work and who perform a very important role in protecting the rights of individuals.  However, protecting the rights of individuals has nothing to do with maintaining restrictive practices that developed in the 1800s.  We live in a different world.  It is unfortunate that there is a need to maintain two rolls.  It would have been helpful if there could have been a single roll of barristers, whether they were formerly members of the Law Library or not.  Ideally, barristers would be barristers and we would have a single roll, with some choosing to become members of the Law Library and those who are not members of the library practising as they deem appropriate, perhaps in the manner mentioned by Deputy McNamara.</p><p>  It would be preferable to have a single roll but I am advised that the Bar is not agreeable to maintaining a roll which includes members of the barrister's profession who are not members of the Law Library.  I personally think that is regrettable because whether one is a member of the Law Library or not, if one is a practising barrister who has graduated through the process of becoming a barrister, passed the exams and gone through all of the training then I do not see any particular reason why<b></b>we should need to maintain two separate rolls, but apparently we do.  I say that as a member of the solicitors' profession.  Since 1971 solicitors have been able to do advocacy work throughout the courts system as well as general solicitor's work.  Over the years, I was one of the very few solicitors who worked on a regular basis as an advocate in the higher courts.  There are many solicitors who do not want to engage that way and I fully appreciate and understand that.  There are many who act as advocates in the District Court but not in the other courts.  It is a matter of choice.  The Law Society did not feel the need to maintain some exclusive roll of solicitors who are advocates in the higher courts.  I do not understand why the membership of a library should determine whether one is excluded from a particular roll when one is a practising, qualified barrister who has gone through the King's Inns and acquired all of the relevant qualifications that entitle one to be recognised as a barrister.  Unfortunately, it appears to be the case that we have to maintain two rolls.</p></speech>

Let us be clear, not all barristers are fortunate to benefit from Government contracts but when the cost of a day in the High Court is prohibitive in terms of enabling people to get access to justice or to defend themselves against the State it become a major issue.  There is nothing in this Bill that deals with that.  The overwhelming public interest issue is how to significantly reduce the cost of pursuing justice.  Essentially what we have here is the Minister's passion, which is fair enough.  He is entitled to his passion and is a learned man with strong views on these matters.</p></speech>

One roll for both will be maintained by the regulatory authority, rather than one roll being maintained by the Bar Council.  I was inaccurate because I was thinking of an earlier issue.  That is the reason the regulatory authority, rather than the Bar Council, will maintain the roll.  I apologise if I gave the wrong information.  I was misinformed in a comment I had made about maintaining two rolls.  It goes back to a conversation I had about the fact that if we had not brought the whole thing into the regulatory authority, there would have been two rolls.  This was the solution to it.  The other side is that the Law Society will continue to maintain the roll for solicitors.  I would have preferred the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to do this.  The Bar Council could have maintained the roll, but in circumstances where we would have had two rolls, we brought the whole thing into the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.414" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/977" speakername="Michael McNamara" time="11:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014021200014#O00500"><p>That is welcome, but I have several questions.  The roll will be a public document that I imagine will be available on a website and certain details will be published of all barristers.  The details will further the objectives specified in section 9(4) which include informing the public of available legal services and maintaining competition.  I have no objection to any of this information being provided in respect of barriers, but I wonder whether additional information might also be useful.  Clearly, it is useful to know whether a barrister is a member of the Law Library or in the full-time service of the State, but I fear a consumer might think all barristers who are not in the full-time service of the State are available to act against the State.  On Second Stage I raised the issue that the Department of Justice and Equality requires undertakings not to act against the Minister in areas such as immigration and asylum.  I disagree with this policy because it offends the principle of an independent Bar, but the Bar Council has acquiesced to, if not agreed with, it.  Barristers will also be employed by banks and other companies to provide legal serves.  It is not reasonable to think such individuals would be available to act against their employers.  It might be useful to note on the roll whether an individual is specifically employed to provide legal services.  A significant number of members of the Law Library are precluded from acting against the Minister.  It would be useful to include that information on the roll because it would be vital for consumers.</p><p>  Some barristers will be available to be instructed by persons who are not solicitors.  This will be limited to non-contentious issues for the time being but not every barrister would wish to be approached by non-solicitors.  It would also be useful for the public to specify this on the roll.</p><p>  There may be a misapprehension that only barristers who are members of the Law Library are independent barristers who can take instruction from solicitors in villages and towns.  It might be useful to specify whether barristers are available to be instructed in contentious matters.  I do not refer to contentious matters for solicitors because I do not want to pre-empt the public consultation process envisaged in amendment No. 171.  Barristers who are employed or in the service of the State will not wish to be engaged or instructed in contentious matters.  I tabled the amendments in this context because I have to do so in order to submit them on Report Stage.</p></speech>

He raised an important issue.  It is one to which we have given some thought.  It is interesting, arising from our deliberations, that an issue arises regarding whether we bring forward additional provisions and amendments to this provision on Report Stage having teased it out further, which we want to do.  The Deputy will see that the proposed section 76(5) states: "The Authority may, having regard to the objectives specified in section 9(4), prescribe additional information in relation to the professional qualifications and areas of expertise of the practising barrister concerned that is to be contained in an entry on the roll".  That will give the authority some discretion in determining what additional information might be included.</p><p>  I can see advantages in providing on Report Stage for the express inclusion of some of the matters the Deputy has raised and, arising from his contribution, I have a particular concern that we may also need to consider in this context.  Subsection (4)(b) relates to subsection (5) in the context of the specification of whether a person is a member of the Law Library and in the full-time service of the State.  In the circumstances of barristers who are not full-time members of the Law Library and where members of the public may not understand the nuances of whether one is a member of the Law Library, on reflection I have a concern that a member of the public who, for example, wanted to approach a barrister directly on a non-contentious matter might have a less favourable view of barristers who were not members of the Law Library.  He or she may think it a black mark against them.  It is important that the information is available, but it is also important that the manner in which it is made available does not result in the wrong conclusions being drawn about the expertise of others and their capacity to undertake particular legal work.</p><p>  I thank the Deputy for raising this issue.  The reason for including subsection (5) was that I was troubled about whether everything that needed to be incorporated on the roll had been designated and I thought it was important for the Legal Services Regulatory Authority to reflect on this.  Such a reflection would also be relevant to the consultative process in which it must engage.  We will re-examine the subsection before Report Stage and if members have a particular amendment they would like to suggest to us prior to Report Stage, as opposed to it being an issue that arises on the day, I would welcome it.</p></speech>

Logically, this section should commence with the establishment of the authority.  Why is a separate commencement date envisaged?  </p><p>  The Minister referred to a levy in his introduction to the amendments under Part 8.  I presume there will be a cost in being entered on the roll of barristers.</p> <p>Will the cost be the same for all barristers, regardless of whether they are sole practitioners working in or outside of the Law Library, in the employ of the State, etc.?  Will the Minister consider something similar to section 51 of the Legal Services Act 2007 in the UK, which provides that fees can be applied to certain permitted purposes and only to them?  These are set out.  As I explained when I raised this on Second Stage, my concern is that the great majority of barristers will practise in the Law Library while others will come together in various configurations outside it.  However, to become a barrister, all of them must do a pupillage or devil for somebody in the same way all solicitors have to serve an apprenticeship.  The reality is people will not do pupillages in the Minister's office or the Attorney General's office or in banks or in-house.  If chambers are established, they may end up doing pupillages in them.</p><p> In fairness to the Bar Council and Law Library, they have made great efforts to ensure everybody from the King's Inns can do a pupillage and that maintains wide access to the profession, which is an important aspect of competition.  I do not say pupils should be paid but they are not paid.  Nevertheless they incur the costs of living and it would be detrimental if only those whose parents can afford to support them can do pupillages.  It would be similarly unfair if members of the Law Library were to bear all the cost of pupillages, which are essential to accessing the profession.  Those who benefit from the system would then go in-house.  Perhaps there is room for a levy to be imposed on all practising barristers which would then be used to pay pupils.  It is a proposition.  I agree entirely with the Minister's proposals to open up the Bar but I am afraid of any unintended consequence.  While the configurations in which people could practise will be more widespread, access to the profession could be narrowed because members of the Law Library would be the only ones bearing the cost of pupils.</p><p> The Minister also mentioned the anomaly regarding the UK firm which wished to established itself here and had a barrister lined up to employ.  Perhaps I am misreading section 116(4) which states, "In this section employment includes part-time employment but does not include employment by a solicitor".  Does that maintain the anomaly?</p><p> I refer to the issue of a representative body.  The Bar Council, as it is entitled to do, has declined to register non-members of the Law Library.  Perhaps it is not that straightforward because its constitution requires it to.  The constitution also states the council represents the Bar of Ireland.  The Bar of England and Wales represents all of the Bar of England and Wales whether people are sole practitioners, of which there are relatively few, in chambers or in the Crown Prosecution Service.  A body to represent the entire profession is useful.  Freedom of association means that the council can accept whichever members it wishes and dissociate itself from whomever it wishes.  I am a little sceptical about having to quote "The Life of Brian" but it is like the Judean People's Liberation Front and the People's Liberation Front of Judea.  It is useful to have one body to represent all barristers because the representation of those at the Bar is an important aspect of the administration of justice and the council is in a unique position to promote certain values, the rule of law, which it consistently maintains, human rights, etc.  That is perhaps less an issue for the Minister than for the council itself.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.427" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="11:50:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014021200015#P01100"><p>I am conscious that we are in a time of change and organisations have difficulties with change.  I hope that when we move from enacting the Bill, the legal services regulatory authority is in place and change has been effected, in two or three years the Law Society will represent all practising solicitors and the Bar Council will represent all practising barristers, be they members of the Law Library or not and the disparate elements within each profession in the context of their engagements in providing legal services and the manner in which they engage with the public will appropriately feed into the policy dimensions and an approach will be taken by the two professional organisations to issues when they arise.  There is a huge benefit in that because the alternative is the establishment of other organisations and they will spend half their time cannibalising each other rather than focusing outwardly on issues which are genuinely of benefit to society and their own members.  However, I cannot address those internal issues.</p><p>  On the issue of a separate commencement date, it is envisaged that there will be a six-month period following enactment during which the authority will have to establish the new roll.  We cannot have a situation where the roll cannot be applied while the new roll must be established and there is no roll.  This is purely a mechanical, administrative issue.  Like everything else, we are open to suggestions in that context.</p><p>  It is envisaged that all barristers on the roll will contribute to the levy.  I am conscious that the levy has to be set by the authority based on the principles prescribed in the Bill, which seek also to have regard to the differentiation between the numbers of solicitors and barristers and the nature of the engagement by solicitors and barristers with disciplinary issues.  It will be open to the authority to take a view regarding how a levy might be dealt with <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i> young, recently qualified members of the legal profession who may be earning little income and others.  There are issues to be dealt with.</p><p>  On the issue of employment of barristers, let us say the legislation is enacted and we have dealt with regulatory issues and a employee barrister is employed by a firm of solicitors, there would be nothing to prevent him or her from doing contentious work but he or she would only be able to do it because he or she had been instructed by the solicitor in the firm.</p> <p>There will be an employee barrister who will be able to appear in court on a regular basis and will represent clients of that firm.  It will be open to that firm to decide that on issues in which it has no engagement, that barrister might do other work - I do not know.  However, he or she would need to be instructed by solicitors where it is contentious work.  There is the regulatory oversight and there are issues to be addressed by the legal services regulatory authority during the consultative process.  It is not my understanding, nor is it intended in the Bill, that if a barrister is employed as an employee within a solicitor's firm, he or she is only there part time.</p><p> Coming back to a discussion I had with Deputy Mac Lochlainn earlier, it is also not envisaged that barristers who become employees in a solicitors' firms would remain in such positions for the rest of their days.  As with anybody else who is employed, they would be employed on some basis and if they decide they want to go back and operate out of the Law Library, it is assumed that they will do so.  It is also assumed that there would be no code of practice that would prohibit or prevent them from doing that and that no new restrictive practices would be introduced that could defeat the purpose of the legislation.  Solicitors are to some extent in a better position than barristers.  Solicitors are still instructed by individuals from all around the country, depending on whether they have particular areas of expertise.  It is quite odd that although a solicitor can at the moment do all the solicitor's work and all the barrister's work, and nobody is suggesting that this attacks the independence of solicitors or undermines the administration of justice, there is a suggestion coming from some quarters that if a barrister were employed within a solicitor's firm or if a solicitor were a partner with a barrister, that might undermine the system of justice and the independence of the legal profession.  It makes no sense, but it is an indicator of the extent to which there is discomfort with change.  In a profession in which there has been so little change for more than a hundred years, I understand there is a natural resistance to change.  Sometimes there is too much focus on trying to identify all the reasons for having no change or reform, rather than trying to identify the benefits of change.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1025" speakername="Alan Shatter" time="12:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014021200016#Q00300"><p>That is a really important issue.  As Deputies know, the legislation contains a separate provision allowing the legal services regulatory authority to review the area of legal education and what changes might need to be effected to ensure that the doors are kept open and to ensure that those who wish to become a member of either profession can to do so and that nothing impedes that.  The legislation contains very specific provisions with regard to our system of legal education, which has been run well.  This is where there has been evolution on behalf of the Bar and the solicitors' profession in the increased sophistication of lectures, studies and training provided to people who wish to become either a solicitor or a barrister.  That is the area in which there has been change over the years.  The competition between the Law Society and the Honourable Society of the King's Inns in the type of legal training they provide has helped to contribute to ensuring that its excellence has improved over the years.</p><p>  However, there has not been an overarching examination of the provision of legal education in Ireland.  Can it be accessed generally or do any sections of society have difficulty in accessing it?  Are any structural changes needed?  For example, as happens in England - I am not sure whether this is either desirable or necessary in Ireland because we are a much smaller jurisdiction - should the universities be licensed to have some remit in providing professional training for either profession?  Before everybody gets excessively excited and thinks this is something I am advocating, I am not necessarily advocating it.  I am very familiar with the system in England.  It is necessary because of the extent of the population.  I know the Law Society experimented with providing legal studies in Cork and it did not prove economically viable.  Therefore, I am not sure there is a necessity for anything of that nature.  However, it is a good idea for us to request the legal services regulatory authority to carry out an overview of educational matters.</p><p>  In that context, I very much value the work done by both of the professional bodies in providing continuing legal education for the qualified members of both professions.  I particularly welcome one development.  Towards the end of last year I corresponded with the Law Society and the Honourable Society of the King's Inns.  This is something that is important and comes out of the independent legal professions in consultation with an independent Judiciary, as opposed to coming from the Department of Justice and Equality.  I invited them to consider the creation of a course for qualified barristers and solicitors in judicial training, a course for members of the legal profession who aspire to become judges in the future or those who have no interest in becoming judges but who are regular advocates in the courts and would like to get a greater insight into the judicial function - for example, how judges approach cases, or the type of evidence they believe is helpful in clarifying issues.  I invited both the Law Society and the Honourable Society of the King's Inns to consider whether they would either individually or collaboratively consider establishing such a course.  I publicly welcome the positive response I received from the Honourable Society of the King's Inns, which, I understand, is engaging in a consultative process with the Judiciary with a view to establishing such a course.  As I understand it, it would be a course available as an option in which practising lawyers could participate.  I believe it would be very valuable if we moved on in the context of training.  At the moment a judge gets judicial training after appointment.  It would be an extra, valuable link in the chain for practising lawyers who may consider at some stage in their career applying to the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board to be appointed to the courts if they had some opportunity - with, I would very much hope, a substantial input from the Judiciary - to engage in this type of course.  I very much look forward to seeing how this matter develops.</p></speech>

The adjudication process will determine the appropriate costs to be paid.</p><p> To make it easier for the committee to deal with this part, any section proposed for amendment is presented in its fully revised state rather than as a series of individual amendments.  I will set out what each section in Part 9 provides and what changes, if any, are proposed.</p><p> Amendment No. 177 refers to section 80.  This is a standard interpretation section to describe and delimit key terminology in the Part.  It has been slightly reworked from the original for the sake of clarity.  During the long consultation analysis period following publication of the Bill, new definitions, including those of disbursements and contentious business, were found to be necessary.  These have been inserted into the text we have today.</p><p> Section 81 is a technical provision to enable the redesignation of the Taxing Master's office as the office of the legal costs adjudicators.  This new office will have an increased capacity for making adjudications and will be headed by a chief legal costs adjudicator who will have certain core functions which I will outline as we go along.</p><p> Section 82 is a key section, representing as it does the twin policy imperatives of transparency and modernisation.  The new chief legal costs adjudicator will be obliged to keep a publicly examinable register of determinations.  This register will bring to light the decisions made by the legal costs adjudicators and the reason for these decisions.  It is my belief and expectation this register will make a valuable contribution to competition in the legal services marketplace.  As legal cost adjudications will be a quasi-judicial function in the Courts Service apparatus, it is appropriate that adjudications would be published and explained within reasonable limits so as not to breach confidentiality rules or overburden the office with bureaucracy.</p><p> Section 83 is new and provides clarity on the long-standing policy intention that while the new office of the legal costs adjudicator will replace the current Taxing Master's office, the <i>status quo </i>will continue with regard to county registrars and their existing and limited taxation functions.  The only change regarding county registrars is that in maintaining their existing functions, they will be required to keep a register of their determinations and will in their own adjudications be guided by the principles relating to legal costs set out in Schedule 1.</p><p> Section 84 is a much improved upon section 83 of the Bill as published.  This section provides that guidelines will be prepared by the chief legal costs adjudicator to the benefit of anyone making an application to the office setting out how the process works and what is required.  I should point out the reference to the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government as one of the persons to be consulted on the guidelines comes about as result of Ireland's obligations under the Aarhus Convention which seeks to ensure access to justice on environmental matters is not prohibitively expensive.</p><p> Section 85 on the review of scales of fees is new.  It came to my attention recently that Appendix W to the Rules of the Superior Courts, which sets out certain scales of fees for specified legal services, is irregularly updated.  I propose to provide that the Superior Court Rules committee, whenever it considers it appropriate to do so but at least every two years, would review and update Appendix W in line with the new cost principles set out in Schedule 1 of the Bill.</p><p> Amendment No. 183 of the Bill provides for a new section 86 which, along with the unamended sections 85 and 86 from the original Bill, will help to modernise the operation of what is currently the Taxing Master's office.  The new office of legal costs adjudicators will be required to be run in a more businesslike and transparent fashion in the framework of a strategic plan, an annual business plan and an annual report to be laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas together with the annual report of the Courts Service.  I have ensured since publication that the powers of the Minister to influence and approve strategic plans have been removed from the text of section 86.  They are now purely a matter for the chief legal costs adjudicator and the chief executive officer of the Courts Service.</p><p> The final amendment in this group is amendment No. 184 which relates to section 88.  It provides for the substitution of the Taxing Master's office with the office of the legal costs adjudicators, and makes provision for a chief legal costs adjudicator and his or her terms of appointment along with those of other legal costs adjudicators.  The key amendment is the deletion of previous references to bankruptcy and arrangements with creditors as a disqualification from holding office as the legal costs adjudicator.  It is possible I will, on Report Stage, also revise the length of term of appointment for a legal costs adjudicator, which may not be entirely satisfactory.  It stands at a five year term which is non-renewable.  Having reflected on this, I am concerned the term may be too short and that by making it non-renewable, substantial good practice and expertise could be lost to the office and to the important work undertaken, and that continuity has a particular and important role to play.  I want to reflect on how we further enhance the office and on how we address this issue in circumstances in which I am concerned if someone is appointed to the office, it should not necessarily be, and it is not necessarily in the public interest that it would be, a lifetime appointment, but I am also concerned to ensure the office is entirely independent and there is no suggestion the Minister of the day, or a Minister who may be unhappy with an adjudication, could in any way interfere with the workings of the office or exercise some discretion with regard to whether, if the appointment was for a five year period or longer, somebody's appointment should be renewed.  I am giving some consideration as to how best to deal with this matter pending Report Stage.</p></speech>

and 34, to insert the following:<b>&quot;Legal practitioner to provide notice of conduct of matter, costs, etc.</b><br /><b>90. </b>(1) A legal practitioner shall, whenever required to do so under this section, provide to his or her client a notice (in this section referred to as a &ldquo;notice&rdquo;) written in clear language that is likely to be easily understood by the client and that otherwise complies with this section.<br />(2) On receiving instructions from a client, a legal practitioner shall provide the client with a notice which shall--<blockquote>(a) disclose the legal costs that will be incurred in relation to the matter concerned, or<br />(b) if it is not reasonably practicable for the notice to disclose the legal costs at that time, set out the basis on which the legal costs are to be calculated.</blockquote>(3) Where <i>subsection (2)(b) </i>applies, the legal practitioner concerned shall, as soon as may be after it becomes practicable to do so, provide to the client a notice containing the information specified in <i>subsection (2)(a)</i>.<br />(4) A notice shall:<blockquote>(a) subject to <i>subsection (2)(b)</i>, specify the amount of legal costs--<blockquote>(i) certified by the legal practitioner as having been incurred as at the date on which the notice is provided,<br />(ii) certified by the legal practitioner to be of a fixed nature or otherwise certain to be incurred (or if it would be impracticable for the legal practitioner to so certify, the basis on which they are to be charged), and<br />(iii) insofar as is practicable, certified by the legal practitioner to be likely to be incurred;</blockquote>(b) specify the amount of value-added tax to be charged in respect of the amounts referred to in <i>paragraph (a)</i>;<br />(c) set out the basis on which the amounts were or are to be calculated, explained by reference to the matters set out in <i>paragraph 2 of Schedule 1</i>;<br />(d) contain a statement of the legal practitioner&rsquo;s obligation under <i>subsection (5)</i>;<br />(e) if the matter which is the subject of the notice involves or is likely to involve litigation, provide--<blockquote>(i) an outline of the work to be done in respect of each stage of the litigation process and the costs or likely costs or basis of costs involved in respect of each such stage, including the likelihood of engaging a barrister, expert witnesses, or providers of other services,<br />(ii) a statement of the legal practitioner&rsquo;s obligation under <i>subsection (6)</i>,<br />(iii) information as to the likely legal and financial consequences of the client&rsquo;s withdrawal from the litigation and its discontinuance, and<br />(iv) information as to the circumstances in which the client would be likely to be required to pay the costs of one or more other parties to the litigation, and information as to the circumstances in which it would be likely that the costs of the legal practitioner would not be fully recovered from other parties to the litigation;</blockquote>(f) specify a period, which shall be not longer than 10 working days, for the purposes of <i>subsection (7)</i>.</blockquote>(5) Where the legal practitioner becomes aware of any factor that would make the legal costs likely to be incurred in a matter significantly greater than those disclosed or indicated in a notice relating to that matter provided under this section, he or she shall, as soon as may be after he or she becomes aware of that factor, provide the client concerned with a new notice.<br />(6) Where a matter which is the subject of a notice under this section involves or is likely to involve litigation, the legal practitioner shall not, in relation to that matter, engage a barrister, expert witness or provider of any other service without first, to the extent practicable--<blockquote>(a) ascertaining the likely cost or basis of cost of engaging the person,<br />(b) providing the client with the information referred to in <i>paragraph (a)</i>, and<br />(c) having complied with <i>paragraph (b)</i>, satisfying himself or herself of the client&rsquo;s approval (whether express or implied) of the engaging of the person.</blockquote>(7) A legal practitioner shall not, during the period referred to in <i>subsection (4)(f) </i>that is specified in a notice, provide any legal services in relation to the matter concerned, unless--<blockquote>(a) the client concerned confirms that he or she wishes to instruct the legal practitioner to continue to provide legal services in connection with the matter concerned, or<br />(b) <i>subsection (8) </i>applies.</blockquote>(8) A legal practitioner to whom <i>subsection (7) </i>applies shall, notwithstanding that subsection, provide legal services in relation to the matter concerned where--<blockquote>(a) in the professional opinion of the legal practitioner, not to provide those legal services would constitute a contravention of a statutory requirement or the rules of court or would prejudice the rights of the client in a manner that could not later be remedied,<br />(b) a court orders the legal practitioner to provide legal services to the client, or<br />(c) where the matter involves litigation, a notice of trial has been served in relation to the matter or a date has been fixed for the hearing of the matter concerned.</blockquote>(9) The legal practitioner shall provide his or her client with clarification in relation to a notice, as soon as is reasonably practicable after having been requested to do so by the client.<br />(10) Where a solicitor, having received instructions from a client in relation to a matter, proceeds to instruct a barrister in relation to that matter--<blockquote>(a) an obligation on the barrister under this section to provide a notice shall be fulfilled where the barrister provides the notice concerned to the solicitor,<br />(b) a duty owed by the barrister under <i>subsection (6)</i>, <i>(7) </i>or <i>(9) </i>to his or her client shall be construed as a duty owed by the barrister to the solicitor, and<br />(c) the solicitor concerned shall--<blockquote>(i) where he or she considers it appropriate, or where requested to do so by the client, request the barrister to provide clarification in relation to a notice provided by the barrister, and<br />(ii) immediately on receipt of a notice referred to in <i>paragraph (a) </i>or the clarification referred to in <i>subparagraph (i)</i>, provide that notice or clarification to the client. &quot;.</blockquote></blockquote></blockquote>Section 89 of the published Bill is unamended except for a tiny typographical change.  It continues the existing prohibition on solicitors charging fees based on percentages of damages due to the client and it applies to barristers in addition.  It also prohibits the automatic deduction of legal costs from damages or other awards.  An innovation of this Bill is the prohibition on the charging by barristers of legal costs that are based on crude calculations of the value of junior counsel as a two thirds or other proportion of senior counsel's fees.</p></speech>

It is being revised by the drafters to improve the flow and clarity of the text.  It incorporates the best aspects of the existing section 68 of the Solicitors (Amendment) Act 1994 in respect of the obligation on solicitors to provide their clients with written fees estimates and makes significant improvements upon it.  This is a key and innovative section in the Bill as regards legal costs transparency and will also apply for the first time to barristers.  It sets out that legal practitioners will have to provide clients with a written legal cost notice written in clear language that is likely to be easily understood by the client.  Such notice will set out either the legal costs that will be incurred or, if that is initially impossible to know due to the presence of variables, it will set out the basis on which legal costs are to be calculated.  Factors such as the stages in the litigation process, cost of outside expertise, financial consequences for the client and withdrawing or losing the case are all to be covered where relevant.  In addition, the legal practitioner will be under an obligation to inform the client of any emerging factor that would significantly add to the estimated cost for the client and a new notice will have to be provided.  A ten-day cooling off period is allowed and, as an added protection for clients, legal practitioners may not engage counsel, expert witnesses or other service providers without first gaining confirmation from the client.  Legal practitioners will also be obliged to provide any clarification in respect of the notice whenever so requested.</p><p>  Section 91 allows legal practitioners and their clients to make agreements as to fees for services.  This is a continuation of the <i>status quo</i>.  The text has been enhanced since publication to make it clear that such agreements may still be amenable to adjudication by the legal costs adjudicator where appropriate.</p><p>  Section 92 is another transparency-related section.  It sets out in detail all the constituent items to be included by a legal practitioner in the final bill of costs provided to the client.  It will describe in the form of an itemised statement the legal services provided, the time spent and other relevant factors.  It has been enhanced since publication to ensure that any fee-related agreement between the legal practitioner and the client is set out clearly in writing.  It also sets out the preliminary steps in respect of the communication and resolution of any disputed item.  It allows barristers to provide their bills of cost through the solicitor concerned, who shall provide them to the client immediately upon receipt.</p><p>  Section 93 places an obligation on legal practitioners to attempt to resolve disputes around legal costs with their clients before resorting to making a formal application to the legal costs adjudicator.  This is in keeping with the Bill's desire to encourage mediation and other informal resolution avenues.  In support of this, the section also provides a new clock-stopping mechanism whereby the time taken in attempting to resolve a dispute is disregarded within the timeframe for making an application to the legal costs adjudicator.</p><p>  Regarding Opposition amendment No. 189, I note Deputy Collins's absence, but perhaps I will nevertheless address it.  Deputy Collins's proposed amendment is based on section 76 of the Finance Act 1982, which inserted a new section 5(4A) into the VAT Act 1972.  It provides that VAT is payable on fees for services even where the supplier of the service is not legally entitled to recover payment of the fees.  The effect of it is that VAT has been payable on barristers' fees since September 1982.  As this part of the Bill's amendments do not impinge on the VAT regime, I am not willing to accept the Deputy's amendment.  As I understand it, because barristers are not legally entitled to sue for fees payable to them, the Revenue Commissioners have accepted in practice that VAT on barristers' fees is payable upon receipt of the fee by the barrister rather than by reference to the date when the fee note is issued to an instructing solicitor.  I have received submissions from interested parties asking me to ensure that the Revenue Commissioners continue to treat barristers' fees in this way in the event that a provision is inserted in the Bill to allow them to sue for their fees.  I do not, as Minister for Justice and Equality, have the jurisdiction to dictate to Revenue how it should treat any category of taxpayer.  Moreover, the Bill does not yet provide that barristers can sue for their fees.  So, amendment No. 189 would be premature and may yet be irrelevant.  While a provision to recover barristers' fees is being considered for insertion on Report Stage, the appropriate wording has not yet been found in conjunction with advisory and Parliamentary Counsel.  I would also point out that the legislation that the Deputy refers to only places an obligation on barristers to pay VAT.  It does not provide for the specific treatment of the VAT concerned.  In these circumstances, the amendment would not do what the Deputy presumably wishes it to achieve.</p><p>  Quite clearly, if we are to have provisions in the Bill that allow for direct access by members of the public to members of the Bar for non-contentious business and there are other possibilities depending on the outcome of the consultative process, in fairness to barristers it will be important that there is a clear provision to ensure that, should a barrister undertake work on behalf of a member of the public and not be paid for that work, in the absence of a solicitor being part of the relationship the barrister can properly sue to recover fees properly due to the barrister.  Indeed, if the legislation were not to address that issue adequately, it would leave a very major lacuna in the legislation that would be inappropriate.</p></speech>

url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUS2014021200019#U00300"><p>I move amendment No. 190:<blockquote><br />In page 80, between lines 35 and 36, to insert the following:<br /><b>&ldquo;Application for adjudication of legal costs</b></blockquote><b>94.</b>  (1)  In a case where a person is ordered by a court, tribunal or other body to pay, in whole or in part, the legal costs of another person, the person whose legal costs are to be paid by reason of that order shall furnish a bill of costs to the person who is the subject of the order to pay the legal costs, in a form and manner consistent with﻿&mdash;<br />(a)the terms of the order,<br />(b)this Act, and<br />(c)any rules of court relating to the preparation and furnishing of bills of costs in a case to which this subsection refers.<br />(2)Where a person who is the subject of the order to pay costs receives a bill of costs prepared in accordance with <i>subsection (1)</i>, that person may, having attempted to agree the bill of costs with the person referred to in <i>subsection (1)</i>, apply to the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator for adjudication on any matter or item claimed in the bill of costs.<br />(3)Where a person in whose favour the order to pay costs has been made issues a bill of costs prepared in accordance with <i>subsection (1)</i>, that person, having attempted to resolve any dispute regarding the bill of costs with the person who is the subject of the order, may apply to the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator for the bill of costs or any matter or item in the bill of costs to be adjudicated upon.<br />(4)Where a legal practitioner provides a bill of costs in accordance with <i>section 92*</i> to his or her client and the client considers that any matter or item or the amount charged in respect of any matter or item in the bill of costs is not properly chargeable, taking account of the provisions of this Act, and any rules of court relating to costs payable to legal practitioners by clients, the client may apply to the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator for the bill of costs or any matter or item in the bill of costs to be adjudicated upon.<br />(5)   (a)Where a legal practitioner provides a bill of costs in accordance with <i>section 92*</i> to his or her client and the bill of costs or any part thereof remains unpaid on the expiry of a period of 30 days from the date on which the bill of costs was provided, the legal practitioner may apply to the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator for the bill of costs or any matter or item in the bill of costs to be adjudicated upon.<br />(b)Where a barrister has, in accordance with <i>section 92(8)*</i>, provided a bill of costs to a solicitor, and the bill of costs or any part thereof remains unpaid on the expiry of a period of 30 days from the date on which the bill of costs was provided, the solicitor concerned may, with the consent of the barrister, apply to the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator for the bill of costs or any matter or item in the bill of costs to be adjudicated upon.<br />(c)An application to the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator pursuant to <i>paragraph (a)</i> or <i>(b)</i> may not be made after the expiry of 12 months after the date on which the bill of costs concerned was provided to the client under <i>section 92*</i>.<br />(6)Where the legal practitioner applies for adjudication pursuant to <i>subsection (5)</i>, the legal practitioner shall indicate whether or not he or she is aware of any dispute regarding an item in the bill of costs and if so aware the matter to which the dispute relates.<br />(7)Subject to <i>subsection (8)</i>, an application to the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator by a client pursuant to <i>subsection (4)</i> may not be made after the expiry of 6 months after the date on which bill of costs concerned was provided to the client under <i>section 92*</i>, or 3 months from the date of payment of the bill of costs, whichever first occurs, so long as the bill of costs is in a form and manner consistent with﻿&mdash;<br />(a)this Act, and<br />(b)any rules of court relating to the preparation and provision of bills of costs by a legal practitioner to a client.<br />(8)Where a bill of costs has been provided by a legal practitioner to his or her client and the legal practitioner has agreed to accept a lesser amount in discharge of the bill of costs which lesser amount is paid, neither the legal practitioner nor the client may make an application to the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator for adjudication of the bill of costs under this section.<br />(9)A legal practitioner who has provided a bill of costs in accordance with <i>section 92*</i> to his or her client may apply <i>ex parte</i> to the High Court or to a Legal Costs Adjudicator for the abridgement of the period of 30 days referred to in <i>subsection (5)</i> and, where it appears that it is just to do so, the Court or the Legal Costs Adjudicator, as appropriate, may grant an abridgement of that period.<br />(10)Rules of court may make provision for﻿&mdash;<br />(a)the giving of notice of the application for adjudication to other parties or to such other persons as the Chief Legal Costs Adjudicator shall direct,<br />(b)the furnishing of documents, records and vouchers to the Chief Legal Costs SECTION 94 Adjudicator or to other parties to the adjudication,<br />(c)the circumstances and manner in which written submissions are to be provided for the purposes of an adjudication, and<br />(d)the steps that may constitute an attempt, by a person referred to in <i>subsection (2)</i> or <i>(3)</i>, to agree a bill of costs, and the certification by a Legal Costs Adjudicator that the person has made such an attempt.<br />(11)An application under this section shall be in a form specified by rules of court or, as the case may be, under <i>section 105(1)</i>.&rdquo;.<br />This amendment relates to section 94 and provides for applications for the adjudication of legal costs to a legal costs adjudicator.  It is primarily intended to make improvements to the flow and practical workability of the section.  The key amendment is found in subsection (5) which now includes subparagraphs that provide for a solicitor to make an application to the adjudicator in relation to a bill of costs provided by a barrister, which bill remains unpaid in whole or in part by their mutual client.  This is in recognition of the fact that usually the business flows from the client to the solicitor to the barrister and not directly from the client to the barrister.  Therefore, it makes sense that the solicitor should be able to make applications where this is the case.  This will not be true in all cases as there is some direct access to barristers by clients such as architects, engineers, etc.  Subsection (10) includes a couple of small additions to allow for rules of court to provide for the manner in which written submissions may be provided and the steps that may constitute an attempt to agree a bill of costs before having recourse to the adjudicator.<br /><b></b>On section 95,<b></b>some duplication has been removed and some minor improvements are being made to the text.  The section continues to provide for the matters to be ascertained by the adjudicator in the course of an adjudication such as what work was actually undertaken by the legal practitioner, what would constitute a reasonable fee for that work, how long it took to do the work and whether it was appropriate in the circumstances that a charge was made for the work concerned.<br /><b></b>Section 96 provides for the powers of the legal costs adjudicator to inspect documents, summon and examine witnesses, apply to the High Court for the enforcement of a summons and to adjourn hearings so that disputes may be referred to mediation or another informal resolution process, where appropriate.  A new addition to the section, which had been intended at the time of publication of the Bill, is a provision that adjudications shall continue to be held in public unless the adjudicator is of the opinion that it is in the interests of justice that part or all of the hearing should be held<i> in camera. </i> Discretion is also being given to the adjudicator to conduct an adjudication without an oral hearing where it is expedient and in the interests of justice, but only with the consent of the parties.</p><p>  The Chairman will have received a note from the Bills Office in relation to changes that had to be made to cross references within<b></b>section 97<b>.  </b>I trust those references are now in order.  The section provides a detailed framework for the hearing and determination of legal costs adjudications.  It includes a provision that the determinations will be made subject to the legal costs principles set out in the Schedule.  It provides that fees for disbursements and other fees must be furnished with receipts and other documentary evidence and that any item not previously flagged to the client in the notice of costs will not generally be chargeable by the legal practitioner.  In a departure from the current taxation process, the section also provides that the adjudicator shall write a report of the adjudication, setting out his or her reasons for the determination upon the request of a party or where it is considered to be in the interests of justice.  The latter is intended to bring greater transparency and consistency to the legal costs process. <br /><b></b>Section 98 provides for the effect of a legal costs adjudicator&rsquo;s determination, including a modernised version of the long established, so-called &ldquo;one-sixth rule&rdquo; whereby the costs of the adjudication process will be charged against any legal practitioner who is found to have issued a bill of costs that is determined by the adjudicator to be at least 15% higher than it should be.  I have received written representations from lawyers&rsquo; representatives asking me to increase that margin to at least 20% but I am of the view that 15% is appropriate and fair, representing as it does a less than 2% tightening of the traditional margin.  The key amendments being made to this section are: the insertion of a 20-day grace period before the adjudicator&rsquo;s determination becomes final, which I will discuss further later; an amendment to clarify that the 15% rule applies only to legal costs charged by a legal practitioner to his or her own client, as opposed to &ldquo;party &amp;amp; party&rdquo; costs; and the insertion of a new subsection to allow for the costs of the adjudication to be offset against the aggregate amount owed to the legal practitioner as determined by the adjudicator.</p><p>  The possibility of a referral of a question of law to the High Court in the original section 99 remains unamended.  Section 100 is entirely new and is inserted here to reflect current practice in the Taxing Master&rsquo;s office whereby an objections procedure allows the Taxing Master to briefly reconsider disputed legal costs determinations.  This is a commonsense filtering mechanism which works well in practice and helps to keep the number of referrals to the High Court lower than they would otherwise be.  This, of course, is desirable.  Parties seeking to utilise this mechanism must do so within 14 days of the determination, thus ensuring that proceedings are not drawn out.<br /><b></b>Section 101 provides for a review of a determination of a legal costs adjudicator.  This is a slightly amended version of the original section 100 of the Bill as published.  The key change is a change in terminology from &quot;appeal&quot; to &quot;review&quot; to accurately reflect the process intended by this section, which gives the court power to confirm the determination of the adjudicator, to remit the matter to the adjudicator for another determination in line with the court&rsquo;s decision or to substitute its own determination for that of the adjudicator.  The only other change is the insertion of a new subsection (5) to carry over the &quot;test&quot; already provided for in section 27 of the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995, but inadvertently omitted from this Bill, whereby the High Court must first be satisfied that an adjudicator has erred in his or her determination to the extent that it is unjust before the High Court will allow a review of that determination.</p><p>  The original sections 101 and 102 in relation to privilege and the power for the chief legal costs adjudicator to specify the form of documents required for the purposes of this Part, have not been amended.  Sections 106 to 109, inclusive, of the original Bill are standard, transitional provisions to ensure a smooth hand-over from the Taxing Master&rsquo;s office to the new office of the legal costs adjudicator.  The only amendments here are found in section 106 and are purely technical in nature.<br /><b></b>Amendment No. 198 is the final amendment.<b></b>Schedule 1 of the Bill provides for the principles relating to legal costs to be applied by legal costs adjudicators when making determinations on disputed bills of costs.  The key principles are that only those costs that have been reasonably incurred and are reasonable in amount will be permitted.  In considering what might constitute a &quot;reasonable amount&quot;, the adjudicators will consider a number of relevant factors, including, for example: the complexity and difficulty of the legal work concerned; any relevant skill or specialised knowledge applied; the amount of time and labour spent on the work; and the number and complexity of the documents that were required to be drafted or examined.  The key changes made to this Schedule from the published Bill are the deletion of subparagraph 1(c), which was recommended for deletion by those with expertise in the legal costs area, and the deletion of the original subparagraphs 2(l) and (m), which are considered unnecessary.  The latter have been replaced with a new subparagraph 2(l) to cover the use of outside expertise in the legal services provided and whether such costs were necessary and reasonable. </p></speech>

In circumstances where a member of the Bar was being directly consulted by a client, he or she should be able to recover fees.  I also regard it as an entirely anomalous and historical accident that if a member of the Bar has properly undertaken work on the instructions of a solicitor and he or she does not get paid, he or she is left effectively in limbo beyond making a complaint to the Law Society.  That is entirely inappropriate and unfair, although it might have been an interesting concept in the 1800s.  We are looking at how we can best address that.  I hope we will have an amendment on Report Stage.</p></speech>

While I know I said earlier that it is an extraneous issue - the VAT issue is a Revenue matter and is not for us - it is an issue in the context of people finding they are unexpectedly being levied for VAT for fees that they may never get paid.  There is an obvious issue that arises.  That is an issue that affects the professional work of people, not just in the Bar, as it could in these circumstances, but also in other areas.  As Minister for Justice and Equality, I cannot modify our VAT legislation.  However, we will look at how we might deal with this to ensure there are not unexpected or unintended consequences that impact on people.</p></speech>

It is important to use this forum to enable amendments that are suggested from outside this House to be teased out.  I would be of the view that simply because a Deputy is handed an amendment, it does not necessarily mean he or she should automatically table it.  It has been a very useful opportunity to tease through aspects of the Bill.  It is part of the process of ensuring we get the best possible legislation at the end of the day.</p><p>  I have already referred to some areas in which we will introduce further amendments on Report Stage.  In dealing with some issues on Report Stage, particularly dealing with limited liability issues we may need to recommit the Bill so that there is adequate time to discuss them.  I will also try to ensure that our Report Stage amendments are published in reasonable time so that people have an opportunity to consider them and consult on them.  They should have more than adequate opportunity to identify the issues on which they should kick me around, obviously in a constructive and helpful way so as to ensure that at the end of it all we get really good legislation.</p></speech>

The commissioners are accompanied by Mr. Ray Leonard, deputy director of investigations, Mr. Chris McGuire, analyst, and Ms Suzie Rafter, communications and research officer.  We are here today to discuss issues arising from reports of the unlawful surveillance of GSOC and the operation of the new protocols providing for enhanced co-operation between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC, which were agreed in September 2013.</p><p>  To ensure that mobile phone interference with the broadcasting equipment is kept to a minimum, I remind Members and those in the Public Gallery to switch their phones and tablets to aeroplane, safe or flight mode.  I ask everyone to do that now because this meeting will be broadcast live on the Oireachtas television channel and on the Internet.  </p><p>  Before we commence, I will remind everyone of the position on privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.   Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>  I now invite Commissioner O'Brien to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for its invitation to appear today.  As members are aware, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was previously before this committee on 3 July 2013.  On that occasion we discussed issues which had arisen regarding our capacity to properly investigate complaints alleging Garda misbehaviour.  More specifically, we reported at that time on what we felt were undue delays by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the provision of information relating to investigations.  The exchange of information between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and GSOC is essentially managed under agreed protocols drawn up under section 108 of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005, as amended.  Protocols had been in place between the two organisations since the commencement of GSOC's operation in 2007.  As outlined by us in July 2013, we were in negotiations with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na on the revision of these protocols.</p><p>  In our annual report for 2012 and in a section 85 report, which was laid before the Houses of the Oireachtas, we reported on the delays caused to our investigations and the non-compliance by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in terms of timeliness in the provision of information.  Since our appearance before this committee, revised protocols were agreed and signed off by me, as chairman of the commission, and by the Garda Commissioner on 23 September 2013.</p> <p>The operation of these revised protocols is a work in progress.  However, both organisations are actively working to ensure compliance through ongoing monitoring and review.  Indications are that some improvement in the system can be seen.  The commission is happy to discuss any matters on those issues with the committee today.</p><p> In the past week, as members will be aware, information relating to a specific security sweep was published without authorisation from this commission.  As a consequence of the publication, the focus on GSOC, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, and other agencies has been intense.  First, we would like to point out our unhappiness with the release of the contents of a secret document into the public domain.  The media coverage at the weekend took us all by surprise.  Since Sunday last, we have been briefing the Minister for Justice and Equality and the Garda Commissioner, dealing with press queries and so on.</p><p> As a direct result of the newspaper coverage on Sunday, I, as chairman of the commission, was called to see the Minister for Justice and Equality on Monday of this week.  Over two hours, I updated him on the situation.  I must point out there is an inaccuracy referenced in three separate places in a report that may come into the public domain.  I pointed out the presence of inaccuracies to the Minister.  I laid out to him that, in view of the amount of detail in the public domain last Sunday, the commission strongly suspects that a copy of a section of a report which is marked secret was possibly in the hands of a journalist.  I expressed my regret to the Minister that he had been blindsided by the appearance of this information in the media.</p><p> I must explain to the committee my clear recollection of the reasons and the thinking to retain Verrimus, the UK specialist company.  The final investigation report and the Verrimus documentation make reference to reasons for the sweep that do not accord with my recollection of those reasons.  This is a matter that I identified in my own notes shortly after receiving and considering the final investigation report.  I can only assume this arose because of a misunderstanding and I make no criticism of the authors.  However, I am categorical in my recollection of the reasons but it is, nevertheless, important in the interest of clarity that this is brought to the attention of the committee.</p><p> On Monday, we launched an internal inquiry to see how much information was in the public domain.  The three commissioners met the Secretary General on Tuesday afternoon to further update the position.  Later that afternoon, after a kind invitation from the Garda Commissioner, I met him privately in Garda headquarters to brief him.  He again had been blindsided by the release of this information.  He was understandably concerned and during our two-hour meeting I tried to allay his sense of grievance.  We have agreed that for the benefit of public confidence to ensure we continue to maintain and develop the relationship between our two organisations.  We both agreed to try to find a way through this crisis.</p><p> Last night, we felt the level of public discourse was such that we needed to appear in public to answer questions.  The commission was represented on &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; and that was another way to update the wider public on this series of unfolding events.</p><p> Why did we conduct this inquiry?  As a brief background, I will outline the work in which GSOC has been engaged for the past few years.  We were appointed in December 2011.  From the earliest days of our tenure, we were conscious that in the context of organisational risk management, it is prudent for the purposes of good governance that precautionary measures are utilised to allay fears of unauthorised penetration of assets, physical or electronic.  GSOC has, since its commencement of operations in 2007, taken seriously all aspects of its security and carries out ongoing testing, as well as reviewing, of its systems and procedures.  Part of this ongoing monitoring includes penetration testing of electronic systems and security sweeps.  The staging of these test procedures is sensitive and it is, therefore, closely guarded in the context of information control.  This, as members will appreciate, is a standard operating procedure for organisations holding sensitive data.</p><p> In the early days after our appointment, we decided that a security sweep of our building, which had not been undertaken since 2007, was something that we would undertake.  We did not progress this immediately at that time.  Security checks, albeit part of standard procedures, should always be predicated on the level of risk that exists at any time.  Risk assessment should be dynamic as time and circumstances change.  The work of GSOC is high profile.  The work we are engaged in can accrue great interest and it is wise to put risk assessment in that context.</p><p> Throughout 2012, we spent considerable time negotiating privately with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na around our operational protocols, addressing issues of timelines and other issues of interagency co-operation.  Towards the end of 2012, we took a strategic decision that we needed to air publicly some dissatisfaction with the level of co-operation we were getting from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  This resulted in us making very public comment around the publication of one report following a sensitive investigation.  For example, on 9 May 2013, we took the unusual step of submitting to the Minister a special report in accordance with section 80(5) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  That special report contained some highly critical comments on our relationship with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  A few weeks later, on 23 May 2013, we also made some further criticism of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na&rsquo;s adherence to our operational protocols in our annual report.  Members may recall that this committee invited us to attend to discuss these reports on 3 July 2013.  This was a level of publicity and controversy which was unusual for the commission.  In the context of this public profile, we did then have heightened concerns about confidentiality, particularly in light of some public discourse appearing to be exceptionally well-informed.  For that reason, consideration was given to the engagement of the Irish firm which had previously undertaken such a security sweep for this organisation.</p><p> When did we conduct this inquiry?  On 9 June 2013, contact was made with that Irish service provider but it was established the firm was no longer operational.  Further inquiries were made with oversight bodies similar to GSOC in Northern Ireland and England and Wales to establish whether a suitable resource to undertake this work existed.  On 3 September 2013, contact was made with a UK service provider.  On the basis of a recommendation of suitability, this UK firm, which specialises in technical surveillance counter measures, was engaged by GSOC.</p><p> How was the inquiry conducted?  On 23 to 27 September 2013, in accordance with standard operating procedures, a security sweep was conducted of GSOC&rsquo;s office.  The overall cost of the security checks undertaken in late 2013 was just under &euro;18,000.  As well as the general check of our building, the commission also sought expert advice on the sorts of capabilities that exist in the interception of ICT communications, including telephones.</p><p> What was found?  Two potential threats were identified during this security sweep from 23 to 27 September 2013.  The first threat was a wireless device located in the boardroom - the commission&rsquo;s conference room - which was found to have connected to an external Wi-Fi network.  Access to this wireless device was protected by a password.  Absent this password, the device should not have been able to connect to that external Wi-Fi network.  As GSOC does not have a Wi-Fi network, this device had never been activated by GSOC and its password was unknown.</p> <p>Its connection to an external network was, therefore, a concern.  This device, although Wi-Fi enabled, was unable to communicate with any of GSOC&rsquo;s databases or electronic systems.</p><p> As part of the security checks, the conference call telephone unit located in the chairman&rsquo;s office was subjected to a number of tests, one of which was an alerting test.  Immediately after this test, the conference phone line rang.  The security expert judged the likelihood of a wrong number being called at that time to that exact number was so small as to be virtually zero.  GSOC conducted a number of telecoms checks to seek to establish the source of this telephone call but was unable to do so.  Further checks revealed no additional anomalies or matters of concern.</p><p> On 7 October 2013, after confirmation paperwork was received from the specialist firm, the investigation team assessed these two threats.  On 8 October 2013, a public interest investigation was launched, pursuant to section 102(4) of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act 2005.  The investigation was launched on the basis that the acting director of investigations was of the opinion that, to the extent these threats could be proved, section 102(4) engaged.  This is to say such surveillance may have originated within An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, if so, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that justified disciplinary proceedings.  The investigation was launched in the public interest to ensure the objectives of GSOC, as set out in section 67(1) of the Act, were not compromised or impugned.</p><p> As part of that investigation, the specialist firm was re-engaged and a number of steps were undertaken, including accessing retained telecommunications.  During the course of the investigation, the specialists advised on the risks of interception to mobile telephony.  The commission established that commercial products were available that could, for example, intercept mobile phones, take them over and send and delete texts from them.</p><p> During a visit by the specialist firm on 19 and 20 October 2013, it detected a UK 3G network.  UK networks do not operate within Ireland, except in Border areas.  It advised that such a network could only be simulated through a specialist device.  The device simulated a UK mobile phone network which picks up UK phones registered with that network.  Once a phone has been connected, it can be forced to disable call encryption making the call data vulnerable to interception and recording.  The specialist firm indicated this level of technology was only available to Government agencies.</p><p> With regard to what the inquiry found, analysis of these threats was inconclusive.  GSOC was operating at the limits of its technical knowledge and on information only from security professionals.  The commission did not rule out that there could be reasonable explanations for any or all of these issues.  Connection by the Wi-Fi device in the conference room with an external Wi-Fi network was occurring randomly and with no discernible pattern or agent apparent.  The anomaly in the telephone unit in the chairman&rsquo;s office could not be repeated.  The commission could not rule out the possibility that an innocent call was made to the office at 1 a.m.  Telecoms data could not identify a number from which the call had originated or even that a call had been made.  Concerning the device scanning for mobile phones, the commission could not rule out that such a device was being lawfully used in the vicinity of our building or that it was not directed at our building.</p><p> In the absence of any further clarification, the commission could not simply proceed on the basis that these issues were purely innocent or coincidental.  Accordingly, it conducted a specific operational test on 19 November 2013.  This was co-ordinated by the security firm and involved a GSOC investigation team.  It also involved the three commissioners to test these issues.  This operational test yielded no results and added no clarity to the threats identified.</p><p> With regard to why the results were not reported, the report was in my possession only just prior to the Christmas break.  I had to think very carefully about the need to report matters to the Minister and other parties.  At the time I made a strategic decision not to report what could be described as suspicious activity that did not meet the threshold of an offence.  I have said before in my briefing to the Minister and to the Garda Commissioner that I regret my decision now.  My decision-making at the time just prior to Christmas looked at the potential damage that could be done to public confidence if these suspicious activities were in the public domain.  We had opened an investigation under section 102(4) and the threshold test was achieved, but, by definition, any likely offence might involve a Garda member.  The level of public disquiet about allegations that garda&iacute; might be involved in that type of activity was immense.  I took the decision alone not to report at the time and, to the point of having publication forced on the State, I still had not engaged in any reporting.  It is our earnest wish that we can all learn from and move on from this experience.</p></speech>

It has been concurrent and consecutive throughout this operation.  I am concerned that in a particular report which I read and of which I took possession just before Christmas the rationale put up front in the report is not the type of rationale I had in my mind, nor have I had in my mind, regarding any issue of the initial security checks or the launching of any investigation.  I have a clear note of what was in my mind.  There is potential for further miscommunication and it is very important that I bring it to the attention of the committee.  When I met the Minister and the Commissioner, I was fully open that there was potential for more criticism and more public media coverage, as I believe the initial report may be out there.  We have now released to the Minister some other technical reports.</p> <p>The issue I am at odds with is within the report marked "Secret" and it appears in three Verrimus reports.  I have no idea what is out there among the journalists.  I am absolutely secure and confident about what I have given to the Minister.  What could be interesting is that we could have another series of public discourses about the rationale for why this occurred, reasons we had to undertake the security check and the reasons we launched the investigation.  I am very clear about what was in my mind in terms of the investigation.  Also, having chatted to my colleagues who went to tender for the security firm's work, they do not concur with the type of rationale being put on these documents.  I put it there as a warning.  If documents are out there, I suspect I might have another very early Sunday morning.</p></speech>

I thought it was a very kind offer by the Garda Commissioner.  He called me on Tuesday around midday to say he and I should have a cup of coffee.  I agree with the Garda Commissioner that almost the entire duration of that conversation will be confidential between him and me.  What we agreed towards the end was that I would publicly state he and I and our two organisations would try to get past this particular difficulty to ensure we served the State and came together to reduce any other denuding of public confidence.</p></speech>

He said in his submission that when he had been appointed in 2011 there was an agreement to have a general sweep, as there had been none since 2007.  For some reason, he did not proceed with it at that point.  He waited until 2013 when he says the prevailing atmosphere after the various reports and testimony was becoming more complex and intense, which was something the agency was not used to, and the public discourse appeared to be exceptionally well informed.  That leads me to believe there was material in the public domain that might have only come through some form of collection or leak.  Perhaps he might clarify this.  There has been much confusion about this point, that is, whether it was a routine sweep or whether Mr. O'Brien specifically said the sweep should take place.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.596" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon O'Brien" time="16:25:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014021200006#F00700"><p>There has been a great deal of public discourse.  That is exactly what I wished to avoid in some of my decision-making which, as I said, I now regret.  However, let us be very clear.  We work in an information rich environment and society, a society where technology is moving forward.  We work in an environment where information can come out either through human sources who might work for the agency speaking to other people outside the agency, through surveillance or through overheard conversations.  The result is that, at times, it appears that some comment on what should be issues of confidentiality within our organisation, even between individuals, is being discussed in newsprint and the media or potentially just between other people.</p><p>  As I said in my opening statement, risk assessment and risk management must be dynamic.  To refer back to the inception of our period in office, we three made little or no public comment in the first year.  We were working quietly and, as we made clear on the last occasion we appeared before the committee, engaging with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Timeliness was an absolutely implacable issue for us as a commission.  We waited a lengthy time while we were trying to improve this.  There were conversations between us, as the commission, on whether we would ever become more vocal and public about the problems we were having.  As that level of more public discourse happens, the level of risk of other people wanting to know what one might be saying increases.  If the level of risk increases, one starts to think about how to mitigate that risk and what sort of counter-risk measures should be put in place.</p><p>  In terms of risk assessment, there is a risk at all times.  One can do a number of things.  One can identify and isolate that risk and eliminate it.  One can identify and examine that risk and accept some potential part of that risk because it is good for one; one can try to mitigate some parts of it, or one can just accept that there is the risk and work with it.  We look at these types of issues all the time, but that is part of a standard procedure where there is proper governance and proper administrative governance.  That is where we are.  I am absolutely clear that this security check came about as a result of nothing more than the thought that while the risks were increasing, we might need to start thinking about and be aware of what risk we might be exposing ourselves to.</p></speech>

I think it numbered no more than four or five.  One cannot have a security sweep of a building while all of the staff are in the building.  We took the decision to have it done late in the evening.  There have been many reports of covert operations and black operations at night, but this was a sensible way to conduct an operation where we retained some form of confidentiality about the fact that it was being done.  We could have that reasonable expectation.  I wish to be clear that at this time we were looking at potentially external risks to information flows being seized or captured or us being surveilled externally.  What is clearly the case is that we have a problem internally.  That is a real issue.  We had always warned staff over the period of time about different conversations and possible leaks.  It was right that we had kept this very tight so that a small group of people could assess what the findings might be and then start to think about how we could mitigate or eradicate the risks found.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien took exception to the Senator using the words "bugging device".  Let us call a spade a spade.  Whether it was a bug or other type of device, I do not understand why he should take exception to that language being used.  If he were to call a spade a spade in giving his evidence, it would be very helpful.  The elephant in the room is who leaked this story.  Why was it leaked, in Mr. O'Brien's opinion?  Why at the time did he not have enough confidence in the Minister to go to him directly?  He touched on this in his report which we only received at the start of the meeting.  Why did he not have enough confidence in the Minister to go to him immediately, as he should have?  If a similar situation arose now or in the future, does he have enough confidence in the Minister to go to him?</p></speech>

If one thinks of the forward strides in technology, this old-fashioned word does not describe the nature of surveillance in this day and age and what it will be in the future.</p><p>  I do not know who leaked the report, but I would certainly like to know.  It is an outrage for somebody to take a secret document and I cannot understand a benign reason for wanting to put it in the public domain.  I have launched an investigation and hope to get to the bottom of the matter.  If somebody has leaked that sort of information, he or she needs to be brought to justice.  I have every confidence in the Minister.  I took the decision just before Christmas and got the final report to think through the ramifications of this and my reporting responsibilities.  I had not informed the Minister of what I had done prior to publication of this issue.  It was good journalism on the part of the media to raise this creditable question and I am quite happy to be called to account.  I regret the fact that I did not inform the Minister, but I did it for the very best reasons.  I could see down the line that even the mention of the fact that we had opened up an investigation into these security incidents had immense potential for further damage in what was already a strained relationship between the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Unfortunately, where we are now is where I feared we would go had I reported the matter to the Minister who clearly has a responsibility to make this public.  Upon my head I took that decision.  I recorded that decision and have monitored it during the past few weeks and have worried about it.  I made it with the very best of intentions.  I think the people of the State are and should be horrified to think one State agency would be in any way surveilling another State agency.  At present we have no evidence that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was surveilling my organisation.  As was picked up earlier, any language around this can be injurious to the men and women of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The members of the force do a fantastic job for the State and all of us.  I am sure that when this type of story appeared, as it has, had I been the Commissioner of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I would have been furious.  I take responsibility for this and I am quite happy to come before the committee and be called to account.</p></speech>

If a person goes into a room and plants a device that is not supposed to be there, whether one calls it a "bug" or a "device" - one cannot get away from the fact that a bug is a bug - it does not take Inspector Clouseau to figure out that if one could identify the person or people who leaked this story, one might also find the source or who planted the device.  That would kill two birds with the one stone.  Is there anybody else in GSOC, in addition to Mr. O'Brien, whom he thinks should resign over this matter?  Does he think the handling of this matter is a resigning matter?</p></speech>

As the Taoiseach and others have called for clarity, let us be clear on some of the issues involved.  The  Deputy continues to use the word "bug".  The first threat was a piece of existing technology that the staff of GSOC had both purchased and installed.  It was not the device that was suspicious but the activity it was undertaking.  We need to be clear on that point.</p><p>  The second threat was anomalous or suspicious activity on my conference call.  That is not a bug, but it could be something that comes in from the outside.</p><p>  The third threat was some form of external scanner.  It is really important that we try to get our language right and in this session I will be completely open with members, as I should, and try to give as much information as I can.  I am concerned that because of this matter, we are talking about covert policing methodologies that would not necessarily or normally be in the public domain.  Already we are starting to talk about issues that could be of advantage to both criminal networks and terrorist organisations.  I want to be very clear that there may be certain things on which I will limit my language and some of the knowledge I have.</p><p>  In response to the question of resignation, I have considered my position personally.  I considered my position when I went to speak to the Minister and I considered my position with my colleagues because towards the end of this particular investigation I leave the two good people alongside me as culpable and liable for some of the activities I have undertaken.  That is the reason I am very clear that I have taken the decisions I have taken.  I have considered my position.  When I went to see the Minister and the Secretary General, it was pleasing that they did not immediately call for my head.  Equally, when I called on the Garda Commissioner, Martin Callinan, he said I had made and taken operational decisions; that I had made and taken decisions that were very difficult.  I thought it was a very positive offer for the Garda Commissioner to say it might be wise for him, Martin Callinan and me, Simon O'Brien to more forward.  I would like to see the other side of this crisis.  I would like to lead the organisation to the other side of it.  If Deputies and Senators, the President and the people of Ireland lack confidence in me as chairman of GSOC and I indicate that my position is then untenable to try to lead the organisation to the other side of the crisis, then, of course, I will go.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien has explained how he and the Commissioner were kissing and making up, but I want to return to the issue of the leak.  My assertion is - Inspector Clouseau could not come up with better - that if the person who leaked the story is identified, does he think that is the person who was responsible for the planting of the devices or organising it in the first instance?</p></speech>

I do not make light of this.  I was very respectful of his offer and I am glad that we have had that conversation.  Of course, it is not about Inspector Clouseau; we are carrying out an investigation and will have to think about what shape that investigation takes, but GSOC has been put in the grave position where a secret document has been put in the public domain.</p> <p>It could be likely that the person who leaked the report is also responsible for other issues within our organisation.  As a police officer myself for many years, I have always kept an open mind on an investigation.  Then one sees what evidence presents and whether that might lead to a suspect being either brought forward for prosecution or brought to justice.</p></speech>

I want to continue on a little bit on the train of thought that Deputy Healy-Rae was following.  This was considered such a serious issue because we were talking about information that could potentially be very serious - that was being used in investigations and so on - being leaked into the public domain.  Mr. O'Brien had grave concerns, and Mr. FitzGerald said last night on the television that he had concerns about articles, quotes and so on that he read in the newspaper and that led him to a "heightened awareness" of risk, as he said.  That led to the investigation into the security technologies.</p><p>  What struck me about Mr. O'Brien's evidence was that four to five people in your organisation knew about the investigation taking place and ruled out or could not definitively say that information was lost.  Four to five people knew that.  Out of the four to five people who knew that, that report came out into the public domain.  We have four to five people in his organisation and therefore we know it is one of those five that was involved in leaking the report.  Contrary to what we believed at the start, the security risk is very real, exists today and is something that we have to be very concerned about right now.  If a document marked as secret and confined to an inner circle of people can be leaked then anything in your office can be leaked.</p></speech>

This is our time to give as much of that clarity as we can.  Four to five people would have been involved in the original security scan.  That was increased when we opened the investigation up.  Again, we are talking of a cohort of probably only ten people that were included in the investigation as it moved forward.  They are clearly identified within my decision log.  We met in quite difficult circumstances.</p><p>  The Deputy is right; we are not confining our suspect group to those individuals who were included.  As we speak now we are making inquiries of our own technology to see if there is any way that copies of the report could have been printed.  It was on a separate stand-alone secure system that this report was being held.  All of those issues are being closed down so that we can now take some time to look carefully at who or who might not have accessed, seen, printed or taken this particular issue.</p><p>  I must say again for clarity that I am at a disadvantage as to what is in the public domain.  What I can say is that what I read on the Sunday morning in my bed was, without doubt, a piece of journalism that had an awful lot of provenance.  Such was the level of detail that is indicated to me that it could be a particular report that I received just before Christmas.  Lots more investigative steps on that are being taken.  This came to us only on Sunday.  I have to say that we have spent some time with skids under the back of our heels trying to catch up in relation to this particular ongoing inquiry.  Now I have had a foot-on-the-ball moment - probably just last night - and really started to get to grips with what we need to do next. </p><p>  I was glad to have met the Garda Commissioner.  Now is the time to start investigating how we have got to where we are.  Now is the time, Senators and Deputies, to call me and others to account about why we have got to where are.  I am quite happy now to be in front of the committee within just three days of this happening so that I can give members clarity in a controlled environment and in a controlled way.  That is not where we have been in the last 48 or 36 hours.  We have really just been trying to find out who said what to whom and what has been happening.  Let us get ourselves back on track.  As I say, there is a bit of grip around things now and some thoughts on how we go forward.  I am happy to take this organisation forward unless someone, or other people or a number of people say that is not right.</p></speech>

He was completely unaware that it might have been someone from within his own camp, which is now his prime suspect.</p></speech>

If one is given a report by a security firm which indicates the threats that were identified in the early stages - just after the security scan - one and I would say "Who would be the suspect group?".  It is clear that there are many people out there who may want to get some information from our building.  It could be any number of people - journalists, maybe people who have complaints.  I must, however - as unpalatable as it seems and as unpalatable as it is to hear - put within that potential suspect group a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It not an organisational issue.  It could be a rogue member.  We opened up the report because we believed the threshold had been made or the criminal investigation was made.  We proceeded with a very healthy degree of scepticism.  When that level of risk or threat is presented, you have to start deciding what you are going to do about that.  What we were very clear about was that whatever we did we would do quickly, and whatever we could do we would just come back to try and get some form of clarity as to where the problems of these threats came from.</p></speech>

What he did do - he mentioned it just previously - was to realise that there were other people who could have been involved - criminal elements, journalists who may have been looking for a story, etc.  There could have been any number of people who wanted the information.  His scepticism did not prevent him from believing that the surveillance may have originated within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and, if so, a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na may have committed an offence or behaved in a manner that justified disciplinary proceedings.  That was the basis for his investigation, not that there was a security threat and that it could have been any other source.  He made the specific decision, albeit perhaps sceptical, that it was members of the Garda alone who were the chief suspects.</p></speech>

We are a corporate body.  I was faced, and we were faced, with threats to our independence and to the way we do our business.  I think it was a proportionate and justifiable action to open this investigation and then allow us to use some of our police powers to look at these specific threats - one involving the telephone and one involving an IT network.  Again, without going into policing methodology that would benefit other people, it was important that we could proceed quickly.  While I have said that I keep an open mind, I have to say on this one that I really hoped that I could close this down, isolate, potentially look at those threats and then say that we had mitigated those threats because they do not come forward.  That was always my intention.  If one looks at where we are now, we cannot get to any specific place where we can say these threats have moved forward any more than that they could have been suspected surveillance activities.</p></speech>

Sticking with the technology question, what we are seeing is that it is more likely now, because your report was leaked subsequent to all of your checks being done, that there was no technology issue and that it was an internal leak all along.  Is that a line that you are pursuing?</p><p>  Second, how can you assure people who may have left sensitive information with you, or who may left have private, secret documents, as this report was labelled, with the GSOC, that the information is secure and they will not be reading about it in a Sunday newspaper shortly?</p></speech>

Obviously the Deputy will be aware that even since the report was given to me just before Christmas, and prior to that, we were already building our firewalls up higher.  We were starting to look at the learning we were taking even from just the first connection with the security experts.  This was all about internal sweeps of the building, external looks at where the threats might come from, even just being overlooked.</p> <p>One of the potential issues I did talk about was asking questions of security experts of what capability could be ranged against us.  Without giving too much away, I was shocked to think about the level of threat that came with mobile telephony and all of those issues we are now taking back into our risk management systems.  We are where we are today.  I hope we can move past this, but in terms of our surveillance operation, by definition, it should, if it is successful, remain very very imprecise.  If one is the subject of surveillance and one has any knowledge of that surveillance, the surveillance is failing.  Any person undertaking surveillance would want to make sure that at the end of the surveillance operation the situation remained completely imprecise.  That is where we find ourselves; we have no precision; we have suspicion.  We have suspected activity and nothing, in my view and professional judgment, would have got past the threshold test to say we had an offence.</p></speech>

Will Mr. O'Brien tell the committee very simply in order that the people who are watching can understand if it is his opinion there was a leak at a high level within the Garda ombudsman's office of this report to the media and that the office is now looking for that mole?

A small number of people, approximately seven, had access to a secret report, yet that report has found its way into the hands of the media and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission is investigating the matter.  That is a serious revelation.  Mr. O'Brien has also said that what prompted GSOC to do the security sweep and enlist the British security experts was that it had suspected it was under surveillance.  In fact, he did not use the past tense in his statement or some of his earlier comments.  He has said he suspects GSOC was under surveillance.  Does he still believe that, apart from the leak which amounts to a very serious matter, GSOC was under surveillance?  I am aware that he has said GSOC does not have definitive proof one way or another and does not have definitive evidence, but does he believe and suspect GSOC was under surveillance?</p></speech>

I had nothing in my mind to say we were under surveillance.  We clearly had issues in terms of information flows that might be difficult to understand or explain and the whole idea at first was to look at ourselves and our buildings to see what capability was ranged against us.  It was after we had made that check that we had further suspicions and now we started to talk about specific threats.  At the time there was an indication, a suspicion, that someone might have been surveilling GSOC.  As the issues came forward, with two specific threats, found very close one after the other, anyone in a reasonable organisation, in taking reasonable steps to protect its security, would have had to think about what to do and how to try to mitigate these threats.</p></speech>

We have clearly established that Mr. O'Brien believes there was a leak.  Who has access to secret information within the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission and is giving it to people in the media?  That is a very serious issue.  On what initially led GSOC to enlist the security firm, it was in the context of a higher profile for the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission after he had made public comment that he was not receiving adequate co-operation from the Garda.  That was one context.  The other was that there seemed to be high level information in the public domain that he could not explain; presumably, it should have been information that was secure within the GSOC organisation.  Given the context in which GSOC had initiated the security sweep, was the possibility of surveillance discovered, with the three anomalies which have not been explained fully, one way or another, but which could have malign or benign explanations?  What is Mr. O'Brien view on whether GSOC was under some form of external surveillance?  Is he now of the opinion that GSOC was not under surveillance?  Can GSOC be secure in view of the problem that there is an internal leak or has Mr. O'Brien concerns about external surveillance?</p></speech>

Initially we were looking at the risks presented to our security.  At the time we may have been under surveillance.  In any risk assessment process one has to look at the range of threats across the building.  One of them could have been being looked at through binoculars.  One looks at all of these things to identify whether the potential risk is high, low or medium and how to respond.  Therefore, when we get to the point of threat, of course, one says there could be a level of surveillance by another person or agent-----</p></speech>

In order to leak a secret document one does not need surveillance equipment if one has access to the document.  This is where two things can potentially be confused.  One only needs access to the document to get it out.  There may be a question about how one got it out, by photocopying it or whatever else, but one does not need Government level surveillance technology.  We have established that a secret document was got out, probably by a small number of people who had access to it.  What I am asking about is the other side of the story, the security anomalies and the possibility that surveillance equipment was being deployed against GSOC.  As that issue has been investigated, we do not have any definitive answer, but the two-piece threat is not so alarming, so to speak, but threats two and three are quite alarming.  On threat two, after the test had been done, the possibility of somebody ringing back immediately at 1 a.m. was described as remote to zero by the security experts.  I am alarmed by this.  There could be a benign explanation, but the balance of probabilities suggests there is not and that is what the security experts believed.  Is that correct?  Is that not something about which we should be deeply concerned?</p></speech>

Is Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s concern that his recollected reasons for initiating the security investigation are different from those in the report that he believes may come out in the newspapers this Sunday?  Can he tell us more about that?  Can he explain why the possible conflict of explanations as to why the investigation was launched in the first instance exists?  It seems pretty strange that Mr. O'Brien has one version of why he initiated the investigation while somebody who may leak a report on Sunday has a different one.</p></speech>

I have no idea.  These suspicions have now been identified.  Once one recognises that a risk of being under surveillance exists, through a telephone line or by visual means, one must mitigate the risk.  One must up-spec one&rsquo;s security either to accept or mitigate that risk.  There could well be potential that somebody might be looking at our building.  The identity of that person or agency is completely unspecific.  The exact reason people undertake covert surveillance is so they will not alert one to the surveillance and be able to watch one for longer.  What was the Deputy&rsquo;s second question?</p></speech>

This would give cause for public concern or concern on the part of anyone examining the matter.  Mr. O'Brien seems to intimate there are directly conflicting explanations as to why the investigation was launched in the first place.</p></speech>

I do not know what may come out but I am clear on the position if a certain document is in the hands of other people, such as a journalist.  I have looked at that document and it does not fit my recollection of why a particular security check was revealed.  I say it now because I am on the Oireachtas record and because I believe it will be important not to have another round of public disquiet and public comment if the content of the document emerges this weekend.  I have been very clear in meetings with colleagues and others who may be involved in this that I would rather flag this aspect of what may be said.</p><p>  How did it happen?  As with the Deputy&rsquo;s previous question on whether we are talking about ongoing investigations &ndash; I will not be naming anyone owing to legal advice nor commenting further, and I hope I have not commented too much already &ndash; we will see exactly what may come out.  From that point, we will respond to that.  It is very important that I have looked at what I have seen.  If I have seen a particular fault, I have briefed the Minister as clearly as I could as the information was still coming to light.  I am briefing other colleagues to say we should wait to see what other potential issues or banana skins might emerge.  I would rather be open and honest with members and the people and say we should not allow anything more to be dragged out of us kicking and screaming.  If we find anything else and if any other issues arise we believe should be in the public domain as we begin to examine how to pick ourselves up and move forward, I will not allow myself to appear before people again only to have them ask why they were not told about it.</p></speech>

I have five questions, which I will ask while fully recognising the independence, importance and integrity of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, which has a crucial oversight role in terms of public service and security.  The first point concerns the specific allegations, as made in the newspaper.  The second concerns the role of the three-person commission.  The third concerns the security status as of now, the fourth is on the anomalies and the fifth is on the Minister&rsquo;s meeting.  I will ask two questions first and then the remaining three.  We will get through them very quickly that way.</p><p>  On the specific allegations in the newspaper, the article states a speakerphone upstairs was bugged and that a test of a line confirmed the phone was being used to eavesdrop.  Could the commissioner comment on these specific allegations, having regard to his statement to the committee that while he regarded activity as being suspicious, it did not meet the threshold of an offence?  Perhaps he will explain to the committee what threshold he applies in terms of reporting or otherwise.</p></speech>

That test was not repeated although we tried to repeat it to see whether we would get the same response.  With any security issue, there can be tests resulting in false positives and tests in respect of which one may be relying on someone else.  Who knows?  Even the security firm itself could have some thoughts on it.  I have thought about every single aspect.  Coming on the back of that, the fact that we could find in our inquiries no specific or detailed evidence of what line may have phoned in made it a very difficult test.  It is absolutely right that the security experts have a view.  That, on its own, could suggest an offence but I believe it was a case of very strong suspicion, probably stronger than that pertaining to some of the other threats, and probably harder to explain away.  However, it was my judgment that I could not think that met the threshold of an offence being committed by any other person or agent.</p></speech>

I refer to the conference call telephone in Mr. O'Brien's office and to dealing with the threshold, as outlined by him.  How does his suspicion tally with the comments of Mr. FitzGerald last night on television?  He stated the chance of the occurrence being benign or having happened by chance was between remote and zero.  Assuming he held and still holds that belief, it is confirmation of covert surveillance.  How does Mr. O'Brien respond to that?</p></speech>

I would not set myself up to try to second-guess the experts.  I do not have the expertise and can rely only on their view.  I still hold to the view I expressed and take it very seriously.

As to the chance of it happening benignly, as per what Mr. FitzGerald and the security experts have said, it is on a higher level of suspicion.  I would still say there is a very small chance that this could be some innocent telephone caller coming in, and for reasons of thoughtfulness as to whether that could meet the threshold of an offence, on the evidence I would almost err on the side of not going down that thought process.  If that sounds convoluted, there is a point at which one must ask when that threshold would have been met.  Had that test been repeated, and had we found it again, that might have indicated an offence in my mind.  It has not.</p></speech>

Where they at one in terms of their belief that something was awry?  Did they all have suspicions?</p><p>  I note that Mr. O'Brien stated in his contribution that a decision not to report was one that was made by him as chairman.

I do not have a UK phone.</p><p>  In terms of events, I predicate this response upon the fact the relationship I have with my two colleagues sitting on either side of me is an excellent one.  The way in which we do our business and come to our decisions has been proven to be very good, and we have discussed this before.  Within this particular set of events, it became very difficult for us to have a properly functioning governance structure around this investigation.  I bring it back to this: that because of the threats that were identified to us, we completely disallowed ourselves any use of mobile telephony in looking at, talking about, or having any text data or data about this investigation.  We disallowed ourselves any meetings around a normal meeting table, either in my office or elsewhere.  We ended up having to keep it so tight that we were meeting in caf&eacute;s in Capel Street to discuss this, because the security firms told us clearly of the threats to mobile phones with quite low technology.</p><p>  We have had discussions together.  There has been some learning on our part in relation to the decision-making, which was difficult.  I will let my colleagues speak but, even if we just look at the sort of area we get ourselves into in terms of governance of this investigation, my colleagues on either side of me have no memory and I do not think I have shown them the final report on this matter.  However, that was just before Christmas.  For them, some of these issues have felt as though we were running in a different place.  We have had discussions about this.  That is why I want to make it very clear that, certainly, in relation to the reporting structures, I must take that responsibility upon myself.

They have tried to persuade us or impress upon us that no event triggered their decision in 2012 to have a sweep of their offices.  I am not convinced.  Nor am I convinced that nothing happened in 2013 to precipitate a repeat of that sweep.</p><p>  What was found in the sweep in 2012?  If nothing was found, it points to incompetence by the company that the commission hired, which has not been named despite its being out of business.  I presume the company made a report, which the commission has somewhere.  The commission needs to keep it secret in case it gets printed next Sunday.</p><p>  Was it that the commission's second sweep, in 2013, was triggered by something in the first one, or why was there a need to repeat the sweep?  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission was set up in 2007.  As far as I know, from what they have put on the record, only two sweeps of the offices happened and only since this commission came into being, and the previous commission did not carry out such a detailed security measure.</p><p>  I have a question on the secret report others have mentioned.  Mr. O'Brien has stated that he is trying to put it on the record before it comes out, possibly in the media.  Has the commission given a copy of the secret report to the Minister and to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Will they divulge it publicly, even with redacted parts, prior to its being printed in the newspaper so that they can get the full extent on the record at their bidding rather than that of a journalist?</p></speech>

The first sweep was carried out in 2007.  That was a decision of the first commission as a matter of good practice.  In setting up an organisation and in acquiring a premises, we carried out a sweep at that time in 2007.  That was the first one.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.666" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon O'Brien" time="17:15:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014021200011#L01700"><p>There is an indication that threat one may well have been within the building at that time - that it was a piece of our own kit.  It was not necessarily the piece of kit; it was the way it was behaving.  We picked it up behaving in a certain manner.  Because we wanted to test the provenance and the likelihood of this threat, we kept it under surveillance by another electronic device that merely looked at when it would come on and go off.  Sometimes it would come on at 1.20 a.m. and go off at 1.40 a.m. and other times it would come on at 7 o'clock in the morning and go off at 11 o'clock.  It was completely random.  There is an issue with regard to that.  I would not say the first company was in any way incompetent.</p><p>  In relation to the report to the Minister, after a long and detailed briefing with the Minister on Monday, we furnished him with one report.  It is not and never has been the behaviour of this commission to release reports under section 101 by designated officers.</p> <p>The only time we let those go is to the Director of Public Prosecutions.  We have been in discussions with the Minister and his officials to the effect that we will try to give them a redacted copy.  That is the reason, for the sense of clarity, if - as I suspect - the report is in the public domain and we have been seen as trying to furnish to the Minister some form of redacted copy of it, one again may believe public confidence may be damaged in the process.  Consequently, we are very clear that the report be retained by us.  We will have it and, in many ways, as we go forward and more potentially comes out, if certain statements are repeated, we will know what report is out there and that might start to narrow down where we should look as to how it may have been released.</p></speech>

I also have a few technical questions.  Was the sweep confined to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission's building or was there a further examination of Mr. O'Brien's own home or his personal mobile phone?  If Mr. O'Brien perceived a threat against the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Ombudsman Commission, surely he would also examine his own telephones or telecommunications at home.  He also mentioned that the sweep had been carried out at night time.  Modern technology suggests most of the transmission in eavesdropping can be carried out in bursts.  One need not wait until evening time, as it can be carried out during the day and can hide among all of the other telecommunications traffic within an office.  Consequently, performing sweeps at night often will not disclose any traffic.  Has there been a suggestion that GSOC might carry out a sweep of the office while it is active, now that this matter is in the public domain and, presumably, everyone in the office is aware of it?  GSOC might then find other potential threats.</p><p>  On a related matter in respect of the third threat, Mr. O'Brien stated the level of technology involved was only available to Government agencies.  That suggests an increased threat over and beyond that posed by an individual.  There are questions as to the type of equipment that would be required to present that level of threat.  Was it a piece of equipment that could be converted for use on the United Kingdom's 3G mobile network and could be switched to some of the other mobile networks in Ireland?  In this day and age most equipment is easily convertible to capture whatever network is in use in an area.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien has ruled out categorically An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na misconduct.  How can he do this, or how can he rule out anyone, if he does not know from where or whom the threat came?</p></speech>

The chairman of the commission stated that we might provide the Minister with a redacted copy of our section 101 report.  In fact, we are drawing up a report for the Minister.  It will not be a redacted copy, as we do not do redacted copies of our section 101 report.  It is a legal point and an important point to make, just to correct the record of the committee meeting.</p></speech>

Within the security company's expert opinion, it would state it was a device that was only available to Government agencies.  I do not have the level of expert advice to know if that is right or wrong.  I have some knowledge of this type of kit and suspect it probably could be switched from the UK to others.  As I have stated previously, I do not have a UK mobile phone, but we had UK operatives who were operating in our building at the time.</p></speech>

Mention was made of Inspector Clouseau, but it is far more serious than that.  The picture painted by the chairman, Mr. O'Brien, was almost like Graham Greene's 1949 film, "The Third Man".  I say this with deference to Ms Foley.  </p><p>  I wish to set a context in respect of some of the issues involved.  What is the total staff complement within GSOC?  Do all staff members come under the provisions of the Official Secrets Act?  How many of GSOC's staff are seconded from An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Does GSOC occupy the entire building from which it works?</p></speech>

It is a case of what level of surveillance it is and whether there can be any innocent explanation for it or whether it can be explained away.  As I stated, if the test signal was given, there could be a chance it was some other thing.  Even if we say a figure of 99%, let us consider what if the 1% had happened.

Did Mr. O'Brien consult with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before he issued that press release?  That is referred to in the protocols that the GSOC agreed last September.</p></speech>

We did not consult with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na before that.  It is not a matter that is necessarily referred to in the protocols or at least covered by the protocols.  Certain matters are, but that would not be one that would fall within the protocols as something we would discuss on an inter-agency basis before we would take that kind of action.  The only time we would ever consult about something like a press release or a public statement would be on investigations where we have joint jurisdiction and where both agencies might be investigating an incident, and both have legitimate reasons to be involved, and we may need to share certain things and be careful, but this was not one of those.</p><p>  In terms of what the Deputy calls the exoneration of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, I would not use the word "exoneration" because it has specific connotations.  What we did say was that no such evidence to point to the Garda was disclosed.  The Deputy can call that exoneration if he wishes, but it is not the same as categorically ruling in or categorically ruling out.  It was definitely included to try to allay public concern because of the danger of people simply adding two and two together and getting five.  As the Deputy said, it did not have the desired effect.  I tried to explain it publicly yesterday evening again, and we hope that it has been understood at this stage in the proper manner.</p></speech>

We were looking for specific security threats in terms of the physical security of the buildings and the issues of capability against mobile telephony.  It is a lesson for us all, and we have had to put out a number of messages internally to our staff colleagues, that it can be very unhelpful and damaging to release any information to unauthorised third parties, be that through conversations or otherwise.  It can also be an issue of real concern if people are careless with people's information by allowing it to exit the building, dropping it or leaving it for others to see.  We have had to deal with flows of information and, to come back to where I started, in an information age - we currently have all sorts of ways of accessing information, and it is a vital resource that some may even pay money for - we have had to make that very clear, because in the very recent past it seemed to me that information that was known only to a few people inside our organisation suddenly appeared within newspapers' newsprint.

Mr. O'Brien may not be able to answer this question, but would he inform people such as that of security concerns or checks?</p><p>  Mr. O'Brien spoke about referring matters to the Minister.

I have met with the Minister, as has the commission, on a number of occasions since we have been together over the past two years.  We are an independent organisation with a body corporate; therefore, we will take certain aspects of our independence and the way we do business to us.  It is not as if we have to speak to the Minister or his officials in regard to matters that we can deal with ourselves.</p><p>  In terms of legal advice, I had not taken legal advice until this time in regard to the decision I took just before Christmas.  Clearly, I have been taking legal advice, as has the commission, this week on the ramifications of my decision.</p></speech>

Is he comfortable having meetings and conversations?  Is there such a thing as counter-security checks in dealing with these issues?  Obviously, these issues are of concern to Mr. O'Brien and to everybody, but are there steps the commissioner can take to deal with that, given the history in terms of what has gone on?</p></speech>

Clearly, we are now more secure than we were previously.  If the Deputy is asking if we would always have total security, we do not.  That is why we have risk assessment.  We look at the level of the risk that comes in and we mitigate that risk, but certainly there is learning to come out of this, and we will continue to look at our security.  We are now far more conscious of the level of capability in terms of what we should and should not be saying on mobile phones.  Frankly, our attitude has always been, apart from when we were dealing with this particular covert operation, that we as commissioners should not be talking about anything that we would be particularly nervous about.  At times when we might be talking about confidential issues, we may use some other means of communication rather than mobile telephony.</p></speech>

It is important that since this information has come into the public domain, for the first 24 hours we were catching up with where we should go.  I am confident now that both the Minister and the Garda Commissioner have all the information I could provide them with.  The Deputy's questioning today of me and my colleagues is very helpful.  I hope that as we put more information into the public domain, that will allay a sense of public concern.  As far as I and the commission are concerned, we hope that we can move past this crisis point, learn from it and move on.  The Garda Commissioner made a very kind offer about moving forward together, and we will certainly avail of that offer.</p></speech>

In respect of this issue, since the time the current commission was formed we rarely used the room in which the piece of kit in question was located.

Nearly all the business we have done since the inception of the current commission has been on the fourth floor in and around the commissioners' offices.</p></speech>

We are a State investigative body.  As my colleague, Mr. Kieran FitzGerald, stated on "Prime Time" last night, it would almost be ludicrous to ask the Garda to conduct an investigation of an activity that may have involved one of its members.

The Minister's statement, which may have been based on a briefing we provided to him, indicated there was no definitive evidence.  We have explained the difficulty placed on everybody by the fact that explanations of this nature leave unanswered questions at their tail end.  There is a certain degree of inconclusiveness about the matter and that presents us with a difficulty.  It is a rational conclusion, however, that there is no definitive evidence.  On that basis, and returning to the statement we issued to allay public concerns, no evidence of any Garda misconduct was disclosed.  That was misinterpreted, but we have tried-----</p></speech>

The circumstances warranted a change of approach.</p> <p>I join with the Chairman in welcoming the GSOC personnel here today.  I have a number of questions and I realise that much ground has been covered.  How long did the security sweep take and over what period of time was it carried out?  What kind of Wi-Fi device was it?  Perhaps Mr. O'Brien can elaborate on that.  Was it a router and what exactly was the potential of the device that was found?  How many telephone lines are connected to GSOC's headquarters?  Where is the suspicious equipment stored now?  Were a public inquiry to be held, would that equipment be presented to the inquiry?</p></speech>

We are where we are at this particular point.  It is important that we move forward from where we are, while learning from the process upon which we have engaged.

I know that at the moment he cannot definitively say whether surveillance took place, but it is described as technical or electronic anomalies.  Would the possible surveillance or interference we are talking about be done remotely, outside the building, or would somebody have to physically enter the building to do it?</p></speech>

When I say "internal threats" one could possibly describe them all as external threats, if it is something from outside that is trying to connect to a Wi-Fi router inside our building.  Not only did we look at and find some suspicious indications but we also asked very clear questions about what capability could be ranged against us in terms of mobile telephony.  There are a number of aspects of that security sweep that we addressed.  While these suspicious issues would have arisen, this was a full sweep of our building and it was a well-executed operation.</p></speech>

Obviously, the biggest security breach at the moment is the release of information on a confidential report to the press.  Aside from that internal security threat, outside the activation of devices, this was all GSOC's own equipment.  There is no suggestion otherwise.  As Mr. O'Brien said, things have moved along from a technological point of view and these devices would concern remote surveillance.  Would that be a fair summary?</p></speech>

Maybe something was calling upon it to connect.</p><p>  In terms of the other last threat, clearly that would seem to indicate that it was outside the building.

The question was asked earlier whether we had the entire building.  In fact, we have a building with our own entrance but on the ground floor there is a convenience store.  It does not appear to be internal to our building.  Its entrance is on Capel Street, while our entrance is on Abbey Street.  For the sake of total clarity, however, when it was mentioned earlier as to us having an entire building, we certainly do not share a floor internally with any other tenant.  For the sake of clarity, on part of the ground floor of this building, separate to ourselves, is a convenience store.</p></speech>

GSOC launched that investigation on the basis that such surveillance might have originated in the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and that, if that was the case, a member of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na might have committed an offence.  That was on 8 October 2013, but at that stage only two threats had been identified and neither of them was identified as using technology or ICT know-how available only at Government level.  Subsequent to this, GSOC identified threat No. 3 between 19 and 20 October 2013.  I wonder about the proportionality of GSOC's decision to launch a public interest investigation.  Threats No. 1 and No. 2, the Wi-Fi device and the issue with the phone, are not classified as something one would only expect a Government agency to have the capability of doing.  Anyone could have done this.  For all sorts of weird and wonderful reasons, people may want to hack ICT and computers of Government agencies, Departments and Members in Leinster House.  On the basis of these threads, GSOC made a decision to invoke a public interest investigation procedure to examine the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The evidence available at the time, from what the witnesses have told us, seems lightweight to form the view that such an investigation should be instigated.  This investigation requires an examination of Garda activities.  Is there more to the decision to launch these investigations of these threats?  Is there another reason a sweep was made at this time other than the generality described to us?  It is open to that suggestion.</p></speech>

It is important that the relationship is strengthened and moves in that direction.  There is the suggestion GSOC does not trust the Minister and that is why it did not go to him.

In meetings with the Minister he completely respects the impartiality and independence of our office and this has nothing to do with me having a lack of trust in the Minister for Justice and Equality of the State.  I was very clear when I met him and said it publicly that I regretted the decision not to inform him.</p><p>  The Deputy is correct that the relationship with the Garda Commissioner is very important.  I hope we can get to the other side of this crisis very quickly.  </p><p>  In terms of my decision-making, it was not predicated on whether the threat was at Government level or not.  One must just think through what came to my attention following a security sweep which I had not expected to turn up anything.  I came in on a Tuesday morning when the paperwork was back to find that these indications were coming together, albeit they were suspicions.  We can call one of them an electronic anomaly in a boardroom on one floor of the building and one other electronic anomaly in my office.  That feels quite problematic and requires further investigation.  It requires us to quickly get to the bottom of what the threats are, where they come from and how to neutralise, manage or otherwise investigate them further to see who might be behind such suspected activity.</p></speech>

Am I correct that it is a public interest investigation, without naming individuals, into reports that a convicted international drug trafficker had faced a number of charges in October 2005 in connection with the seizure of &euro;1.7 million worth of cocaine and heroin at a location I will not mention?  A number of years later the charges were dropped without explanation.  I want to confirm that the public interest investigation concerned that matter.</p></speech>

To summarise, if it is convenient for the Chairman, the difficulties we outlined concerned delays in getting information germane to the investigation from the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Some of the delays ran to a considerable period of time and far too many of them, in our opinion, ran over what was in the original protocol agreement of an outer limit of 30 days to receive documents.  Many of them ran much longer than this and some were considerably longer.  That was the difficulty that was aired most before the committee.</p></speech>

The bottom line of that investigation is that had there been an offence or even disciplinary misconduct at a lower level by any member, senior or junior, we would have brought it to the appropriate authority at that time.  As it was, we submitted a file to the Director of Public Prosecutions, DPP, who directed no prosecution.  There the matter rests.</p></speech>

GSOC then contacted its sister organisation in Britain, which it is perfectly entitled to do.  I know that the Ombudsman in Ireland, whether that was Emily O&rsquo;Reilly, or now, Peter Tyndall, cooperates with her or his European counterparts regularly.  GSOC sought advice on a high-quality security consultancy, one of the best international standard, as I think Mr. FitzGerald said last night.  The fact that GSOC sought an international, top-quality operation suggests that it had profound fears, not small or slight fears, but serious fears about the security threat.  Is that a fair assessment?</p></speech>

We thought about the firm that did the original sweep in 2007, which was not available to do this.

That is of concern to many citizens.  We follow the reports of surveillance and monitoring of citizens and recently there have been many revelations and whistleblowers emerging internationally, so people are beyond being shocked.  Is it Mr. FitzGerald&rsquo;s opinion that the issues identified by the security consultancy company were of the type that the ordinary criminal gang in Dublin, or that type of operation, or a journalist, could be involved in, or does he believe that its sophistication suggested it came from government level, if it was the case?</p></speech>

We should bear that in mind.  Technology that may be available to be deployed lawfully by government agencies is perhaps a better interpretation.  I do not quite follow the Chairman&rsquo;s question.</p></speech>

It is being said, and Mr. FitzGerald identified this last night, that because GSOC was pursuing an investigation - which it is its job to do, courageously, without fear or favour, to pursue every issue - that had very serious ramifications for people at a higher level in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, it had therefore put itself in the way of surveillance and monitoring and the outcome was potentially a threat to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  It is being said that may have been GSOC&rsquo;s reason for bringing in a high-level security analysis to protect itself from a threat.  Is that a fair or unfair assessment?</p></speech>

The Minister is setting an impossible standard of proof as there is rarely definitive proof of anything.  This is all the more true in issues of surveillance and communication.  Criminal standard is beyond all reasonable doubt, which equates to approximately 70% certain, whereas civil standard is on the balance of probability, which is 51% certain and above.  Definitive proof would surely be much higher than these two standards used by the courts.  The Minister's very carefully worded and qualified statement sets out that there was no "definitive" evidence of unauthorised technical or electronic surveillance found.  He repeated that three times.</p><p>  There is an apparent need for definitive proof.

The real question is who initiated it.</p><p>  In light of the Minister's very carefully worded findings that there was no definitive evidence of unauthorised technical or electronic surveillance, and that databases in the office had not been compromised, has the commission received or sought unequivocal and categorical assurances from the Minister and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na as to whether any authorised or lawful covert surveillance has been authorised on the GSOC or any part thereof since its creation in 2007?</p></speech>

I spoke with the Garda Commissioner yesterday in a private capacity.  I have no evidence in that regard and I have every confidence in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  As I stated, we identified suspicious threats within our building and, having investigated those, we can find no evidence that an offence has been committed.  With regard to definitive proof, I come back to my original comments.  We are talking about levels of suspicions.  One test had a high bar in terms of the likelihood of repeat.

He confirmed only that no definitive evidence of unauthorised technical or electronic surveillance of the office was found.  He did not mention what kind of evidence was found or if there was authorised or lawful surveillance in place.  He did not go on record in the House to confirm this or allude to it at all.  Moreover, there were phrases in his speech which qualified much of what he was saying, including "the facts as they are known to me", "as much information as I can", "no definitive evidence found", "database ... not compromised", "based on the information available to me at present", "the Garda have been subject to what appears to be a baseless innuendo" and "not in possession of the full facts".</p><p>  All of this conditionality, caveats and qualifications in the Minister's knowledge and confirmation to the House means he has admitted to not being fully informed or aware of the facts surrounding these allegations.  In these circumstances it is very surprising that he has no interest in setting up an independent inquiry to establish them.  It is his statutory responsibility as Minister to address such issues and establish such facts.  The low level of confirmation provided is surely not satisfactory for matters of State security.  Should there be an independent inquiry in order to eliminate the lack of clarification on matters of suspicion and doubt?  Will it be very difficult for the public to have confidence in this?  It is not rocket science, and many Irish people believe that GSOC was bugged by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na-----</p></speech>

We hope to give much information.  We are now in a place where we are speaking of these issues because of the unauthorised leaking of a secret document.  That is not a place I wanted to get to but it is where we are.

That is appreciated.  Many of the issues have been addressed already, whether satisfactorily or not is a matter for interpretation.</p><p>  In respect of the potential for more information to leak out in the coming days, perhaps next Sunday, through publication in national newspapers - Mr. O&rsquo;Brien seems to think there is a strong likelihood of that &ndash; I am interested to hear whether he has any intention of sharing in more detail either with Members of the Oireachtas or with the committee, the notes to which he referred in his opening statement which verify that whatever might be leaked in terms of the motivation behind the sweeping in the first place is entirely different to what he recalls.  That is most important.  If Mr. O&rsquo;Brien has a clear and distinctive recollection which differs from what might appear in the national media in the days ahead then at the very least it should be shared with the Oireachtas and potentially published.  He referred specifically to notes in his possession.  It would be in the public interest to learn what is in those notes.  Should I stop and allow Mr. O&rsquo;Brien to respond to the first question?</p></speech>

I can only suspect that a document that might be marked &ldquo;secret&rdquo; that was solely in our possession is now out in the public sphere.  We should wait to see what might come forward but it is very much worthwhile to say that I can see difficulties in those documents in terms of accuracy and in terms of my thoughts and decision processes.  Whether at some time in the future that will be subject to further examination by Deputies or anyone else then I will clearly always assist and come forward to provide clarity and openness in that regard.</p></speech>

If Mr. O&rsquo;Brien could share his clear thinking with the public and the Oireachtas it would pre-empt that and would avoid the potential for confusion, or worse, misleading the public.</p><p>  The other point I wish to raise is the confusion between the leak, which is an internal matter, which no doubt the commission will pursue, and the question of surveillance.  If I understand clearly what Mr. O&rsquo;Brien said, we can presume that an internal person could not have carried out the surveillance on their own because of what he alluded to in his introductory remarks.  He said the fact that only a State agency could have facilitated this type of surveillance makes it is impossible that one person or a number of people acting independently within the organisation could have facilitated the surveillance on their own.  Is it correct to say that it would be impossible?</p></speech>

It is not our opinion as to what was being ranged against us.  Whether that is one person or two people or an agency is completely unclear.  In terms of internal people being involved in surveillance, it would seem from what we heard that there was an external dimension to the suspicious threats that the security company uncovered.</p></speech>

Whether it is individuals or a state agency, that is the opinion of that particular report.  There are capabilities out there that are in the hands of government agencies and there are capabilities that are in the hands of private individuals.  This is the world that we live in and kit that used to be only in the hands of government agencies can be replicated.  That is why debates such as this in an open public forum, while it is very important, just give more information to perhaps show that the technology race is lost.</p></speech>

Commissioner FitzGerald said on RTE&rsquo;s &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; that with regard to the conference call facility specifically, the international experts that were hired stated that the chances of that particular software not being subject to surveillance were close to zero.  Does Mr. O&rsquo;Brien agree that the third party report at the very least amounts to documentary evidence that surveillance had in fact taken place?  It might not be admissible in terms of evidential admissibility in court to establish guilt or criminal behaviour but it does amount to evidence.</p></speech>

Again, I come back to my earlier point that we looked at that and tried to mitigate that particular suspicion.  We made further inquiries in terms of what phone line or phone number might have come in but that got us no further.  The test was repeated and the results were not replicated.</p></speech>

John Mooney, the journalist in question from <i>The Sunday Times</i> explicitly stated that certain events prompted the third security sweep.  Deputy Mulherin alluded to that as well.  That uncovered the external Wi-Fi shadow device.  Could Mr. O&rsquo;Brien confirm what those events were?  On &ldquo;Prime Time&rdquo; Commissioner FitzGerald acknowledged that there was a heightened awareness throughout 2012 regarding certain matters that appeared in the public domain and public discourse &ndash; reference has been made to that.</p> <p>Can Mr. O'Brien elaborate on what these things were?  Were there other certain events?  To get to the heart of the issue, what suspicions were there and what were the commission's suspicions?  Were there additional suspicions of which we are not aware?</p><p> I have one final and unrelated question.  Mr. O'Brien has repeatedly said today that he regrets not reporting to the Minister for Justice and Equality until after the revelation appeared in <i>The Sunday Times.</i> Is that regret simply as a result of the information leaking into the public domain?  In other words, had it not leaked into the public domain, would he still regret it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.843" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon O'Brien" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014021200020#U00200"><p>I will take the last question first.  This is nothing about feeling sorry after the event.  The committee can see where this debate is taking us, exactly where I did not want it to go.  We have legitimately investigated suspicions and threats that were turned up in a security sweep, a security sweep that had been planned for some time.  It was based on risk management and risk assessment as things go forward.  There were a number of aspects to why it was based on risks and why we did it at that time.</p><p>  Let me take the committee back to the chronology.  The Irish firm was contacted in June.  That was at a period when we were far more public and high profile, a period where issues had been appearing in the media.  It was a sensible way to take us forward, after quite a lengthy period of nearly 12 months when we had been quite silent on many things.  I have a very clear view as to what was in my mind when I asked for the investigation to be launched under section 102.  I also have a very clear mind as to what the discourse and discussion was in regard to why we engaged in a security sweep.  The reason we engaged in a security sweep was that we had not had one for some time and now was a good time for that to happen, based on the fact our profile was becoming higher and the fact certain issues had been appearing in the press and we could not understand how they got there.</p></speech>

It is a contradictory statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2014-02-12a.845" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Simon O'Brien" time="18:45:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/NVJ2014021200020#U00400"><p>I do not think it is contradictory at all.  Risk assessment is dynamic.  Events happen and events that did not happen the year before will happen the following year.  That is the issue here.  For the first year of the commission, we were not out in the public domain on a regular basis.  We were working away quietly to try to achieve our objectives.  These objectives are impartial and ensure we investigate fairly.  Coming through into the second year of our commissionership, we were far more about making criticisms.  That resulted in certain matters appearing in the press.</p><p>  We felt that this was always something we were going to do from the get-go.  We discussed it early on when we first came together as a commission and had been around the whole debate for a while.  It is clear we were making contact with the old Irish firm we had engaged before.  At the time, when we finally got in touch with the UK firm, it was time to do a security sweep.  I was probably more surprised than anyone for the sort of suspected activity and threats to have been turned up when I came in and had the report delivered to me on a Tuesday morning.</p></speech>

Why did it look for an international expert firm?</p></speech>

It was not a process I was involved in, but it seems quite proportionate and sensible to look elsewhere.  While we would always look to support the State, we have very close contacts with our sister agencies in the Independent Police Complaints Commission, IPCC.  We have regular meetings with those colleagues in regard to training and retraining of our staff.  The IPCC is an interesting group we could talk to in an independent and confidential way and the particular firm was recommended by a colleague who has had a long relationship with us over the years, through another professional investigator.  Therefore, the decision was taken to engage the firm.</p></speech>

I thank them for the work they do and acknowledge they have a very difficult job.</p><p>  With regard to informing the Minister of their concerns following the checks made, has the commission previously had to inform this or previous Ministers of concerns that arose from security checks that had been carried out?  Mr. O'Brien outlined in his presentation that after due consideration he decided not to inform the Minister on receipt of the report.  Does he now feel that he has weakened or damaged the independence of his office due to having had to make a public expression of regret for not acting in a particular fashion?  Calls have been made for an independent inquiry.  Mr. O'Brien said earlier that this is a matter for others to decide.  Am I correct to assume that he would be happy to co-operate with any such independent inquiry?</p></speech>

I regret not informing him.  I believe that if one gets something wrong, one should be open about it, apologise and see if things can move on.  I am certainly not perfect.  The one thing I would say is that if I have made a mistake, I will put my hands up and admit that mistake.  Certainly, in this case I regret that we sit here today.  I was only trying to do things in good faith and was very much trying to avoid the sort of public discourse in which we now find ourselves.  Events have overtaken me.  If anyone comes forward and wants us to assist them with an inquiry set up by this House, by elected Deputies or Ministers, we will assist that inquiry.  We are at a place at the moment we very much hope to get past.  We can do that and move on to the important work we need to get on with for the people in the future.</p></speech>

The Minister said that no evidence of unauthorised technical or electronic surveillance was found.  He went on to say that it was unfortunate that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na has found itself during the last 48 hours the subject of what appears to be completely baseless innuendo.  He added that no information has been furnished to him by GSOC suggesting that An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na was involved in any way in what gave rise to concerns in GSOC about its security.  Is it fair for us to assume that when Mr. O'Brien met the Minister to brief him earlier this week he informed him that GSOC conducted an investigation under section 102(4) into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?</p></speech>

I was with the Minister and his officials for two hours and we had a very fruitful discussion.  I made it clear to the Minister that everything we have done, in terms of the activities of myself and my colleagues, was done in the best of faith.  We believed that with the level of suspicion and threat involved, we had to move the issue on.  We opened the investigation in October and by December I had the closing report.  We were very clear that this needed to be a short, sharp look at the potential threats ranged against us.  We had to identify those threats and see if we could give them any provenance, namely, find out where they were coming from.  If we could not do that and find evidence of an offence, we would close the investigation down and we did that very quickly.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Brien has told us that when he briefed the Minister on Monday he informed him that he opened a section 102(4) investigation into An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Is it the case that GSOC is now conducting an internal investigation to ascertain the source of the leak?  In other words, is GSOC investigating itself?  Is it GSOC's intention to continue that investigation into itself?  Has it the capacity to do so or does it have any third party assisting with that investigation?</p><p>  Finally, we are here today because there was a suspicion of unlawful surveillance of GSOC's offices.

I apologise for missing the last hour of the meeting but I had to make a speech and cast a vote in the Seanad.</p><p>  The Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na Act requires that GSOC should be independent in the performance of its functions.  How does Mr. O'Brien's expression of regret to a Minister qualify as being independent in the performance of the commission's functions?  There is no provision in the Act for GSOC representatives to express regret to anyone.  GSOC must make its own decisions - be they wrong or right or simply decisions with which we disagree.  The commission must be independent at all times.  It seems to me, in the overall scheme of things, that this story reached the newspapers and immediately, Government sources, including the Taoiseach and the Minister for Justice and Equality, went ballistic, targeted GSOC and then, within 48 hours, we had an expression of regret.  I do not see that as being consistent with the requirement under law for GSOC to be independent.</p></speech>

I do not believe that it is wrong for me to express regret on that.  I would suggest that it actually enhances independence in the sense of displaying a degree of humanity.  I realised that perhaps I had not thought this through properly and had made a mistake and my apology was predicated on trying to find a way past this.  The Senator thinks that has fettered our independence but I do not believe so.  We have been given and enjoy a significant amount of independence to get on with the very important work we do.  We hope to continue to do that work into the future.</p></speech>

That is obviously what GSOC thought at the time; that this was the best way to deal with the matter.  There has been an immediate change in attitude and I am disappointed.  I am supportive of GSOC and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and am not here to take sides, as some people in this debate have done, unfortunately.  Mr. O'Brien recognises, as do most people, the enormously valuable work done by An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am very keen that GSOC would not be subject to political pressure but that is what I have seen in the last few days.  Let us take the Director of Public Prosecutions as an example to illustrate my point.  If there was a major mess up in the most vile of rape cases, the DPP would never say "Sorry".  The DPP never expresses regret.  That might be ---</p></speech>

The DPP makes decisions independently.   The DPP never explains or apologises because the office cannot do so.  It is not that an explanation or apology is not desirable or that we would not like to find out the reasons for the DPP's decisions but under our constitutional arrangements,  offices such as that of the DPP must be independent of any pressure.</p> <p>Has the commission become less independent of political and media pressure in the past week?</p></speech>

Does Mr. O&rsquo;Brien agree that the evidence of this would be hard to come by, given the advanced level of technology?  Is it not also the case that the one piece of indicative evidence is that on detection, it ceased to exist?  Could this not indicate that the source was active on discovery regarding anomaly No. 2 and the phone call?</p></speech>

It is very difficult, if it has been conducted successfully, to know it has been done.  We were left with several suspicious activities which we investigated.  In some of our investigations we left assets in place untouched and examined them; in others, we repeated tests to see if they would be repeated.  In the final test, when we tried to find some form of linkage between a couple of the threats, again we did not have anything coming back.  We got to a certain place where we were operating with a lack of proper communication.  It was right and proportionate to do what we did and to get out when we did.</p></speech>

There is a formula of words being repeated <i>ad nauseam</i> such as &ldquo;no definitive evidence of unauthorised, technical or electronic surveillance.&rdquo;  Everyone does it by rote and it is a little eerie at this stage.  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien has confirmed he did not ask the Garda whether it had conducted lawful surveillance.  However, it would be technically possible for the Defence Forces to also lawfully conduct surveillance.  Has Mr. O&rsquo;Brien asked the Minister that question?</p></speech>

One of the questions we will pose is how we are going to get to those answers.  Reasonable people watching this will ask who credibly could it have been.  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien has indicated there is an internal leak in the commission to the media.  Why would the media then bother having to engage in surveillance if they could get the information anyway?  I do not think it is the complainant.  Who has an interest in conducting surveillance on GSOC?  Mr. O&rsquo;Brien has said seven people had access to the commission&rsquo;s secret report which he fears might end up with the media.  Was the report in electronic format?  Were there hard copies?  Who had access to them?  Was the report produced by the A list surveillance team?  How could it have got the basis to the report so wrong as to contradict Mr. O&rsquo;Brien&rsquo;s interpretation of why he had employed it?</p></speech>

My answers to questions might prejudice it.</p> <p>I want to be open, but I must be careful of what I say.  We have said enough about who might have had it.  We have launched an internal inquiry.  We will take it where we can go with it.  If we move forward and want other assistance, we may ask for that in the future.</p></speech>

I acknowledge the presence of Mr. O'Brien and his staff.  You have a most thankless job and you and your organisation have a very isolated position.  His decision not to inform people before Christmas based on the evidence they had might have been correct, so I would not beat myself up over it if I were him.  Have any GSOC members felt under threat or under surveillance at any time individually outside of this suspected surveillance of the organisation and its offices?  When the sweep that uncovered the first and second threat was carried out on 23 and 27 September, should it have uncovered the threat that was discovered on 19 October, or was there a view that the third threat, the WiFi instrument, was put in after 27 September?  Is it possible that it was there and a full sweep was not carried out?</p><p>  Threats one and two were in the conference call room, and one was in the conference phone in the chairman's office.  Would the person who placed these devices have needed inside knowledge?  Were they placed strategically?  If I went into the office with two devices to plant, would I be able to pick the phones I needed or would I need insider knowledge to know that they were the right phones?  Who would be involved in conference calls?  I cannot envisage GSOC using the phones for sensitive material via a conference call.  In what context would GSOC use both of those phones where the bugs were placed?</p></speech>

We have gone with what was detected rather than what could have been detected.  We cannot conjecture as to whether something was or was not there on that date.  The security sweep was to look for identifiable threats, and these were the identifiable threats it found.  It went through a range of other examinations and did not find anything else.  The issue, as we have talked about in the past, is about planting things within devices.  Nothing we have found here is talking about the planting of a device.  Threat one was already our property.  It was not about the device but about how it was acting in terms of a potential threat on the phone in my office.  It has both an internal and external dimension.  There was no issue about anything being placed there.  It was on a desk which we use for a lot of things - a lot of teleconferencing - and it has the ability to pick up a wide range of audio from anyone speaking around it.  We have found these threats, we have examined what they may mean to us and we have learned from the process.</p></speech>

It is part of the world in which we live, unfortunately.  Would you suspect any internal reason someone might want to carry out surveillance of the organisation?  Is there any particularly sensitive investigation you are carrying out at the moment that might provide a motive for some person or group to carry out surveillance on his office?  I have no difficulty with a British or American company, or whatever, doing the sweep, but I would imagine that a number of Irish companies could have carried out the sweep on the offices.  Why did you not seek an Irish company?</p></speech>

As the process went on we used a firm that was known to our sister organisations that are also oversight bodies.  We got the best we could find and it turned up these threats.</p></speech>

When one does a risk assessment one explores what threats can be ranged against one and how those threats might come in and compromise one's internal security.  That is the idea of how one does a risk-assessed security sweep of a building, system or any other issue.</p></speech>

From what I know it seems to be common knowledge there is a history of leaking to the press by members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  I am proof of it.  Does this not worry the ombudsman commission?  One third of its staff are former members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The members of the public to whom I speak know there is a history of leaking.  Is this not a major concern?  It is amazing former members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na are investigating former colleagues.  I am not trying to put a slight on any individual.  Former postman should not investigate postmen or former midwives should not investigate midwives.  I am not putting a slight on postmen or midwives; the problem is how will anyone see credibility in a system where former colleagues investigate the Garda.</p></speech>

Will this correspondence be published?  To provide background, the Taoiseach and the Minister stated yesterday that GSOC should give these answers at this committee hearing.  This was obviously inappropriate of them as they cannot instruct GSOC to do anything.  GSOC is not answerable to the Garda Commissioner as far as I know and it is of concern he came out with this.  It is meant to be the other way around.  The Commissioner's four demands are with regard to the nature and extent of the anomalies identified by the UK security consultancy; whether these anomalies amounted to a security breach and if a criminal offence is suspected; the basis for suspicion of Garda misconduct; and whether any matters identified now require investigation by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  To be quite honest I am not interested in whether the ombudsman commission answers these.</p></speech>

The witness said at the end that he has an earnest wish that he can move on from this.  Is he saying this matter is closed as far as GSOC is concerned or should it be investigated further?
