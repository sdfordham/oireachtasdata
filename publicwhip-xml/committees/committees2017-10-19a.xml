Apologies have been received from Deputy Peter Burke.</p> <p>  I welcome Deputy Pat Deering to the Committee of Public Accounts and we look forward to working with him.  Deputy Deering replaces Deputy Josepha Madigan.  Unfortunately, because of a family bereavement, the Deputy is not able to be with us today. </p> <p>  I want to hold over the minutes until the next meeting to have a review of them.  We will move straight to the next item, which is correspondence.  </p> <p>  Correspondence Nos. 817A and 818 are briefing documents, including an opening statement from Tusla for today's meeting.  We can note and publish that.</p> <p>  Next item is Nos. 822A (i)to (iv), which are the opening statement and supporting documentation from the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, for today's meeting, and we have received a revised opening statement this morning.  Have members received the revised opening statement that arrived this morning?  I want to demote yesterday's statement from the committee documentation because it has been replaced by the opening statement from this morning. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.7" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B00400"><p>I have read both.  Statement No. 2 is just a shortened version of statement No. 1.</p></speech>

We cannot pretend that we do not.  It is most unusual.  I do not know whether we have ever had circumstances where an opening statement has been recanted before it has been delivered.  We have both.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B00700"><p>We will discuss the HIQA correspondence.  There might be a legal issue.  The documents we discussed last week had "legal privilege" written on them.  We have received correspondence to say that legal privilege is not withdrawn.  We will come to all of that collectively because it is all connected.  We must consider that point when we come to it.</p></speech>

The next item of correspondence is category B, dated 11 October 2017 from Ms Moyagh Murdock, chief executive officer, CEO, of the Road Safety Authority following a request from the committee to provide information in respect of the impact of vaccines at board level.</p></speech>

I wondered about that.  There is an explanation on the non-competitive procurement of goods and services.  We will note that reply.</p><p><b></b>The next item is correspondence No. 806B received on 11 October 2017 from Ms Joanna Murphy, chief executive officer of ConnectIreland.  The correspondence, which relates to the meeting with the IDA on 5 October 2017, states that comments made by Mr Martin Shanahan, CEO of IDA, regarding a job creation target for the Succeed In Ireland initiative were not accurate.  We will publish this document and write to the IDA for a detailed response.  When we receive the response we will discuss it and how to proceed.  It flatly contradicts some of the items the IDA mentioned in the meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B01200"><p>I also sought information from the IDA.  I did not see it come in.  It was specifically about how it calculates how many jobs are actually created by its clients.  The CEO stated in his response that a survey is carried out, which is presented to the companies to fill in and is then monitored.  The monitoring, however, seems to consist of information that is provided by the companies.  There do not seem to be any real checks.  It is important, because we need to have accurate figures.  I asked for the methodology and precisely what the IDA do.  Can that be followed up on, to ensure that we get it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B01300"><p>Absolutely.  The committee asked for that information from the IDA in public at the last meeting, but the response has not come back yet.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B01400"><p>The IDA has stated that ConnectIreland is in dispute with it and that it is a contractor.  We have no way of knowing if this is good or bad value for money.  I have a major concern about that.  I would like to see more about this but I do not know where we could fit it in.  It might be a case of having an hour-long engagement with the IDA.  I am not sure whether it is appropriate to have an engagement with a subcontractor, which means we probably should engage with the IDA directly.  I am not satisfied with what we are hearing.  I do not want to take a reassurance without satisfying myself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B01500"><p>We all know that ConnectIreland has contacted various Members of the Oireachtas and has had meetings with many people.  As a first step we should get a response from the IDA and then take it from there.  I am not long-fingering this.  That company has made its case to quite a number of people in the House.  We will come back to it once we get a response from the IDA.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B01600"><p>There was also a concern raised about the IDA's response to the question of how much it costs to create a ConnectIreland job as opposed to an IDA job.  The CEO said that there is no methodology to calculate how much it costs to create a ConnectIreland job.  ConnectIreland says differently.  There is obviously a dispute there.  We need accurate, full information.  Either there is a methodology to work out how much it costs to create an IDA job versus a ConnectIreland job or there is not.  I am not satisfied with the response the committee received at the last meeting.  It was a bit glib.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B01700"><p>This item of correspondence from ConnectIreland has to be teased out fully, and it will be.  This is the first step.  We will get a response from the IDA and take it from there.</p> <p>  I should have said that the Road Safety Authority item mentioned earlier was reference No. 825B.  I made a mistake there.  </p> <p>  Correspondence item No. 823B dated 18 October from Mr. Tadhg Daly, CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, will be discussed as part of the HIQA debate in a moment.  We need to get the routine correspondence out of the way and we will come to the Nursing Homes Ireland and HIQA correspondence then.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B01800"><p>They are slightly different things.</p></speech>

That is all I am doing at the moment.</p><p>The next item is No. 808C,<b></b>correspondence dated 13 October 2017 from Alan Kelly with a list of questions to be forwarded to Cork Institute of Technology.  Can we note that?  The letter has been issued by the secretariat.  </p><p>As a general point, we often agree at this meeting to ask questions of bodies and send the questions on to them.  On some occasions members have been asked to forward individual questions to the secretariat.  When the letter goes out from the secretariat it is in the name of the Committee of Public Accounts, and it might be the particular view of a particular member.  In future, when follow-up questions are sent in from individuals, the rationale for the question should be clarified.  If questions are sent out in the name of the committee we have to be satisfied there is a rationale to the question. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1239" speakername="Mary Lou McDonald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#B02000"><p>That is fair enough.</p></speech>

Members should understand that it is in all of our interests to know what questions are being asked in our name.</p><p> The next items of correspondence are Nos. 809C(i) and (ii), from an individual to the Taoiseach in respect of the issue of teachers not being State employees despite being covered by public sector pay deals.  We have written to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform on this matter and are awaiting a reply.</p><p> The next items of correspondence are Nos. 810C(i) and (ii), dated 13 October, from Ms Tereasa McGuire, chairperson of the Mayo, Sligo and Leitrim Education and Training Board, MSLETB, providing an update as requested by the committee on the status of the 2015 and 2016 accounts, which are still outstanding.  I propose that we write to the ETB saying that it is our expectation that the 2017 financial statements will be completed within six months of the year end.  The Comptroller and Auditor General might wish to comment on this matter, given the letter from his office to the MSLETB.  Is he satisfied that progress is being maintained?</p></speech>

I am in agreement with everything that is in the ETB's letter.  We are progressing on the 2015 accounts.  I expect to have those completed by the end of this year.

Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Next is No. 812C, dated 13 October, from the general secretary of Education and Training Boards Ireland, ETBI.  He has also spoken to the clerk by phone.  The general secretary points out that the ETBI is a voluntary body and does not have any governance role over ETBs.  Rather, its job is to promote the interests of the sector.  As such, it does not have a similar role to that of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in respect of the third level sector.</p> <p>  When we discussed inviting a number of ETBs to appear before us, members asked that we also invite the ETBI, but it is a different type of organisation than the HEA, in that it is not a conduit for funds and receives no State funding.  It is just an association.  It has annual conferences and might arrange training, but it is not funded directly.  It has no oversight role even though it has a fancy name.  Given that the oversight role in respect of ETBs remains with the Department of Education and Skills, I propose that, when we are engaging with the sector, we should direct these questions to the Department.  I see no role for the ETBI in our examination.</p> <p>  When we debate our work programme and decide which ETBs to invite, I ask that members submit which ETBs they would like to attend and the rationale for same.  There are 16 of them and we will not invite them all, so let us have a rationale for choosing which to invite rather than just members choosing to invite - or not invite, as the case may be - their own ETBs.</p></speech>

It is an item on our work programme, but it does not have to be done immediately.  I am asking whether members have any particular ETB in mind.  At the beginning of the month, we received a note from the Comptroller and Auditor General to the effect that there were outstanding issues in respect of the Kildare and Wicklow ETB.  As the Deputy mentioned, there is an investigation.  The Limerick and Clare ETB's 2015 audit is still in progress.  Audit queries remain outstanding in respect of the Louth and Meath ETB and the process in respect of the MSLETB is still under way.</p></speech>

I misspoke earlier.  The MSLETB's 2014 financial statements are not completed.  We basically got two sets - 2013-14 and 2015 came in June and July.  The two audits have been completed and we are working on following up on items arising from those.  We expect to have the two of them done by the end of this year.</p></speech>

There is great variety in them.  Some are the amalgamations of three vocational education committees, VECs.  Some have not amalgamated with any other.  The experience is different.  The City of Dublin ETB deals with Student Universal Support Ireland, SUSI, which is in a class of its own in terms of scale of operation and so on.  I will speak with the clerk and give some suggestions.</p></speech>

It would be an obvious one, seeing as how it is the largest by a mile.  I have no particular issue with it, but it would be strange not to invite it to attend.  It is the most prominent ETB, so inviting it to attend would almost be automatic.</p></speech>

We will discuss that and perhaps agree at our next meeting which ETBs to invite.  We have scheduled a November date for them, so we will try to finalise which to invite next week.</p> <p>  The next items of correspondence are Nos. 813C(i) to (iii), inclusive, dated 13 October, from an outsourcing company called Forward Emphasis.  The company is trying to ascertain whether properties of dissolved companies pass to the State and whether it can buy such a property to expand its company.</p> <p>  I have raised this matter outside the committee previously.  Forward Emphasis knows that a company has been dissolved and that there is an asset.  It understands that the assets of dissolved companies transfer to the State legally and it wants to buy an asset from the State.  For the benefit of members, I raised this issue following a previous meeting by way of parliamentary question.  According to the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, when a company such as the one in question is dissolved, its remaining assets automatically transfer to the State.  The State has no mechanism in place to know which assets are being transferred to it, which is extraordinary.</p> <p>  I asked a further question on this topic.  This person might have written to us after seeing my parliamentary question.  I asked what monetary assets had been transferred to the State from dissolved companies.  In 2013, they amounted to &euro;151,000.  In 2014, they amounted to &euro;10.8 million.  In 2015, they amounted to &euro;513,000.  Last year, they amounted to &euro;371,000 up to the date of my parliamentary question.  The &euro;10.8 million was from a single company's bank account outside the State.  It landed out of the blue and was lodged into the Central Fund.</p> <p>  All that we can do is ask the company to engage directly with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department is the only body that should have a handle on assets automatically transferring to the Minister, but we now know that it has no handle on that at all.  The company should take up the issue with the Department.  We will advise it accordingly of where to go.</p></speech>

As the current Chairman, I raised this matter arising from a previous Committee of Public Accounts that dealt with the Social Insurance Fund, which handles unpaid amounts by employers in respect of PRSI, redundancy and insolvency payments.  There was talk of collecting money from a widow who got something that she should not have got.  After discussing the Social Insurance Fund and an outstanding &euro;500 million to that account in the context of dissolved and non-trading companies, I raised this issue and pursued it.</p><p>It is in light of that I have discovered that it can actually happen that a company can be liquidated and there might be an asset at the end of the process.  Any encumbrance on that asset also transfers to the State but the State has no mechanism in place to know whether the entity owned an asset.</p></speech>

It normally takes a couple of weeks.  If we meet here on Thursday, it is probably after the weekend by the time the letter goes out.  There is a lot of work to be done so they probably have only received it.  We give them a short period of time but we have a checklist to make sure we get them all back.</p><p>We are now back to dealing with items of correspondence in connection with Nursing Homes Ireland and HIQA.  I will refer to the various items of correspondence first.  We will then discuss them because they are all on the same issue.  I want to put them all together for discussion.  Items Nos. 822A(i) to (iv) are the opening statement and supporting documentation from HIQA for today's meeting.  We received an opening statement yesterday and a revised opening statement this morning.</p><p>The next item of correspondence related to this is correspondence dated 18 October from Tadhg Daly, CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, declining an invitation to appear at the committee.  I will read that letter into the record.  It is a short letter.  We wrote to Nursing Homes Ireland after the last meeting after we had considered the correspondence that had been sent to us anonymously.  We discussed it at the last meeting.  The committee received that documentation and it was circulated.  We wrote to Nursing Homes Ireland and the reply that came in yesterday said:</p><blockquote>I acknowledge receipt of your request to NHI to attend, as a voluntary witness, a hearing before the PAC next Thursday (19th October) in regards certain matters that have been the subject of recent media coverage.<br /><br />The Board of Directors has instructed me to reply as follows.<br /><br />I am not in a position to attend such a meeting at this time.  It is also important that I emphasise that all information connected with the matters to which you have referred, and aspects of which have been the subject of certain recent media reports, remains strictly confidential and covered by legal privilege.<br /><br />It is a matter of the most serious concern to NHI, its officers and its memberships that purported extracts of a clearly recognised confidential and legally privileged memorandum have appeared in the public domain.  NHI has not waived privilege over the content of its documentation and continues to rely on the strictly confidential nature of the information to which you have referred.  Equally this privilege also applies to the setting within which the discussions you refer to took place, as this involved a consultation with legal advisors.  The priority for NHI remains to ensure that there are no further breaches of NHI's legal rights, or of the legal rights of its officers, ex-officers and members.  <br /><br />A further issue which prevents me from accepting your invitation to attend is that you have not provided me with the nature of the questions which the members of PAC might wish to canvass and as you will appreciate this substantially curtails my ability to prepare appropriately for any such meeting.  Should you wish me or any other officer of NHI to re-consider such a request in the future I would respectfully ask that you would provide an agreed agenda, including a schedule of agreed questions which the members of PAC intend raising, and that you would do so within a reasonable time frame in advance of such a meeting.<br /><br />Kind regards,<br /><br />Tadhg Daly</blockquote> <p>As a result of that, it is clear the document we received the last day was a document prepared for Nursing Homes Ireland which it says is legally privileged.  It is saying it is not waiving its legal privilege.  The issue is that the Oireachtas has a job to protect the rights of citizens and citizens have rights to legal privilege.  It is not the function of the Committee of Public Accounts to ignore that we have been specifically informed in legal writing that these documents have legal privilege regardless of how they came into our possession.  They were published in the <i>Sunday Independent</i>which is the reason we discussed the matter.  It is the function of the Oireachtas to protect our citizens and their legal rights.  I am just making that statement before we decide what to do.</p></speech>

When private nursing homes interact with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which administers taxpayers' money, they have to do so on an individual basis.  To act collectively is illegal.  We are all about observing the letter of the law.  I find this letter from Mr. Daly quite extraordinary and unacceptable.  It is unacceptable that he is refusing to come in and assist the committee with our deliberations.  We have in our possession not an extract of minutes but the complete minutes of a meeting that Mr. Daly convened on 23 October 2015.  It was with three partners from Eversheds who are Nursing Homes Ireland's legal advisers.  Mr. Brian McEnery, who is the serving chairperson of the board of HIQA, which regulates nursing homes, was also in attendance at that meeting.  The provenance and authenticity of the minutes of the meeting have not been challenged anywhere so far as I can see.  The minutes were signed off on by Dermot McEvoy who was in attendance at the meeting and who is a partner with Eversheds.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that he will not be here to assist us with his inquiries.  Mr. Daly will be aware that we wish to speak to him about a number of issues and newspaper accounts of a meeting that occurred in October 2015, which I understand he convened.  These raise very serious issues.  We understand that issues regarding using a collective effort to bring the State to the table to extract more money from the fair deal scheme were considered and debated at this meeting.  We also understand that methods of increasing voluntary or individual contributions in private nursing homes were also discussed.  Of course, it is not appropriate - in fact, it is illegal - for a collective effort to be entered into in those matters, which is alarming.  The whole area of conflicts of interest is also alarming.  As we have seen reports of it, we know that Mr. Brian McEnery, the serving chairman of the board of HIQA, also attended this meeting.</p> <p>  We cannot overstate the seriousness of the matters that arise.  Mr. Daly needs to present himself to the committee.  He will be aware that we are in receipt of documentation and that we are in receipt of an email he sent to members of Nursing Homes Ireland.  He will be aware that we are in receipt of correspondence in which he directs those same people to destroy the minutes we have.  All of this is very disturbing.  While I know Mr. Daly would be presenting himself as a voluntary witness, I am sure he would not contest the fact that large sums of public money find their way into private voluntary nursing homes, all of which are members of his organisation.  It is essential and it is in the interests of Nursing Homes Ireland that he present himself before us.</p></speech>

However, he has agreed to come in as a witness and we should embrace that.  We should have him in here.  We do not know how accurate the report from a Sunday newspaper is, from which serious issues arise, but it is extremely important that he comes in..</p> <p>  Earlier the Chairman dealt with correspondence on nursing home contracts.  On Thursday, the Ombudsman, Mr. Peter Tyndall, launched an important document on nursing home contracts prepared by Sage.  It is important to support an advocacy service for vulnerable adults and older people, the issues relating to nursing home contracts and so on.  There is another side relating to vulnerable people.  It has come up clearly and I know we will deal with it.</p> <p>  We should write to Mr. Daly and get him to appear before the committee at a mutually convenient time.  His presence here is extremely important.  It is important that he has offered to come in and, subject to further clarification, we should do that.</p></speech>

I wish to return to one paragraph of his letter, which the Chairman read out as follows:</p><blockquote>It is also important that I emphasise that all information connected with the matters to which you have referred, and aspects of which have been the subject of certain recent media reports, remains strictly confidential and covered by legal privilege.</blockquote> <p>If something is in the national media, we cannot un-see it.  It is perfectly valid for us to act on something that is in the newspapers that is drawing attention to an issue of major concern.  It is perfectly valid and it would be absolutely inappropriate for us not to follow up on it.  It has been raised here on numerous occasions that the fair deal scheme requires a thorough investigation.  This particular aspect would be very much part of the deliberations that would take place at a single point or over a number of meetings.</p></speech>

At that meeting we discussed briefly management of conflicts of interest, and the committee was quite satisfied with the responses.  However, an article appeared on 8 October 2017 in the <i>Sunday Independent </i>on a meeting attended by HIQA chairman, Mr. Brian McEnery, with members of Nursing Homes Ireland in October 2015.  This has raised concerns for the committee, and the purpose of today's session is to clarify the extent, if any, to which there was a conflict of interest and whether HIQA governance standards are appropriate or sufficient to manage any such conflicts of interest.</p><p>We invited a representative of Nursing Homes Ireland to attend today's meeting voluntarily, but Nursing Homes Ireland declined the invitation stating it was unable to attend at this time.  It has stated it will reconsider the request for a future date, and just before the witnesses came in we agreed to reissue the invitation to Mr. Tadhg Daly from Nursing Homes Ireland to attend at a mutually agreed time as soon as possible.  We also invited representatives of the National Treatment Purchase Fund because we understand Mr. McEnery has advised members on the fund.  It was unable to attend today because of another commitment.</p><p>From HIQA I welcome Mr. Brian McEnery, chairman, Mr. Phelim Quinn, chief executive officer, CEO, and Ms Mary Dunnion, director of regulation and chief inspector of social services.  We are also joined by Mr. David Keating and Mr. Niall Redmond from the Department of Health.  Members have received a document, which is a memorandum of the meeting referred to in the newspaper article mentioned earlier.  Nursing Homes Ireland has stated it has not waived legal privilege over this document or the setting in which the meeting took place.  As we have not had time to get our own legal advice on this I will insist that members do not refer to the document, which is a minute of that meeting prepared by Nursing Homes Ireland's legal adviser, which contains the heading that the document contains legal advice which is legally privileged.  Members are free to discuss the opening statements and content of the meeting, but not reference the exact document mentioned because it is legally privileged.  I do not want reference to that particular document, but the contents of the article in the <i>Sunday Independent, </i>which deals with the meeting and HIQA's attendance at it, is fully open for discussion here today.</p><p>I also want to put on record that because of the late receipt of the reply from Nursing Homes Ireland, which we received yesterday, we had expected it would be here today, so we have not had time to get full legal advice.  In the meantime, as Chairman I am taking the cautious view, pending legal advice, not to refer to the document, which is legally privileged.  HIQA had already submitted its statement, in which it refers in detail to the contents of that meeting.  Through the secretariat, I sent word yesterday to HIQA not to include that aspect of its opening statement today because, as Chairman, without the benefit of legal advice I was taking the cautious view I do not want to trespass into that meeting where we have been informed by Nursing Homes Ireland that the minutes of the meeting are legally privileged.  However, the committee had a detailed discussion in private session this morning, and I am quite happy to be guided by the committee that HIQA's original statement should be read into the record as it was originally intended, and my sending a message to HIQA was merely exercising a cautious approach pending legal advice.  We are very happy for HIQA to discuss it and I apologise for any discommoding I caused yesterday evening by asking HIQA to shorten its statement.

As the Chairman has said, I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Mary Dunnion, director of regulation and chief inspector of social services and Mr. Brian McEnery, chairperson of the board.</p> <p>  At our appearance before this committee on Thursday, 28 September, the issue of potential conflicts of interest arose, specifically with regard to Mr McEnery and his role as both chairperson of the board of HIQA and as an adviser to nursing home operators.  Subsequently, an article was published in a Sunday newspaper, which was discussed by the committee last week.  In order to help answer any questions the committee may have, I wish to outline HIQA's governance arrangements and how we handle conflicts of interest.</p> <p>  HIQA is committed to high standards of corporate governance.  We have a clear policy on conflicts of interest, which ensures that staff and board members are aware of their obligation to act in the best interests of HIQA and to avoid situations where there may be a potential or actual conflict of interest.  This policy is in line with Government policy, as set out in the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies 2016.</p> <p>  HIQA&rsquo;s code of governance and code of business conduct, which was approved by the Minister for Health in October 2014, also reflects the obligations of board members and staff under the ethics in public office legislation.  Both documents have been submitted to the committee for reference.  Our policy and procedures on conflicts of interest apply to board and staff members and are adhered to at all times.  Furthermore, at the beginning of every board session, the sub-committees of the board and attendees from HIQA's management team are requested to declare any real or potential conflicts of interest.  Any declarations are recorded in the relevant minutes.</p> <p>  All of HIQA's inspection staff work within a scheme of determination, which must be agreed to and signed upon commencing employment with HIQA.  This scheme of determination clearly shows the level of regulatory decision-making the chief inspector permits her regulatory staff to make.  In addition, regulatory staff work within a specific code of conduct, which includes a confidentiality clause.</p> <p>  The regulation of designated centres is based on a series of steps.  This includes the initial receipt of information, which can include mandatory notifications, unsolicited concerns and protected disclosures; inspection activity, that is announced, unannounced or registration inspections; and the creation of a centre profile, which contains a description of the centre, a regulatory assessment of information received and the findings of inspections.</p> <p>  All regulatory activities, whether information or evidence received, regulatory judgments or inspection reports, are gathered, generated and saved within a secure information management system.  Access to this system is determined and approved only by the chief inspector.  No member of HIQA's board has access to this system.</p> <p>  Regulatory risk and judgments, and potential and actual enforcement actions, are managed by HIQA's regulatory risk committee, chaired by the chief inspector.  All records of this meeting, decisions made and actions planned are stored within the information management system.</p><p>The chief inspector provides a monthly assurance report to HIQA's executive management team, a bi-monthly report to the board of HIQA and a quarterly report to the board's regulation committee.  These assurance reports include an update on progress made against annual business plan objectives, details on the frequency of meetings of HIQA's regulatory risk committee and details of mitigating actions taken against any regulatory risks.  Reports on quality assurance include information on key performance indicators, internal audit reports and an update on the external stakeholder engagement schedule.  Furthermore, the chief inspector produces and publishes an annual report detailing all regulatory activities, which is a requirement of the Health Act 2007.</p><p> As CEO, I, along with the chief inspector and director of regulation and other officials from HIQA, regularly attend Oireachtas committees when requested.  So far this year, we have presented to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, the Joint Committee on Health, the Joint Committee on Children and Youth Affairs and, of course, this committee.</p><p> Finally, HIQA has received correspondence from a private nursing home provider containing a number of assertions regarding perceived conflicts of interest.  This correspondence was copied to some Members of the Oireachtas.  HIQA has directly replied to this through our chief inspector and director of regulation, Mary Dunnion, and separately through our board chairperson, Brian McEnery.  We have made all of this correspondence available to committee members.  I will now hand over to chairperson of HIQA's board, Mr. McEnery, who will address specific points raised.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.166" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian McEnery" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017101900002#N00200"><p>I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it.  In May 2013, I was appointed chairperson of the board of HIQA.  It is a great honour to chair the board of the authority because its work is important in improving quality in our health and social care sectors.  Since the authority's formation, I have been enormously impressed by the impact it has had on service improvement.  As a student, I worked as a care assistant in the UK and saw, at first hand, the positive impact of regulation in that health system.  I am enthusiastic about the role of Ireland&rsquo;s regulatory body in our health service.</p> <p>  The board has in recent times been particularly focused on ensuring that there are prudent and effective controls which enable risk to be assessed and managed.  We have devised a new and more comprehensive risk management suite of tools in the authority and these are aimed at ensuring that risks to the delivery of the authority's agenda are managed and mitigated.  The board and its committees are also focused on ensuring that the resources of the authority are used optimally.  Some of the key work undertaken by the board in recent times includes: approval of annual budget and corporate plan; approval of the annual report of the authority and its financial statements; and the assessment of performance of the CEO.</p> <p>  I am conscious that the committee wishes to address issues of conflict of interest and a recent report in the media surrounding a meeting of nursing home operators that I attended.  I will address both of these issues in this statement.  I suspect this is what committee members wish to ask me about so I am more than happy to address it directly.  I am also happy to inform committee members about the exact nature of my contribution to the event.</p> <p>  First, just to set out the background to my appointment, I applied for the position of chairperson through the Public Appointments Service system.  I displayed current and comprehensive experience of the health care arena garnered throughout my professional career.  I have at all times before, during and since my appointment tried to ensure that I maintain the highest ethical standards in accordance with the code of practice for the governance of State bodies and, indeed, the code of governance of my own professional body, the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants.  In that context, I have been clear at all times that I am currently a partner in BDO Ireland and head of health care in that practice.  I indicate openly and transparently on the HIQA website that I am one of the firm's health care consulting partners.  I additionally outline on the HIQA website that I have been an adviser in the older person care sector for the past 17 years and that I edited the Nursing Homes Ireland annual nursing home survey.  I further outline that I produced the report A Fair Price for Care - Ireland on behalf of Age Action Ireland.  I also outline on the HIQA website that I worked as a care assistant in a UK older person dementia care home in the past.  In addition, I outline that I have acted as financial adviser to primary care centres, acute care facilities and older person care centres throughout Ireland and that I have a broad range of health care sector experience from both a financial and operational perspective.  In a sense of openness about my professional life, I believe I could not have made it more transparent that I am a financial adviser to the health care sector and in particular to nursing home operators.  This comprises a significant portion of the professional work which I do and I have never tried to hide or deny that.</p> <p>  When I came before the Joint Committee on Health and Children as a new chair to present my credentials in 2013, I outlined then that I have specialised in the area of advisory services in health care.  I went on to state that for the past ten years or more, I have provided financial, operational and strategic advisory services to acute, older person and primary care services throughout Ireland.  In my annual declaration of interests to the Standards in Public Office Commission, I state my professional capacity within BDO.  Finally, the BDO website states clearly that I negotiate rates for nursing homes with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, and work in health care advisory.  It is clear that I advise nursing homes, hospitals and primary care centres.  In 2015, I believe I spoke at six conferences on the topic of nursing homes, the financial implications impacting the sector, the fair deal as it impacts on nursing homes and the statistics of the industry.  In the middle of 2015, BDO launched the nursing home survey, Ireland's most in-depth nursing home research publication, which analysed the financial performance of the sector.  This was launched by the then Minister of State, Kathleen Lynch.  At the time of launch, I spoke extensively to the press and media about the report and its findings.</p> <p>  I was invited by Tadhg Daly, the CEO of Nursing Homes Ireland, to attend an operator meeting in my professional capacity on 23 October 2015 to speak about the sector.  I spoke about financial matters and answered questions that were asked of me based on my professional experience.  I was there as an invited speaker and participated when invited by the meeting.  I left the meeting before it concluded as my professional advisory input was no longer required.  In that respect, I left prior to the attendees discussing next steps or actions.  It was not unusual for me to speak at conferences relating to nursing homes as I had, by 2015, given a number of presentations to the pillar banks and a commercial conference provider for nursing home operators and at the formal launch of the nursing homes survey.  This was the context in which I came to speak at the event on 23 October 2015.  I accepted an invitation, was there as a financial expert and spoke about financial matters.</p> <p>  I would like to set out what I said at the meeting and to show that my contribution was based on advice for the sector in general.  I am of the view that advice was entirely appropriate to the audience and was good advice for the sector in general.  I outlined the following in answer to questions put to me after I was welcomed to the meeting by Tadhg Daly.  I spoke about the finances of the industry and the fair deal scheme.</p><p>I spoke about the genesis of the scheme and the criteria the NTPF applies when agreeing rates with nursing homes.  I also spoke about the financial impact of the NTPF reducing fair deal rates and about labour rate inflation and staffing shortages.  In response to a question, I said that the NTPF acknowledged that nursing home costs were increasing.  It often accepted that these costs were reasonable and prudently incurred and that it would like to be able to give a better fair deal rate but the budget simply was not there.  I relayed to the meeting that the NTPF negotiators often stated to me and to operators during negotiations that it was important that there was a voice calling for an increased budget for the fair deal to back up its own requests.  I outlined that the NTPF frequently stated to operators that the fair deal budget was reduced as a result of austerity and that increases in the fair deal rates to cover cost increases would not be forthcoming to any great extent until the fair deal budget increased.</p><p> In response to a question about the four criteria used to determine the fair deal rate, I outlined to the meeting that the NTPF, in meetings with me and my clients, recognised the criteria it uses are somewhat arbitrary and need to change.  In response to a question about the first Deloitte report on the fair deal scheme, I stated that in my opinion it failed to recommend sufficient changes to the scheme&rsquo;s methodology, changes which I believed the NTPF may have also wanted.  In response to another question about the criteria for pricing care, I stated that the scheme lacked sophistication and outlined that as a financial adviser, I believed setting a rate for a home was wrong.  I suggested that it would be much better to have a rate pertaining to the resident and their needs rather than to a building.</p><p> When responding to a question about the appeals process, I outlined to the meeting that my experience was that operators were better off not just accepting the rate offered by the NTPF off the bat and that engagement and challenge around their case was likely to be better than not negotiating.  When asked about the need to provide more beds, I said I believed that different parts of Government were sending different signals to the sector.  The EIIS scheme, for example, was extended to nursing homes to encourage new developments, but simultaneously fair deal rates were being cut, which was a contradictory message.</p><p> On a final question to me about the possible direction of travel, I suggested there should be engagement with the NTPF and good communication channels between providers and commissioners, that the cost of care should be a consideration and not just an arbitrary pricing mechanism, and that there should be some equality between providers with similar circumstances, that is, blatant inconsistencies in the scheme should be focused on and removed.  I suggested an independent appeals process should be sought in future enhancements of the fair deal scheme and that operators should not be afraid of engaging in the appeals process, as I had found it useful in a number of instances.  However, I suggested the appeals process can, if it goes the full way, take as long as nine months and this is too long.  Beyond answering the questions posed to me, I did not contribute to discussions surrounding strategy.  As the guest attendee, I left when the questions and answers session finished and before the attendees went on discuss follow-up actions.</p><p> On the board and governance, the role of the board of HIQA is to be the governing body of the authority.  I am the non-executive chairperson of the authority&rsquo;s board and I, or other board members, do not have operational involvement in the workings of the authority.  I want to outline this to the committee for a few reasons.  Section 42 of the Health Act states the chief inspector is accountable to the Oireachtas in his or her work.  The chief inspector is not accountable to the board and so the board and I, as chair, do not have any remit over the regulation of nursing homes or other facilities regulated by HIQA.  Legislatively, this is the case.</p><p> The board does not get involved in executive decision-making.  The chief executive is the accountable person under section 24 of the Act and so, in operational matters, he is the person who runs the authority and has the responsibility and accountability.  Operational matters are not brought to the board for decisions because that is not its role.  The way HIQA is legally constituted means that I, as board chairperson, cannot, do not and would not intervene or even have information relating to HIQA inspections.  I have, on one occasion, been asked to intervene personally by a nursing home operator who sought that a HIQA report would not be published on the HIQA website.  I refused to intervene.  In the follow-up correspondence, I was informed that the disappointed party intended to inform Oireachtas Members of my professional role.  I say this as I wish to provide members with all of the relevant information regarding my role. </p><p> I welcome the opportunity to be present at this committee.  There is no conflict of interest in providing nursing home owners with financial advice, including advice on negotiating with the NTPF, and being chairman of the regulatory authority.  This is because of the unique way HIQA is legally constituted.  Clearly this was established at the point of me being appointed to the role of Chairman from the very outset.</p></speech>

That is "negotiated" in the past tense.  It makes no reference to the fact that he currently engages on behalf of nursing homes in direct negotiations with the NTPF.</p></speech>

I am happy and have always been happy to put on the record, as I did at the HIQA meeting, how we will deal with conflicts of interest should they arise.  I made that clear during the Public Appointments Service process and I have tried to ensure at every stage that it is clear that my professional role is financial adviser, including to the healthcare sector, of which nursing homes form a part, but that this does not conflict with my role of chairperson of HIQA because HIQA does not have a role in relation to financial affairs.  The role of HIQA is in regard to other aspects, into which I do not have an input as board chairman.</p></speech>

The fact that he declares what he undertakes to do in his business and in all his roles is admirable and transparent, but whether that is a conflict of interest is a completely different matter and I have substantial concerns.  We have established from his engagement with Deputy McDonald that while having advised Nursing Homes Ireland in the past, he is not currently on record for it, to use a legal term.

HIQA regulates nursing homes in respect of inspection and regulation and the board, and I as chairman, cannot and do not and would not have anything to do with that aspect.  I believe that I came through the public appointments process on the basis that I had sectoral experience as a care assistant and as an adviser.</p></speech>

The nature of the organisation, its importance and the right of the public to have absolute confidence in that organisation is not helped by the proximity he has to so many other matters.  I ask that he come back to us about the former director of finance with the National Treatment Purchase Fund, NTPF, David Allen, who I understand anecdotally is involved in the establishment of Letsbuyhealthcare, and say whether Mr. McEnery or his team have been advisers in its establishment.  It creates the complexion for me, and I imagine for the public, that the chairman of the gamekeepers is involved in advising the poachers.</p> <p>  Would Ms Dunnion be comfortable, notwithstanding that, as I have put on record, Mr. McEnery has expertise and is probably the foremost expert in that field available in Ireland, and given the public confidence currency that is involved in HIQA, with a chairman of the board who is involved in so many other aspects of the industry which her organisation regulates?</p></speech>

The chairman of the board of HIQA is appointed by the Minister, as are the board members.  We recognise in the conflict of interest area that people have a professional life outside their board membership.  That is widely publicised and acknowledged.  I can say unequivocally that at no time has the chairman or a member of the board of HIQA in any way asked or questioned me or influenced any decisions.  In that context I have absolutely no experience where there would be a conflict of interest.</p></speech>

That is enshrined in the legislation and the scheme of determination through the inspectorate, to which everyone has to sign up and agree.  The controls are there within the legislative framework, the Health Act 2007.</p> <p>  The reporting relationship is to the Oireachtas and the only relationship I have to the board of HIQA is as an assurance to the board in its function working for HIQA.</p></speech>

I appreciate that we are here talking about these perceptions today but we also need to convey the facts and they are, as Ms Dunnion pointed out today, that we have very clear controls within HIQA and the public should have confidence in the role that HIQA plays in its regulation of designated centres for older persons.</p></speech>

The statement goes into very clear detail of exactly what was said and Mr. McEnery's role, which are actually contradicted in the media reports.  I will proceed to them now, and perhaps we will tease some of this out.  I am looking at two different media reports, both of which were covered in the <i>Irish Independent</i>, one on 8 October and one on 18 October.  The first says the chairman of HIQA, Mr. McEnery, attended a confidential meeting of private nursing home operators at which a boycott of the fair deal scheme was mooted.  Does he dispute that there was any talk of a boycott of the scheme at the meeting?</p></speech>

Mr. McEnery is the chairman of HIQA and he does not see any difficulty with that.  In fact, he stayed at the meeting.  I am referring to the reports on the meeting.  It astounds me that Mr. McEnery would stay at the meeting when the possibility of a boycott was put on the table.</p></speech>

Therefore, they were directly responding to a contribution Mr. McEnery made.  That is an account of what is in the media.</p><p>That, obviously, would be very troubling for me and, I imagine, very troubling for Mr. McEnery.  If he has read those media reports and also the notes that we cannot discuss here - and they say very similar things and chime very much with what is in the media reports - that would be very concerning.  It would be very concerning if the media accounts were true and if Mr. McEnery did in fact say these things.  That would amount to advocating anti-competitive practices, would it not?</p></speech>

What I have in fact said is what I have outlined in my opening statement, that is, that I have at all times indicated that engagement with the National Treatment Purchase Fund can take three forms.  It can take the form of an initial meeting, and the National Treatment Purchase Fund will give an offered price; one can negotiate with the National Treatment Purchase Fund; and then there is the possibility of an appeals process.  That is exactly what I suggested.</p></speech>

In my view, without question, Mr. McEnery should stand down as chair of HIQA, without prejudice, pending the outcome of an examination and an investigation which is ongoing and pending the very serious questions and concerns that I and other members have.  Mr. McEnery can account for himself.  If I were him, I would offer my resignation before close of business today, but Ms Dunnion and Mr. Quinn have a duty and the organisation has a duty to protect itself.  I am absolutely astounded that HIQA has taken the course of action it has taken and I do not think it will end well for the organisation.  Everything we have seen here is very troubling and very alarming, Mr. McEnery's opening statement is very troubling and alarming to me and his responses are troubling.  If they are troubling to me, I cannot for the life of me understand how they do not cause the same alarm bells to go off in Mr. Quinn's head and Ms Dunnion's head.

Mr. McEnery is the chairman of HIQA.</p><p>I do not want to put him in a spot when it comes to privilege but this is something that he must reflect on.  It is possible that he does not have a role in it because he is an invited guest.  He is, however, the head of HIQA and he attended a meeting.  According to him the subsequent minutes are inaccurate.  The criteria for his attendance are not clear and he cannot quite remember whether they came in the form of an email or not.  Looking back now in his capacity as chairman of HIQA, does he think it appropriate that he attended a meeting for which he did not see the minutes until two years later?</p></speech>

There was a slight deviation in what Mr. Quinn said from what is written on page 2 of the short version of the second report, which states that HIQA had received correspondence from a private nursing home provider.  Speaking before us here today, Mr. Quinn said that he had made some of the correspondence available.  According to the document, however, all of the correspondence was made available.</p></speech>

Standards are not a matter for the board of HIQA.  We have no input into the devising of standards.  This is a matter for the executive of HIQA.

Does Mr. McEnery think that perception could arise among the people in attendance that he spoke to, advising them of inflation in wages, which there is of course, or on a whole range of other matters that he listed out in his opening statement?

I absolutely do not think, then, that the perception described by Deputy Murphy might arise.  Many advisors help nursing home clients; we only have a small portion.  I do not think that people might assume me to be on the inside, because I am not.  There is no link or crossover between the two roles.</p></speech>

Under the Health Act 2007, for example, there are requirements for business planning, annual reporting and so on.  There is also a code of practice for State agencies as put forward by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.

If, for example, somebody is acting for both sides, such a conflict cannot be resolved.  Did Mr. Keating receive any guidance at all before coming to this meeting?</p></speech>

He is saying nothing.  Let us just leave it there because that is what I am hearing.</p> <p>  I wish to ask Mr. McEnery about Chinese walls.  I have been hearing such walls a great deal in recent years.  Does he see this as something that falls within that category, namely, that he has Chinese walls himself in respect of this issue?</p></speech>

HIQA has nothing to do with financial matters.  I am a financial adviser and there is nothing neither I nor any board member of HIQA could do to impact upon the regulatory role of the chief inspector.  There is not a cross-over.  I am a financial adviser.  HIQA does not have a role in respect of financial matters.  In fact, the reason I had an interest in this role, as chairperson - and when I submitted my application to the Public Appointments Service - is that I had experience operationally, as a care assistant, and a strong knowledge of the health care sector.  There is not a crossover between the financial aspects that I advise on and the regulatory aspects that are the preserve of HIQA.</p></speech>

I thank our guests for attending.  I appreciate the amount of time they have spent here.  I also thank Deputy Catherine Murphy for that final question.  It was also one of the final questions I had on my list, which illustrated my satisfaction in general and in particular with the responses Ms Dunnion, as director of regulation, provided in terms of her opinion on whether there is a conflict.  I do not have any further questions.</p></speech>

All I want to do is inquire of Mr. McEnery whether the board understands why we are all concerned and why HIQA was brought back in here when the issue appeared in a Sunday newspaper and we found out about an obvious conflict of interest?  In hindsight, does the board have any regrets about its position?</p></speech>

In addition, I am happy to get the opportunity to explain the context of what I believe I have explained many times, which is that I have a role as financial adviser in all aspects of the health care sector but particularly in respect of nursing homes.  I am also happy to say that there is no link between HIQA and the financial aspects of the matter and there is no link then between my professional capacity and, for example, interacting with the NTPF and HIQA.  That is the most emphatic thing that I want to say here today, which is that they are not related because HIQA does not have a role in financial affairs and I would not have any ability or capacity to influence an aspect of the regulation on behalf of any nursing home.  That is why I included in my statement that where I was forcibly asked to intervene on behalf of a nursing home I refused because that is exactly the role I do not have, namely, to interfere with the work of the chief executive.</p></speech>

This complaint came in because HIQA did not act and that is the reason all this came to light.  Does Mr. McEnery have any comment to make on that?</p></speech>

Does he see any conflict there at all?  I know he has told us he is not interfering in anything and that he has no capacity to interfere.  We accept all that, but does he see no conflict there or that questions would arise over the two positions he holds?</p></speech>

It referred to, for example, having experience of health care, which I have.  I acted in the capacity of a care assistant.  It specified having boardroom experience and I felt I have that.  It also referred to having an understanding of the health care system and I believe I have a deep understanding of it.  I believe they are three of the facts that I set out to the Public Appointments Service as to why I was a suitable person for the role and obviously the Public Appointments Service so selected.  I do not believe there is a conflict and I do believe that part of the reason why I was chosen by the Public Appointments Service was because of my experience.</p></speech>

For future reference, if Mr. McEnery was asked again to give a presentation to a body such as Nursing Homes Ireland, as he did in October 2015, would he reconsider his position or would he give that presentation if was asked?  Would he inquire as to why he was being asked?  In hindsight, would he look at it in a different way?</p></speech>

I will be giving advice to nursing homes next week.  That is the truth.  I have never tried to hide the fact of what I do, whether it is a hospital or a nursing home.  That is my specialism.  That has been my experience in life.  I spoke at a conference organised by a company called CMG Events, which arranges conferences attended by many nursing homes.  In fact, often there are a lot of nursing homes in attendance.  I cannot control who is in attendance.  I did not know who the attendees would be at that event in 2015.  I was invited as a guest, I spoke and I left.  I am disappointed at how it is being presented because I was not there in the capacity of an attendee, I was there to speak as a guest.</p></speech>

Could Mr. McEnery comment on the anomaly between what is the cost per resident between private and public nursing homes?  As a politician, I have been told by private nursing homes that public nursing home care costs a lot more per resident than the private equivalent.</p><p>Can the witness comment on that, in the context of his role as a financial adviser?</p></speech>

First, I wish to clarify something.  I said that the witness should consider his position.  It may well be, without prejudice, because of his successful career in acquiring knowledge and expertise that he has something of a monopoly on information.  I mean this in a respectful way.  As a result of the latter and because of the public confidence issue, it is on that basis, and without having done anything wrong, it might be better for the authority if the witness stepped aside.  However, I have a specific question.  He mentioned that a nursing home had approached him and asked him to remain silent on a report that was, perhaps, going to have a negative impact on it  and the witness point-blank refused to do so.  That is admirable and I respect it.  In light of the fact that we were given information that cannot be mentioned here due to legal privilege, when that nursing home approached the witness to intervene in the matter, were threats made by the nursing home to the effect that if the witness did not comply with the request, it would seek to make public conflicts of interest that it was alleging, be they true or untrue?  In essence, was there an attempt by this nursing home to blackmail the witness?</p></speech>

In some of its communications it said, "We are shocked by the manner in which you and the HIQA board are exercising statutory powers".  The HIQA board was not exercising statutory powers.  It was the chief inspector.  It also said, "We strenuously resist all efforts by the HIQA board to reduce our bed numbers in circumstances where we receive fair deal rates lower than those paid to our competitors and do not intend to charge additional service charges to our residents ...".  It continues, "We are now writing to Mr. McEnery to assist us."  It specifically wrote to me and said that it sought my intervention in not having the report published and it alluded to the fact that if it was published it would make that known to the Members of the Oireachtas, the media and the courts.  It said in part of the letter that I would be subpoenaed.</p></speech>

Its primary functions include supporting the development, welfare and protection of children, offering care and protection for children whose parents are unable to do so, and maintaining and developing the services needed in order to deliver supports to children and families.  Prior to 2014, many of the agency&rsquo;s functions were undertaken by the Health Service Executive.  Staff, assets and systems were transferred from the HSE to the agency on its establishment.</p> <p>  The agency's financial statements for 2016 record total income of &euro;682 million, almost all of which comes from Vote 40 - Children and Youth Affairs.  This includes &euro;16 million provided to support the agency's capital investment.  The agency's expenditure in 2016 was &euro;680 million.  Some 35% of expenditure related to staff costs.  The agency employed approximately 3,600 whole-time equivalent staff at the end of 2016.</p><p>The agency incurred expenditure of &euro;118 million on foster care and aftercare allowances in 2016, and a further &euro;96 million on independent placement provision, including residential care.  Expenditure in 2016 of &euro;144 million was in respect of grants to almost 1,000 organisations delivering services under three key programmes: &euro;98 million on child welfare and protection; &euro;25 million on the school completion programme; and &euro;21 million on family and community support measures.</p><p> I issued a clear audit opinion in respect of the agency's financial statements for 2016, which were certified on 23 June 2017.  However, the audit report drew attention to the statement on internal control in which the board acknowledges that there had been inadequate monitoring and oversight of grants paid to outside agencies.  The control weaknesses identified included delays in the signing of some service level agreements &mdash; audit sampling found that some agreements for the calendar year 2016 were signed as late as quarter 3 of 2016; inconsistencies in the agency's ongoing monitoring of grant-funded agencies, which is carried out through monitoring meetings and receipt of financial reports and staffing returns from grant-funded agencies; and consistent review of the financial statements, with some cases identified where no evidence was available to demonstrate that required financial statements had been received or reviewed.</p><p> In 2016, as in previous years, non-compliance with procurement rules continued to be an issue for the agency.  When it was established, the agency took over a number of contracts which had originally been put in place by the HSE.  The HSE continues to provide support in defining the agency's procurement needs and in managing its procurement processes.  The agency noted that it will take a sustained focus over a number of years to achieve high levels of adherence to public procurement rules.</p><p> The agency's statement on internal control outlines steps being taken to resolve the issues.  The chief executive will be able to provide the committee with an update on progress in this regard.</p></speech>

As mentioned, I am accompanied today by my colleagues, Ms Helena Hanna and Mr. Gerard Hughes from the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  Mr. Alan Breen is my head of communications and Mr. Peter O'Brien is the senior accountant.</p> <p>  I will not go over all the history of the agency.  Most committee members will be familiar with it.  Tusla was set up in 2014.  It is just slightly over three and a half years old, and it brought together a number of services from the HSE, the National Educational Welfare Board and the Family Support Agency as well as some services related to domestic, sexual and gender-based violence.  Suffice to say, the establishment of the agency was one of the largest and most ambitious programmes of reform undertaken by Government and the most comprehensive reform of child protection, early intervention and family support services ever undertaken in the country.  We have 4,000 staff and in 2018 we will have an operational budget somewhat in excess of &euro;700 million.  The 2016 outturn for Tusla was a surplus of &euro;626,000 for pay and non-pay, and a capital surplus of &euro;1.88 million, less than 0.1% of our total budget.</p> <p>  We have been undertaking a very ambitious and far-reaching transformation programme affecting structure, processes, practices, policy, methodology and, of course, organisational culture.  We are leading an organisation whose staff are trying to deliver supportive, co-ordinated and evidence informed services to positive outcomes for children, young people, families and communities.  Our staff have an appetite for change.  As I go round the country, the level of enthusiasm and commitment for change is very encouraging.  They have embraced that positive approach and that is being captured as we move into the next three-year corporate plan, which starts next year.</p> <p>  I would say, and my colleague from the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned it, that when we were set up, most of our corporate functions were very heavily dependent on the HSE through a memorandum of understanding, including some of the areas the Comptroller and Auditor General have drawn to our attention around procurement and the management of grants.  It is our intention to become as fully self-sufficient and independent from the HSE as is possible while at the same time still taking account of the Government's shared services agenda.</p> <p>  We have embarked on this transformation programme.  We have had additional investment over the past two to three years and I would say that we have unapologetically used most of that investment for front-line development to try to make our front-line services more robust and responsive.  We have an opportunity to develop our capacity in some of these corporate areas, especially finance, HR, estates, ICT and areas around freedom of information, health and safety, data protection, etc., because we cannot continue to be dependent on the HSE on an ongoing basis.  We need to be independent and we have begun to invest in these corporate functions as well as, not instead of, I hasten to add, continuing to invest in our front line with the advent of mandatory reporting.</p> <p>  I have mentioned in the statement that one such programme is our child protection and welfare strategy which is underpinned by a national practice approach called Signs of Safety.  We have been giving political parties a briefing on these as we move forward.  They are fundamentally aligned to the principles of Children First, which, as the committee will be aware, is due to be commenced on 11 December.  Children and families will very much be at the centre of our assessment and decision-making and the approach will be strengths based, evidence based and outcomes focused.</p> <p>  On some headlined progress to date, as we have highlighted in our annual report, we have managed since establishment to achieve a 38% reduction in cases awaiting allocation.  There were some signs that was beginning to taper off and that the graph was going steadily downwards.  It has begun to plateau a little and further work is being done to keep that on a downward trajectory.  Within that, there has been a 77% reduction in cases that were deemed to be a high priority.  More than 2,000 inspections of early years services were carried out in 2016 and there were 432 new registrations-notifications in 2016, which was a threefold increase on 2015.  Educational welfare services worked with an additional 3,700 new children in the 2015-2016 academic year, and 31,000 children and 23,500 families were referred to family support services, also in 2016.  A total of 155 family units of accommodation were provided, including 147 emergency refuge and family units, in domestic, sexual and gender-based violence services.</p> <p>  There are a range of additional improvements and enhancements within financial governance and controls which cover a range of expenditure areas.  These are referred to in the background information that we have provided.</p> <p>  I acknowledge and welcome the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and its findings.  I and the agency value the process the Comptroller and Auditor General undertakes which highlights the areas that need change and improvement.  The independent audit process also identified areas of strength and showed where good and tangible progress has been made year on year.  I am aware of the current weaknesses within the agency regarding procurement and grants in particular.  Alongside the senior management team, I am leading on the implementation of specific and relevant programmes to address these weaknesses and bring about improvements.  As these long-term solutions are in the process of being introduced, some of the same issues might come out again in 2017 but I am confident the Comptroller and Auditor General will see clear plans and actions in place to address these issues.</p> <p>  The specific issue of non-competitive procurement has been raised.  We selected procurement as a priority area to be addressed.  The steps we have taken thus far to address these issues include the implementation of a three-year procurement plan which will address the short and long-term needs of the agency.  The plan identifies the priority procurement categories for the next three years, emphasises the need to improve collaboration and recognises that continued training and communication with all relevant staff is a key task to sustaining the changes made.  We have established a team dedicated to procurement which will be its sole responsibility.  That is another example of us using the additional investment to become as self-sufficient and independent as possible.</p> <p>  On the specific issue raised of the monitoring and oversight of grants to outside agencies, as was mentioned, the agency funds in excess of 900 separate organisations to the sum of approximately &euro;144 million.</p><p>As part of our transformation programme, a dedicated project working group was established to develop and implement a programme of governance and compliance for the section 56 and section 59 grant-funded agencies.</p><p> The objectives of this programme include the creation of a new section 56 and section 59 contract, which has now been completed - our corporate solicitors have finalised that - with an accompanying governance framework and an internal governance model.  The internal governance model includes a standardised process and structure for the review and monitoring of service deliverables.  It will be further supported by the introduction of a commissioning unit and a compliance unit whose focus will be on the governance and oversight of those grant-funded agencies.</p><p> Obviously for any programme of change of this magnitude to be effective, it must commence with knowing where the weaknesses are and knowing what needs to be changed; we know that with the help of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I and my senior management team were acutely aware when Tusla was established that there were significant areas to be improved.  I knew this would be a difficult challenge to undertake but we believe it is not insurmountable and we have already made very significant progress on all the areas that have been highlighted.</p><p> In order to build upon and continue with developing Tusla as the agency which provides the best services we can for children, young people and families, we need to be given some time.  We have been given additional resources.  We believe that some further additional investment in years two and three of our new corporate plan for 2019 and 2020 is necessary.  The additional investment we have had has been hugely helpful in allowing us to make the improvements we have made so far; there is still more to do.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for inviting me and my colleagues to appear before the committee to present and discuss our annual financial statements for 2016.</p></speech>

I apologise for leaving him for almost five hours.  Unfortunately, as the Chairman outlined, that is the nature of this House from time to time.  I welcome Tusla's third-year audit and its clear audit from the Comptroller and Auditor General.  While not wanting to diminish the exceptions relating to procurement, payroll etc., they are rather usual.</p> <p>  It is not just State money that is involved in funding the Child and Family Agency.  We note Atlantic Philanthropy's generous donation in the accounts.  I also thank the Committee of Public Accounts secretariat for the preparation of the report given to me, mirroring that produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I also commend Tusla on the format of its accounts, which are quite refreshing in comparison with what is produced by some Departments.  I found them very easy to read and I thank Tusla for that.</p> <p>  I note that the agency managed to spend all but &euro;700,000 of its allocation, which is a significant decrease on the &euro;8 million left over in the previous year.</p> <p>  Procurement is the biggest issue identified here alongside some technical smaller matters.  Tusla's internal process identified &euro;5.2 million whereby competitive processes were not used in the procurement of goods and services.  It was quite disturbing that the Comptroller and Auditor General's audit found more that Tusla had not determined.  I ask the witnesses to give me some detail on the three-year plan on procurement that was mentioned.  I will not be specific as to whom I ask the question of - Mr. McBride might like to start.</p></speech>

One of the areas is where we have used agency staff in administrative and managerial grades.  The original contract was meant to be solely for front-line practitioners - social workers, social care and the like.  We have all had a very significant need for administrative and managerial grades as we have developed the agency.  That is an area we need to address.  We have commenced a procurement exercise to address this; it is in the region of &euro;7 million.</p> <p>  The other one made headlines in relation to private foster care.  We buy places for children from independent fostering agencies and they hitherto have not been subject to contractual arrangements.  We have a process in place now to put them on a kind of framework contract, including supported lodgings as well; so that is in hand.</p> <p>  The other areas are around psychology, assessments and therapeutic assessments, often court-directed where if a HSE psychologist has not been available we have been forced to buy an assessment, essentially, from a private therapist or psychologist, many of whom, as I understand it, are employed by the HSE anyway, but do this privately.  That is an area that clearly needs to be tightened up.  We have plans to ensure there is a contractual framework around that.</p> <p>  There was an issue raised about security.  Of course, security for some of our buildings may be security in a special care unit, residential unit or secure unit for our children.  There are particular needs there.  It is not just routine building security; there is a bit more to it than that.  A new portfolio has been set up in health business services to address the expired contract-----</p></speech>

It is lamentable when a new agency, such as Tusla, is bringing &euro;5.2 million of bad habits into the organisation.  I understand any audit will highlight issues of people maybe bending the rules for expediency purposes; that happens everywhere.  Having said that, this is taxpayers' money and Mr. McBride has a responsibility to ensure those rules are followed.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. McBride to outline the nature of the three-year plan.  How is Tusla getting those agencies and suppliers on board in terms of service level agreements?  It was highlighted, for instance, that some of the SLAs were not signed until the third quarter of the year in which they were in operation.  That is clearly not acceptable.  That might not necessarily be suppliers; it might be other service providers through the Tusla family.  I want to ensure that the compliance department in Tusla is doing its job appropriately.</p> <p>  I highlight one other small thing.  Clearly there is an issue if &euro;700,000 is not identified by Tusla's own internal audit or accountancy function and has to be highlighted to it by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I ask Mr. McBride to give me some information on that.</p></speech>

We will wait until next year for that.  I mentioned the service level agreements, SLAs, and I will focus for a moment on the compliance side as opposed to anything that might have gone on.  Why would it be the case that a third party agency would be subject to a service level agreement it has not signed?  Why would Tusla effectively allow six to nine months to pass before receiving authentication of that SLA?  Why is that the case?</p></speech>

It is not that there was nothing in place before that but a new contract has just been completed that we think covers all the compliance matters that need to be covered.  Some of this comes down to capacity on our side and other aspects come down to an attitude and culture, perhaps, among providers, as they do not necessarily want to be as accountable to us as we would like them to be.  Perhaps they had a history of being much more independent in what they do with their grants and the conversations we have been having with them recently are to the effect that just as the committee argues, this is public money and we need to be sure of value for money and service deliverables and outcomes for children.  A bit of an attitude and culture shift is required in that regard with our relationship to the providers, some of whom have been able, dare I say, to do as they pleased in the past.</p></speech>

The agency was operational for two and a half years when the Revenue notified it that it was not to charge VAT.  I find that a bit strange.  My own dealings with the Revenue Commissioners led me to believe that if I did something wrong, I would know within a week or two at the most.  That was back when I was in business.  The agency got away with it for two years.  I know it was simply complying with that it thought was the appropriate tax code.</p></speech>

We were seeking clarification from Revenue as to whether VAT should apply in such cases and as soon as we received notification on the VAT status, we recognised the debt with the guardians <i>ad litem</i>.  We wrote to them and the balance outstanding at the end of 2016 was just shy of &euro;1.6 million.  We have collected &euro;1.5 million of that to date.</p></speech>

My question was to be how much is left to be collected but that is fine.  Within the payroll section, there were overpayments of &euro;422,000 in 2015 and that rose to &euro;721,000 in 2016.  Why has there been a significant increase?  Is this to do with more people being employed or is there some other issue?</p></speech>

With the establishment of the agency there were nine separate payroll ledgers operated independently throughout the country but we consolidated those to one payroll ledger.  We feel we are more accurately accounting for overpayments in our balance sheet and this gives a more true reflection of the position.</p></speech>

We submitted, as part of the Estimates process last year, three case scenarios.  These were a modest increase in referrals which may result from mandatory reporting, a moderate increase and a more extreme increase.  Ultimately we went with the more modest increase in referrals, based on research that we had carried out on other jurisdictions which had introduced this model.  There is a school of thought that, given that the Children First guidance has been out for some years, that people have been acting as if mandatory reporting is already in place.  Whether that is true or not is difficult to say.  It is also difficult to be absolutely precise about the numbers of additional referrals that Tusla may get.  We have developed a business case on the more modest increase.  In preparation for that we have 304 staff of all grades in the recruitment process currently.  Some 185 of them are social workers.  We are hoping to land a significant number of those in 2017, before year end.  A number may then fall over into the early part of next year.</p></speech>

Some will have had job offers, some will have had start dates already established and some will be waiting on Garda vetting.  We are confident we can get most of the 304 staff in by the end of the year, and a further 150 staff next year.  Overall there will be 454 new staff members over the next 14 months or thereabouts.  As part of the 2018 estimates process there is investment to deal with that.  It is difficult to be precise and say that will be enough staff to deal with the increase in referrals, but we base these numbers on the case scenarios we developed.  We created a reasonably sophisticated business case.  If the numbers of referrals are within that modest bracket we feel that Tusla can cope with it.  It is not all about social workers.  There are only a limited number of social workers produced in Ireland every year.  It also encompasses administrative grades, social care workers, family support workers and other grades of staff as well who can assist in diverting referrals away from the "statutory" social work intervention.  Some of these referrals can be diverted to a lower level, a less formal type of response.  It is very important that we respond to these referrals in a proportionate way by neither over-reacting or under-reacting to them.  We are confident with the investment and with the numbers that we have projected that we can deal with that.</p> <p>  A very important development is our national childcare information system, NCCIS.  It is a client index system, a management information system which will track all of the children we deal with now and into the future, regardless of where they are in the country.  Eight of our 17 operational areas will be using NCCIS by the end of this year, with the remaining nine coming on stream by the summer of next year.  That will assist in getting a timely and proportionate response to these referrals and ensure that as children move around the country with their families they are tracked and that whatever response we have made to those referrals is captured and that information shared.  We will also have a dedicated email address in each of the 17 areas for receiving and responding to mandated reports, which is another development we are putting in place at the moment.  We are becoming increasingly independent from the HSE on the ICT front.  We have our own domain now which contains Tusla-only information and which is managed by us.  We are not relying on the HSE in that regards.  The roll-out of NCCIS will represent significant progress for the whole ICT strategy.  While we cannot be completely sure about the increase in referrals we have made a reasonably sophisticated calculation in terms of what we need, which formed the business case that went to the Department as part of the estimates process.</p></speech>

We even went so far as to check dates and locations to validate the claims made.  They were all signed off on and approved, as I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General will confirm.</p></speech>

It was absolutely the case that all of the claims that were submitted to the Family Support Agency had an assertion that no claim in respect of the same period had been or would be made against another Government Department or elsewhere.  This assertion, which was on all of the claims, was a requirement of the Family Support Agency at the time.</p></speech>

There was a clear requirement.  As part of the declaration that would be made, the organisation would be informed by the claimant that he or she was not claiming expenses elsewhere.  The claimant would tell the organisation that it was the only place he or she was claiming expenses from.  That did not turn out to be the case.  Mr. McCarthy is saying that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General routinely audits various organisations.

I think there is a valuable lesson to be learned here, particularly if these issues arise again.  Maybe Ms Hanna can explain where Tusla got the advice that it should make a disclosure rather than a complaint.  Perhaps public bodies need to be educated on their actual requirements.  If a body simply reports something without making a complaint, the report may not be acted upon.  If it is not acted upon, there is a difficulty.  If a complaint is made, it has to be acted upon.  Tusla might come back to us regarding the process and on the question of whether lessons have been learned.</p><p>On page 16 of the report it says that the commission also found that it is a matter for the agency to recoup any moneys that may be due.

Given that we are under time pressure, the witnesses might come back to me on this after the meeting.  I am looking for details on the turnover of social workers.  It is my understanding that it is quite high but perhaps the witnesses might be able to give us the numbers very quickly.  Is Tusla having difficulties with retaining staff in this area?  It has been brought to my attention that because of the remuneration levels, it can be quite difficult to retain staff.  That has been reported to me anecdotally.  I ask the witness to provide some figures now and to provide a more detailed analysis as a follow-up.</p></speech>

We have a turnover figure for social workers here, which is around 6%.  That actually compares reasonably favourably with other jurisdictions.  A recent study by the British Association of Social Workers found that child protection social workers were only hanging around for 18 months.  We are doing significantly better than that, I am pleased to say.  That said, the Deputy is correct that retention is a challenge for us.  We are actually recruiting quite large numbers but retaining those social workers at the front line is a challenge.  We are conducting exit interviews so that we know why people are leaving.  We are also expanding our senior practitioner scheme in order that every social work team will have a senior practitioner attached to it.  That means that there is something of a career progression or career path for social workers to become senior practitioners, a way for them to stay in practice rather than-----</p></speech>

I remember doing some work on this a few years ago and we were seeing turnover rates in other jurisdictions of between 15% and 24%.  It is not high, comparatively.  Tusla has been doing work with UCD on retention rates within social work, which is ongoing.  They have found that retention is not a particular problem.  It is more the manner of the work, the protection of caseloads for new staff and so on.  Once people come into the child protection and welfare service, I will not say they enjoy the work but they get great satisfaction from the work.  It is a matter of giving them the supports they need-----</p></speech>

As someone who has managed social work for all of the care groups, including older people and those with disabilities, I can safely say that the child protection shift, and I have said this publicly, is the hardest shift and perhaps we need to be looking at differentiated rates.

I read through all the documents.  I particularly noted the commissioning unit, the commissioning strategy and so on.  My head was done in not with Mr. McBride, but with the language being used.  Dr. Geoffrey Shannon came up with very specific recommendations because of the failure of communication on the ground between Tusla and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in exercising its duty in respect of section 12.

I can quote the recommendations to Mr. McBride.  There was no follow-up with An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and there was no one to explain the situation to the garda&iacute; in question after they did their best in taking a child into care in an emergency.  Nobody from Tusla was coming back to them and guiding them.  There are all sorts of recommendations here in respect of training.  The report specifically mentions training for garda&iacute; and a special person to be assigned to the Garda unit.  Has that social worker been assigned?  Rather than spend my time quoting the report, I will focus on those specific recommendations.  Dr. Shannon went out on a limb to say that this must be done to safeguard children.  He gave a time limit of a year.  Can Mr. McBride come back to me with a written report as to which recommendations have been complied with and which have not?  Will Tusla complete them all within the year?  Has the social worker been assigned to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  These recommendations are all listed in the report.</p></speech>

Between December 2015 and the end of December 2016, there was an increase of 136 whole-time equivalent staff, but Tusla only had an additional 18 in 2017.  Why has it ground to a halt?  I will read on to complete the question.  The final paragraph in that section below the table reads:</p><blockquote>Currently, Tusla's Human Resources recruitment function is progressing 304 posts that are at varying stages of the recruitment process and there are an additional estimated 145 posts to be recruited in 2018.  Of these 449 posts, it is estimated that approximately 185 will be social worker posts.</blockquote><p>How do the figures of 304 posts being worked on and another 145 next year tally with what appears to be only 18 additional staff in the chart?</p></speech>

It comes back to the point about retention.  The Chairman is correct about this, and how we put in specific measures to retain staff, particularly front-line staff and front-line social workers.  With social workers, we tend to recruit in the last quarter because new graduates come out of colleges in September or October.  We see a spike in activity in the last quarter.  This is why we have 304 staff at various grades in the process.</p></speech>

On page 33, there is a heading on note 2 regarding net operating surplus.  Regularly at the Committee of Public Accounts people give out about the level of expenses of board members and senior executives, and it makes great headlines, but I want to say, and I suspect it will not be reported, that on page 33, which deals with the CEO's travel and subsistence, it states that during 2016, &euro;147 travel and subsistence was reimbursed to the CEO.  That is extraordinarily low.  If that is the extent of it, it is an exemplar.  If it was &euro;14,700 it would be in the newspapers tomorrow.  It is remarkably low.</p></speech>

Then I move to page 34 and look at board members' fees, and I see some directors have waived their fees entirely.  That is a great news item that I have not seen too often before, and the directors concerned are to be complimented if they feel they want to provide all of their time and services and not claim their fee.  On page 35, I see the board members' expenses and the total claim for the 11 board members referenced during the course of the year is &euro;158.  That is remarkably low again.  We have never seen anything like it.  It is a compliment.</p></speech>

We do not see it very often in the Committee of Public Accounts and I want to highlight it.  The committee had quite detailed discussions about another person's travel and expenses, and it is important from the board's point of view to put the other half of the equation on the record also.</p> <p>  I will now move on to the annual report 2016.  I am concerned with regard to page 18, where it states the number of cases awaiting allocation, including those awaiting allocation for fewer than three months.  The total figure was up to 9,000 in 2014 but this had decreased to approximately 6,000 at the end of last year.  The number of high priority cases awaiting allocation has also decreased, according to the chart.  The chart is going in the right direction but it is not there yet.  That is probably the message I would take from Tusla's appearance here today.  Tusla got off to a rocky start from its inception and it is probably beginning to get there now.  Mr. McBride might comment on this because some people are still asking what is the solution.  Is it more staff?</p></speech>

Social care workers do not necessarily undertake the same range of tasks a professionally qualified social worker undertakes, but they provide a huge contribution to our overall front-line service.  Most of our residential workers, for example, are social care workers.</p></speech>

Page 20 deals with the emergency out of hours service.  How much financially has Tusla invested in this?  It states the emergency out of hours service provides a call centre, with access to a local on-call social worker for An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na for consultation and advice.  What does that mean?  What is the relationship?  The word "local" is used.  For example, how many will be available throughout the country on this Friday night?</p></speech>

In the other areas of the country we have someone on-call, and I believe seven contact points cover the rest of the country.  In terms of what we anticipate next year, we are still to receive the Minister's statement so I do not want to pre-empt anything, but we anticipate the on-call capacity will almost double, to pick up on Deputy Connolly's point, so we can provide not only advice and information to the Garda over the phone but a member of staff can physically attend an incident or situation and take custody of a child where necessary.  This is what we plan to have in place from next year.</p></speech>

In an incident of domestic violence, or whatever it might be, where a child is present and a garda deems it is not safe for the child to remain, as things stand at present the garda may call us and ask whether we know the family and do we have information on the family and whether the child is on our child protection notification system, which is like a child protection register.  We can give this type of information over the phone, but as things stand at present we do not have the resources to physically attend the incident.</p></speech>

Page 69 refers to the workforce breakdown.  We understand the difficulties and we may have mentioned that already.  Regarding the absentee rate by group, the absentee rate is increased in residential services.  The trend across the public service in recent years has been downward to reduce absenteeism.  Why is it going the other direction in Mr. McBride's organisation and what is it doing about it?</p></speech>

We are carrying out a fundamental review of the balance of the provision we have between our own residential provision and the children referred to earlier who we put into independent residential provider places.  I do not know if we have got that balance entirely right.  However, suffice to say that up until recently there has been very little investment in residential services for children.  That is something we will have to put right.  You will find that the absence rates are fairly closely correlated to things such as the level of violence and the violent incidents staff are subjected to in the residential centres.  Staff have an entitlement to a period off work if they are significantly assaulted.  I cannot remember how long it is and it would depend on the circumstances too.  There is almost an in-built absence rate, as it were, by virtue of the fact-----</p></speech>

Do Mr. McBride know how many were issued and how many children would have been in families where there was domestic violence that resulted in protection orders and barring orders being issued?  I am trying to find out if there is a link between Tusla and the Courts Service.

The final issue is that one of the most basic rights of a child in terms of child protection is a roof over their head.  Page 44 of the report deals with homelessness.  It is utterly inadequate.  It states that homeless liaison was established in October 2015 to ensure Tusla meets its statutory obligations and organisational objectives in the area of homelessness.  How many children are homeless tonight?  Tusla is the child protection agency.  It talks about its achievements in 2016 on the next page.  The first is that Tusla has agreed a protocol.  The next one is that it has had briefings relating to a protocol, and the next one is that it has established networks in the family support context.  I get zero sense that the agency is doing something out on the front line.  Is it all just outsourced to some other agency?</p></speech>

We might have to increase that next year.  In the Dublin area, the social worker can be contacted if there are particular concerns or particular need for supports.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1258" nospeaker="true" time="09:00:00" ><p>We can mobilise support in that way.  However, not all children who are homeless require a service from Tusla.  We must be careful to respond to those situations in a proportionate way.  Many of those children are living with very caring and able parents and it is not necessarily for us to intervene or interfere.  However, we recognise absolutely the need to provide support when it is required, which is why we have established the liaison social worker who is dedicated specifically to homeless families.  We are also looking at whether our family resource centres can offer support to homeless families.  For example, families can call in to be signposted on to other services and given advice and support and so on.</p></speech>

We have a had a busy day here.  We were here until lunchtime and I have had to do a few other things in between.  I welcome the witnesses.  For an agency that was set up only four years ago, Tusla has a big spend of &euro;669.473 million in 2016.  It is a lot of money for an agency that is only in its infancy.  There is a heavy responsibility and onus on Tusla having regard to the care of the children of the State albeit it only deals with children who are deprived or in want of its services.  There is &euro;13.56 million for the capital programme.  To what does that relate?  Is it the purchase of buildings for family resource centres and things like that?</p></speech>

Is it Dublin-based and then spread out around the country or is it regional or county based?  I am from Carlow-Kilkenny.  If I want to get in touch with Tusla in the morning, is there an office in Kilkenny or Carlow?  It is doing an important job all over the country, but what is its structure?  Is it like the HSE and based everywhere?</p></speech>

However, that breaks down into four regions, Dublin north-east, Dublin mid-Leinster, south and west.  Each of those regions has a regional director and four areas, respectively, with the region in the west having five.  As such, there are 17 operational areas and these, for the most part, cover two counties each, for example Carlow-Kilkenny.  That is in essence our operational structure.</p></speech>

If there is a violence in a small village in the country, is Tusla accessible?  What is the first agency called?  I suppose it is the Garda.  Is Tusla called in immediately after to analyse the issue that where, for example, there is violence or a sexual assault against a child?  Does Tusla make the decisions or is it An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na?  Who makes the decision to take a child into care or to a family resource centre?

The first responder is normally An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in particular if there is a violent incident or a child is harmed in some way.  However, garda&iacute; are obliged to then give us information about that and we either respond together with them or, sometimes, after their initial response.  Decisions as to whether to remove a child in an emergency situation are made immediately by garda&iacute; under section 12, which was referred to earlier, and we follow the matter up.  If a child is to be removed on a longer-term basis through a care order, we apply to the courts.</p></speech>

In my area, the Grace case famously happened and we all know about that.  Is Tusla able to guarantee that nothing like that will happen today?  In the Grace case, a neglected child was left in foster care for years and years without anyone doing anything about it.  It was ignored despite the fact that the HSE was aware of it.  We had evidence given at this committee by witnesses, but no one could give us a satisfactory answer as to why that happened.  Is it possible to give a guarantee that something like that cannot happen now with Tusla up and running, provided with resources, improving by the year and seeking further resources?  Can we be sure a case of those proportions will never happen again?  I know one can never say never, but is that the case generally speaking?</p></speech>

There will be a three-year costing of what services we think will be required over the next three years.  We have given the Department an indication of that because over the past couple of years we have tended to produce business cases on a three year rather than annual basis, so the Department are aware of what we think we will need in years two and three, which in this case will be 2019 and 2020.  If Tusla were to receive the same level of investment in those two years as it got in 2017 and 2018, it would be nearly home and dry.</p></speech>

The committee agreed as part of its work programme for 2017 to review the work of Irish Aid, particularly the overseas development aid programme and the way it has been used to date to deliver added value in communities around the world.  This is the second in a series of meetings with relevant stakeholders and the committee proposes to report on its findings to the D&aacute;il and Seanad later this year.</p><p>The format of the meeting is that we will hear the delegation's opening statement before going into a questions and answers session with members of the committee.  Before we begin, I remind members, witnesses and those in the Gallery to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting, as they can cause interference, even on silent mode, with the recording equipment in the chamber.</p><p>I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by the Chair to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I call Ms Keatinge, Mr. MacSorley, Mr. Meehan and Ms Foster-Breslin to make their opening statements.</p></speech>

This is a welcome and timely initiative.  Our members have made a number of submissions.  We know of at least 14 from a couple of our working groups, at least seven or eight of our agencies and some coalitions, for example, the Irish Development Education Association, IDEA, the Development Education Network and the Irish Consortium on Gender Based Violence.  I hope that this gives a strong sense of our interest in being involved in this process and the significant support from and commitment by Irish civil society towards the programme.</p> <p>  Alas, I will not have time today to represent each and every one of those submissions, but I will start by highlighting a few of the recurring themes.  We need to speak practically about how we can scale up funding to Irish Aid's programme while maintaining its quality.  This quality is based on untied aid and is focused on tackling the root causes of poverty, meeting basic needs and working in the least developed countries.</p> <p>  We need to speak about strengthening the partnership - the meaningful dialogue - with civil society so as to allow us to do what we are good at, that is, delivering real change to communities on the ground, playing in the privileged space for advocacy at home and abroad, and playing a vital role in development education and public engagement.</p> <p>  We need to speak about how Irish Aid's programme is able to go beyond the business-as-usual approach if we are to deliver on the transformative ambition of the sustainable development goals, SDGs.</p> <p>  I will stick to two main points, the first of which will set the scene and share a few of the broader contextual challenges that make this review so timely and important.  The second will emphasise what is a major opportunity by insisting that Irish Aid's programme remain at the forefront of Ireland's efforts to increase its global footprint.  I will then hand over to my colleagues, Ms Heydi Foster-Breslin from Misean Cara, Mr. &Eacute;amonn Meehan, CEO of Tr&oacute;caire, and Mr. Dominic MacSorley from Concern, to elaborate on the recommendations made in D&oacute;chas's submissions.  We are also joined by Ms Louise Finan, policy officer with D&oacute;chas, and Ms Noreen Gumbo from Tr&oacute;caire, who is also the chair of D&oacute;chas's humanitarian working group.</p><p> By way of context, I am very aware of the very wide-ranging and positive discussion the committee had recently with Mr. Niall Burgess, from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, and Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca, the new director of Irish Aid.  While not trying to repeat the many points and issues that were raised, it may be useful to be reminded of the context and their key descriptions of the Irish Aid programme.  Mr. Burgess, for example, started by speaking about Ireland's values as being universal and founded on the UN Declaration of Human Rights.  He stated our place in the world is founded on ensuring that others are secure and prosperous in their own parts of the world.  He also spoke about the fast-changing context and the interconnected world we live in, which demands, I believe, that we must find new ways of collaborating, adapting and joining the dots, particularly in respect of our work at home and overseas.  One got a sense, from the conversation, of the need to have ambition in the Irish Aid programme.  After all, that is ultimately what the sustainable development goals are all about.  It is a question of thinking about ways of using new technology, involving the diaspora and the private sector, and perhaps being willing to take more risks if we are to innovate in the work we do.  We know, however, that we are living through turbulent times, not least because of our being battered by the effects of climate change, as Hurricane Ophelia reminded us all too well on Monday.  We must also go further to appreciate the very real political crisis we are in.</p><p> At D&oacute;chas's annual conference this year, a South African activist, Kumi Naidoo, reminded us that we are in an age of cynicism and mistrust in which it is easier to use narrow identity politics, laugh off allegations of sexual abuse of women, build walls and offer a vision of populist nationalism to win votes than to convince people of an agenda for transformative change, one that spans borders, recognises the potential of women and believes in the richness of multiple identities.  It is also an agenda that understands the huge threat posed by climate change.</p><p> In addition to experiencing this political crisis, we are experiencing conflict, large-scale displacement and humanitarian need like never before.  We have been before this committee many times in this regard.  In April this year, we talked about the four famines, which still rage today.  Back in July 2016, we were before the committee talking about the effects of migration and the refugee crisis as Ireland played a critical role in negotiating the New York Declaration on Migration and Refugees.</p><p> It is important to remember that, during those meetings, we also heard the personal stories of the people and families behind the statistics.  We need to remember also the impact of time on those many millions of people who are suffering and displaced.  I was at an event last week to recognise the Day of the Girl.  At the event, we heard about the 130 million children who are not being educated.  They are surely the lost generations we will have to deal with in the future.  I am sure from our own history that we recognise the importance of dealing with and managing trauma and violence, and I am sure we recognise how long it takes to build the long, painful road to peace.</p><p> The challenges are considerable, therefore, and we need to find ways to meet them, but we also need to remember that we have a huge opportunity in Ireland today.  It is an opportunity to put Irish Aid up front and central to increase and strengthen our global footprint and international reputation.  The Taoiseach, Deputy Leo Varadkar, spoke in September at the Fine Gael think-in  about increasing Ireland's global footprint through a greater diplomatic, trade, tourism and enterprise presence.  We should also be talking about building a strong, well-resourced and ambitious Irish Aid programme of which Ireland can be proud.</p><p> I have no doubt that each member has his or her own stories and anecdotes about what has made him or her proud of what the Irish footprint looks like.  For me, a particularly memorable moment was being in Mogadishu in the late 1990s.  To be honest, it was probably not the best place for a relatively young development worker.  The Somalis, however, were always eager to ask me where I came from.  When I said Ireland, their eyes would light up and they would ask, &ldquo;Do you know Mary Robinson?&rdquo;  I did not want to disappoint too much so I said I knew her but not personally.  Mary Robinson's visit in 1992 is a visit Somalis remember so well, even today.  What she brought to them was hope and solidarity.  What she stood for was universal values of human rights and a belief in the importance of international humanitarian law.  She also showed immense physical courage and bravery by going to Somalia at that time.  She was willing to shine a light on a crisis that no one else wanted to talk about.  Anyone looking at the footage of her visit will see that she sat and listened to people who were suffering.  She talked to them and offered hope to those families who were in desperate need.  I confess it was always good to be Irish in Mogadishu, and that is still the case today.</p><p> To me, however, it is a matter of framing the Irish Aid programme around some of the aforementioned key ingredients.  It is the values based on human rights, political leadership and the courage to speak up for those who are suffering that will make the Irish Aid programme so important.  Let us remember also that, in Somalia at the time in question, amazing work was being done by Irish NGOs.  Concern and Tr&oacute;caire, in particular, have been there throughout the crisis.  Having visited both Mogadishu and Gedo at the time, I noted nobody else wanted to go there.  The NGOs, however, were on the ground and working closely with communities to meet absolutely critical needs.  It is these ingredients that I hope will shape the Irish Aid programme of the future.</p><p> I thank the Chairman.  I will hand over to my colleague, Ms Heydi Foster Breslin.</p></speech>

We appreciate that there are difficult choices to make around the Cabinet table and applaud the Government for affording, during the recent economic crisis, what protection was within its power to the overseas aid budget.</p> <p>  Ireland's overseas development aid programme is rightly held in high regard by its OECD peers, and the quality of the programme has been highlighted time and again.  It cannot be denied that this small nation has punched well above its weight where contributing to global development is concerned.</p> <p>  At its peak, in 2008, the Government spent &euro;921 million in aid, representing 0.95% of GNI.  The total spent on aid in 2016 was &euro;732 million, or 0.33% of GNI.  Having come through some very difficult years, however, the economy is growing again.  We believe the prospect of sustained growth provides an opportunity to plan for the future prudently but with some degree of confidence.  The publication of an explicit roadmap, as outlined in the D&oacute;chas submission to this committee, is a key element in planning for overseas development aid growth to meet the UN target of 0.7% of GNI.  That percentage represents only 70 cent out of every &euro;100 produced in the Irish economy but the difference this small percentage can make in the lives of poor, vulnerable and marginalised people has literally to be seen to be believed.  I would love to be able to bring the members of the committee to Rumbek in South Sudan, where the Loreto Sisters are transforming the lives of young girls, the leaders of tomorrow, by ensuring they receive a quality education.  In Mzuzu in northern Malawi, the St. John of God brothers are bringing dignity and compassion to the lives of people encountering mental health challenges.</p><p> It goes without saying that, as the economy grows, the absolute amount allocated to the overseas development aid, ODA, budget will increase, even if the percentage remains the same, but the scale of need in developing countries, from humanitarian assistance, to meeting basic needs, to advocating for human rights, is such that the ODA as a percentage of GNI needs also to grow.  We are a small country and there are limits to our resources, but even small countries can have a great impact on the lives of people in developing countries.  This is the experience of my own organisation, Misean Cara, where missionaries can manage, with grants of &euro;10,000, to transform lives.  This year, however, Misean Cara was unable to meet the needs of its members organisations, as represented by the total value of the funding proposals received in April.  We had reluctantly to take the decision to cut all grants by 10% across the board, thus curtailing the interventions planned by our members in communities throughout the world.  I am sure that my colleagues here could tell similar stories.  </p><p> The work of development is often long and slow, built on long-term commitment to an ideal, even when immediate prospects are not encouraging.  An example of this, which is well known to members of this committee, is the 2012 victory at the Inter-American Court of Human Rights for the community of El Mozote in El Salvador, which is my part of the world.  The survivors were supported over three decades by the Sisters of the Sacred Heart of Jesus and Mary.  Together, they worked for justice in the wake of the horrific massacre in 1981, and finally achieved it 31 years later.  To achieve something such as this, long-term support is essential.  The community did not give up and those supporting them did not either.  To be able to build real momentum in development and to ensure that success builds upon success, we as organisations need to be able to assure our programmes and partners in the global south that funding will follow year on year.  We need to be able to enter, with confidence, into multi-annual agreements.  This will allow organisations that are bringing life enhancing change to communities dedicate a little less time to the constant search for funding and more to the implementation of quality programmes.  A clear commitment to a multi-annual roadmap towards the 0.7% target would go a long way towards making that possible.  </p><p> Globally, bilateral ODA to the least developed countries, LDCs, has fallen from $25 billion to $22.4 billion in 2016.  Ireland previously led on reaching a UN target to give 0.15% of bilateral ODA to LDCs.  Ireland exceeded this target from 2011 to 2014, but this positive trend looks set to be broken.  In 2016, the share of Ireland's bilateral aid to LDCs was just under 0.1% of GNI.  </p><p> Ireland's long-standing commitment to poor and vulnerable communities in the less developed countries of the world is something of which we can all be very proud.  At a time when it appears that uncertainty, conflict and confrontation are increasing at a global level, Ireland can be an example of solidarity and support.  The Irish know both sides of this story.  Given our history of famine and emigration, we know what it is like to lose everything.  We have the chance now to show leadership as global citizens at a time when it has never been more required.  We can set down a marker for many other countries to follow by publishing a multi-annual roadmap to reach the 0.7% target by 2025 at the latest.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1336" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. &Eacute;amonn Meehan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017101900002#C00200"><p>Ireland has a proud tradition of principled engagement in development, humanitarian aid, UN peacekeeping, disarmament and the protection and fulfilment of human rights internationally.  Advancing and protecting a focus on global poverty reduction has high levels of public support in Ireland with 80% of those surveyed supporting an increase in ODA.</p> <p>  The Irish Aid programme is widely recognised as one of the best in the world.  In the context of this review, a key emphasis needs to be to protect and build upon the high-quality approach already evident in Irish Aid.  That means a focus on poverty for the spend, grant assistance and untied aid.  All of these are critically important, and I have no doubt that they will continue.  Ireland is well recognised not just because of the nature and quantity of its funding, but the quality of the response provided by Irish Aid that is delivered by Irish NGOs.  Aid from Ireland, delivered through Irish civil society and missionary partners, has played a critical role in supporting millions of vulnerable people around the world, helping to meet their basic needs and to attain justice.  Those of us  here today representing Irish civil society working in the international arena are accountable to the Irish public as supporters of our individual organisations and also as taxpayers.  However, Irish Aid funding to civil society organisations decreased from 26% of ODA in 2015 to 23% in 2016.  </p> <p>  Focusing on humanitarian funding, that is, funding going to emergency response, the situation was even more striking.  In 2016, Ireland's humanitarian assistance programme grew to &euro;194 million to respond to the unprecedented level of humanitarian need.  Only 12% of the humanitarian budget in 2016 was allocated to NGOs.  This is an alarming reduction from 20% in 2015.  By contrast, multilateral spend in 2016 was 61% of Irish Aid's overall budget, with increases in funding to the World Food Programme, United Nations Development Programme, UNDP, the United Nations Children's Fund, UNICEF, the United Nations Office for the Co-ordination of Humanitarian Affairs, UNOCHA, the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, UNHCR, Central Emergency Response Fund, CERF, and country based pooled funding mechanisms.  This absolute and percentage reduction in funding to NGOs is of concern to us.  In light of Ireland's commitments under the grand bargain, which is an agreement entered into at the World Humanitarian Summit in Istanbul in May 2016, Ireland is committed, along with 21 other signatories to the grand bargain, to ensuring that 25% of humanitarian aid goes to local and national humanitarian actors by 2020.  We would like to see Irish Aid progress this.</p> <p>  While we fully support multi-lateralism and are proud of Ireland's record on the world stage and the influence it holds, we need to ensure that we are focusing funding on where it is needed most and where it will reach those who need it as fast as possible.  It is critical to get the correct balance of channels to achieve maximum impact, and in our view, the balance has tipped too far towards multilateral funding.  This should be reversed.  A recommendation from the Doch&aacute;s humanitarian working group, which is in the papers presented to the committee, is that a comparative value for money assessment should be undertaken on the humanitarian funding practices of Irish Aid.  </p> <p>  Irish Aid is also highly regarded for its development education and public engagement streams of work.  We believe that this should be continued and strengthened.  Development education is vital to ensuring that we encourage critical analysis of the world around us - we believe this is never more important than it is now - and that we equip Irish people to become engaged global citizens who understand and support how Irish Aid allocates their money overseas.  According to recent research from Doch&aacute;s, figures indicate that Irish Aid allocations to development education have fallen from 0.73% of the ODA budget in 2011 to 0.51% in 2016.  </p> <p>  To achieve the SDGs, Irish Aid's programme needs to continue to strengthen its relationships with and support of civil society, including Irish development NGOs and missionaries, and to ensure an enabling environment to allow civil society to flourish across all of the regions we work in.</p><p>This means supporting a diverse, international development sector across a range of small, medium and large organisations.  It means also ensuring predictable funding to these organisations from Irish Aid.</p><p> We know that civil society is under attack in many of the countries in which we are working and yet it has a vital role to play in ensuring good governance.  Civil society has an important advocacy role in holding duty bearers to account and in ensuring pro-poor and sustainable policies are implemented.  There were 281 killings of human rights defenders in 2016.  Those who stand up for the rights of vulnerable communities often do so at the risk of their own safety.  In March 2016 Berta C&aacute;ceres, a Honduran environmental activist and human rights worker, who was a partner of Tr&oacute;caire was murdered because of her opposition to a hydroelectric dam which was to be built on the land of indigenous communities in the Ag&uacute;an Valley.  She is just one example of an emerging global trend towards restrictions, threats and violence against organisations and individuals who speak up against the powerful in their societies.  Building up civil society therefore is an important part of development programming.  Irish Aid and the wider Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade should be commended on this country's support to human rights defenders.  Ireland is rightly seen as a global leader on the issue of protecting civil society space and should continue this vital work.</p><p> There is undoubtedly a growing trend toward the manipulation of aid away from poverty reduction and towards the security, commercial and migration policies of many donor countries.  Ireland has not gone in this direction and is to be commended on that.  The key message we have this morning is that the quality of Irish aid, which has been evident since the programme's inception in the 1970s must be protected at all costs.</p></speech>

I call Mr. MacSorley.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1339" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dominic MacSorley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017101900002#D00300"><p>Did I draw the short straw, coming third?  I saw the RT&Eacute; three-part documentary "The Thin Green Line", which is a contemporary story of the work of the Irish Government in its overseas embassies.  I hope all present saw it.  It is a really important statement of a nation that is operating at a global level and it gave an insight into Ireland's work and its significant influence abroad.  It really gave an insight into the work that Ireland is doing in New York, Paris, Geneva and Sierra Leone and the huge influence it is having.  That work needs to continue and needs to be reinforced.</p> <p>  As other speakers have mentioned, this is emerging from a tradition in which Ireland and its people have identified socially, politically and economically with the world's poorest.  That is something we can never be complacent about.  It is our responsibility to ensure that this heritage, which does not exist to the same extent in many other countries, is retained through the next generation.  Irish Aid is at an important juncture.  I think it is an extraordinary recognition that Ireland's Permanent Representative to the United Nations, David Donoghue, who I think will come before the committee, was given the role to co-faciltate this historic agreement.  The sustainable development goals are not just promises.  They cannot just be promises.  If one analyses them, there are in fact rights.  They are rights to food, shelter, education, health and protection.  We have to frame them.  There is a reason they are called promises, in the context of getting 193 nations to subscribe to them.  Internally, however, we can start to see those promises as rights and it will move from aspiration to obligation because that is the challenge that lies ahead.</p> <p>  One World, One Future is a great document.  It is a great aspiration.  It has nearly all the things in it that should be in there.  It was conceived before the sustainable development goals, SDGs, before the world humanitarian summit, before Brexit and before we faced a year in which 20 million people are facing potential starvation.  This is unprecedented.  The attention span of the global media is challenged by a consumption of irrelevant commentary from a President who tweets, as well as being consumed by the frequency of crises, but they are not coming back, are not analysing and are not pointing the finger as to how we can tackle these issues.  The goals are big, bold and ambitious.  The price tag is estimated to be around &euro;3 trillion.  At the high level conference, Professor Jeffrey Sachs was given the floor and he challenged people, the corporations and the private sector on the role they have to play.  The sustainable development goals will not be achieved simply by the work of the NGOs, the donors and the public.  The private sector has a critical role.  At the World Economic Forum, the discussion was about the role of the private sector and enterprises that combine profits with purpose.  We have good examples among the NGO community within Irish business, that is, in the Kerry Group and Accenture, where these companies contribute significantly.  These are positive examples, whether it is through the agriculture sector or health, in which Irish Aid, Irish NGOs, Irish private sector and the Irish public are in a partnership in a place like Niger or in Zambia.  In Concern's case, this is transforming - through climate-smart agriculture - the productivity of 100,000 farmers, most of them women who are now progressing from being unable to feed their families to becoming small business enterprises and sending their children to school.  It is not just about enough food but about the right food and nutrition.  These are amazing examples of success in a world that really needs to have them.</p> <p>  Aid has to stay untied and be principled.  We all work with multiple donors.  The shift of emphasis that is happening with some other donors is disturbing.  We are not seeing that with Irish Aid and we need to retain that.  We need to stay focused on resilience building and prevention of hunger.  We need to establish targets within a national action plan.  We believe that Irish Aid has a key role to play in what has to be a whole-of-Government approach as a key driver.  At European level, Ireland has an even bigger opportunity and a greater obligation now to have a principled voice, as well as a leadership role it can and should have in the delivery of principled poverty-focused aid.  </p> <p>  We should stay focused on poverty.  It is easy to say that Ireland has a focus on poverty but it is not just a slogan as it involves tough decisions about prioritisation and going into countries that face significant challenges.  There are major challenges in terms of security and corruption and we must focus on what we can and are doing within that.  With the quality of the work that Irish Aid is funding with organisations, we are doing work that is not simply about welfare, it is about using different models to transform the lives of people.  It is having a much greater impact.  I think the responsibility for us is that we need to capture these stories because we have to go back to the public and talk about the impact and how we manage to bring about these levels of transformation within these challenging contexts.  Our commitment is that we will stay true to our mission, that is, working with those in greatest need.  We will continue to subscribe to the highest standards of accountability, organisational transparency and efficiency that we have worked hard to achieve.  That level of transparency and accountability is of paramount importance right now because the scale of human suffering is of truly unprecedented proportions.  We need the full confidence and support of the donors, the public in particular, as we go forward.  We will continue to be a gateway for the Irish public and Irish businesses.  We will continue to work hard through various coalitions to ensure the messages are getting out.</p><p>Ireland will report next year in New York.  We have a good story to tell and we will have a huge opportunity.  The range of reports from countries have varied significantly.  Some of them were quite poor, some of them were very defensive and some of them were exceptional.  We have an opportunity, because we have a great story, to come back in and give exceptional leadership.  I will give one example.  Ireland provides five-year funding in the Central African Republic.  It is a country we do not hear much about because it is largely forgotten and it is not of strategic interest.  Ireland is the only donor providing that level of funding in order that programmes can be designed on a longer-term basis among communities in extraordinary flux.  Other NGOs are jealous and other donors are nervous because it is a level of leadership in a country that is unparalleled.</p><p> There is an opportunity for Irish Aid to review its partnership countries and boldly go into more of these countries, such as the Central African Republic, and add in the diplomacy for which we are known and the challenges about tackling conflict.  Ant&oacute;nio Guterres has the potential to be a great Secretary General.  He has challenged all of us to tackle the issues that create poverty.  In particular, he has spoken about assertive diplomacy in a world that is increasingly using militarisation to further its needs.  Ireland, in its agenda - which is the right agenda - to be on the Security Council, has a role to dig back in as a country that has overcome conflict, hunger and poverty to focus on these three key areas going forward, because we will not be able to embrace all of the sustainable development goals equally.  Let us stick to what the nation knows about, which is those three key areas, and we will prove to have a leadership role.</p><p> I was in classrooms a couple of days ago.  We always like to quote various people so I slightly paraphrased George Bernard Shaw when I stated the essence of inhumanity is not hatred but indifference.  In a world where we see political indifference from other countries we have the opportunity to be a greater shining light.  If we fail to act on the suffering of others we not only deny their humanity but we erode our own.  This is an opportunity for us to strengthen that even further.</p></speech>

With regard to Mr. MacSorley's concluding remarks on the 20 million people facing starvation at present and 65 million refugees worldwide, there really is a crisis.  There are so many crises throughout the world at present.  In our engagement with the Secretary General of the Department and Irish Aid officials, we spoke at some length about the potential of the knowledge transfer and the involvement of Irish companies.  They are now multinational companies, and great credit is due to them.  So many of those have become internationalised, particularly in the food sector, and there is great potential there.</p> <p>  The theme running very strongly through Mr. Meehan's contribution was his concern about a greater percentage of our aid going to UN-based organisations, the European Development Fund and other mechanisms, with a reduced amount going through our NGOs.  Is he concerned that aid going through the UN organisations and the European Development Fund goes to areas that do not reflect Irish Aid priorities?  Is that his concern?</p></speech>

Ireland's involvement in multilateral agencies is critical for a variety of reasons, including our political and diplomatic influence.  From our perspective, the NGO community, civil society in Ireland, and the missionary community as Ms Foster-Breslin spoke about, have lots of capacity, and we feel we have the potential to do more, deliver more, grow our programmes and respond in very practical and immediate ways to the needs of vulnerable people.  Irish Aid recognises this.  The issue for us is not that the money is being misdirected, it is about balance and appropriate levels of support to multilateral organisations and appropriate levels of support to the Irish NGO community.  We have shown our ability to respond effectively.  As Mr. MacSorley pointed out, many of the places where we work are failed states or states that are extremely vulnerable.  More and more, the emphasis, the funding and our time and energy are going into those places.  We have the capacity to respond in these countries.  We have relationships and sophisticated mechanisms of response, and we believe Irish Aid already knows this.  As I stated in my opening statement, we believe Irish Aid should review the balance of that spend.</p></speech>

At times, all of us ask why humanitarian aid does not reach particular areas or regions.  Do the UN-based organisations and other transnational organisations not have greater capacity than NGOs to get assistance to the most needy in a quicker manner?  I am posing this as a question and not a statement.</p></speech>

As we have said this morning, we value the multilateral institutions.  They do work in difficult places.  There are issues about them and around them, and there have been many attempts to reform the UN system over the years, most of which have ended in failure.  We believe it is a responsibility on Irish Aid to ensure the funding goes to those places where it can be most effectively used and used most quickly to respond to those who are vulnerable.  It is about the balance.</p></speech>

Following from what the Chairman has said, we share those concerns on funding and the increasing securitisation agenda, which is not helping the aid agenda.  It is very difficult to find out exactly where aspects of the European Development Fund go and what exactly it is being spent on.  We would very much share those concerns.  The other side of the coin is the tax issue and tax justice.  Unless we get this piece right also we are in danger of giving with one hand and taking with the other.  It is vital that we state this.</p> <p>  There must be engagement with parliamentarians and Ministers in the countries.  I have seen very good examples of this partnership, whether with an NGO or a missionary order.  Do the witnesses envisage more space for their work to continue this and engage parliamentarians of the areas in which they work?</p> <p>  Do the witnesses have confidence in the oversight and implementation of the overseas development goals?  Next year Ireland will report.  What is going on in the meantime?  Do the witnesses have an input in the oversight implementation agenda?</p> <p>  There is no doubt there is pressure to keep our aid untied, and we are responding well to it, but we see a change in other countries whereby aid is tied in with trade.  There is an opportunity for us to be a leader, as the witnesses pointed out.  Even though it is a long time coming, the human rights and business report is nearly there.  It was good to hear what was said about Niger and that we are an example there and in the Central African Republic.</p><p>I was at the launch of the UNFPA's Worlds Apart report on reproductive health and rights for women and girls, which is part of the conversation about empowering women.  Giving women and girls in the countries where the witnesses work that empowerment or capacity to make decisions is very low down on the agenda.  I know it is very difficult because of some of the societies where they live.</p><p> I was interested to hear about Irish Aid reviewing the partner countries because there are other countries which we could look at.  I have seen Irish Aid in action and I know the effectiveness of the work it does.  Is Irish Aid getting to a point with some of its projects of letting go because it has done what it can?  This would create space for other projects to come in.</p><p> We are not as aware as we should be of the pressure on African countries in terms of refugees and migrants.  Look at what Uganda and Kenya are working with.  We know about the Rohingya people coming into Bangladesh.  These countries are vulnerable and are trying to tackle the root causes of poverty for their own populations and the pressures they face.  At times, their responses are much better than ours with regard to the humanity and compassion they show.</p></speech>

Politicians and people at home are watching this and the witnesses are speaking in terms of being one of the best in the world.  This is the type of language and message people want to hear.  There was mention of a high-quality approach, being poverty focused and identifying with the world's poorest of the poor.  The witnesses have a really positive message to get out there.  Part of my concern is that we are probably not winning enough people over to the message.  The witnesses spoke about getting Irish people involved in overseas development aid and development issues.  How important do they see politicians travelling to look at Irish Aid's projects?  How important is it to have these champions, that is, people who can go back to their communities and explain to people, who still feel the brunt of austerity and everything else, that they are getting quality and bang for their buck and every cent is being spent in the right way?</p> <p>  I share the concern of the witnesses about multilateral funding and I have raised this here and in the Chamber.  We spent &euro;188 million on overseas development aid through EU institutions.  We have never had anyone before the committee to tell us where it went.  The Minister comes in, and we have officials in, and they outline figures, but I genuinely do not believe we have the capacity to dig down and see exactly where all the money is being spent and whether it is being spent wisely.  I understand the common-sense approach of multilateral funding when it comes to the likes of Ebola, AIDS and vaccines.  All of this makes sense, but there are other smaller projects and the concern is when it drifts.  We hear stories, from people coming back, about jeeps and staying in the best hotels.  This is when people lose the message.</p> <p>  My party supports the 0.7% of GNI target for overseas aid and I believe all parties here do.  For the viewers at home, how is GNI calculated?  What is the difference between it and GNP?  People speak about accountability, transparency, confidence building and planning for the future.  How important do the witnesses believe it is for the Government to document how and when it plans to reach the UN target of 0.7%?  When we look at graphs, it is difficult to find out how we will come to it.</p> <p>  With regard to policy coherence, it is not only about quantity of aid, it is also about the quality.  We would all agree that to improve the quality of overseas development aid, we must have a whole-of-Government approach.  How do the witnesses believe the Government is doing in creating this effective policy coherence?</p> <p>  I understand the difference between tied and untied aid, but perhaps the witnesses will expand on it for our viewers.  What is the difference?  The witnesses state Ireland's approach is unique.  In what way is it unique?  What do some countries do with their tied aid?  Do they dump corn, food and their own products on local markets?</p> <p>  Ireland has been described as a tax haven.  Many NGOs, including members of D&oacute;chas, rightly point out that tax havens deprive developing countries of much-needed tax revenue through illicit shady deals and corruption.  People state, unfortunately, that Ireland is playing a double game in this regard.  We have built up a reputation as a tax haven.  How does this impact on our international credibility when it comes to overseas development aid?  How damaging is it to Ireland's tax policy in efforts to create a fair and equitable world?</p> <p>  The least developed countries were mentioned, and they seem to be under threat.  We met the target of 0.15% of gross national income in 2015.  The witnesses mentioned they are concerned about where this is going.  Will they expand on this?</p> <p>  Disability inclusion is an area that has received more focus, and this is with regard to 100 million people around the world.  How is Irish Aid focusing its overseas development aid on disability inclusion?  How do we rank internationally in this work?</p> <p>  I am excited by the idea of training the trainers.  A programme is set up, and it is not just the NGO but the local community.  Will the witnesses expand on this?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1351" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Dominic MacSorley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017101900002#F00300"><p>That is an excellent range of questions.  I will address a number of them and pass others to my colleagues.  I will come back to the multilateral issue, which has come up a number of times.  The UN is a very flawed system and even the UN agencies themselves are beset by bureaucracy.  We went through a transformative agenda under Valerie Amos, and when we finally came out of it, it had improved levels of coherence and co-ordination at country level.  NGOs are now permanent on the humanitarian country teams, which are the co-ordinating bodies in Juba in South Sudan and Nairobi in Kenya.</p> <p>  Ireland and the NGOs do not operate in isolation.  We operate in co-operation with others.  If we want to influence the UN, we must pay into it.  That is the reality.  In many cases it is doing extremely strong work with restricted resources.  That being said, it comes down to simple issues and we are now tracking the efficiency and speed with which funds get dispersed.  In Somalia, Irish Aid and others will simply contribute to an emergency pooled fund which will get divided out, because contractually it is easier than writing a cheque for four different agencies.</p> <p>  Our experience of documenting the progress of this is it took us nine months to register and get formal acceptance within the UN system before we could even access these funds.  This comes down to bureaucracy and not having the right systems.  From our side, the committee can be assured we will track this and come back and state it is not working at optimum level and achieving what it should.  Let us improve it rather than cut it and let us also ensure we continue to expand the remit of NGOs.</p> <p>  The point on politicians and champions is key.  We really welcome the fact politicians will travel over and come back and become champions.  Beyond this, I will pick up on what Mr. Meehan said on the development education programme.</p><p>The Irish Aid programme, for example, is funding the schools debate programmes right across the country.  Last year was the first year it was an all-Ireland process and a Northern Ireland school won.  Northern Ireland had not been part of that for almost 30 years and at that time parents were uncomfortable about their children travelling across the Border.  As part of this process, the winning team will go to Ethiopia or Tanzania and they are extraordinary ambassadors not just now for their own peers, but for life.  It changes them and they start to read newspapers and pick up these issues.  They are interested and get into politics.  This cannot be underestimated.  Sometimes the development education programmes seem to be the easy ones to cut but they are not.  They are critical and facilitate connections.  In some ways, building connections between Irish civil society, such as the rape crisis group working in Kosovo or Teagasc working in other areas, adds value.</p><p> The burden of refugees across the globe has been mentioned and the Rohingya is a very good example.  Bangladesh is half the size of Ireland but it has a population of 162 million.  It is already hosting 400,000 Rohingya and now there are 500,000 on top of that.  Over a period but most recently, they have taken in close to 1 million refugees, which is the same as Germany.  The challenge is that natural disasters resonate with the public and donors in terms of response but conflict disasters do not.  When we tracked how long it took to raise &euro;1 million, it took 24 hours after the Haiti earthquake and nine days after the Nepal event.  It has taken us 90 days to raise &euro;1 million for the Horn of Africa food security crisis because much of it is conflict-driven.  Through the most recent Disasters Emergency Committee, DEC, appeal in the UK, the Rohingya crisis has only raised &pound;7 million.  If we are going to work in these areas, we must formulate plans to ensure donors and the public respond to these human crises.  The price tag for the people at the end of it is no different, whether it is an earthquake or other crisis.</p></speech>

We are members of Coalition 2030, which is a civil society network of domestic agencies, the environmental pillar, trade unions and international non-governmental organisations, NGOs.  We can say as part of the coalition that we know Departments are engaging on the SDGs and there is much talk about them.  We also know the Central Statistics Office, CSO, has a team examining data.  Are we confident there is enough oversight or it is ambitious enough?</p> <p>  I have two concerns.  If this is just about data gathering for whether Ireland is on track, we are really missing the ambition of the SDGs and we must go much further by not only seeing if we are on track in Ireland, but asking whether we are playing a role in influencing Europe and really pushing leadership around the SDGs in our partner countries.  I do not see that happening yet and the data is not being gathered.  I would really like to see it.</p> <p>  I will also admit that we have often put on the table the need for a stakeholder forum to journey throughout the process.  The truth is we are two years in now and only this week was the first meeting of the senior officials at a cross-departmental meeting.  Is this the urgency we need?  This is two years on.  The voluntary national review will be in July next year but in other countries, this has been an 18-month participatory process.  We do not yet know what the Government is thinking.  We need to do much more and there needs to be much more urgency around this issue.  There seems to be renewed talk about it and we are confident that this week we will hear more and the coalition will certainly be involved with some of those discussions.  This must be a multi-sector forum and it must involve politicians, the private sector, civil society and many other key stakeholders.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1354" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Heydi Foster-Breslin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017101900002#G00300"><p>There is the matter of multilateral funding.  UN or pooled funds can be slow to be dispersed.  Agencies in countries are uniquely equipped to respond to crises as they have strong ties.  I can speak for Misean Cara members and we are in over 50 countries.  The wide geographical spread of effort should not be confused with debt; we like to say the people are there before, during and after a crisis.  There can be extraordinary achievements as a result of missionaries working in communities over many years, coming to understand challenges faced by a community and being part of it on a daily basis.</p> <p>  We want to focus on least developed countries and not just countries in the news, surrounded by Europe or seen to have refugee or migration crises.  In this part of the world one often hears about economic development work in Africa but we need to do this in every continent.  I can speak for my own part of the world.  Femicide is at its higher there than in other continents and a woman is being killed every single day.  We can see what is happening in Honduras, El Salvador and Venezuela, as well as Guatemala, my own country.  It is absolutely horrific so let us not forget other continents.</p> <p>  I can give many examples of our members working to support communities struggling with the effects of climate change.  There has been talk about big agencies.  Usually with missionaries, and particularly Irish missionaries, one wonders if the process is working.  I am the product of Irish missionary work.  I will not say my age but 40 years later, I can say it does work.  If one wonders how a girl from Guatemala makes it to Harvard, it is because of Irish missionaries.  This works but development takes time.  It is not just about the countries around Europe.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1355" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr &Eacute;amonn Meehan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017101900002#G00400"><p>On engaging with parliamentarians, I think of the work of the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA.  I know many Members of the Oireachtas are members of AWEPA.  It is an initiative that has delivered many positive outcomes over the years and it would be wonderful to see it renewed.  It would be wonderful to see more Members of the D&aacute;il and Seanad involved with AWEPA, creating environments and spaces where parliamentarians from the countries where Irish Aid and the NGO community works have the opportunity to visit and engage.  Ultimately, this is about creating local structures that are successful and generate and promote good governance, as well as the space for civil society.  More and more what we see is authoritarianism, poor governance, increasing corruption and a narrowing of civil society space where even community and small human rights organisations no longer have the space to operate.  They are under pressure and staff are detained or watched.  How they get their money is monitored and it is increasingly difficult for the organisations that are critical to progress, development and good governance.  Years ago when Mr. Nelson Mandela was in Ireland, in response to a question about what Europe could do for Africa, he said that African leaders need to think deeply about what they can do for their own people.  He stepped down as president after one term, which was central to that idea.  More political engagement is critical.</p> <p>  There is a path to the 0.7% of gross national income goal.  We would like to know whether the timeline is 2025 or 2030, as we recently heard both years mentioned.  Irish Aid has indicated that if we hit the goal, the organisation would come under stress because of the amount of money involved.  If there is a plan and the Department and Government have time to plan and put in place structures, systems and people, it is all readily achievable.</p><p>On the matter of tied and untied aid, tied aid is essentially as much about the donor country's government as it is about the recipients.  It may not be poverty-focused.  Much of it may be tied to contracts and business from the home country receiving the aid.  Much of it never leaves the capital city of the donor.  It may be tied to the purchase of food for delivery and distribution.  On tax havens and transfer pricing, it is clear that more money leaves the Continent of Africa through the use of tax havens and transfer pricing than goes into development co-operation and that is a real problem.  Work to address it is going on but it really needs significant attention.</p><p> On least developed countries, LDCs, I was shocked when I saw that figure when preparing for this briefing.  Some 0.15% of gross national income is the UN target for funds to go to least developed countries in aid and very few countries meet that target at the moment.  It is a shockingly small amount of money for the most vulnerable countries and people on the planet.  In local communities, as Deputy Crowe was saying, training for transformation is an essential component of the work of organisations such as Tr&oacute;caire and those who work through Misean Cara.  It is ultimately about strengthening local capacity, civil society, governance and communities.  Sometimes, the structures and systems that we, in the West, put in place cripple local initiative, enterprise and opportunity.</p><p> It would be a valuable use of this committee's time to ask where the European Development Fund, EDF, goes, and to ask about the European Union's development policies and the Mediterranean.  Mr. MacSorley mentioned that Europe has taken several million refugees.  Uganda has taken in 2 million refugees from South Sudan.  Refugees are a geographic problem.  It would be very useful to better understand what is now driving EU development policy from Brussels and where that money goes.</p></speech>

Our colleague, Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan, does excellent work for the Association of European Parliamentarians with Africa, AWEPA.  She is a great champion of the organisation and does a huge amount of work to facilitate meetings.  Many of us would like to give more time to it but pressures on time from committees and other commitments do not allow us to give as much time as we would like to that organisation but Deputy O'Sullivan's work with it is exemplary.</p> <p>  I will call my colleagues, Deputy Noel Grealish, Senator Ivana Bacik, Senator Billy Lawless and Deputy Se&aacute;n Barrett.  I ask that one person respond to each topic from the questions since we are unfortunately under serious time constraints.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1358" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1313" speakername="Noel Grealish" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017101900002#H00300"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  I acknowledge the tremendous work that Irish Aid does.  In my own constituency of Galway, we have a little organisation run by Ronan Scully called Self Help Africa.  I acknowledge the tremendous work that he does.  I am a big supporter of Irish Aid.  When the budget is being dealt with, we always get constituents asking why we send so much money abroad and saying that we should look after our own first, but I am a firm believer that we should support the most vulnerable in the world.  Many of us here have visited various projects through the years.</p> <p>  Ms Keatinge said there are four famines at the moment.  I remember reading a newspaper article recently stating that famines in Africa are now worse than they were in the 1980s when we had Live Aid, which put it on the world stage.  Unfortunately, we do not have Live Aid now, and we do not have Mary Robinson or Princess Diana, who put famine on the world stage.  Mr. MacSorley mentioned that we do not see famine in the news any more or on any television programmes.  We see President Trump and his tweets and terrorist attacks that take place around the world.  Africa is put far down the list on the news, except for the matter of migration.</p> <p>  Ms Keatinge said that 130 million children do not receive education.  That is frightening.  That has a huge knock-on effect and is an issue that has to be addressed by all aid agencies worldwide.  Ms Foster-Breslin mentioned missionaries in Lusaka.  I paid a courtesy call to the parliament there and met 12 members.  Eight were taught by Irish missionaries and the respect that Irish missionaries have abroad has to be acknowledged.  I am proud of that when I go abroad and see the impact that Irish missionaries had through the years.  Unfortunately, we do not have missionaries to send now but there was a knock-on effect.</p> <p>  Mr. Meehan mentioned projects.  What is the biggest project that money is spent on?  Is there a level of corruption in some of these countries, meaning that Mr. Meehan might have to pay somebody off to go in to try to develop a project, such as a politician or other person?  Self Help Africa's project in Zambia is boring for wells for water and that is a very important thing since water supports crops and animals.</p> <p>  I compliment the witnesses on the tremendous work they do abroad and I firmly support my colleague in saying that we need to go abroad and look at these projects as politicians.  Unfortunately, the media will put in a freedom of information request and call it a junket, but it is important that we go and see projects first hand.  Those people are human beings, the same as us.  I went into a school one day and it had one biro between 15 students.  We throw them in bins while we are walking.  The little things that we take for granted are very important to them.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1359" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1402" speakername="Ivana Bacik" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017101900002#H00400"><p>I thank the witnesses for the excellent presentations.  I join others in commending the great work done by NGOs with funding from Irish Aid.  As Ms Keatinge said, it is timely and important that we review the Irish Aid programme.  It is great to hear from all the witnesses and from Mr. Niall Burgress and Mr. Ruair&iacute; de B&uacute;rca.</p> <p>  On the issue of the 0.7% target, on 5 October I asked Mr. Burgess when he was here about the Government's commitment to a roadmap to reach that target, on which I know the witnesses are all in agreement.  The response was not entirely positive.  The response was that as the Irish economy was growing, this 0.7% would in fact be a large amount of money in absolute terms.  Will any of the witnesses say a little more about how they anticipate the realistic prospect of reaching that target, particularly in the wake of the recent budget and the increase there?  Do they see that as part of a process or do they feel that was somewhat disappointing?  I would be interested to hear how they feel we are approaching the idea of a roadmap.  The issue of multi-annual funding and long-term funding is crucial.  I was at a recent seminar with fundraisers where they made the point that it is crucial that one is not limping from year to year with annual funding.  Multi-annual funding makes it much easier and more efficient to plan and look at sustainable development.</p> <p>  On the question of multilateral aid versus bilateral aid, I am somewhat concerned that there is a message that bilateral aid is good and multilateral aid is bad.  I hear a somewhat different emphasis.  Mr. Meehan made the point very clearly that he believes the balance has tipped too far towards multilateral funding and that it should be rebalanced.  Is that reflective of the entire membership of D&oacute;chas?  Is it a particular Tr&oacute;caire view?  The response from Concern was slightly different.  There was one line in the Concern submission that I felt was very strong, that bilateral and multilateral channels are critical for systemic change.  Looking at the Irish input into the negotiations of sustainable development goals and how important those are, we must see development in multilateral, global terms.  It is crucial that message comes strongly from this committee too, particularly, as is in the Tr&oacute;caire submission, when there are efforts to undermine the legitimacy of multilateral organisations like the UN.</p><p>Something we have heard at this committee that is of real concern is that with Brexit, the EU development budget will be greatly reduced.  Surely at this time Ireland should be stepping up to the plate, as Mr. David Donoghue has done for us at UN level, to restate firmly our strong commitment to multilateral development and to reaching sustainable goals as part of a united group of nations.  We all have criticisms of UN bureaucracy but I refer to Mr. MacSorley's point about reforming from within and Coalition 2030.  There is an enhanced role, as I understand it, for NGOs at UN level and that seems to be a better way forward rather than saying we must rebalance our aid programmes and being so critical of multilateral organisations.  I hope I have not got that wrong.  I just want to be clear that the message from this committee is not that we feel that bilateral is better than multilateral.  Clearly our bilateral links and the strength of organisations on the ground that have long relationships are hugely important.  However, we have to work really intensely at the multilateral level.  To me it is not a bad thing that our ODA spend in multilateral organisations has increased.  I did not really hear why Tr&oacute;caire is saying it should be rebalanced other than concern about bureaucracy in the UN, but I think there are other ways of dealing with that.  I am sorry for going on about it but I feel so strongly that with Brexit, Trump and so on we must restate our commitment to multilateral efforts.</p><p> Following on from that, Ms Keatinge mentioned the day of the girl and Deputy O'Sullivan mentioned the UNFPA report.  I know we have a submission from the Irish Family Planning Association and I am a member of the all-party group which it facilitates on sexual and reproductive health.  Crucial to attaining so many of the sustainable development goals, STGs, is a commitment to improving sexual and reproductive health and rights, particularly for girls and young women.  Ireland has been a stalwart supporter of UNFPA.  To me that is one of the strongest multilateral programmes in development because that is the UN agency that provides sexual and reproductive health services in over 150 counties and territories so it is hugely important.  Do the witnesses believe Ireland should be doing more on this?  We are already have a strong commitment.  However in the wake of Trump, clearly UNFPA funding is under threat.  Can the witnesses comment on that?</p><p> To come back to the issue raised by Mr. MacSorley of Concern about the review of key partner countries, as he pointed out, Ireland traditionally has a commitment with key partner countries in southern and eastern Africa.  I have been to some of those countries and I have seen the great work being done but the witness asked if we should also have a commitment to the Horn of Africa and central Africa.  I would like to clarify that.  Does the witness mean we should be reduce the commitment to some of the current key partner countries or that it should be in addition to those countries?  Again the multilateral approach is crucial because we have committed to certain countries, as I understand from having visited them, and other EU countries have committed to countries they might have stronger bilateral links with.  That is very important that there is no duplication and that we are efficient in terms of delivering development aid.  Can we refocus our efforts in other countries in the Horn of Africa and central Africa without negotiating that with other EU countries that may already have strong bilateral programmes running through which we could channel our funding more effectively to deliver real change for people on the ground?</p></speech>

It was super presentation and it makes me proud to be Irish when I see the achievements of Irish Aid over the last number of years.  Most of my questions have been covered by my colleagues.  However, one issue that concerns me is my adopted country, the US.  We see a complete change in direction from this administration, which is really frightening.   I refer to immigrants, refugees and asylum seekers.  One really disturbing thing to see is young children being stopped at the border with South America, including children from Ms Foster-Breslin's country of Guatemala.  These children are as young as six years old.  They are on their own, are given no legal representation, have no one to look after them and are being deported immediately.  It is outrageous what is happening there.  How is it affecting our relationship with the United States in regard to aid to the Third World or countries that need it?  Is it affecting our position because many of us are very concerned about the humanitarian aspect and the United States.  Being one the largest countries in the free world, there is much to be concerned about.  Is this change of direction affecting our position overseas?</p></speech>

I do not want to repeat what other people have said.  Perhaps these questions have been answered.  What percentage of the aid received is used for education?  Is there a deliberate attempt to ensure that a certain percentage of aid goes to educating people?  To me that is very much part and parcel of the problem the world is facing.  There is also the question of hunger but education is a huge issue in many areas in terms of lack of progress.</p> <p>  I visited Somalia approximately 20 years ago as a public representative.  It was the most horrific scene I have ever seen in my life.  I am horrified that 21 years later there is practically no improvement.  I refer to the same old problems, whether religion, people grabbing power or whatever.  I saw little children of three, four and five years of age and the only piece of clothing they had was a vest and the only bit of food they had was one bowl of rice per day.  When I came back I said that if anybody talked to me about poverty in Ireland I would scream.  The message that we, as a society, do not understand the poor standard of living in many of the countries that have not experienced a great deal of progress must be constantly and loudly and clearly made.  I thank the Chairman and I would be interested to hear the views of the witnesses.</p></speech>

We need to take the questions individually.  One person can respond to each of the subjects.  I call Ms Keatinge.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1366" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Suzanne Keatinge" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FDJ2017101900002#J00700"><p>I will take Senator Bacik's question about the roadmap and whether we think this is realistic.  It is important to say that the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Coveney, when he was introducing Irish Aid's recent annual report, said that we were not going to get much this year but that he was willing to commit to a dramatic increase after that.  He went so far as to say that he supported the idea behind a roadmap.  It is going to be very important for us to keep him to that.  There are a couple of things I would like to stress in that regard.  The reason we keep talking about a percentage is so that it allows that amount to go up and down depending on the economic growth situation.  That is really important.  The sustainable development goals may be aspirations but they also relate to rights and obligations.  That 0.7% target is an international commitment that the Government has consistently signed up to.</p> <p>  I would like to reference what Mr. Meehan said earlier.  We have seen the timeline shift.  This was meant to be achieved after the millennium development goals in 2015.  Then the date changed to about 2020 and then it shifted again to 2030.  In our submission and in our press release after the budget, D&oacute;chas said this needs to be achieved by 2025 if we are to achieve the ambition of the sustainable development goals.</p> <p>  There was a variety of questions and lots of specific ones, including one on disability inclusion.  The issue of tax came up as did the issue of sexual and reproductive health.  I do not think we are all experts on each of them.  However, if there is an opportunity, we will make submissions to the committee on specific themes.  D&oacute;chas would be very open to doing that and to facilitating those kind of conversations.</p><p>I thank Ms Keatinge.  I agree with everything Senator Bacik said about the importance of the multilateral system.  It is increasingly important in today's world.  There is no question about that.  In the submission to this review by the D&oacute;chas humanitarian working group, there was a very clear issue for that group about the very sudden shift in percentages for the D&oacute;chas humanitarian group.  The spend from Irish Aid went from 20% of ODA to 12%, with a very rapid scaling up on the multilateral side.  I think its question refers that.  Is there sufficient thought in that?  Is there a very strong rationale for that?  As the group suggested, perhaps a value for money assessment could be undertaken on that if that trend is to continue?  We need a multilateral system, and we need it like we have never needed it before.</p></speech>

However, the concentration of aid cannot be allowed to result in people being left behind in other countries.  This is somewhere where we might in differ.  Misean Cara is in over 50 countries.  Poor people in countries that have a attained middle income status are especially vulnerable in this regard.  Inequality is a major development challenge.  The OECD Secretary-General, Angel Gurr&iacute;a, stated that we have reached a tipping point, that inequality can no longer be treated as an afterthought, that we need to focus the debate on how the benefits of growth are distributed and that work on inclusive growth has clearly shown that there does not have to be a trade-off between growth and equality - on the contrary, the opening up of opportunity can spur stronger economic performance and improve living standards across the board.</p> <p>  Development efforts then should address the needs of the poorest people in countries that are exhibiting development at a macroeconomic level, with a view to ensuring an equitable distribution of resources and access to opportunities.  We believe that the Irish Aid programme should therefore remain open to funding targeted initiatives in countries where such needs exist.  Often a relatively small investment can make a significant contribution to justice, equality and the realisation of human rights.</p> <p>  Again, while economies of scale are desirable, space has to be afforded to small-scale interventions.  Often, these can act as incubators for innovative strategies that can later be replicated at scale.  This was the case for a small education project in Zimbabwe, where a particularly successful methodology for accelerated literacy and numeracy education was used subsequently by UNICEF at a national level.  </p> <p>  On the comment about missionaries and being proud when finding them when visiting other countries, we do not see the numbers declining.  We do not see borders.  One example is the Daughters of Charity, which has 21,000 members.  How is the missionary movement declining?  We work with 91 congregations and each congregation could have from 250 members to 21,000 members.  How is that declining?  We are alive and we are thriving.  It is an energetic and innovative missionary movement.  It is a fantastic Irish legacy and it is going to be there for a long time.  Members will be able to be proud of the Irish missionary movement for many more years.</p></speech>

I thank members for their comments.  We could be here a lot longer but we cannot afford to be.  I have one point in response to Deputy Grealish and Senator Bacik.  I refer to the scale of the famines and the comparisons.  The drivers now are very much around conflict and that is the key change from 20 or 30 years ago.  In regard to the US, we are concerned about the budget but at a broader level and at a political level, one just has to look at North Korea to see that diplomacy has been abandoned in favour of militarisation.  If we are going to use this, then we have to say that Europe needs to step up and become an alternative voice.  Ireland has a role, whether it is in tackling or reducing the tensions which might result in a catastrophe or in dealing with the drivers of conflict at a famine level.  The positive thing to take out of this is that it is all preventible.  The technology is smarter and the early warnings and the early actions are all there.  There is a transformation in that &euro;500,000 can be transferred from Dublin on a Thursday evening and be spent by women in remote isolated villages in Somalia on Saturday morning.  It is not always an absence of food but an absence of cash.  This is the 21st century.  Solutions are there and they have prevented famine in Ethiopia.</p> <p>  We talk about corruption and these governments but zero tolerance is the way to go.  We also have to acknowledge and communicate to the public that Ethiopia committed &euro;350 million of its funds, becoming the second largest donor after the USAID, to combatting the food security crisis last year.  This is the essence of partnership.</p></speech>

However, one cannot dig down into the multilateral support.  Some of that will go on education but that is not clear from the statistics.  Some 4% of what it could track went to education.  However, there is likely to be more spent on education.  </p> <p>  I might make one other point around policy coherence.  I know that this is a review looking specifically at Irish Aid but I think policy coherence is Irish Aid across into other areas of government.  The two that stand out for us would be climate change and our policy on refugees.  This review should not be completed without that policy coherence across areas.</p></speech>

Currently, Ireland chairs what is called the Nordic Plus donor group.  It is a really interesting group of like-minded countries and Ireland's leadership in chairing that, and specifically Irish Aid's leadership in chairing that, shows that when Ireland puts its mind to it, it really can form very strong influential relationships that drive agendas.  While it might be diplomatically quite hard to navigate what is happening in the US, Ireland is stepping up into that leadership role with other countries, and as other speakers have said, becoming an influential voice at EU level within those donor countries to mitigate the worst effects of what one cannot stop.  That is what we would like to see more of and we would commend Irish Aid for that.</p></speech>

Deputy Grealish and other members referred to the outstanding work that your organisations and other sister NGOs or missionaries do abroad.  We want extend to all the people working out there our very best wishes.  We understand and appreciate they are working in the most difficult of conditions in so many parts of the world where there are crises and are getting assistance to the most disadvantaged people in our world today.  I live in Cavan town beside a small convent, the Holy Rosary Convent.  The convent houses retired nuns, many of whom are quite elderly and who were involved in teaching and in the health services in Africa.  They were literally pioneers many many decades.  They did outstanding work and it is always a joy to listen to the different stories of their work.</p><p> As Ms. Foster-Breslin mentioned, great success followed from that work, from training and upskilling people and providing services where none existed.  As Irish people, we are all very proud of that work and of the work carried on by both lay and religious missionaries across the world today.  Perhaps Ms. Foster-Breslin might convey to her colleagues the appreciation of this committee and of the Oireachtas in general for the outstanding work they do among the most disadvantaged and underprivileged people.  I thank the witnesses very sincerely for their presentations this morning.  We will no doubt have further engagement as the work of this committee continues into 2018.</p></speech>

Mr. Donoghue is very welcome to today's meeting.  He has joined us on many previous occasions, most recently in 2015 in his role as co-facilitator in the negotiations on sustainable development goals.  On behalf of the joint committee, and indeed the Oireachtas, I congratulate him on the work he undertook to ensure a successful outcome to those negotiations and the establishment of the SDGs.  He recently retired from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and I wish him well on his future endeavours.</p><p>The conclusions and recommendations of the review currently being undertaken by this committee will feed into the Department's recently announced review, making our current series of meetings both timely and extremely relevant.  The format of this engagement is that we will hear Mr. Donoghue's opening statement before going into a questions and answers session with the committee members.  </p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the public gallery to ensure that their mobile phones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting as even on silent mode they cause interference with the recording equipment in the room.  I also remind members of the longstanding practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>I call Mr. Donoghue to make his opening statement.  I am watching the monitor here as I am due to speak in the D&aacute;il chamber.  If I leave the Chair during Mr. Donoghue's contribution, it is not out of any disrespect.</p></speech>

It is a pleasure to be back here in a new capacity.</p><p>As was said, I have recently retired from the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I will make a few opening remarks about the importance of the 2030 Agenda for sustainable development and about the role Ireland can potentially play and the leadership which we can continue to exercise in regard to implementation of the new agenda.</p><p> It was a great honour and privilege for Ireland to have been asked to take on this role and I can safely say that it has enhanced our standing at the UN and that is good for a number of reasons.  We are in the phase now of implementation and the important thing is to keep momentum going worldwide in terms of getting early progress on the 17 goals and the 169 targets.  Targets are the subsidiary goals under each of the headline goals.  The entire package or agenda also contains an important political declaration and a set of detailed arrangements about how we are going to monitor and review implementation of the STGs worldwide, at regional level and nationally.  The entire package is called the 2030 Agenda.</p><p> In each country arrangements are being, or have already been, made to co-ordinate their own input into the worldwide monitoring and review exercise.  It is not for me to set out the arrangements which have been made in this jurisdiction, but I am aware of them and they follow the pattern set in other countries - in other words, a couple of government ministries take the lead but their mandate is to ensure that there is a whole-of-government approach to implementation of the STGs.  I have to say that this time around, it is not just for governments.  There are many other stakeholders - I am sorry to use the jargon - but I cannot find any alternative to it.  The UN refers to them as stakeholders and that really means in no particular order, civil society, the private sector, parliaments, both national and local, and the scientific and research community.  There is a vast array of partners which will be called upon to help implement the goals, so it is not simply a government-to-government exercise.  It could not be as the scale of the goals is so big and the scale of the funding required is so big that one has to have private sector involvement, although on carefully agreed terms that reflect the concept of sustainability.  It is a huge enterprise in every country but it is for governments in the first instance to establish arrangements to ensure coherence and effective co-ordination across the board.  It is also expected that in each jurisdiction there would be arrangements to bring the voice of civil society into the process.  Again, it is not for me to comment on that but I know that Coalition 2030 has been founded here which brings together 100 NGOs that are interested in different aspects of the STGs, and I welcome that.  It is a very good move and I hope that Coalition 2030 will be able to play its part in the preparation of Ireland's report.</p><p> Perhaps I should say at this stage, although I am sure the committee is aware of it, that next July Ireland will be one of a number of countries that will present a review of its own performance in implementing the STGs so far.  Again at the risk of telling the committee something it is already aware of, there is a UN organisation called the High Level Political Forum.  It is a gathering that takes place every year.  It involves minsters, representing all the member states, who come together to do a number of things.  They review one big theme relating to the STGs, but they also give the opportunity to UN member states to carry out so-called voluntary national reviews, that is, to present an account of how they have fared so far, what challenges they are finding and what opportunities that they see.  The point is to encourage mutual learning.  It is not meant to be a process of putting countries into the sin bin.  It is meant to help weaker administrations, in particular, to learn from their neighbours, to pick up good ideas and to come away encouraged in terms of the further implementation.</p><p> I emphasis the word "voluntary" national review.  Although a country like Ireland would have had no problem in presenting its account, there are many developing countries that were fearful about the global north, as it were, imposing its own standards and expectations on them, in particular against a background where many of these countries have tiny, or even no, bureaucracies.  They did not want to find themselves forced to account for insufficient performance so that is why in the STGs document we had to emphasise at every stage the voluntary nature of the these national reviews.  However, Ireland's review will be next July.  So far, approximately 66 countries have made voluntary reviews in the two sessions of the High Level Political Forum that have occurred since the STGs were adopted.  It meets every July for approximately eight days with Ministers there for most of that time.</p><p> A key moment for Ireland is the presentation of its national report and its national action plan.  I understand that the Department of Community, Climate Action and Environment will be in the lead in preparing for that process.  That is a very good thing and I would hope that it would be as inclusive as possible, and I have no reason to imagine that it would not be.  If Ireland can set a good example by having an arrangement which allows civil society and other key stakeholders to have an input into it, that would be a very good thing.</p><p> There is a meeting of the High Level Political Forum at Head of Government level every four years.  The first such meeting will be in 2019.  The purpose of that is to enable governments at the highest level to have an overall strategic view of what needs to be done globally and regionally.  We will be working up to 2019 when every government will be expected to field its Head of Government.  It is important that Ireland puts its best foot forward not only because of our particular association with the negotiations but, more importantly, because this is a country which is valued at the UN for its strong commitment to development, to human rights, to equality and inclusion and to all the key themes in the document.  It is important that we, even as a small country with limited resources, do the best we can to demonstrate the seriousness with which we are taking this new agenda.</p><p> I will take another European example.  Germany was one of the star performers in the early stages, partly because Chancellor Merkel, as a former environment minister, was particularly keen on the STGs.  In various ways, the German system has moved quite rapidly to provide momentum nationally.  There are other counties that also see themselves as market leaders and I hope that Ireland would be able to take its place there.</p><p> One of the early things that had to be done by every country was to align the STGs with its national development plan and-or its national strategy on sustainability.  That was done in the first year or so in most countries.  One can imagine that for developing counties the national development plan is the bible for their government activity, so the STGs now inform and underpin the national development plan in those countries.</p><p>I imagine that process will be completed over the next couple of years.  Leaving aside what we are doing domestically to meet the goals, which will be the subject of the report, we also have an opportunity through the Irish Aid programme and our other international interactions to help developing countries to reach the goals.  I imagine that will also be a big theme of our national report.  The Irish Aid programme, which the committee has been discussing lately, is highly respected at the UN.  It is one our assets, and I daresay that it may have been one of the reasons Ireland was asked to take on this role to begin with.  We have a fair amount of standing in regard to sustainable development, and therefore we should use the potential of the Irish Aid programme to help our partner countries reach the goals.</p><p> Of course, it is a utopian agenda.   It is made up of 17 goals which cover almost everything under the sun.  It is hard to think of anything which is omitted from the SDGs, and it is breathtaking, in a way, to imagine that each country will have achieved the complete agenda by 2030.  If I can be allowed a personal reflection, however, having been through the process, the key factor was that no country in the world wanted to be left out of this project.  A  country may have been afraid of some of its aspects or expectations, but on balance each country felt that it had to be inside the tent rather than outside.  I am thinking here not just of tiny developing countries that have almost no administration and no capacity, but also of larger countries which might have had - I am picking my words carefully - questionable human rights records.  They might have felt that they would not be able to live up to the high standards set in the document, but even those countries decided that they had to be in.</p><p> To use my own phrase, I think that part of it is the risk of political embarrassment.  To put it in a more positive way, we need to use political peer pressure in order to get the goals achieved.  Let me come up with a hypothetical example, and this really is a hypothetical.  Let us imagine that we are talking about the Central American countries.   Mexico is a regional leader.  However, it might be the case that Guatemala is doing better under the education goal than Mexico.  Mexico then has an incentive to pull its socks up and to sprint ahead on the education front in order not to be embarrassed regionally.  I know that is a bit basic, or perhaps a bit human, but that is the glue that keeps the entire project together.  No country wants to be embarrassed, humiliated or, in some way, isolated and, therefore, every country has signed up, and has signed up without reservation.  I was relieved that we managed to get the document through in August 2015 without any country entering reservation, which would have hamstrung us from the beginning.</p><p> Every country has signed up to the exact same document without variation or reservation.  The test will be delivery, and whether we can get the completion of all the goals by 2030.  In practice, some countries will decide that they want to prioritise.  Wearing my official hat as the father of the SDGs, as it were, I would have to say that is not valid.  All 17 goals are equally important and interconnected.  However, I sometimes use the example that Austria is unlikely to focus too much on the oceans goal, being a landlocked country.  That is an example of how there will inevitably be some differences.  In the case of Ireland, there will be official expectations that we achieve all the goals or show that we have done our best to do so, but in practice I imagine that at the outset we will pick a number of them where we have a pretty good story to tell.  I am only just imagining that.  Officially, however, I would have to say that we will need to show that we are addressing every goal and all the interconnections between them.</p><p> Of course, those interconnections are a challenge for our governmental system as we know it.  If one accepts that health and education, for example, are deeply interconnected and if one throws in nutrition and access to water, then one must find ways to ensure all relevant Government Departments must be able to capture and work on those interconnections and avoid thinking in silos.  It is said at the UN that above all, the agenda has to be held together.  There can be no cherry-picking and no division of the agenda into one set of goals versus two others.  It is a highly ambitious, perhaps utopian agenda, but the fact that every country in the world has agreed to it is unprecedented, and we need to build on that.</p></speech>

It is great to hear from somebody who was so closely involved with the development of the SDGs.  I compliment Mr. Donoghue, on behalf of the committee, on his incredibly important role in co-chairing the process.  It is a remarkable achievement to have every country signing up without reservation.</p><p>It is particularly interesting for this committee, which is in the process of carrying out a review of Irish Aid.  We heard earlier from a number of non-governmental organisations, NGOs, and from D&oacute;chas.  I do not know if the witness heard the discussion, but it considered multilateral versus<b></b>bilateral delivery of aid.  I am interested in the witness's view, as the co-chair of the SDG process, on the importance of multilateral aid programmes.  An argument was made by D&oacute;chas and particularly by Tr&oacute;caire that Irish Aid should rebalance and move more towards bilateral rather than multilateral aid.  Some of the people who spoke to the committee expressed concern about a lack of transparency as to where money directed to multilateral aid goes.  The Concern representative then spoke about reforms at UN level that were addressing some of those concerns.</p><p>Delivery being crucial, could Mr. Donoghue say how we can deliver on the SDGs, not just in Ireland but elsewhere?  How important is multilateral aid in this regard?  Could he say something about the reforms of the UN development system?  Earlier, the committee heard comments about &quot;bloated bureaucracy&quot;.  As somebody who believes passionately in multilateral approaches to aid and development as being more effective and sustainable, I would like to know how we can ensure the transparency we are looking for in multilateral aid and what the UN is doing to ensure better transparency and reform.</p><p>My other question is about our progress report in July 2018.  I am interested to note that the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment is co-ordinating that work.  Could Mr. Donoghue say whether it is appropriate that the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade would not be the lead Department on it, as I had assumed it would be?  We know how important climate change and climate action are, and I presume that is the explanation, but just perhaps Mr. Donoghue can tease this out.</p></speech>

There were mixed feelings about the millennium development goals, MDGs, that preceded the SDGs.  Does Mr. Donoghue think we have learned any lessons from the MDGs and how do the SDGs differ from them?  I wish to follow up on Senator Bacik's point about monitoring.  Mr. Donoghue has experience of the Irish system.</p><p>Given that we have such a broad group of stakeholders, how does Mr. Donoghue see that progress being monitored, people being involved in the debate and the roll-out?  That is the key component.  I would have thought the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, but Mr. Donoghue has also mentioned the Department of Education and Skills and the Department of Health.  I do not know how that is going to be done.  Will there be different sectors, with the Minister going through each one?  I am a bit all over the place when it comes to it.</p><p> UN reform is very important, and it is an extremely important international organisation.  Many would have concerns about the Security Council and the veto of the permanent members and the whole process being deeply undemocratic and unequal.  Is there any appetite for UN reform in this regard, and can Mr. Donoghue see it happening any time soon?</p><p> I am conscious that the witness has a background in refugee issues.  Will he expand on that work and the impact that the New York Declaration will possibly have on the global refugee crisis?  I am very conscious of the fact that we are dealing with an unprecedented number of refugees and internally displaced people around the world, with the figure of 65 million one that is quoted all the time, and the significant humanitarian crisis.  We have been critical of the EU-Turkey deal and in relation to Libya.  This deal, which we are facilitating, will be discussed at EU level in the next couple of days.  It involves pushing people back into detention camps.  In some cases women are being tortured, there are ventilation and sanitation issues, and the people are being treated like commodities.  Does the witness have any concerns about our approach to these deals we are doing to try to deal with the migrant crisis that is clearly happening in various parts of the world, but particularly in Europe?</p></speech>

Senator Bacik raised the question of multilateral versus bilateral aid.  That is an old debate, of course.  I was at one point the director general of Irish Aid, so I remember it from then.  There are different merits in each form of aid.  Multilateral means that one can perhaps get more value for one's money, because ultimately it is put with a lot of others'.  The problem, however, is that it is less visible and recognisable as Irish aid.  Bilateral aid, on the other hand, is something upon which we clearly have our own imprint.  On the sustainable development goals, SDGs, believe it or not, official development assistance, ODA, as such was not particularly examined in the context either of finalising the SDGs or of looking at the funding, which is the subject of a separate agreement.  There is an agreement called the Addis Ababa Action Agenda, which was negotiated more or less in parallel with ours.  It focused on the financial and non-financial means which we would need to implement the new goals.  There was not that much interest expressed, odd as it may seem, in the relative merits of multilateral and bilateral aid, because we are going to need a level of funding for the implementation of these new goals which is so vast that it puts ODA of any kind into the shadow.</p> <p>  For example, about two years ago the World Bank produced a document, called From Billions to Trillions, and even in the title we can see that the billions, roughly speaking, are what one gets by adding up the current levels of ODA of whatever kind and the potential for further ODA, for example, from the Gulf States, who up to now have not done very much.  However, there is a limit to the amount of ODA that can be got from anywhere.  If we talk about trillions, on the other hand, that is where we factor in private sector funding.  The estimate is that it would take about $4.2 trillion dollars a year for the 15 years to get the SDGs implemented.  Of course, that is a very general assessment and it can be debated in many ways.  However, if we take that as even halfway accurate, $4.2 trillion, then the total amount that can be supplied by present or future ODA, whether bilateral or multilateral, is relatively insignificant.  Far more can be provided through other sources.</p> <p>  For example, and this is something I learned in the subsequent negotiations I did about migration and refugees, to which Deputy Crowe just referred, the level of funding available from remittances is greater than ODA contributions.  That is just by way of a general comment that ODA, seen through the UN lens, is relatively, I will not say unimportant, but secondary.  Domestic resource mobilisation is another big theme.  That means helping developing countries to improve their administrative systems and combat corruption in such a way that they get more of a tax take.  Domestic resource mobilisation would be seen as the second biggest objective.  ODA would be a main instrument, then domestic resource mobilisation, then there is debt relief, preferential trade arrangements, and then there are many other remittances and forms of financial assistance.  That is a general comment.</p> <p>  Coming back to the particular merits of one over the other, I personally have some sympathy with the point which the Tr&oacute;caire colleague apparently made.  I do think that we need to play to our strengths, and Ireland is a country which is known primarily for its bilateral involvement in partner countries.  That is where we have built up a reputation.  It is for debate whether one would label a particular school "Funded by Irish Aid" or not.  While that is another issue, we are known generally for the quality of our bilateral aid.  In whatever arrangements are made, I would not want to see that dimension diminished too much.  That is just a personal view, and I emphasise I am no longer in any position of responsibility, so this is not necessarily Government policy.</p> <p>  Some balance roughly like what we have at present is probably the right one.  Of course, a lot depends on the quantum of aid that we are administering.  There could be staff implications if we were putting a lot into the bilateral area.  One then has to factor that through.  One advantage of emphasising multilateral aid is that it is being left in the hands of others, notably the UN and the EU, to track and demonstrate what is happening with the expenditure.  There can be risks attached to it, but on the whole I think it does work.  There is no easy answer to this debate, and I would like to see something along the lines of the present balance maintained.</p> <p>  Moving to the reform of the UN development system, since the SDGs came into effect, the entire UN system has been almost revolutionised.  Practically every topic which comes up at the UN is prefaced in terms of implementing one of the goals.  It is now the bible for the UN across the board.  It is even coming into the Security Council, and I will come back to Deputy Crowe's very interesting point in a moment.</p><p>The Security Council, strictly speaking, sees itself as the place where decisions are taken about international peace and security, but it is a perfectly reasonable to make the point that we will never get lasting peace and security in any part of the world if problems of serious under-development are not addressed.  They are linked, so it is perfectly legitimate for the sustainable development goals, SDGs, to now be discussed in the Security Council.  That said, some members of the Security Council prefer to try to keep things separate.  However, it is reasonable to imagine that the SDGs should now govern everything that the UN does.</p><p> The deputy Secretary General of the UN is Amina Mohammed, who is a former Nigerian Minister of Environment.  She was also the special representative of then Secretary General Ban Ki-Moon for the SDG negotiations.  She is intimately familiar with the SDGs, and she has the role now, under Secretary General Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, of supervising a whole set of institutional changes at the UN to follow through on the logic of the SDGs and overcome the silo thinking.  That applies to the UN agencies, in particular.  Some agencies are better than others at recognising that we are now in a much more interconnected world, where no agency can operate on its own.  This has implications for the field, as they say, because one has an in-country UN presence which has had a rather loose co-ordination up to now.  However, one consequence of the SDGs is that in, for example, Liberia or Nigeria, the so-called resident co-ordinator, overseeing the ten or 12 UN agencies, which would typically be there, would have a far greater role, including with the local government, in order to help it to implement the SDGs.  Both the changes being made at headquarters to give effect to the new logic of the SDGs, and the changes being made to field operations, are attracting a lot of attention at the moment at the UN.</p><p> I have to say that the UN has never been a particularly effective organisation.  One of the many strange things about it is that there is very little movement between headquarters and the field.  I come from a national diplomatic service where it was par for the course to go abroad every couple of years.  The UN does not operate that way.  Certain countries establish what are almost national rights to particular positions at the headquarters.  It is very hard for the reformers to break that up, and to get the mobility between headquarters and the field which we, in a national context, would regard as vital.  Obviously, bad habits develop if somebody has been in the same post for 20 years.  I will let that go for the moment, but transparency and accountability are the key words at the moment at the UN, particularly because we have a new Secretary General who is very able and very committed to improving its functioning, and the SDGs are the context for him to attempt that.</p><p> The issue of our own national arrangements have been raised.  It is not really for me to say, but I think the particular committee involves all relevant Departments, including the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, so I have no doubt that we will have input into the work of that committee.  However, I am not privy to the exact arrangements for co-ordination.</p><p> Deputy Crowe asked about the lessons learned from the millennium development goals, MDGs.  There are a number of key differences between the MDGs and the SDGs.  One difference is that there were only eight millennium development goals.  They were focused on the traditional development priorities of health, education and so on.  They did not go into the environmental area or the economic area.  As such, the first major difference is that the SDGs are far wider.  As the figure of 17 goals compared to eight implies, they cover a much wider range of policies.  The second difference is that the MDGs were dreamed up by a couple of UN officials and announced.  They were never negotiated.  This time around, the feeling was that every country in the world had to have ownership of the goals for them to work and be accepted.  That meant that the likes of my Kenyan colleague and I were needed in order to broker this agreement.  We had to produce successive drafts of the document until one day, with the sixth draft, we got it.  That meant that every country had a veto on every word of the document.  When one bears in mind that there are 193 countries in the world, and one is not just talking about one person per country, but possibly an entire cabinet and civil service.  It is formidable.  That is another key difference.</p><p> The biggest difference between the MDGs and the SDGs is that every country in the world is now operating to the same plan, as it were, for the 15 years.  The MDGs were seen as the rich countries saying to the poor countries, "This is what we want you to do if you want to get official development assistance, ODA, from us".  I am simplifying a bit.  This time, however, we are all on equal terms, so all 193 countries are operating to the same plan, with no special arrangements for any country.  We are all setting out together on this journey, as it were, towards 2030.  That is called universality.  This is the first time the UN has ever done this.  It is the first time that every country has agreed to the same vision for what its society should be achieving, and that is unique.</p><p> Another important difference is that we built arrangements to monitor and review progress into the SDGs.  There were no such arrangements in the MDGs.  We also built in a separate agreement, the Addis Ababa action agenda, on the detail of the financial and non-financial means that would be needed to implement the goals.  There was no such agreement for the MDGs.  Something came along a few years later, but it was separate.  Many people said that a weakness of the MDGs was that eight goals were announced, but no funding was announced with them, and therefore they were never likely to be achieved in full.  Very roughly speaking, one could argue that we achieved about 60% or 70% of the MDGs.  I am making a sweeping generalisation here.  However, that is mainly because China was able to lift itself out of extreme poverty within a generation.  That achieved one of the goals handsomely, but then some of the other specific goals fell short - I emphasise that 60% or 70% is just my very vague indication.  We included in the SDGs the remaining work that has to be done to complete the MDGs.  They were folded into the new agenda.  I am fairly certain that when it comes to 2030 there will be a further set of goals for the next 15 years.  I think this approach is now here to stay.</p><p> A member made a very good point about monitoring.  Given the breadth of stakeholders involved, and all the people I mentioned earlier, it is difficult to see how each country will do it.  One could have, say, a national council for sustainable development or for the SDGs, which would try to bring the key players, government and others, under one roof.  That is an option which some countries have gone for.</p><p> Strictly speaking, the question of the Security Council and the veto is off to one side as an issue, but I am happy to deal with it.  The veto available to the five permanent members of the Security Council is an old chestnut that has been debated backwards and forwards for more than 20 years.  The basic issue of reforming the membership of the Security Council has also been debated for 20 years, and I am afraid we are no further along today.  This is partly because there is no particular deadline which would force the permanent five to agree to widen the Council in a particular way.</p><p>Different models are available, each of which brings in major regional players.  In one model they would have permanent seats.  In another they would have almost permanent or semi-permanent seats.  The rest of us have not made up our minds, but there is no particular guillotine or deadline by which we should make up our minds.  This means this unhappy state of affairs continues, whereas with the strategic development goals, for example, my Kenyan colleague and I were able to say that a summit coming up in September 2015 to announce new goals for the next 15 years was a deadline we could not let slip.  We then created an artificial deadline of 31 July that year by which we stated we had to have the negotiations finished.  People told it would leave us with six weeks and asked what would we do then.  Even though it was artificial, we insisted on a deadline and we said we would finish on 31 July.  We actually finished on 2 August.  We need deadlines and it is as simple as that.  The Security Council matter will drag on because there is not that pressure.</p><p> On migration and refugees, I was asked to co-facilitate, that is, co-chair, a separate process last year which led to the New York Declaration.  This is the first global agreement ever on migrants and refugees.  This may seem strange, but the reason is that refugees are already well covered by the UN in a strict sense.  We have an agency that deals with them, the UN refugee agency, UNHCR.  We also have the Refugee Convention of 1951.  Up until now, migrants, as in the 244 million people in the world deemed to be migrants, have not been seen as a matter for the UN because some countries maintain the degree to which they take in migrants is a matter for themselves and that it should not be the basis of an agreement at UN level.  However, that thinking has been superseded.  The New York Declaration involved 193 member states and they all agreed to a set of commitments about the most vulnerable migrants.  Economic migrants who might go from Ireland to Australia do not particularly need assistance at UN level, but the thousands of people leaving Syria certainly do, and this is what the New York Declaration is about.  It was a very difficult negotiation because there were so many conflicting points of view.  I was teamed with Jordan, which had its own issues and particular needs as one of the two or three host countries which carry unbelievable burdens.  One third of the population of Jordan consists of refugees.  We got an agreement, which I think is a good one, and there are now follow-up processes to come up with a specific global agreement on migration and another specific agreement on refugees.</p><p> To answer the Vice Chairman, I do not have any particular role in the oversight of the strategic development goals.  I will follow them with great interest.  Internationally, I am asked to speak from time to time about certain aspects of them.  In a vague way I am seen as a kind of godfather of them, rightly or wrongly.  My Kenyan colleague is approached in the same way.  I do not have any particular role in Ireland's implementation of them, at least not so far.</p></speech>

It is a great privilege for Ireland to have somebody of his stature who has been involved in setting out these 17 principles to be followed.  The average man or woman on the street knows nothing about this, and this is the big weakness of these bodies and aims.  How do we bring it down to that man, woman and child in order that they understand what is being tried here?  The aims are very worthwhile, but there needs to be buy-in.  It is the buy-in part that I feel is a bit at sea.  We never read about this in our daily newspapers and very seldom do we hear it being discussed on television or radio.  What would be the case if somebody went out with a microphone and asked the man or woman on the street whether he or she knew anything about the sustainable development goals?  It is a terrible shame, given the amount of work and good being done behind the scenes.  The buy-in is the most important thing as we all should appreciate what is trying to be achieved here.  Does Mr. Donoghue have any suggestions for a group of politicians such as ourselves as to how we could begin to seek the assistance of the public in trying to get buy-in for this idea?</p> <p>  I have had the pleasure of being in the United Nations.  It is out there and does not seem to connect with individual governments.  It is never discussed at government level.  There are representatives such as Mr. Donoghue, and all of this good work goes on behind the scenes.  I do not want people to think of the good work achieved by Mr. Donoghue and his Kenyan colleague and the 17 goals as something about which something had better be done and a report produced.  We really have to buy in to this as a society, along with everybody else.  This is where a committee such as this, or a parliament such as this, needs to be made aware of what all of this is about.  Not alone should there be an annual high level political forum assessing progress but we have to assess progress as a parliament.  If I am to learn anything from today's meeting, it is that we as a committee should try to make certain that at least twice a year a couple of hours are put aside in the Seanad and the D&aacute;il to look at how we are doing on these goals.  This is the only way I can think of.  I ask Mr. Donoghue's opinion on whether there are other ways we could make certain the good work being attempted does not just drift away, and that while people think it is a good idea, they have other things to be doing.  I would appreciate Mr. Donoghue's views on this.</p></speech>

Most of the questions have been asked already by my colleagues.  History keeps repeating itself, and something that disturbs me at present is the terrible Rohingya refugee problem.  It is ethnic cleansing and nothing less.  What is the United Nations doing?  What is happening there?  Why are we not able to act more quickly when these terrible tragedies happen?  I am based in the United States and I see the treatment meted out now to Hispanics, Muslims and people from other countries.  The Irish were treated exactly the same during our terrible famine from 1845 to 1852.  We were treated just as badly, if not worse, in the United States when we had to emigrate.  History seems to be repeating itself all the time.</p> <p>  Why do the wealthy Arab nations not contribute in the same proportion as the rest of us?  They have a huge responsibility.  They are trying to democratise themselves but they do not seem to be giving great example by way of foreign aid.</p></speech>

For example, there is Palestine and the blockade and embargo affecting Cuba.  A delegation from the foreign affairs committee visited Georgia some time ago and the witness is a former ambassador in that area.  We can see Russian aggression and movement there.  It comes back to where the United Nations, UN, is on those kinds of matters and specifically the role of the UN Security Council.  It must be very frustrating but this also raises questions about the effectiveness of decisions taken at the UN.</p></speech>

I strongly agree with Deputy Barrett's comments.  We have this disconnect in a way between, on the one hand, the enthusiasm that greeted the agreement on the sustainable development goals, SDGs, in New York on the part of many governments and, on the other, that the ordinary man, woman and child on the street does not know about them.<br/><br/>We always knew there would be a major challenge in communicating the new goals.  During the negotiations, I remember a British film-maker, who has a passionate interest in sustainable development, came up with a plan that might sound crazy.  He had it in mind that within approximately three days of the goals being agreed, he would have communicated them to all 7 billion people on the planet.  That would be done with every conceivable form of social media.  He did not pursue the plan but one can see that he saw a problem that needed to be addressed.<br/><br/>Younger people have a key role to play.  We hope this agenda will be completed in 2030 so, in a way, this will build the kind of world they will live in then.  We all noticed that when the SDGs were adopted, young people were the most enthusiastic.  They grasped that this could be quite important for the quality of their own lives.  It comes down to education in schools.  I will come to the committee in a moment but in every country we must start teaching the SDGs in classrooms and bring them to the attention of schoolchildren.  That is accepted in the UN and there are many initiatives under way in different parts of the world to raise the profile of the SDGs.  Much depends on the initiative of the individual country.  I was in Germany at a conference a few months ago and, to my amazement, when I was on a tram I saw the full SDG poster on it.  There are 17 icons and it is quite a well-known poster at this stage with a simplified version of the 17 goals.  This was all over the tram.  Clearly, some local initiative looked to highlight the goals and I remember thinking I would love to see them on the 46A bus, for example.<br/><br/>The roles of this committee and the Oireachtas in general can be very important.  We mention parliaments in the SDG document and the declaration.  Parliaments, whether regional, local or, in particular, national, can hold governments to account for their performances.  The Deputy is absolutely right that it is not just a case of having an annual meeting at the UN.  I drafted most of the document and my Kenyan colleague and I envisaged that parliaments would have the role being spoken about.  I say this not necessarily in an accusing way, but in a constructive fashion.  I hoped parliaments would invite Ministers or civil society representatives, as this committee just has, and ask them what can be done to ensure we have a better story to tell on nutrition, human rights or whatever.  That is something being taken seriously by many parliaments.  Members might recall when they came to the UN in a formal capacity just before the goals were adopted.  Even then there was a sense that parliaments would be a key player in directing political attention and focus on these goals.  Ultimately, that will come down to the initiative of individual parliaments and committees.  I would have thought it would make sense to ask relevant Ministers, as well as civil society and private sector representatives, to contribute.  The private sector is very interested in a constructive way in these goals.  The committee might consider inviting relevant people to come before it as the report is being prepared over the first six months or so of the coming year.  I would think that would be in the spirit of the SDGs agreement.  It is a collective effort and not just the responsibility of the Government.  Parliaments can fill the gap in a way.<br/><br/>Senator Lawless spoke about the Rohingya.  I left the UN approximately six weeks ago and at that point it was the top priority for the new Secretary General.  That does not mean there will be the kinds of solutions we want to see.  What we have witnessed over the past few months is a desperate position.  The parallels described of Ireland's experience are very real and clear.  I am afraid much of this comes down to the political will on the UN Security Council at any given time.  In fairness, there is more or less universal condemnation of the treatment of the Rohingya.  In a way, I am moving to the question of the effectiveness of the UN.  I will try to avoid naming specific countries when speaking about the UN Security Council's current construction.  If there are five permanent members, one of which is Russia, and matters arise where Russia wants to block progress, that is a possibility.  By way of balance, there are times when Israel would be in the dock, as it were, and it would rely on an ally.  It is a fundamental weakness of the current arrangements that five members of the UN Security Council have permanent status with a veto to go with that.<br/><br/>An initiative has been launched by France at the UN whereby the veto would be waived voluntarily in the discussion of mass atrocities.  For example, if a Syria-type case is being discussed, the five permanent members would voluntarily waive those veto rights.  It is slightly torturous as if one simply changed the UN charter in order to eliminate the veto, it would itself be blocked, leading to a catch-22 situation.  There must be some sort of voluntary code, meaning that all five could decide, in a Syria-type discussion, not to invoke a veto.  For different reasons, most of the five would not want to change the <i>status quo</i>.  They want to cater for positions where they would feel they have a natural interest.  Currently, the French initiative has not gone very far but it is supported by many other countries of the UN.  They feel something must be done to prevent the kind of stalemate that happens all too often.  It happened with Syria, for example.  The Rohingya matter is ongoing but we have all seen how particular valuable initiatives are thwarted because one or other member of the P5, as they are called, is unhappy.</p></speech>

Ireland is renowned for its peacekeeping and we should be very proud of our achievements.  The peacekeeping college that we have in the Curragh has done tremendous work in educating those from other countries who wish to learn how we perform our peacekeeping duties.  It is a skill in itself.  We do not go in with heavy armour but with trained individuals whose practices in how to engage in peacekeeping have been handed down over many years.  It is fascinating to see Irish troops in places like Lebanon.  My wife came with me when I was Minister and she was taken by people in the Defence Forces to visit homes and talk to people.  This is the sort of thing that Ireland is expert at,  yet I never hear our peacekeeping college being spoken about enough to educate people that we have this expertise.  I had a very bad experience which I will not go into here in public, but it is not appreciated.  We have got into this European habit of seeking greater co-ordination on security and we seem to be protecting ourselves and Europe instead of looking at how we can influence peacekeeping throughout the world.  It is very important to us and it is part of the goals that Mr. Donoghue is talking about.</p></speech>

One can spend billions on other things but if there is not peace, one is throwing the money out a window.  Peacekeeping seems to have taken a lesser role.  I was reading the other day about how the European Commission is trying to progress greater co-ordination for our defences in Europe.  We are a neutral country and we should be proud of it.  We are a great help to the rest of the world because of our peacekeeping efforts.  I am interested to hear Mr. Donoghue's views on how it can be got across that peacekeeping should be prioritised as highly as security and other aims or achievements that we would like to have.</p></speech>

The new Secretary General, Ant&oacute;nio Guterres, has put conflict prevention at the top of his agenda for his term in office.  He wants to demonstrate that the UN has a key role to play in preventing and managing conflict.  He highlights the activities that the UN does well, such as peacekeeping and peace building, in which Ireland has been active.  He represents that as being linked to the sustainable development goals, SDGs, and states that if the UN can strengthen its conflict prevention and management role, it will help to achieve peace and that, in turn, creates an environment in which SDGs can be implemented.  He is right, and the Deputy is right in referring to goal 16, which talks about peaceful and inclusive societies.  There is a peace goal because we call recognise that there cannot be lasting development without peace.</p> <p>  I was with the former UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, about three years ago when he visited the Curragh.  He was highly impressed by what he saw.  In the White Paper which appeared about a year later, there was reference to a proposal which would involve expanding the scope of that college.  That is a great idea.  There is a job to be done to highlight the importance of our contribution at the UN, both in the Curragh and in the field.  We have a reputation for always stepping up to the mark when the UN asks for a contribution to sensitive peacekeeping missions.  We are seen as both effective and reliable.  We may not have huge resources to contribute but we are highly respected for the quality of the contribution we make.  I hope that we can continue to maintain that reputation.  We are getting slightly off the main topic here, but I am very sympathetic to what the Deputy was saying.</p></speech>

He was at this event while 17 October is the UN's International Day for the Eradication of Poverty and the organisation All Together in Dignity has an event at the famine statues.  Many of those involved in projects in the north inner city and south inner city that work with extremely poor, marginalised and vulnerable people gather there and are remembered.  There is a link between their stories and sustainable development goals and they really try to make people aware of real poverty and what it means.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Donoghue for attending, for the amazing CV that we all got a copy of and all the work that he is done, which is rewarding, frustrating and challenging but extremely positive.</p></speech>

On behalf of the committee, I thank them for coming and offer my sincere apologies for having asked them to exit quickly earlier.  The format of the meeting is that the witnesses will be invited to make brief opening statements, which will be followed by a question and answer session.</p> <p>  Before we begin, I draw the witnesses' attention to the position regarding privilege.  Witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members should be aware that under the salient rulings of the Chair, they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I remind members and witnesses to turn off their mobile phones or switch them to flight mode.  Mobile phones interfere with the sound system.  I advise the witnesses that any submission or opening statement they make to the committee will be published on the its website after this meeting.</p> <p>  I now invite Mr. Kane to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

I thank the committee for inviting me to attend.  As members know, I chair the oversight group that will review A Vision for Change, the national policy on mental health.  I am doing this in a voluntary, no-fee capacity and I am not an official in the Department.</p> <p>  The Joint Committee on the Future of Mental Health Care and our oversight group share many of the same concerns.  We are both concerned with ensuring that there is a long-term vision for mental health care.  We are both aware of the responsibility to meet the mental health needs of all of the citizens of Ireland.  Perhaps crucially, we are both aware of the need to ensure that our recommendations are informed by the realities of our mental health services while also balanced by the improvements that we must see forthcoming.</p> <p>  The starting point is the background to both of our discussions, namely, A Vision for Change, which set out a ten-year policy framework for Ireland's mental health services.  While its term came to an end last year, its recommendations helped to shape our current mental health system and many of these remain at the heart of effective and appropriate mental health services.  The policy proposed an holistic view of mental illness, recognising that biological, psychological and social factors contribute to mental health problems.  It proposed a person-centred approach, recognising a need for the voice of the service user to be heard, and highlighted the importance of community and social inclusion in recovery, with interventions aimed at maximising recovery.</p> <p>  We cannot ignore the fact that issues exist within the mental health system.  Difficulties in recruiting staff, such as consultant psychiatrists across all specialties and psychiatric nurses, have had a significant impact on the delivery of services.  We can also see disparity in the HSE performance reports, with some areas enjoying excellent levels of staffing and low waiting lists while others are not so fortunate.  However, it is important to note that progress has been made in implementing many of the recommendations contained in the report.  A number of service improvements have been implemented in parallel with the accelerated closure of old psychiatric hospitals and their replacement with bespoke new facilities that are better suited to modern mental health care.  Service improvements include the development of adult and child and adolescent mental health services, coupled with shorter episodes of inpatient care, the adoption of a recovery approach in the delivery of services and, crucially, the involvement of service users in service planning and delivery.  The importance of working collaboratively with service users and their family members and carers was formally recognised in 2016 with the establishment of the Mental Health Engagement Office within the HSE.</p> <p>  Other ongoing developments include the development of counselling services at primary and secondary care levels, for example, early intervention at primary care level; a greater awareness of fostering mental health promotion in society through campaigns like Let's Talk and #LittleThings; the publication last year of the expert review group report on the Mental Health Act 2001 and the suicide prevention strategy Connecting for Life; a reduction in the child and adolescent mental health service, CAMHS, waiting lists for those waiting more than 12 months, although there is still more work to be done in that respect; and the commencement of work on the new national forensic hospital to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.</p> <p>  These achievements are all steps in the right direction.  However, in taking any further substantive step towards positive change, we need to first ensure that we are all travelling in the right direction.  Any action taken must be evidence based and continue to carry the ethos of person-centred care that was originally espoused in A Vision for Change.</p> <p>  With this in mind, an evidence-based expert review was commissioned by the Department of Health in September 2016 from Work Research Centre.  This evidence review examined the implementation of A Vision for Change and considered how future policy and services might be better directed.  The review was completed in February and provides evidence to determine the policy direction for a revision of A Vision for Change in terms of international best practice and the experience of implementing the policy.  The report covers the following main topics: mental health situation, policy and services in Ireland today; prioritising mental health as a major societal issue; primary prevention and positive mental health; recovery, social inclusion and living well with mental illness; mental health care provision; and mental health system governance and financing.  It presents a broad overview and mapping of evidence and developments in the mental health area that may be helpful in guiding policy development and practice.  It does not present recommendations.  Rather, it provides an unbiased resource from which information can be drawn.</p> <p>  The next step was the establishment of the oversight group to oversee additional policy priorities for mental health based on the outcome of the expert review.  I was appointed to chair that group on 18 July and its membership will be finalised by the end of this month.  We held an initial meeting of the group on 5 October to discuss our final terms of reference and finalise our membership.  Further to this group, we will have a stakeholder consultation and appropriate additional advice and input will be sought throughout the process.</p> <p>  The priorities of the oversight group will include, but not be limited to, the following: primary prevention, early intervention and positive mental health; the integration of care and delivery systems between primary and secondary services; the development of e-mental health responses, which is important for younger people, who are more familiar with this area; workforce planning, forecasting and skill mix, including mechanisms to attract and retain staff; emerging needs of vulnerable groups, people with comorbidities and specialist needs informed by the relevant clinical programme; and the development of research, data and evaluation capability to ensure that the achievement of the best mental health outcomes can be demonstrated within the resources available.</p> <p>  The oversight group will be requested to produce a high-level policy framework that sets out future service priorities.  We will submit our report for consideration to the management board in the Department of Health and the Minister of State for mental health and older people, who may subsequently submit proposals to the Cabinet sub-committee on social policy and public service reform for approval.  While the work of the oversight group is just beginning, we must ensure that our final recommendations are implementable and achievable.  Initially, we will focus on what will be good outcomes that demonstrate a better life for those who access the services.  With this in mind, it is planned that a successor policy to A Vision for Change will include a multi-annual implementation plan to inform the allocation of resources in future years.  As committed to in the D&aacute;il, the HSE will be directed to develop a multi-annual approach to the development of mental health services.</p> <p>  I would be happy to address whatever questions or comments that members may have.</p></speech>

We will rely on bringing in other expertise and views as required.  I can give a flavour of the kind of people already on the group.  In addition to me as chairman, there is Mr. Liam Hennessy, who is the Health Service Executive's head of mental health engagement, and who describes himself as a patient of the mental health services.  We have Dr. Philip Dodd, the national clinic adviser and clinical programme group lead for mental health, a consultant psychiatrist with a special interest in learning disability.  Dr. Amanda Burke is an executive clinical director for the Galway-Roscommon mental health services, Dr. Fiona Keogh is a senior research fellow in the National University of Ireland, Galway, and Ms Martha Griffin is an expert who works in Dublin City University as a lecturer.  Dr. Shari McDaid is a lecturer in mental health reform, Ms Yvonne O'Neill is head of planning and performance and a programme manager in the HSE, Mr. Leo Kinsella is a HSE area manager, and Mr. Colm Desmond is principal officer in the mental health division of the Department.

If we start from that position and are guided by that vision and those outcomes, we will try to deliver that.  We will look at the evidence and expertise that will guide us to delivering the policy.  Our hope would be that the policy would set the outcome measures and we would work from that basis.  That is instead of coming up with a list of resources required to do something.  We are going with what we are trying to achieve in the outcomes first and then trying to match what we need to deliver that.  We will also consider evidence in that area.  With regard to Healthy Ireland, there will definitely a focus on trying to prevent people becoming unwell, intervening earlier, building resilience and having a clear focus as we progress.  It is a matter for a wider group and we will have cross-departmental and agency support in trying to bring in other stakeholders to achieve that.</p></speech>

It takes a cross-departmental and whole-of-Government approach, and this is crucial for it.</p> <p>  My next question relates to our new communities.  A Vision for Change was published 11 years ago and society has changed enormously since.  Our population has increased and we are facing challenges that we never had to face before.  For example, there are refugees from countries where they experienced female genital mutilation, and there is psychological damage arising from that, not to mention the appalling physical damage.  Will the group be able to build that kind of consideration into its work?  We have experienced social changes in recent years, and even in the past six or seven we have seen an impact from social media on every one of us, never mind vulnerable young people.  How will that be built into the consideration?</p></speech>

We will consider e-health response as well and part of that will examine good use as well as negative impacts.  We will consider how to ameliorate the problem and work with stakeholders in the area.</p></speech>

I have a specific interest in certain areas.  I worked as a pharmacist before I got involved with politics.  I saw a significant increase in the use of medication for children with mental health issues.  I have a personal opinion that this is something that must be examined in a radical way, particularly overuse of products, and I often feel that because of the strains on the system, children can be prescribed medication because the time may not be there to deal with issues through cognitive behaviour therapy or more appropriate treatment.  We need to investigate the matter and I ask the witness to consider some expertise in that area for the committee.</p> <p>  I would also like the group to examine education and primary education in particular.  Children's brain development is most active in those years and well-being and mental health should be almost a compulsory part of the primary education system.  It would be a very good starting point for prevention.  I have personal experience of children with difficulties having battles for evaluations in schools.  They eventually get special needs assistance but can be put into secondary school without any link-up between the schools.  The same child with difficulties would go into a new environment, with different challenges completely as secondary school is so different from primary school, and after three months or so behavioural problems would be seen, with people scratching their heads wondering why it happened.  The obvious answer is staring us in the face.  It is another area we must consider very carefully.</p> <p>  The witness mentioned a multi-annual delivery and implementation plan, which is critical.  In this committee we recognised very early that the reports are there but one can never design a perfect system on paper.  I would add to the implementation plan an implementation office and a direct line of responsibility for implementation.  This is instead of somebody saying it is not his or her responsibility.  When somebody has a responsibility to deliver something, it generally happens.  It is a key element.</p> <p>  There is also the matter of GP referrals to the child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS.  Is that a guarantee of a timely appointment?  It should be but I am led to believe there are difficulties or sometimes it is not recognised the way it should be.  I ask the witness to examine that also.</p></speech>

We will see what we can do.  There are many difficulties but we want to bring something that sets the highest standard but which is deliverable.  We do not want to set ourselves up for a further fall by overpromising.  That is where the multi-annual element comes into effect, as we can step up what will happen over the years and build it in a particular way.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1438" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1279" speakername="Pat Buckley" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017101900002#F01200"><p>I have a number of questions and will try to ask them as quickly as possible.</p><p>I do not want to see the work of this committee running parallel to any other review.  There have been too many reviews of reviews of reviews.  We already had reports from the psychiatric nurses and the Royal College of Surgeons.  We had a review of A Vision for Change and we are talking about another.  We have an excellent document from Mental Health Reform containing another review of A Vision for Change.  Therefore, we could be going down the wrong path already.  Where would Mr. Kane like to see this committee going?  I acknowledge that is a very broad and open question.  If Mr. Kane were sitting here as a committee member, what would be his number one priority?  Would he envisage a timeframe for its implementation?</p><p> Deputy John Brassil mentioned education and the schools approach.  I certainly agree with that.  Page 51 of the mental health reform report, the review of A Vision for Change, which is produced already, contains all this information.  It is an exciting document and it will cut out a lot of work for us.  I have a note stating prevention in schools should be the key to reducing the stigma and risk of suicide.  This would involve a low investment for a very high return.</p><p> I do not want this committee to be a talking shop.  I want it to be an implementation body that works over each quarter, perhaps.  Do we honestly need another review of reviews when all the reviews have been produced by professionals and experts?  I have said at a meeting on the Committee on the Future of Healthcare that the experts we have left out of most committees are the 16 and 18 year olds who experienced the traumas, and the people with disabilities.  The latter have been forgotten about.</p></speech>

What we have been asked to do is develop a successor to A Vision for Change.  We are not going to throw A Vision for Change in the bin and just repeat the cycle.  There are some elements in it that are still important and relevant.  We are going to try to add to them to have a policy that will guide us over the next ten years.</p> <p>  With regard to action and an action focus, I am at a stage in life where I get a bit impatient about talking and chatting.  Even in my own family, there is a real burning issue in this area that drives me on.  Both professionally and as a father, I have a problem here that I want resolved.  I hope to bring that energy and drive to what we are doing.  That is why, right at the beginning, the focus was on trying to come up with a set of outcome measures that will really demonstrate an impact on people on the front line.</p> <p>  My immediate priority is ensuring that, if people have difficulties, we are at least able to offer support immediately and to start to move on that basis.  Referring somebody to a practitioner who will see him or her in three or six weeks is not sufficient.  If people have a really urgent issue, they need to be seen.  We need to have a system that is able to achieve this.  That is really important.</p> <p>  I take the point on 16 and 18 year olds and the disability sector.  As part of a consultation process, we could do something really targeted in this area so we represent the views concerned.  This is also really important.</p> <p>  Mental health reform was mentioned.  Dr. Shari McDaid is part of our group.  Whatever she has done that is of benefit to us will be taken on by us.</p></speech>

He is a man of great integrity and experience.  I am dismayed, however, that the oversight group is working in parallel with this committee.  The group's remit sounds very much like ours, yet we know there are people, including in Mr. Kane's family, in dire straits all over the country.  They include children, older people and younger people.  Very nicely, the committee secretariat produced a summary of the 48 reports.  We have reports, committees, groups and consultations coming out of our ears and we need to get on with a fairly simple task.  We know how to do so.  I am slightly depressed and dismayed over the state we are in today.  Pragmatically, however, there are always opportunities so I am interested in learning how Mr. Kane believes we could work together effectively without tripping over each other.  What should the relationship be?</p> <p>  I suggest that it would be helpful if the oversight group were accountable to this committee.  Perhaps it is something we might write to the Minister for Health about.  In a way, the Minister for Health is the master of us all.  This would make sense and it would ensure we are not doing the work the group is already doing.  It would ensure, however, that the group's work tracks back to us.  How does Mr. Kane envisage us working together?  Is he similarly dismayed that we might trip over each other?</p> <p>  I have a suggestion for the Chairman and the other members regarding the worthy work the oversight group will undoubtedly do.  The people on the group are very expert and experienced.  Perhaps the group could be accountable to this committee.</p></speech>

We are really delighted to be here this morning, before we get our work under way, so that between us we may be able to work out a way of sharing work and coming together to do stuff, with the group doing one task and the committee doing another.  We would certainly be very open to considering how we could do that.</p> <p>  While the work is ongoing, we should continue to drive on and do what is required.  Our role is to set out what the agenda will be over the next ten years.</p></speech>

It is really important that we come up with a united, clear picture on which we can all agree and then get behind it and drive its implementation.  As a group, we would be very open to that.  We are here today to talk to the committee and work with it on it.</p></speech>

Our decision, as a committee, will be made after we hear everything from Mr. Kane and in private.  We do have to ask each other where we are going to go with this committee because its remit sounds very similar to that of Mr. Kane.</p> <p>  Before I open the discussion to the rest of the members, may I ask two questions?  A Vision for Change has always been about early intervention, particularly primary care.  I note that there are no general practitioners in the group.  I cannot understand why.  Mr. Kane talked about experts.  Of course they are experts but, besides Shari McDaid, are they mainly HSE employees?  If that is the case, we surely need not only experts who come in to have an input but also a broadening of the group to include general practitioners or other primary care professionals who could advise on what is required.</p> <p>  Is the oversight group rebranding A Vision for Change or producing a brand new document?</p><p>One of the concerns of nearly all members is that we are doing reviews over and over again.  Mr. Kane stated this strategy is for the next ten years.  A Vision for Change was also a ten-year strategy.  What will happen ten years from now?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1453" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Kane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017101900002#H00200"><p>As I indicated, we have not finalised the membership of the group.  At our initial meeting, we recognised that we had a primary care gap and we are examining how we will address or fill this gap.  We are just an oversight group and part of the challenge at oversight group level is to ensure the team has sufficient competence and is able to weld together to deliver what is required.  If we get into members of primary care teams and multidisciplinary mental health teams, we could quickly end up with 25 or 30 people sitting around the table.  This would have the potential to slow down the process.  We have set up a tight oversight group which has a mix of Health Service Executive and non-Health Service Executive members.  The HSE piece was important because when we finish our deliberations, the HSE will have to implement and deliver our conclusions.  The reason there are a number of HSE staff involved in the group is to hear their views and secure their buy-in and involvement from the beginning.  That is the balance we are trying to strike.</p> <p>  We will have consultative structures, processes and ways of engagement with whatever other expertise we need when dealing with a particular matter.  This is a high level group which will oversee the work we will do, rather than just doing the work, if the Chairman understands the difference. </p> <p>  I have not been asked to do a rebrand.  As I stated, A Vision for Change is a substantial document, much of which is still relevant.  The oversight group must try to identify what new elements need to be added to the strategy to produce a new mental health policy for the next ten years.  As I stated, I am impatient and I have no interest in a marketing or rebranding exercise.  I am only interested in trying to develop a set of actions which will deliver real change for people who need it.</p></speech>

I am sure they will pick up on members' frustration about the lack of implementation.  Some of us work at the coalface of mental health and deal with families who have lost loved ones to suicide, which is very difficult.</p> <p>  I strongly welcome the terms of reference, particularly in respect of primary prevention, early intervention and positive mental health.  Prevention is fantastic.  Senator Kelleher's point on working together is a great idea.  We should be working together and partnering up in all walks of life in any case.  The political parties should also do a little more of this because cross-party approaches are the way forward.</p> <p>  Were the members of the oversight group selected specifically on the basis of the terms of reference?  Do they include, for example, specialists in primary prevention, early prevention and the integration of care and delivery systems? </p> <p>  I apologise to members for raising this issue again but I work in the field of addiction.  Recently, the Special Rapporteur on Child Protection, Dr. Geoffrey Shannon, raised the issue of alcohol in the context of child protection.  Ireland faces an alcohol crisis.  The impact of alcohol misuse on families, particularly children, is devastating, especially in terms of mental health.  Is the oversight group considering the issue of children who are reared in homes where there is alcohol misuse and the impact this has on mental health?  More than 50% of people who die by suicide have alcohol in their system.  We are in a crisis, with three people dying by suicide every day.  Alcohol is a depressant which causes severe mental health issues.  Every family has someone in their lives who has a problem with alcohol misuse.  Is this issue being considered or is the oversight group doing any work involving alcohol misuse?</p></speech>

A Vision for Change is crucial.  All of us know people who suffer from depression.  On the issue of awareness, will Mr. Kane elaborate on the Let's Talk and Walk and #LittleThings campaigns?  I am a firm believer in using campaigns to highlight issues because we need to speak about mental health.  It is crucial that funding is provided for campaigns.  Awareness is very important because a lack of understanding of mental health issues can be a major problem.  People are afraid they may say the wrong thing when speaking to someone with mental illness.</p> <p>  The difficulty in recruiting staff, particularly consultants, is a major issue.  People are waiting for appointments and Members of the Oireachtas often make telephone calls asking when appointments can be made for people.  How can the issue of recruitment be addressed?</p> <p>  We need to work together because we would be stronger as a team.  Being divisive will not work.  A Vision for Change was published 11 years ago.  The HSE must work with all the different groups and families, in particular, must be included.  The submission refers to working with families and different groups and states this was recognised in 2016 with the establishment of the mental health engagement office in the Health Service Executive.  Will Mr. Kane provide more information on this office?</p></speech>

I appreciate Mr. Kane's enthusiasm and down to earth approach.  I also welcome his statement acknowledging improvements in services.  While there have been some improvements, the reason the committee was established is that there have not been enough improvements and we are committed to improving mental health services.</p> <p>  I tried to note the names of members of the oversight group but I was unable to write all of them down.  Will Mr. Kane circulate to the committee a list of the members' names and some background information on them?  I noted the names of three doctors, namely, Dr. Philip Dodd, Dr. Amanda Burke and Dr. Fiona Keogh.  Are they all psychiatrists or does the group include a psychologist?</p> <p>  I agree it is necessary to have primary care and general practice represented on the oversight group.  However, it should also include a nursing representative, either a registered nurse or a physician assistant.  As front-line staff, they deal daily with what goes on and should be represented on the group.  I appreciate, however, that the group will not be able to function properly if it is too large.</p> <p>  I would like the oversight group to examine the issue of 24-7 emergency admission to mental health units.  As we all know, people with mental illness do not always have an episode, as it were, between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m.  I know many people who have experienced difficulty accessing emergency inpatient care.</p> <p>  I would also like the group to examine the issue of funding.  Significant funding is provided for mental health.  Some would argue it is not enough and I accept there is always scope for more money to be provided for all sectors.  Funding for HSE mental health services and other organisations doing the same work is allocated to the top of the organisation, so to speak.  If, for argument's sake, &euro;100,000 is provided to an organisation, how much of this sum finds its way down to the service user?</p><p>How much of it is lost on the journey?  I would love the matter to be considered.  I believe a lot of money goes in but I do not believe that all of the money is used on the front line to benefit service users.  I do not know if that is something that the group has considered but I would love if it would include the matter in the review.  I thank the witnesses for their time and enthusiasm.</p></speech>

I wish to express my gratitude to the group for their time.  I must note that they are here on a voluntary basis and not in a professional capacity.</p> <p>  I welcome the oversight.  As Deputy Browne mentioned last week, we do not want this review to reset the policy document, A Vision for Change.  We do not want to start from zero again once the review is completed.  We are ten or 11 years into the programme and this will be version 2.0.  We are simply modernising the programme, as Deputy Corcoran Kennedy said about  social media, etc.</p> <p>  We must focus on stigma again.  We have taken our eye of the ball, slightly, in terms of stigma.  Great work has been done to tackle stigma, particularly as started from a low base.  Ten or 15 years ago I campaigned and canvassed and I can recall that people did not talk about mental health issues when I spoke to them on their doorstep.  Thankfully, all of that has changed over ten or 15 years and we now have a specific committee to tackle the matter.  This generation must decide what its legacy will be in ten or 15 years' time.  If we can start to break down stigma, life will be a lot easier for everybody with these conditions.  One can have all of the services in the world but they will not be of any use if people feel that they cannot interact with them.  I wanted to specifically stress that matter.</p> <p>  I would like the review to identify easy wins for us in terms of the implementation of A Vision for Change.  Where are the quick wins?  Often times, in these documents, one has the big and small issues.  Where are the easy wins that we can start moving on straightaway? </p> <p>  Along with Senator McFadden, I would like to know whether the review will consider budgets.  There is a big lack of knowledge about how the HSE spends the money it is given.  I would like to be given a specific breakdown of the figures.  One can talk about helicopter and aspirational views but if the budget does not marry them, we will be caught again.</p> <p>  Is an emphasis being placed on using creative arts and sport as part of a recovery model?  The initiative is important and needs to be pushed by the committee.  I believe this committee will work most towards implementation, as we discussed last week.  We must outline an overview of where we want to reach but there are two cogs.  First, we are discussing implementation and obviously the review will update same.  Part of the committee's remit should be to invite the HSE in here to discuss budgets, to find out where the money goes and to drill down into the details in order to inform the public.  I would appreciate the answers.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1462" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Kane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017101900002#J00400"><p>I will do my best to answer the questions.  Senator Black asked about our membership.  We tried to pick people for their expertise and thought processes in terms of strategic planning, and for their ability to link that kind of thought with implementation.  We sought personal qualities.  Some of the people with these personal qualities also have clinical expertise and other insights.  Dr. Philip Dodd and Dr. Amanda Burke are our consultant psychiatrists and Dr. Fiona Keogh is a research psychologist.  One can see that element in terms of service users.  We have people who have the expertise.  That is what we tried to bring to the table rather than have a whole group of professional people.  We will involve other levels.  At that particular level we sought people with the competencies to oversee and drive this work.</p> <p>  Addiction is part of all of the mental health services all of the time.  There has been a long discussion on whether addiction is part of the mental health service area or is a stand-alone unit and where it interacts.  We have no specific reference to alcohol in our terms of reference but we will discuss the point raised by the Senator.  Addiction is there, it is living and it is a big thing right in the middle of the service.  We must decide where it belongs and have greater integration.</p> <p>  Senator Murnane O'Connor asked about campaigns.  There have been a number of campaigns such as Let's Talk, which calls on people to reduce the stigma, raises awareness and encourages people to discuss their difficulties.  All of us try to live that in our daily lives even coming here today, and that is why I mentioned that this matter is really personal to me.  That is me saying, as a dad, that we have a problem.  It is important to start the conversation and have campaigns, which is a really good way to do so.  The #LittleThings campaign highlights the things one must pay attention to in one's life.  Both campaigns were accompanied by publicity campaigns.  They emphasise that we all have problems every single day of our lives and provide people with advice on how to manage them.  Providing advice and information has been the focus of those particular campaigns.</p> <p>  There is a lot of things going on with the recruitment of staff.  Some people say it is money and others say it is something else.  Evidence suggests that what really engages people in their work is whether they have a passion for it and are interested in what they do.  In terms of the work we are trying to do, the more we empower people who are on the front line to do what they need to, then that is as much an attraction as salary for people.  What I have said is a little bit linked with what Senator McFadden said.  I wrote the piece because I thought it would prove useful.  I did not want to say nothing had happened because sometimes it can have an impact on people who are doing stuff and trying to do things better.</p></speech>

We must say that some things have really been good and there are great people doing super jobs every single day but there are things that we need to sort out as well.  We must re-affirm to people that this is difficult work in difficult circumstances but it is really important.  Any one of us could need the support of these professionals some day.  It is important that we strike a balance.</p> <p>  I have dealt with the query about doctors.  I will now respond to Senator McFadden.  When we considered the composition of the group, we opted for competency rather than have every single representative group involved at the oversight level.  We made that decision and we have tried to apply it to how we do our work and drive that on. </p> <p>  Emergency admission is a thorny issue.  People would say that if one has an emergency, no matter what it was, one should go through an emergency department.  The initiative was introduced as part of trying to remove the stigma.  The initiative has, to a lesser or greater extent, been successful.  However, we must consider a 24-7 service.  </p> <p>  A number of members have mentioned money and the budget piece but I think we will just flag that.  Perhaps people with more expertise than us can address those queries for the members.</p> <p>  We are not resetting the policy for A Vision for Change.  We want to build on it and see where we can go from there. </p> <p>  I agree that stigma still impacts on the ability of people to speak about mental health issues.  Therefore, if one has a mental health difficulty, other people think it says something about the sufferer rather than something experienced by one out of four of us over a lifetime.  I agree with Deputy Neville that attitudes to mental health were very low and the terms "lunatic" and "lunatic asylum" were bandied about.  A huge piece of work is necessary to dispel the stigma.</p> <p>  In terms of creative arts and sport to combat mental illnesses, I saw such projects when I worked with the Genio organisation and around the place.  I also chair a sports for all group across the major sporting organisations that are considering using sport to assist people to stay well, have a better quality of life and improve people's understanding of mental health and mental health difficulties, and working at a different level around the issues.</p> <p>  I am all for easy wins and things that we can do to make improvements in the area.  If we come across something helpful, as we write the report, we will feed it straight back into the system as we go along.  </p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy Pat Buckley, has just taken his fourth call this week advising that a mother of four young girls has taken her life.  That is the fourth one he has experienced in the local area.  It is a stark reminder of why we are here.  It is to prevent young girls having to grow up without a mother.</p> <p>  We talked about resilience in children in schools and the development of self-confidence and ability from the start, including in cr&egrave;ches.  Would it be possible to consider strengthening the role of the nursing and midwifery staff in the prenatal and perinatal period?  They assess the pregnant woman's physical health.  They have checklists for blood pressure and all that sort of stuff.  They also do post-delivery checks for ten days or whatever.  They then check the co-ordination, movement and speech.  We need to embed emotional attachment to those checklists because even pre-birth it will flag up possible early intervention, possibly pre-birth, that could take place.  Having said that, we have not had mother and baby beds in the State for 15 or 20 years.  Mothers are separated from their children as soon as they are born if there are difficulties.</p> <p>  I believe Wheatfield Prison carried out a project on the overuse of benzodiazepines, lorazepam and Valium.  The prison took a zero-tolerance approach to it and they are not prescribed.  As one can imagine, there is a bit of uproar among the prisoners now and again.  It has actually worked for the past three years.  While I know it is not the witnesses' area, I have a grave concern about the ethics of pharmaceutical companies approaching prescribers and encouraging the dubious use of medication especially for seven to 17-year old children.  That may not be in the witnesses' remit but we need to mention those points at some stage.</p></speech>

People are in serious need, including people whose health is at stake and people whose lives are at stake; there are huge issues here.  I am sitting on this side of the table and Mr. Kane is on the far side.  I am a member of this committee, the Joint Committee on Future of Mental Health Care.  He is a member of a committee charged with developing a ten-year successor to A Vision for Change.  It is not exactly the same.  The future of mental health services could be 20, 30 or 40 years.  Mr. Kane's remit is for the next ten years.  However, there seems to be a massive overlap between what we have been asked to do and what his group has been asked to do.  Senator Kelleher pointed out that there have been 48 reports on this.</p></speech>

After 48 reports, what the hell is going on?  We are sitting over here and Mr. Kane is sitting over there with remits that seem to be largely the same.  It seems to be messing.  If I was a member of a family experiencing a mental health crisis at the moment, I would be asking what the hell is going on here and would be asking very sharp questions of the Minister of State about that.</p> <p>  The point has been made that both committees can work away and we can co-operate.  Mr. Kane's committee could come up with a report proposing one direction and our committee might come up with a report proposing a different direction.  Where would we be then?  It is a mess from what I can see.</p> <p>  Mr. Kane's committee was set up ahead of this committee.  What was his initial reaction when he heard about this committee being established?  When he looked into it, did he see any significant difference between what he has been charged to do and what we have been charged to do?  Does he share the frustration about having two committees with what seems to be a broadly similar remit?  A key discussion for this group after the presentation and the question-and-answer session is where we go from here.  I will leave those questions on the table for now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1478" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017101900002#K01000"><p>I thank Mr. Kane and Mr. Murchan for coming in this morning.  I will deal with two practicalities relating to the priorities of the oversight group.  One relates to the integration of primary and secondary care, and the other relates to workforce planning and recruitment.</p> <p>  On the integration of primary and secondary care, mental health issues are quite difficult diagnostic issues.  So much comes through the door of a GP that it is difficult to sift through what needs to be dealt with outside general practice and what can be dealt with within general practice.  There is a quantum leap when moving from general practice to referring on to the psychiatric services, for want of a better word.  There are many holistic issues relating to mental health.  Is it a disease or just an issue somebody has?  We do not want to label people unnecessarily.</p> <p>  There are many social determinants of health, including unemployment, social deprivation, housing, education and social exclusion.  Many of the issues that present as mental health issues are not illnesses or diseases and should not be over-medicated.  How should we integrate primary care and secondary care?  In my local community I am on first-name terms with the staff that exist.  Quite often there are many members of the community psychiatric team that do not exist.</p> <p>  I agree with what Deputy Brassil said about over-medication which often arises because other services are not available and it is the last port of call.  However, I think there is over-prescription of medication.</p> <p>  Mr. Kane talked about forecasting and workforce planning.  What is needed in a community psychiatric service is pretty obvious, namely, social workers, counsellors, psychologists and, of course, psychiatrists.  Quite often we are missing the social workers, psychiatrists and counsellors who provide talk therapy and not medication.  How can we address the issue of recruitment and retention?  Either it is not possible to recruit or there is a rapid turnover from burnout.</p><p>I do not think it is salary.  It could be workload, job satisfaction, or support from management.  Maybe Mr. Kane would address those issues of integrating and recruiting staff and ensuring there is a full complement of staff in each area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1480" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1242" speakername="Catherine Martin" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017101900002#L00200"><p>I thank Mr. Kane for coming in and for the work he is doing in a voluntary capacity in chairing the oversight group.  Like other members, I had concerns when this committee was set up about the overlap.  My concerns remain today and may be even greater.  Does Mr. Kane share them?  We could say that he is looking at the successor policy, what needs to be done, and that our role may be implementation.  However, it is here in black and white that the successor policy to A Vision for Change will include a multiannual implementation plan.  Therefore that is not something we should be doing.  How does Mr. Kane envisage us working in tandem?</p> <p>  On the membership of the oversight group, following on from the remarks of Deputies Harty and Brassil on over-medication, is there any intention for the oversight group to examine mindfulness-based cognitive therapy or stress reduction?  I would agree with the Chair about having a general practitioner in the oversight group.  Would Mr. Kane consider also including an expert in the field of mindfulness or resilience building?  These areas came up in our education committee, which produced a document recently on positive mental health in schools.</p> <p>  I agree with other members of the committee on the funding issue.  I would ask Mr. Kane to flag it and that it be looked at.  It has been an issue with A Vision for Change, even as recently as last week in the budget.  We have this great plan but the funding is not delivered to match it.  That is a major problem when it comes to implementation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Hugh Kane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FMJ2017101900002#L00300"><p>I acknowledge what Senator Devine said about suicide.  It is a huge problem and is the reality of what we are trying to deal with.  Suicide very often involves a wider issue than just the mental health services end.  We need to keep sight of that.  There are lots of things that impact on people's mental health, as the members all know, such as having a good job, a nice place to live, etc.  It is a much wider thing.<br/><br/>In terms of the whole medication piece, they are very much practice-based issues and may not be appropriate to a review at our level.  We will take the issue back and have a think about it.  I think, though, that there is a place for medication, properly supervised and administered, while there is also a need for a whole range of other kinds of supports as well.  They have to work together.  That is very clear.<br/><br/>Deputy Barry spoke about the challenge of what is going on at the moment.  There is a huge machine out there as we speak, a range of services being delivered and supporting people.  That is going to continue.  If there are problems with the delivery of that, they should be addressed as we go along as well.  Their work will not stop because we are talking about what is going on at that level. <br/><br/>In Ireland, we are reported to death.  There are huge amounts of stuff.  I certainly do not think there would be much point in our two groups working independently and coming up with a set of things that are going in opposite directions.  There are options there.  The oversight group could step down what it is doing and leave it to the committee or we could have more engagement to make sure we are both generally working in the same direction.  It is no issue for me.  I think we could work together.  I have not heard anything here today that is different from what we are thinking.  I think we are all <i>ad idem </i>on lots of issues.  If we are able to support each other and do a better job, great.  If not, let us call it and act on that.  As I said earlier, my interest is very personal.  I am interested in trying to deal with stuff as we go along.<br/><br/>On the integration of primary care and secondary care, I have some ideas myself.  The oversight group is going to look at this issue when we sit down.  We will examine the issues, talk to the experts and come up with some pieces that are really helpful.  That might include things like training modules and improving training at general practice level, better links between primary and secondary care and between people working on the ground, promoting the kind of multidisciplinary team that expands to include families, general practitioners and whoever else might be able to support someone.  It is not always someone on a formal team who can help.  Peer support workers, for instance, give fantastic support to people.  It is about looking within a community rather than sticking to the usual model of identifying the key people we need. If those people are not available, we have to start looking at alternatives.  I do think there are people in community groups, peers, who have expertise by experience, and families can add that kind of support to the professional people who are there.  As was said, a mental health problem can often be linked to lots of other things that are going on in people's lives that have nothing really to do with an organic mental health problem.  We have mentioned that social things impact on people's work.<br/><br/>I have addressed the question about over-medication.  There is a role for medication.  If there is over-medication, it is a professional issue.  There are clinicians in our group who understand that and we will discuss with them what is the appropriate forum in which to deal with it.<br/><br/>The whole issue of retaining staff is going to be a huge challenge.  As I said, it is not just about money.  It is about people being valued and supported.  It is really important that we try to identify the best ways of supporting people who are doing very difficult work, not just professionally in terms of their practice every day but also just as human beings who are dealing with difficulties.  I think that would be really helpful.<br/><br/>Deputy Martin asked about how the oversight group can work in tandem with the committee.  I think we can have that discussion.  If someone tells us we are not needed, that is something we will take on board.  We should be able to work out a way.  As I was saying in my previous comments, there is a whole range of different supports there.  Mindfulness can be useful as can building resilience.  Very often, those who work in these areas have not traditionally been seen as people who would work at supporting people within the community.<br/><br/>I have mentioned the funding piece before.  We will take that back and say there were concerns raised about funding.  Is there enough coming and when it comes in, how is it tracked?  I hope I have addressed all the questions.</p></speech>

I know there are a lot of questions.  I would echo very much what Deputies Martin and Barry are saying, in that it is not really becoming any clearer as we go along.  It is certainly not up to us to tell Mr. Kane whether he should be there or not.  He has been selected fairly and we are delighted that he is giving his time as a volunteer.</p></speech>

It is good to see him still as committed as ever to doing what he can on a professional and personal basis to improve many lives around the country.  In terms of the 48 reports, I actually went through many of them since our last meeting and there was nothing I could disagree with them in any of them.  I thought all of the recommendations were excellent.  Having said that, there was obviously a lot of repetition between them all, which is very understandable because, at the end of the day, we know what is wrong and what needs to be put in place to address it.  I include in that comment the report the education committee published only two months ago about all the issues with young people.  The question now is how we can get them all onto the same page in terms of implementation.  Looking at the terms of reference for the oversight group, it is good that they are quite clear.  There has to be a synergy between ourselves and the oversight group.  I am interested in knowing a little bit more about points 4 and 5 in particular, in respect of the consultation process.  The draft policy will set out the current and future service priorities.</p><p>Are there timelines for what the oversight group is working towards to produce that?  I believe it is essential that we are part of the process.<br/><br/>It has been mentioned already, but I think creative ways of dealing with mental health, like the #LittleThings campaign, are important.  I think it is a brilliant campaign and the more of these campaigns there are, the better.  Campaigns that can be run at a local community base are especially important, like men's sheds and <i>Joe.ie</i>.  They give a lifeline to people who need it.  I imagine many of us have had experience of those and have been able to bear witness to the positive things that they have brought to people along the way.<br/><br/>Mr. Kane mentioned linking in with sports clubs.  I think it is great that the GAA has committed to ensuring that there is a mental health officer in every club.  This goes back to linking in with the community and it is a major part of the battle.  It is about trying to intervene in a positive way as close as possible to where people who have issues are based.<br/><br/>One of the recommendations is about having people with experience of mental health difficulties involved.  That is particularly important.  Recently, I came across the network that had been set up by the HSE for mental health.  I was impressed with it because several of those involved in the network were coming from that place.  They had had experience of using the services and part of their mission was to help to identify the gaps.  From what I gather, it is stronger in some regions than others.  Perhaps Mr. Kane can fill us in on the detail.</p></speech>

I believe two heads are better than one and that we should all work together to achieve a real common goal in this area.</p> <p>  Integration and streamlining of the services through cognitive behaviour therapy, wellness centres, the use of primary care centres and our outreach mental health services are important.  We should be following the money to follow the patient.  If we are to look at it, that is what we should be looking at.  It is a matter of how the money follows the patient.  That is one of the objectives I am keen to see.</p> <p>  Alcohol was referenced earlier.  When we talk about alcohol, we need to consider services for alcohol and gambling addiction, especially how we are funding these services and the counsellors.  Many counties, including Galway, do not have outreach for addiction services.</p> <p>  We talk about how we communicate.  Mr. Kane has already mentioned Let's Talk.  I would be looking at the mental health area with regard to Twitter, whereby people are sitting at home when they want to engage with people.  These are positive things that people can do themselves.  They can feel engaged and positive in how conversation is being had.</p> <p>  I agree completely with what Deputy Neville has said.  Regrettably, not everyone plays GAA, so we need to look at the other therapeutic recovery options.  I have in mind dance, yoga, drama and horse-riding.  Sometimes, people who might have mental health issues might come from another area of disability.  Therefore, their engagement and feeling of participation is most important.  Yet again, money follows the patient.</p> <p>  A major part of this arises from how we empower our educators, whether the educators in education, parents or the person working with young people.  Deputy O'Loughlin does not realise it but she created a new buzzword in my head, linked-in.  It is a matter of how we can link in all these people and, again, how the money would follow into the school system or the various advocate groups that are promoting positive mental health outcomes.</p> <p>  The most important things we need to identify are the roadblocks and the gatekeepers of finance.  Who is preventing this free-flow?  If the funding is to be available and we know it needs to get to a particular goal, what is holding it up?  That is where I am coming from with much of it.</p> <p>  When we talk about stories, we need to listen.  Ois&iacute;n McConville's story is a powerful one.  He tells us that when he started in secondary school he had a gift.  The way the educator looked upon him mattered.  The suggestion was that he was there because of his gift and his talent at football rather than that he had any ability within his own way to perform in education.</p> <p>  It is a matter of how we speak and engage.  Funding may have to go into education to re-train or bring in a particular model.  This may be vital for people who are in roles of responsibility and who are moulding and shaping our young people.  If we are starting from the beginning, that has to be brought into it as well.</p></speech>

Before you answer, Mr. Kane, there is one thing that I want to be absolutely clear for the members.  Are you creating a policy or document that is a roadmap that will be handed to Government at the end of the coming year?  Is that your remit?</p> <p>  The second point relates to membership.  You spoke about the experts.  Really, the experts are the people at the front line.  Again, this is something you might address.  Who selected the members?</p></speech>

The consultation process is something we are going to think about.  There has been considerable consultation around developing the new policy for suicide prevention.  We have no wish to reinvent consultation that has already taken place in that area.  We believe that if we identify some key areas or questions for consultation, it may be the best way to do this.  Our initial thoughts included providing for submissions or suggestions about how it might work.  We have contemplated trying to workshop them in a way that would invite people to come in and make a short presentation to a group of critical thinkers.  This would allow for different views to be run through a process in order to extract the gems we need to use.</p> <p>  It is possible to carry out consultation that ticks the boxes.  Anyone can get through 25 boxes, but it is a matter of how to get value and how to use what comes in as well and build on what is in place.  That is how we are going to do it.</p> <p>  I was asked about the timeline.  We are aiming to try to finish by the end of summer next year.  It should take nine months to a year.  That is what we are looking for.</p> <p>  Deputy Rabbitte asked about money following the patient.  Following our initial deliberation, we are starting to think about outcomes at patient level.  The idea is that the resources start to go where people are delivering the outcomes.  That is perhaps a way of trying to tighten it up a little as well.</p> <p>  I take the point about this being wider than sport.  Whatever people are into is what we are trying to do.</p> <p>  The Chairman asked some other questions.  We have been asked to produce a report that will go initially to the management board of the Department of Health and then to the Minister of State with responsibility for mental health and older people, Deputy Daly.  From there it will move to the Cabinet sub-committee.  These are our terms of reference.</p> <p>  There was a question about how the members were selected.  Several people, including me, were looking at the competencies and the type of people required.  That is the criteria we have used to try to get a group of people together who can work at a high level.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1500" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101900002#D00200"><p>Sure.</p> <p>   I welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee.  In my introductory statement, I will focus on how our mission to safeguard stability and protect consumers is demonstrated through our work on the tracker mortgage examination, Brexit, the banking sector, the insurance sector, and the macroprudential mortgage measures.</p> <p>  I am joined by Ms Sharon Donnery, the deputy governor for central banking; Mr. Ed Sibley, the deputy governor for prudential regulation; and Ms Derville Rowland, the director general for financial conduct.  This reflects the reorganisation of the Bank&rsquo;s financial regulation functions in recent weeks into two pillars.  Mr. Sibley is in charge of prudential regulation and Ms Rowland is in charge of financial conduct, which includes consumer protection.  Mr. Sibley is now responsible for the supervision of credit institutions, banks and credit unions, insurers and the asset management industry.  He represents the Central Bank on the supervisory board of the European Central Bank under the Single Supervisory Mechanism, SSM, and on the boards of the European Banking Authority, EBA, and the European Insurance and Occupational Pensions Authority, EIOPA.  On the financial conduct side, Ms Rowland is responsible for the financial conduct of firms in relation to their customers and clients.  This includes consumer protection, securities and markets supervision and enforcement.  She is a member of the board of supervisors of the European Securities and Markets Authority, ESMA.  The reason we did this reorganisation is to reflect the evolution of the European System of Financial Supervision, ESFS, including the centralisation of prudential supervision of systemically important banks under the SSM.  It also recognises the dual regulatory approach by which the Central Bank is responsible both prudential regulation and financial conduct regulation.</p> <p>  I turn to our consumer protection role.  Our vision is for a well-functioning, well-managed and well-regulated financial services system that safeguards stability and protects consumers.  This is best delivered by a strong culture of compliance, with firms and individuals within firms acting in the best interests of customers.  However, this needs to be reinforced by comprehensive and enforceable legislation, intrusive risk-based supervision, a credible threat of enforcement and powers of redress when consumers have suffered detriment.  As was harshly illustrated by the financial crisis, a fundamental protection for consumers lies in ensuring that the financial system is stable and that individual financial firms are subject to prudential regulations which require them to be sound and solvent, that is, to maintain substantial capital and liquidity buffers to guard against risks.  Our oversight of the system includes the authorisation of firms - the gatekeeper role - a fitness and probity regime and other governance-related requirements.  It also includes a regime to manage the resolution or closure of firms in the event of failure.  Finally, our macroprudential measures seek to build resilience across the financial system, for example, through the limits on mortgage loans to guard against over-lending and over-borrowing.</p> <p>  The national consumer protection framework is formed by us the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, CCPC, and the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO.  In addition, we actively participate in European and international bodies that work to safeguard the interests of consumers.  Our role as the national resolution authority also contributes to both our stability and consumer protection mandates.  We are responsible for the orderly resolution of failing credit institutions, credit unions and certain types of investment firms.  For example, members will be aware of the recent appointment of provisional liquidators to Charleville Credit Union.  We took this action to protect the savings of members, which are underpinned by the deposit guarantee scheme.  The Central Bank is conscious that there is a demand for the services of a credit union in the local area and is committed to ensuring credit union services are available in the community.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the tracker mortgage examination.  The examination is focused on ensuring that lenders provide fair outcomes for all debtors damaged by unacceptable failings in the handling of tracker mortgages, which has caused considerable suffering for many of those affected.  It is clear that all lenders did not sufficiently recognise or address the scale of those unacceptable failings until Central Bank intervention.  We have had to repeatedly challenge certain lenders and push to the limits of our powers in order to drive them to identify and remedy affected customers in an appropriate manner.  This is a basic reason the examination has required significant time to progress.  If certain lenders had conducted their reviews in line with the requirements of the framework and offered better initial proposals in respect of redress and compensation, the examination would be at a more advanced stage.  We recognise the hurt and damage the actions of lenders have caused for many debtors.  This is evident in the calls we receive to our helpline and the powerful testimony from the brave individual who appeared in public before this committee last week.  As I will outline, we are pushing the limits of our powers to ensure affected customers are remedied appropriately.</p> <p>  The examination is the largest, most complex and most significant conduct review that we have undertaken to date in the context of our consumer protection mandate.  Unusually for a live supervisory investigation, we publish regular updates on the examination as our work progresses, precisely because we realise customers and, indeed, the wider public need information.  The latest one was published in the past few days, which the committee has received.  We have also set out principles for lenders to pay appropriate redress and compensation to affected customers, commensurate with the consumer detriment.  Among other important aspects, the principles provide for an up-front payment to enable borrowers to take independent advice regarding the redress and compensation offers made to them.  The appeals process ensures that customers have the option to challenge any aspect of the redress and compensation.  Importantly, the customer can accept the offer while still making an appeal and the offer cannot be reduced by virtue of lodging such an appeal.  In addition, customers have retained the option to bring a complaint to the FSO and-or to initiate court proceedings.</p> <p>  The examination is being conducted in phases.  Phase 2 required lenders to conduct a review of their mortgage loan books, identify affected customers, as well as those deemed to have been in-scope but not impacted, and submit a report of their findings.  All relevant lenders have provided phase 2 reports to the Central Bank.  As our latest update shows, by the end of September, lenders had identified approximately 13,000 affected accounts . Approximately 60% of these cases arise as a result of customers not receiving a tracker product, and the balance relates to customers not receiving the correct tracker margin.  As of end-September, lenders have rectified the interest rates applied to approximately 7,700 affected accounts.  This represents 98% of customers identified by lenders as requiring rate rectification.  The submission contains a table outlining the progress comparing the March update to the September update.  The table also indicates that the total payout so far is &euro;120 million to 3,300 customers.  With regard to the payouts, lenders are required to categorise affected customers by reference to the type and level of detriment suffered.  The types of loss identified range from overcharging as a result of the application of incorrect interest rates up to loss of ownership of mortgaged properties.  Where home or property loss has occurred, a lender is further required to conduct a causation analysis to determine whether loss of ownership resulted from its failings.  To date, lenders have reported that as a result of their failings, loss of ownership has occurred in respect of 23 homes and 79 buy-to-let properties.  As the analysis continues, we anticipate that more such cases will be identified.</p> <p>  As the overall reviews by lenders are subject to ongoing assurance work and challenge by the Central Bank, it is possible that more accounts may be identified more generally as the examination progresses.  We will publish a further update in early 2018.  Our assurance work involves challenging the findings of the reviews by each lender through on-site inspections, reviewing materials and meeting with the directors of these banks.  We also are receiving information directly from customers which has informed our approach and focus in particular institutions.  While assurance work is ongoing in a number of lenders, the Central Bank is concerned from the work completed to date that two lenders may have failed to identify populations of impacted customers or failed to recognise that certain groups of their customers have been affected by their failures.</p><p> We are of the view that some of these customers have been affected and, accordingly, are entitled to redress and compensation.  We have challenged these two lenders on these issues and they will report back to us by the end of October.  As the Central Bank progresses this work, other lenders will be challenged in a similar way.  Where we believe there are customers who may have been wrongly excluded by lenders, we will, using our statutory powers as appropriate, require those lenders to inform them of their decision and of the recourse options available.</p><p> The framework has been designed so that the phases can run concurrently within lending institutions in order that each lender can be dealt with as quickly as possible.  This means that third and fourth phases - the calculation and payment, respectively, of redress and compensation - can begin while the assurance work continues.</p><p> In respect of redress and compensation, the Central Bank does not have the statutory power to compel lenders to implement redress and compensation in respect of failures that occurred prior to 1 August 2013.  Having said that, we have made our expectations very clear to lenders and published principles for redress so that people are aware of what is expected of their lenders.  However, initial proposals from certain lenders fell materially short of our expectations.  Examples of material deficiencies included: failing to offer compensation for certain affected cohorts of customers; unacceptably low offers of compensation; unacceptably low payments for independent advice; and failing to recognise certain types of detriment sustained by customers for compensation purposes, including customers who may have switched lenders as a result of being on the incorrect interest rate.</p><p> As a result of our repeated challenges, lenders have significantly improved their redress and compensation proposals and appeals processes.  To the end of September, &euro;120 million had been paid out in redress and compensation under the examination.  Prior to the launch of our examination, under the separate mortgage programme for Permanent TSB and Springboard Mortgages limited, there were payouts of &euro;36.8 million and &euro;6.2 million, respectively.  This was required by the Central Bank as part of that previous process.</p><p> We expect all relevant lenders to have initiated redress and compensation by the end of 2017.  In the meantime, our work continues.  We are also liaising with other State agencies, including the CCPC, the FSO and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.</p><p> Finally, we have two enforcement cases open, two more are in train and I expect more to follow.  We will continue to provide updates to the public on our examination and enforcement actions as this work continues.</p></speech>

To expand, there was a significant shift in 2013.  We now have the power to impose redress in respect of any damage or episodes that occurred after August 2013.  We can insist that the banks offer a redress scheme in these types of cases.  As most of the damage involved in the tracker mortgage examination occurred before 2013, we have to operate under the legislation which was in effect before 2013.  Any new powers for the future would not help us deal with the scenario which existed before 2013.  We had the powers to compel the banks to produce the information contained in the second stage reports but, in terms of consequences and offering redress and compensation payments to the debtors, we have to use moral suasion and point out to the banks that they are better off putting forward these schemes on a voluntary basis.  Otherwise, they will be dealing with this issue for a long time through the ombudsman and the courts system.</p> <p>  If they are consumer-focused, they should recognise that it is much better to put forward a decent scheme now, rather than forcing people to go to the ombudsman and the courts.  The redress and compensation schemes currently being introduced are not being put in place under any powers of compulsion the Central Bank has.  We are essentially using our regulatory powers to point out that we have this information and that we can tell that there has been significant loss to consumers.  We are pointing out that the banks should not be asking consumers to be going forward wholesale to the ombudsman and the courts, but rather that they should be voluntarily putting schemes in place.  We are also telling them what we expect from those schemes.</p> <p>  I will ask Ms Rowland to add to that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1504" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101900002#E00400"><p>I can add to that in more specific ways if the committee wishes.  When this issue arose, the framework of the examination was developed in the context of the enforcement investigation into Springboard Mortgages limited and Permanent TSB, which the members will be familiar with.  It emerged in that way.  As we were going through the investigation, it crystallised for us that the tracker matter would have a very severe effect on people if we looked at the consequential impact downstream.  As the investigation progressed, we have seen loss of home ownership, loss of buy-to-let properties and all of the devastation that has wrought on people, particularly in the context of the recession which everybody was living in.</p> <p>  We are, as the committee will know, the systemic regulator and we have many powers.  Since 2010 and the reform of the Central Bank after the crisis, there has been significant amplification of our powers.  I want to be very clear about that.  We have used the powers given to us under section 22 of the Central Bank (Supervision and Enforcement) Act 2013 for information-gathering purposes.  We have extensive powers to require, on deadline and demand, the provision of specific documents and information.  We used that power when carrying out the first phase of the reports, when we demanded information to scope out and plan this enormous exercise.  We are talking about more than 2 million accounts and a great volume of information has to be acquired.  I am sure that every member of the committee understands that we would be here for decades if we had to deal with 2 million accounts on a case-by-case basis.  We had to come up with a structure which would move us through such a large-scale piece of work in an intelligent way which would be constructed to cut through the data, but which had strong degrees of assurance drilled in.  The section 22 powers have therefore been used to good effect to meet the deadlines.  The deadlines for the first phase have been met and, contrary to what may have been said in other appearances before the committee, all the deadlines imposed for the second phase have also been met.  As an aside, we were not necessarily happy with the content of what was provided and some lenders have been told to go back and do better.</p> <p>  We are now coming to the third and fourth phases.  In plain terms, it was our view that having an impact on people at the tail-end of the process would be going about it the wrong way around.  The most important thing was to deal with the detriment imposed on people.  The first thing we did in that space was to put out a signal and a requirement that no repossessions were to occur until there was a totally gated procedure to ensure that the cases in question were not contaminated by this difficulty.  The second thing we did was to get the lawyers together so that we could confer in respect of what we thought fair and reasonable tortious principles to assist people might look like.  We knew that this was outside the strict scope of our powers but, looking at the scale of this problem, we thought it might offer a reasonable, quick, upfront payment alternative in addition to the normal infrastructure the State has to deal with such issues.  As the committee well knows, recourse to the FSO is available on a case-by-case basis after complaints have been dealt with through the lending institutions.  That is the normal course.  For the more serious matters, cases may progress to the courts.  Since we were dealing with such scale, we thought that this additional option of compensation, which is not a typical power for a systemic regulator to even wish for or seek, might be useful in this case.</p><p> We also demanded that any limitation period arguments would be held in abeyance by the lenders.  Very importantly, we could not look at everything on a case-by-case basis or we would be here for decades but we stood firm about the quality of the scheme and having a good appeal mechanism in place so people could bring personal information forward before independent arbiters would assist.  That is a very important part of the framework.  We have moved into an unusual space.</p><p> There is a statutory power in the 2013 Act to order redress.  However, that power is prospective and does not capture the harm that has accrued in this instance because most of said harm predated the creation of that power.  In fact, what has happened in a regulatory context was that when the supervisors in consumer protection became aware of these issues, they actually moved to close the gaps and strengthen the provisions in the codes.  This is one of the main reasons it cuts off at an earlier period.</p><p> What we are doing is pursuing enforcement investigations in detailed, forensic ways.  There is a full suite of enforcement powers.  The committee may be aware there have been five significant court litigations challenging the constitutionality of the powers.  There have been many judicial reviews all the way to the Court of Appeal.  We have successfully defended the right of the Central Bank to use its enforcement infrastructure to support proper and effective regulation.  However, none of this delivers an answer to individuals sooner rather than later.  It is for this reason that we thought this was a good additional option.  From a conceptual perspective - let us forget the law for a moment because it is a tool to be pressed into use when necessary - this is an opportunity for lenders to show that they are different culturally to what was the case during the crisis and that consumer protection is something they can proactively consider.  They can also show, in instances where they have caused harm, that they can take the burden off the individual, on a voluntary basis, and afford him or her reasonable redress and compensation.  This will allow lenders to demonstrate that they are capable and able to put consumer protection at the heart of their consideration and just do the right thing.</p><p> We have moved into this space, which is unusual.  It is the result of a timing issue; it brings the monetary sums upfront.  This may not be a complete answer to the harm that has been done to people, but it is something and it is better than letting the matter pass.  We have taken the time to challenge them and it has taken longer for people, which I fully accept.  However, I think it is worth it because to come to us with proposals of no appeal is utterly unacceptable given that decision-making about appeals is the point at which the nuances will be heard.  It is really very important.  To deny the fact there is consequential impact is just not acceptable.  As we move in to look at this under our authorised officer powers, we will find more disagreement and we will commit to using those powers.  This has already started with one of the lenders.  We are demanding that the two with which we are not happy - we will find we are not happy with more - to come back and answer us.  We have imposed deadlines in this regard.  We believe that the disagreement has probably reached the stage with some of them whereby there is no point in continuing an inconclusive conversation any more.</p><p> If people are left out of the scope and we think they should be included, we do not have the power to deliver them into the compensation and redress scheme on a voluntary basis because the decision lies with the lender and not with us.  What we do have is the power to direct a lending institution to identify, by name, the specific individuals about whom we are concerned and to notify them in writing of its decision not to include them and to tell them of their right of redress to the FSO and to the court.  The reason we need this to be done is so people are on specific notice of their rights and can assert them.  In this context, we have been in touch with the FSO to discuss the very welcome amendment to the limitation period, which enables cases to be brought in a longer time span and that is not a difficulty.  This is very welcome, and the ombudsman also sees the benefit of the normal infrastructure working.  If this happened today - I hope it will not but, in the context of financial services across the globe, consumer protection issues do arise - a key feature of the system is to be able to fix those problems.  We have redress powers.  We do not have compensation powers, which are different, but one would think that is usually a matter for the courts because of the specific consideration, but we do have redress powers that would apply today so we would be in a somewhat different position.  I hope this is of assistance.</p></speech>

Within the population of customers who have been identified as being impacted by this issue, rate rectification has occurred in nearly all instances.  There is a figure of 98% in the documentation.  Within the balance, there may be a very small population to still obtain rate rectification, which is occurring and which should be complete very soon, but the remainder of the balance relates to cases that were rectified previously.  In such circumstances, we never expect that number to increase to 100%.  We are looking at the 2% region because they were on the wrong rate for a short period and it was already fixed earlier.  Another group of people no longer have tracker mortgages.</p></speech>

If there is a full dispute about it, any use of any legal power would have to be subject to the full rigours of the law and the dispute they would bring to bear on that.</p></speech>

Has the Central Bank not examined the powers it has under legislation and indicated that it has and will use those powers?  The witnesses give the impression today that the Central Bank will look for names and tell them to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman or the courts.

The Central Bank received a full suite of powers in the 2013 Act and we have moved to use them on every single occasion.  That was sometimes for the first time and these powers are not exactly clear until they have been tested.  I hope members see we have demonstrated through the actions already taken that the Central Bank is willing to move not just to the full extent of its powers but beyond those to seek to deliver a reasonable answer for those people who have been detrimented.  Right now we are in a position where we have not yet fully crystallised the dispute with the lending institutions but we think we are moving into that space.  We have already used statutory powers to deliver answers to this.  We will consider the full suite of our powers with respect to what delivers the answer at the earliest point.  Of course we will consider the use of our powers.</p></speech>

The reality of our enforcement power is that it would cause much delay if we took the route of saying we would use those powers to deliver outcomes.  This has been seen with other cases where the bank is disputing the matter.  Where the lender argues it is adhering to and in line with the contracts in question, any adversarial process would take a long time before somebody would be paid out.  Our strategy now is not to get into a legal dispute that will take a long time to resolve.  It is much better to persuade the banks to on a voluntary basis make a good and decent upfront offer.  Those powers are in reserve.  It is not a case that we can dictate, saying we believe a certain account and the banks must immediately change the charging policy.</p> <p>  Many cases are being picked up where banks are conceding points, indicating they will rectify, make redress and apply compensation in those cases.  That is instead of going down a legalistic route.  There remains cohorts where we believe banks should be conceding further but it will be much quicker if this process of engagement continues.  If they review their positions and concede, it will be the quickest way to get a result.</p></speech>

I am absolutely shocked that the Central Bank has come here, acknowledged its view that certain people are being overcharged or denied tracker mortgages, this is happening in real time and being disputed by banks and the Central Bank is telling us that if the dispute is not resolved, the Central Bank has the power to direct the bank to supply the names of the customers.  The Central Bank will write to customers and tell them to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  That is in itself a lengthy process and the decision of the ombudsman would most likely be appealed by the financial institutions, and this can happen all the way up to the Supreme Court.  It is a very drawn-out process.</p> <p>  Under the 2013 Act, the Central Bank has the powers for redress where overcharging is currently happening.  The Central Bank is of the view that overcharging is currently happening.  I have not heard from the Central Bank that it is willing to use the 2013 powers.  Instead, it is basically saying that these people should go to another agency of the State.  I put it to the witnesses that this is letting down the customers of the institutions and it is a dereliction of its duties relating to consumer protection.</p></speech>

The current strategy is delivering for many people considerable payments for 2008 to 2013.  There are many years before 2013 and if we just consider that period, much compensation due to customers would not be pursued.  Our strategy is to consider the entire matter, from the issue of contract to now.  It is going to deliver for many people.  Yes, it will be too slow and I fully accept that.  We think the strategy has worked with respect to some lenders already to a large degree.  With respect to other lenders, it is coming soon.  With the remaining cases, the first best option is for the bank to agree and accept that where there is ambiguity, it should be resolved in the favour of the consumer.  That will be the most pragmatic and practical way to ensure people receive these payments.</p></speech>

The point was echoed by the Central Bank this morning and it sends a terrible signal to financial institutions that if they continue to deny the fact that the Central Bank believes a certain number of people should be within the scope of this investigation, the powers used will only be to write to affected customers and ask them to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p> <p>  We should be clear.  Does the Central Bank have the power, under the 2013 Act and where customers are currently being overcharged, to impose a redress position on those bank?  If it has those powers, why is it asking the customers, many of whom do not have experience or wherewithal to take a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman, to go in that direction?  In this case, it is the dog that will not bark and the Central Bank is sending a terrible signal to the financial institutions to continue the way they are going.  The reality is that many people will not take a case to the Financial Services Ombudsman and the institutions of the State that exist to protect customers are failing them in this case.</p></speech>

If we used the power to zero in on the harm from 2013 onwards, it would be a legal process between us and the banks.  I agree that is preferable to forcing individuals to take cases.  We are not yet at that point.  The banks are currently reviewing the excluded cohorts and this is the back-and-forth happening now.</p><p>The banks are saying that they have legal advice to the effect that they can win a court case on this, but we are responding that we believe this is so ambiguous that there is a lack of preference for the consumer case that it would be much better if they accepted that these people should receive redress and compensation.  If the banks continue to point to their legal advice and we to our legal view, the result will be a legal conflict which would delay a lot of payments and would only address harm from 2013 onwards.  I appreciate that there is a lot of frustration around this but I would like to point to the following.  First, in the case of various lenders, a lot is being paid out now relating to the whole duration of the damage and not only post-2013.  This is a success of the examination.  Second, we are pushing back.  With the pushback there has been a lot of movement over the course of the year in various cases.  It is true to say that more remains to be done.  We do reserve the option of taking cases to the ombudsman and the courts.  As there is no longer a time limit on the harm, it means that the pre-2013 losses will be subject to rectification and compensation by the ombudsman.  That is very important.  Our strategy is to look at the lifetime of the damage, not just 2013 onwards.  If we focus only on 2013 onwards, in most cases not enough would be paid out.  Our aim is to maximise the protection for consumers.</p></speech>

We institute the administrative sanctions procedure not only against institutions but also against individuals.  We have published the names of individuals in recent years in situations where we have a process concluded against them.  We do publish once we have arrived at the appropriate time to do so.  Legally, we cannot discuss the inside information of individual banks.  The work of the committee is helpful in terms of assisting the public in understanding what is going on.  Through its interrogation of the banks, the banks in their testimonies can disclose, but we cannot.  That is the gap.</p></speech>

It is important to put the scale of this issue in context.  Professor Lane has identified 13,000 customer accounts as being impacted in this examination.  Prior to 2015, there were 7,100 accounts identified, which means more than 21,000 are already confirmed.  The cost of this phase, in terms of redress and compensation, is &euro;120 million across 3,300 customers.  On a <i>pro rata</i>basis, upwards, the overall cost of this examination will be &euro;500 million, and this is likely to rise as more customers are identified and the Central Bank starts levying fines.  It is fair to characterise this as one of the great consumer rip-offs in our State's history.  What people want to know is when this nightmare will end for the customers affected.  In regard to the people who have still not been repaid the money that was wrongly taken from them and have not received compensation, will Professor Lane say this morning when they will get that money?</p></speech>

Others have started the process in that they have agreed the nature of their schemes and brought them before their boards.  To commence redress and compensation, the banks also have also to set up their appeals process.  We think that payout for all of the other schemes will begin by the end of the year.  I do not think that will be the end of this because some people will choose to appeal, which is perfectly appropriate, and if the appeal is not to their liking, they may turn to the ombudsman and the courts.  As such, there will be further action.  In cases where a bank or banks decide they are not going to include a certain cohort, this will lead to further processes relating to those cohorts.</p></speech>

We can talk about the additional cases later.  There are now almost 10,000, of which the Central Bank and the banks are aware, who awaiting repayment and compensation.  Will Professor Lane give people a timeline as to when they can reasonably expect to be repaid and compensated?  That is the number one question that those affected want to have answered.</p></speech>

I must emphasise that it is the responsibility of the banks to deliver in this regard.  We are pressing the banks to move as quickly as possible.  It is for the banks to ensure that they satisfy their customers as quickly as possible.  In these cases, a lot will happen in the next few months.  It is not arbitrarily foreign to the future.  A lot will happen in the next few months.  We have already seen from the schemes that have moved forward that many cases can be handled within a number of months.  A lot has happened up to now.  As we mentioned in our statement, in the case of some lenders it has taken far too long for them to recognise what a proper redress and compensation scheme should look like and what a proper appeals system should like.  In most cases, the schemes are now being brought to the boards of the banks and they will be up and running soon.  For most cases, a lot will happen in the next few months.</p></speech>

Prior to that, I worked in enforcement.  It has been my experience that there is extensive legal engagement with entities, either directly with their in-house lawyers or one can always tell when letters are ghost-written by the law firm.  That does not appear on the face of the record but one knows it is the lawyers' advice.  It is also my impression, through the expert structuring of the negotiations - I perceive the supervisory engagement to be a legal negotiation - that although at the working level, we are dealing with the lenders, they are very well advised.</p></speech>

It would not be correct to say that there is a collective, uniform approach on the part of the banks.  As we have indicated, the redress and compensation is virtually complete in some cases.  This indicates telling that some banks have moved forward.  They have fully respected the intent of the examination and they put enough resources or a lot of resources into dealing with this matter.  In other cases, there is a lot more resistance and that is why we say in the update that they initially had a narrow view of who was affected.  Even where they agreed, there are cases of them not offering proper redress and compensation or not offering proper appeals processes.  We have had the full spectrum of generally reasonable efforts to comply versus their saying, "We do not think this is a big issue".</p></speech>

I do not believe this was an accident.  I do not believe that all the main lenders just happened to make the same mistake, which was against the interests of their customers.

How is it that all the main institutions involved in mortgage lending that were offering tracker products happened to have the same problem?  Will the Central Bank get an answer to that question?  Is it going back to look at board minutes, minutes of management meetings and other documentation?  Is part of the scope of the examination to discover how this happened in the first place?</p></speech>

Even someone who does not know anything about the individual banks or the details, that is, the man on the street, can point to a number of basic issues.  One is culture and, fundamentally, this comes back to a lot of our concerns.  We think there is a common culture across the banks, which is that if there is any ambiguity or area of doubt about how to interpret a contract, to interpret it in the bank's favour rather than the customer's favour.  That was a common dynamic across the system.  Second, as the Deputy said, given the movements in funding costs and in interest rates, the economic incentive for these banks was essentially to interpret any possibility of making their own profitability higher to the detriment of customers.  There are common factors there.  In a similar situation, there is a common culture, which comes back to many things about the banks.  In addition, there were the internal decision-making and other processes of individual banks.  Ms Rowland will comment on the information we are gathering.</p></speech>

The Deputy can expect more to follow.  In each case, there will be specific investigations into regulatory requirements where the suspicion is that they have been breached.  To bring that case through, there will be acquisition of all relevant documents that inform that investigations, interviews with individuals to get the witness narratives about those issues, and scrutiny of board minutes and meetings.  All the relevant evidence within the confines of that investigation will certainly be examined in the enforcement investigations to bring the cases through to completion.</p></speech>

Matters under the Criminal Justice (Theft and Fraud Offences) Act fall within the purview of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  We would not necessarily always be experts on the competence or area of investigation of other agencies or investigation of competition matters.  We have met other agencies for that reason and because they may have other lines of evidence available that they would not be able to share with us.  My colleagues recently met An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and we discussed, at a high level, what we have seen and the fact that we are not making a report, but we indicated that we stand ready to assist the Garda with any information or add to information that it may have.  We have made no formal section 33AK reports of suspicions to other relevant agencies but we have met them and shared our information with them to assist them in their considerations.</p></speech>

I understand that many people are frustrated with being in limbo, waiting to hear.  As part of the framework, we required all of the lending institutions to set up a special area for handling communications with people who may be affected.

In Permanent TSB, customers have been put back on a tracker rate of 3.25%.  I have looked at the documentation and think it is clear cut.  The tracker rate comprises the European Central Bank, ECB, rate, which is variable and the margin is fixed at the point that the person entered into the mortgage on a tracker rate.  If banks determine that those customers are entitled to go back to a tracker rate, then they are entitled to go back on the terms of the tracker mortgage that they originally had.  Is that a live issue being considered by the Central Bank for both AIB, at 3.67%, and Permanent TSB, at 3.25%?</p></speech>

Regardless of what the banks decide they will accept under this process, it remains the case that those affected can go to the ombudsman and it is to be hoped that enough, but there is also the option of going to the court system.  There are many ambiguities in the volume of different materials received by customers.  When there is ambiguity, a reasonable person might say what it reads as to him or her.</p></speech>

That really concerns me because that is not a matter of finding a customer here and there but of finding groups of customers.  I suspect some may be people who switched their mortgage or who had redeemed or repaid their mortgage in full.  Will Professor Lane give us a sense of where this is going?  Will he give us examples of when banks have not identified groups or cohorts of customers as being impacted?</p></speech>

Depending on when a person took a tracker mortgage, whether April 2006, March 2007 or so on, the nature of the paperwork that person would have received from a given lender will differ.  There might be what we call a population, which comprises those who took out a mortgage at the same time and have the same paperwork, and the bank might say the paperwork indicates that there is no issue.  We say that we think there is an issue.  Before starting to open individual files, one notes that these people all have the same contract or set of paperwork, so there is a yes-no decision as to whether people are in or out.  That is what we mean by excluded populations, where a bank might be saying that it thinks its reading of the paperwork is that there is no issue.  We say to look again at the evidence and that it should be part of what is redressed and compensated.  That may include scenarios where people have left one lender for another.  The examination is deliberately universal and comprehensive to try to capture every possible case.</p></speech>

I thought there would be much clearer answers.  It seems that the whole process is dogged by ambiguity, inconsistency and outright obstruction of the Central Bank's attempts to deal with this.  It can hardly fill people with confidence.  I think people will really despise the way the term "common culture" is used as a fancy term to dress up what many of us would see as systematic fraud and collusion to remove millions from individuals and families.  Maybe we can get to the bottom of a few things here.  I will address the matter of people who were told, maybe several years ago, that they were out of scope.  They received a letter from the bank, thought that was the end of it and did not take further action.  What will these people do now?  Does the Central Bank advise them to go back to their banks, or what else?  Can the Central Bank intervene for them?</p></speech>

Anyone who was told previously that they were not in scope is, on our insistence, in that group of people covered by the large examination framework and is in scope.  What I said previously about writing a letter of complaint stands as good general advice to anybody because the lender will have to answer the person in this phase if the person does that.  That is a good, general default position for people to set to protect themselves.</p></speech>

Regardless of what a bank may have said to anyone at any time, that does not give the bank a reason to exclude that case from the examination.  All cases are being investigated.  What remains helpful from the point of the view of the customer receiving information is to write to the bank to ask about his or her position in a process.</p><p>We hope the examination and the way cases are handled will accelerate.  It really has no standing within examination the fact that someone was told, at some point, they are out of scope.  </p></speech>

If they want, as of today, to tell us what is going on with their case, then that is helpful for them to write.  Essentially, the banks will write to those who will receive redress and compensation.  We are talking about scenarios where, hypothetically, there may be a cohort where we cannot reach agreement and the bank says it will not pay them compensation.  We are saying we will force them to write to those customers saying: "The bank has decided not to compensate you but, by the way, you can still go to the ombudsman."</p></speech>

They also have the obligation to have an independent adviser to, if one likes, do quality control on their work.  On our side, we have 26 members of staff plus our own advisers to help, which is essentially the challenge process, the on-site inspection process and so on.

Our assurance work has been done on-site and off-site, and has looked at files.

There will be more and all of that will be complete.  The system, as the Senator will have heard, depends on review by the lender, review then and oversight by its independent adviser, and the Central Bank, using its statutory powers or authorised officer powers.  There is a pyramid of checks.  We should be complete with every one of those lenders by Q1 2018.</p></speech>

The team go in, our team and some of the professional assistants we have procured to assist us with this to get the job done quicker, under authorised officer powers that the Central Bank has to go in and acquire information.  I have confirmed that these are on notice.  We take very seriously any non-co-operation.  Obstructing authorised officer powers is a very serious matter and one that has not arisen thus far in these two lenders.</p> <p>  In terms of the information that the team is scrutinising, this is a very complicated issue that underlies the examination with many manifestations of a tracker problem.  Some of them are contractual.  We look at the actual contract and the actual review that was done to make the decision about whether that is in or out.</p><p>We look at all the associated paperwork and all the decision-making around that to come to our own view on whether we agree or disagree with the decision.  The other manifestation of this problem is what is called a transparency issue.  If the contract was not exactly clear, there may be some ambiguity.  In such circumstances, we look at all the documentation from the time the decision was taken.  The level of detail involved might be such that there are 70 influencing factors to be considered individually.  The team looks in detail at factors like television advertisements and what was done and said at the time to ascertain whether they are in accordance with the decision that was made.</p></speech>

I do not think it would be right for me to comment on offences like theft and fraud from the perspective of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  Its powers of arrest are a matter for it.  We make statutory reports to the relevant agencies as we are obliged to do.  We have to meet a low evidential threshold in order to trigger the need for a statutory report.  It is not anything like a high burden or standard of proof.  Some objective evidence of the issue is required.  We would always err on the side of caution in this respect.  Even today, we are meeting and opening lines of discussion with the Garda and all the relevant agencies so they can assist us in making our report based on what we know.  We acknowledge that they may know things from other dimensions that we do not know.</p></speech>

Stages 3 and 4 relate to redress and compensation, as we have been discussing.  We have no power to compel in respect of those stages because engagement with them by the banks will essentially be voluntary.  Having said that, we have regulatory and persuasive powers to make sure this is done as quickly as possible.  There are deadlines.  We expect this to happen by date X, Y or Z, depending on the bank.  The banks complied with our deadlines for the stage 2 reports.  They all did comply.  We expect these further deadlines to be met.</p></speech>

In the case of the redress and compensation scheme, we have no power to order the compensation, but we have a timeline that we will continue to pressurise and challenge.  It is in our interests to move this on as quickly as possible.  I suggest it is also in the interests of the lenders.  We have taken the time to challenge and to make sure the proposals that have been made and approved by the boards of directors of the lenders are the best they can be.  I stand firm in my belief that we should continue to challenge the quality of those proposals.  We expect that all the compensation schemes will be up and running before the end of this year.  Some of them will have been completed by the end of the year.  We expect the lenders to move through this process at pace.  It is important for them to get it right as well as getting it done quickly.  We expect most of the compensation and redress to be paid this year and into next year.  We will have a further update for the committee early next year.</p></speech>

The explanation given for the system-wide issue was that it was an issue of culture.  It was suggested that culture explains how 11 different banks pushed people off tracker mortgages or did not allow people back on to tracker mortgages.  Unless culture operates like telepathy, that is not really a full explanation.  Does Professor Lane think it is possible that there were interactions between the banks on these issues during the period in question?</p></speech>

As I said earlier, even if there was no interaction, they shared a common set of incentives on the basis that it was expensive for them to fund these trackers.  If they were re-reading contracts and determining that certain scenarios were not really catered for in the way those contracts were written, they may have interpreted in light of that ambiguity that the correct rate should be X, or that certain customers should not be returned to trackers after the expiration of a fixed period.  They may have been using the legal ambiguity in the understanding that they could stand over such an interpretation, even if customers might have a very different interpretation.  The fair-minded person on the street might think it is surely obvious that the natural interpretation is that the tracker rate should be the original rate, as the Deputy suggested earlier, or that it is obvious that the customer has a right, but the legalistic interpretation might be different.  Essentially, much of the dispute centres on the gap between what one might be able to base a court case on and what needs to be done to put the customer first.</p></speech>

One is that in many of these institutions there has been significant internal turnover.  The management teams are different and the banks themselves, under the pressure of their leadership, have had to take a big look at how they operate.  A basic issue is poor documentation and being unclear to their customers and themselves about what exactly a product means.  It is not just us.  The European momentum is to have much clearer contracts and a greater amount of information provided.  It is to recognise that the circumstances of the world can change and that we should be crystal clear about what people understand going into a contract.  That basic systems-and-clarity issue is important.  It is also the case that a great deal of our consumer protection work these days is about bringing to the attention of boards the fact that part of the work of a board relates to governance and that ensuring staff on the front line who are designing these products and interacting with customers take seriously their obligation to put the customer first.  That is an ongoing engagement.  Ultimately, the culture issue is being pushed partly by us.  It is definitely in the long-term interests of the banks to elevate the protection-of-consumers agenda within organisations.  In this process, many hundreds of millions are going to be spent, not just in payouts but in the internal costs of running it.  Not just here, but around the world, there have been so many conduct scandals in recent years that it creates a major incentive for the banks to change their ways.  We have seen in this process, however, that they have relied on lawyers to narrow down the scope of the examination, which indicates that this is far from a revolution in how the banks operate.</p></speech>

Is it the case that the response of at least some of the more reticent banks demonstrates there is no significant change in culture?  The interactions at the committee here have been very frustrating.  It is like being on a treadmill.  Last year, they came in and said it would be sorted by Christmas and the same is happening this year.  It is just going around and around.  Is it fair to say that some of them are engaged in foot-dragging?</p></speech>

We just said there was a common, system-wide source of this.  It is important to emphasise that over the duration of the examination, there have been sharp differences across the banks.  Some banks get it and say they appreciate that this is the most efficient way to resolve it while others are at the more minimalist end.  It is helpful that the committee has been interrogating each individual bank.  It remains an important issue that there is this variation.</p></speech>

The reason it does not use the power is that relatively speaking, it is a relatively small amount of money compared with all the money that is pre-2013 and which it does not want to endanger.  The missing piece in the logic is that the Central Bank is saying that if it were to take legal action in respect of ongoing problems, it thinks that banks would withdraw co-operation with regard to the pre-2013 period.</p></speech>

In some of these cases, the banks are saying they think they are fine and that these people are not entitled to compensation and redress.  Currently, we are in a situation where there is a whole category which, if the banks concede, can be dealt with within the examination in one go.  If the banks decide to resist paying compensation and redress, the next most effective course is for the individuals to go to the ombudsman and the courts, which can compensate for the whole lifetime of the damage, not just post-2013.  As for the post-2013 category, the legal process will be very cumbersome, albeit it will eventually work out.  We could eventually deliver that if the system works, but it will take a long time and it is not the preferred option at this point.  Ms Rowland may be able to add to that.</p></speech>

Subject to thresholds and dispute, if proved down the line, it may deliver a partial subset of the answer.  The people would then have to experience two procedures, one after the other.  The full and complete answer being arrived at once is a far better outcome than one lengthy legal dispute procedure delivering a partial fragment of an answer, which may be the lesser part of the damage to the individual, which must then be followed up with a different one.  It does not seem to be the way to go.</p></speech>

Professor Lane spoke about the 2013 legislation.

The good news for the 13,000 people involved is that they were the ones identified as being affected.  They will receive compensation.  Although it is true that only a small number of lenders have moved a long way in that regard, the others have a process in train; it will happen soon.  The 13,000 cases have been confirmed and will be redressed and those involved compensated in the near future.  I agree that it is not soon enough, but the scheme is in train and on track and it will happen.  Apart from what we have been talking about, it is also about the others who have not been identified by the banks as being affected.</p></speech>

There has been finalisation of the design of the scheme which is subject to the banks' internal processes and the appeal mechanism being in place, but we do not have powers of compulsion.

I really want to find out the answer to this question.  What powers does the Central Bank need to ensure it can get the redress and compensation scheme under way for all of the banks by the end of the year?  Ms Rowland has said the Central Bank has no compensation powers.  Why is that the case?  What powers does it need?  This is the problem.  It appears from what we are hearing that in cases prior to 2013, when the bulk of the wrong tracker interest rates were imposed, the Central Bank can do absolutely nothing.  Effectively, from what I can see, it has no legal powers to put a redress and compensation programme in place.  What needs to be put in place by way of legislation to give the Central Bank the power to seek redress and compensation for those who were affected prior to 2013 and to ensure it can dictate to the banks that under a certain measure customers who have been impacted on should be dealt with?  Ms Rowland has said the Central Bank requires the banks to write to individuals to state they believe they have not been impacted on and that they will have to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  It appears that in the case of the banks and the Central Bank, the tail is wagging the dog.  The Central Bank has not included in its update that under existing legislation it did not have the power to do anything in cases prior to 2013.  What powers does it need from the Oireachtas to enable it to solve this problem?  I acknowledge that 13,000 cases have been identified in the investigation, but there are many more homeowners who need to be identified also.  Not only must they be identified, they must also receive compensation in a timely fashion.  They have put their lives on hold for up to eight or nine years.</p></speech>

We have been able to push to the limit and beyond what we can do legally to convince the banks that it is in their interests and those of customers to make payments on a voluntary basis, even though they could have taken a legalistic approach by stating they were not going to do it.</p></speech>

It looks to me as though it is dealing with it as if it was the banks' problem, which it is, but it is also a problem with regulation.  The Central Bank regulates the banks.  Do the delegates realise the impact this issue has had on people's lives?  If a person has a mortgage of &euro;200,000, he or she could be paying an extra &euro;4,000 a year based on the tracker versus the variable rate.  He or she could end up paying an extra &euro;100,000 over the term of the loan, or nearly half of the initial principal amount.  It is having a real impact on people's lives in terms of the education of their children and in their personal lives.  Professor Lane is saying the banks will address the issue of redress, but that is not good enough.  I do not believe they will do it on a voluntary basis.  One has to have the necessary powers.  I am, therefore, asking Professor Lane what powers he needs.  He has said the Central Bank has no powers of compulsion when it comes to the payment of compensation.  If powers were to be provided for the Central Bank, would Professor Lane be able to use them?  There were changes to the remit of the Financial Services Ombudsman to deal with cases over an extended period.  If Professor Lane was given those powers, would he use them?</p></speech>

The process is to try to accelerate and enlarge the number of people who do not have to invoke common law and who do not have to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman or the courts to receive what they are due.  We have added this additional process to try to deal with the thousands of cases which the Senator has correctly said are so damaging for so many.  It does not in any way remove the normal route whereby the Financial Services Ombudsman has the power to order redress and compensation.  It would be atypical for a regulator to move into the courts-----</p></speech>

It has echoes of the DIRT scandal when the banks had to be dragged kicking and screaming to deal with it.

Are there powers that need to be provided for the Central Bank to enable Professor Lane to carry out his roles to seek proper redress and compensation for the 13,000 people involved and to enable the bank to insist on the banks dealing with the customers who have been impacted on? Will Professor Lane, please, answer that question directly?</p></speech>

We are using our regulatory influence to deliver a lot and save many people from having to invoke the Financial Services Ombudsman and the courts.  We do not claim that every single case will be dealt with satisfactorily.  There will be decisions that will have to be appealed, perhaps to the Financial Services Ombudsman and possibly the courts, but this process will deliver a lot.</p></speech>

The enforcement process drives at proving breaches of regulatory frameworks and holding the lender, as well as any person concerned in management who is responsible, to account.  There are sanctions at the end of the process, including fines and disqualifications, but there are other options available.  However, it is an elongated legal process, the object of which is not always about the individual but about the behaviour of the financial services industry in that environment.  In all conventional systems, the set-up, in this country and others, is for individual cases, where it is entirely about the person, to be brought case by case basis to Financial Services Ombudsman.  That is when they can look at compensation and all aspects of the issue of detriment.</p></speech>

Not knowing is really difficult.  We have asked and required in the framework that the banks set up specific communications facilities so that they are in a position to communicate with the public.  If there are difficulties with that, and we have had some assistance before from information provided to us, they could send those letters to us so that we can check to make sure those systems are working.  We clarified our expectations on communications.  I can only say we consider all avenues of information that we receive and where they identify difficulties, we take those on board.</p></speech>

The fact that someone may have received a letter years ago saying "we do not think you are affected" is not relevant.  Those cases are within the scope of the examination.  It remains the case that it is helpful to write to the banks because they are required to reply.  There is no harm in individuals who may be discouraged.  The examination does not require people to write in.  These cases are being considered.  In many cases they will be included and will receive redress and compensation.  There may be cases where that does not happen.  It is important that they write to the bank and they can move forward to the ombudsman and the courts and so on.  In no sense is there any kind of prior exclusion of any case from this process.</p></speech>

It was the courts that brought it to the attention of the Central Bank.  It failed them as well.  It failed many of those people.  Was it not the courts that brought this to the attention of the Central Bank?  People had to go to the courts to get some form of redress.</p></speech>

I am aware of a case that nearly went to a full hearing in the Supreme Court and did not proceed at a late stage in advance of that hearing.  That certainly represents the difficult legal terrain that some of these cases sit within because that is representative of a hotly disputed issue, going all the way to the highest court in the land to be withdrawn at a late stage.</p> <p>  I make no comment about the Financial Services Ombudsman save to say that we have had very good current engagement with that office and it stands ready to do the right thing by dealing with complaints brought to it.  From our perspective, considerable work was done on the tracker matter and I know that the enforcement investigations were open in advance of that Supreme Court decision and we were committed to pursuing them.  We would have continued.  That case presents difficulty but we had started the enforcement case before that and we are fully committed to bringing it forward.  </p></speech>

In a civil court action, a limitation period exists to prevent people bringing cases after a certain length of time.  In the legal mechanism of a court case that is a defence someone can raise.  If it is not raised as a defence it will not become an issue in the case.  It is different for the ombudsman because that is a statutory filter it has to apply in considering complaints.  It has been very helpful that the limitation period for the ombudsman has been varied from a statutory perspective.  It sweeps away any difficulty there is with long-dated cases coming forward for complex financial products.  That has been very beneficial.  It acts to assist people who want to bring cases that have been in existence for a long time before the courts without acting as a barrier to their doing so.  It operates in two different ways, depending whether it is the statutory ombudsman scheme or it is litigation in courts.</p></speech>

There are extraordinary situations, such as those the committee heard last week, where the severity of loss may be such that the affected customer may reasonably want to test whether the amount of compensation is sufficient by bringing their case to the ombudsman and, if they are still not satisfied, to then resort to the courts system.  There are many options for those affected but the hope is that, although the examination process is still too slow, it will deliver an upfront payment sooner rather than later.  Approximately 3,000 people have already received a payment and approximately 13,000 more will be paid in the coming months.  This in no way damages or restricts a person's option to take the payment and still bring his or her case to the ombudsman and the courts.  Consequently, this gives many layers of redress or recourse for those affected.  We are not saying that people should immediately go to the ombudsman.  They should consider the redress and compensation offer they receive from the bank, take the independent advice, which will be paid for under this mechanism, and at that point make a decision.  I imagine the independent advisers, who have been very involved in helping people deal with this issue, will be able to help people work out if the offer is sufficient or if they should go to the ombudsman to seek more compensation.</p></speech>

I wish to address overcharging and sharp practices in respect of commercial loans to SMEs.  Such a loan could be a tracker mortgage or a similar financial product such as a rate swap product involving a bank inducing a company that is trying to trade out of trouble onto another product which would cost it more money, or unilateral rate changes involving the cost of funds plus a margin.  Banks have their own formula for calculating the cost of funds and that is a moveable feast.  Banking sources have indicated that there are SMEs in similar situations to private citizens in that they have suffered enforcement actions by banks following non-performance of loans into which banks tricked their SME customers either by removing them from a tracker or putting them onto some similar financial product to their detriment.  The particular cases of which I have heard suggest this does not solely concern enforcement action and overcharging but also extreme situations involving the closure of businesses, loss of jobs and personal fallout for those involved.  I raise this issue in regard to SMEs and tracker mortgages in particular.  Members know that SMEs do not have access to the financial ombudsman in the same manner as a private citizen.  Their recourse for remedy is to the courts and they do not have the same avenues of recourse that Professor Lane said are available for private customers.  In view of information I have been given and cases that have been brought to my attention I wish to know the extent to which the Central Bank has been investigating or assessing the impact on SMEs as part of its assessment and crystallisation of the dispute in respect of tracker mortgages and similar financial products.  How many such cases has the Central Bank discovered within that assessment process?  What provision are the banks making for compensation in such cases?  To what extent are SMEs included in the tracker redress scheme?  This is another cohort that is not being talked about.  I have heard of cases, even from people within the banking community who have dared to come forward, which indicate there is an equal and perhaps even more devastating problem in this area because although the focus is on people and their homes, and there is a clear reason for that, some small businesses have been devastated by the overcharging, sharp practices and possibly illegal activities of banks, although the latter remains to be proven.  I want to know about this particular area of lending.</p></speech>

A commercial loan that is secured on, for example, a home is within the scope.  There is probably an overlap.  If a firm funded itself with a tracker mortgage on a home, that is within the scope and will be covered.  Of course, there are many types of loans to SMEs and there are other products that are not covered by this examination.  The Senator has raised an interesting question about whether there were other violations of our codes in respect of SMEs.  As Mr. Sibley mentioned, we are aware of various risk factors, but there is no comprehensive examination like the tracker examination.</p></speech>

The concern is that, while the issue of individuals' loans is in focus and being discussed by us, there has been considerable abuse by the banks of their position of power in negotiating terms and conditions, unilaterally changing interest rates and encouraging people to switch financial products to their detriment.  However, financial considerations and the fact that they have little recourse to remedy the situation means that SMEs must go to the courts.  Are the witnesses satisfied that adequate mechanisms are in place to assist SMEs that have legacy issues with the banks?</p></speech>

There are clear protections, particularly for those SMEs that are in distress.  If there are breaches of those codes, we hold the banks to account through our enforcement actions.  If the Senator has specific information that we do not, we would be keen to see it and would act on it.</p></speech>

Regarding enforcement, penalties and fines, it would seem that, notwithstanding what the country has gone through and the backlash against banks, they still seem to believe that they do not need to adhere to the same standards as other professions.  If someone's solicitor is fined, the solicitor does not turn around and send a fee note to a different client telling him or her to help pay the fine.  With the banks, however, whatever financial penalties the Central Bank imposes on them just seem to be passed on to customers.  How are they paying?</p> <p>  This speaks to the issue of the banks' culture.  Some members have outlined a litany of incidents, namely, the bogus non-resident accounts, the DIRT scandal, systematic overcharging of customers by NIB, the tracker loan scandal involving all of the banks, general governance issues at Anglo Irish Bank and INBS, AIB and Allfirst, the PPI situation and endowment mortgage sales.  These are just the headline issues.  In terms of culture, what sanctions will make a difference to bankers' thinking?  They do not operate like human beings at all.  This is what is constantly reported back by people who have had encounters.  As a country, taxpayers and a Government, everyone had to stretch to save the banking system for public interest reasons.  As such, that professionals within the banks have not been held to account seems to be a major issue.</p> <p>  The greatest impact the Central Bank could have is to tell banks that if they breach a certain threshold of behaviour, it will consider revoking their operating licences.  That is what will hit them.  They will pass on fines and the like.  That is what they do.  They are like a machine that swallows up fines and grabs that money from somewhere else.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1791" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101900002#S01800"><p>Let me make several responses.  We can and do hold individuals to account.  We have an administrative sanctions procedure.  For example, a number of those involved in the running of INBS are in that process now.  Even though someone might say that what happened at INBS was years ago, we have to persist.  Where we believe there to be a case, we will pursue it.  There has been a significant turnover in the banks.  The current management is not the management that was in place during the crisis.  We remain concerned about the banks even with their new teams in place.</p> <p>  In terms of the principles of pursuing financial penalties and individuals, the fitness and probity regime is a part of the process of holding individuals to account and shareholders care about the costs.  There is a large bottom-line cost in the running of the operation, the redress and compensation and the fines.  The financial calculations are not purely passed along.  There is a cost to those involved in financing these banks.</p></speech>

We have all lived in this country and seen successive scandals.  For that reason, it is important that the banks be held to account by means of a strong, clear regulatory framework, that we be robust in our challenge to them and that we demand high standards.  I do not just mean in terms of financial regulation but also in the context of the entire system of accountability.  Transparency is a part of that.  It is my impression that having more information about the outcome of enforcement cases - we have attempted to be as transparent as possible within the requirements of confidentiality - is to the benefit of pressurising the system.</p> <p>  Conduct risk was not on the table in boardroom discussions.</p><p>It may be that they knew very well about liquidity provisions or other prudentially focused provisions.  However, there is something about requiring the people who run the lending institutions to discuss the impacts on their customer base of the products they design and sell.  The incentives must be considered because they help as a driver for better culture.  We have been in an after-the-event compliance environment, historically, in respect of our approach to these things.  Scandals occur and are followed by aftermaths and clean-ups.  There always will be difficulties and scandals, I think.  I am experienced enough in financial regulation to be somewhat pessimistic about it.  However, someone has to keep dropping in the medicine.  We have got to have high standards, expect more and keep driving for that challenge.  We must work together to bring about a more proactive consideration of consumer impact.  I wonder how often anyone in a boardroom discussed impact on consumers before products were sold.  I think they are discussed after things happen.  We have to foster a more incentive-based, structured, forward-looking approach.  I do not say that will solve everything but the time to have the conversation is certainly before it happens, not afterwards.  In fact, we probably will always need to have both.</p><p> In respect of the conditionality on banking licences, I can perfectly understand the Senator's observation.  That is a legal matter that would have to be very carefully done, although I certainly accept the sentiment of the remarks.</p></speech>

We can sit in these meetings for a long time and I feel we almost become conditioned again to the role of the Central Bank as it is.  We are invited by the exchange almost to forget the human consequences that families have suffered.  Following the long exchanges in today's meeting, I might forget the previous hearings we have had, but I will not do so.  I will not forget the human consequences and carnage left after this event.  Last night, I said to Deputy Pearse Doherty that at one stage at a meeting here I felt he was way over the top in his comments.  Having read into it, I have to say he was spot on and could have said a lot more.  Today I agree with him.</p> <p>  The question Senator Mulherin raised is about a licence.  The Central Bank issues the licences to the banks.  Is that fair to say?</p></speech>

If I go into a licensed premises and drink after hours, I will be in court and fined for breach of the licensing laws.  If I go into a shop and steal a pair of socks, I probably will be in court the following Tuesday.  I have the newspapers in front of me and can give the witnesses a sample of the headlines about the banks: "Tracker Scandal Litany of Shame", and "Why Nobody Will Stand Up to Our Bullying Banks".  That is what the people think about this.</p> <p>  What steps can the Central Bank or the ECB take to ensure that some form of restriction or sanction is put on the banks for failing to do things honestly?  Has Mr. Sibley looked at it from that perspective?  The banks were dishonest in what they did.  They stole money from people which they have not repaid.  Whether they did it before or after 2013, they still stole the money and have not given it back.  I would not consider it to be a moral or legal issue.  I would consider that they did wrong and should give it back.  Is that the way the Central Bank would look at it?</p></speech>

The first level is to accelerate and do as much as we can so that payments are made to those affected.  Equally, however, there is the Chairman's question about the implication for the banks over and beyond making payments to those affected.  If they have violated our codes, they will be subject to enforcement actions.  That already happened pre-examination with PTSB, we already announced the settlement, the enforcement, for Springboard, which is now owned by PTSB, and that is the administrative sanction in terms of violations of our codes.  If we see evidence that we think should be passed on to the Garda in respect of fraud and theft, it is for the Garda to make that decision.</p></speech>

They took people's money fraudulently.  The banks made people pay back money to them for which they were not entitled to ask.  On request, they did not return that money.  After a number of years, we could describe it as the bank stealing the money from the people and not returning it.  Is that not the basic position?  It is not a question of legislation, morals or anything else.  It is a question of grand theft from thousands of people and the money remains in the banks.</p><p>Let us just look at the human side of that for one second.  Professor Lane spoke earlier about how the banks behave and about what they are doing.  As for the woman who wrote to the committee who had three children, two of whom have Asperger's; the woman who wrote that a whole ten years were gone from her life; the man who had a stroke; the houses that were repossessed; and the 79 buy-to-let properties which were lost, how can Professor Lane stand over any of it?  Why can he not tell the banks involved in those individual cases, for example, that they stole these people's money and demand they are put back on the correct payments, whether the cases date from 2013 or before?</p></speech>

Professor Lane has to understand this.  I am tired of listening to the Central Bank telling us all of these things.  I understand them.  I understand Ms Rowland's difficulties in respect of the law and everything else.  The fact of the matter, however, is that when one goes back to it, these banks did wrong by their customers, before 2013 and after.  They went to the courts and failed.  Mr. Kissane told the committee at one stage that he had won court cases and the banks still fought similar cases, rather than conceding.  Forgetting all the talk about the legal framework and everything else, although that is required, people are asking what are the banks' responses, on a human level, to the theft they have conducted and to what they have done.  Professor Lane has said that he has challenged them.  Does he still have to challenge them?  Are they still absolutely reluctant to deal with what they have done to a considerable number of their customers?</p></speech>

We agree with the Chairman that referring only to the legal framework is not sufficient.  That is why we have gone beyond that framework in respect of our regulatory powers to push the banks into developing redress and compensation schemes, which will mean that more people will receive redress and compensation than would have been possible had we just left it to the ombudsman and the courts system to deal with this matter.  We fully agree that it is not sufficient just to resort to legalistic interpretations.  The motivation is strong within the Central Bank to ensure that our processes are not just <i>pro forma</i>.  We are pushing back in order to ensure that as many people as possible receive reasonable redress and compensation payments.<br/><br/>It is very important to recognise that there is variation.  Some banks have proactively signed up and conducted themselves in a reasonable manner.  That is seen in the fact that thousands of cases have already been concluded in terms of redress and compensation.  Other banks were slower but we have now pushed them into a situation in which we believe more redress and compensation schemes will be initiated very soon.  We have also signalled that various cohorts of populations remain in dispute.  It is not a one-size-fits-all response.  We believe a lot of progress was made this year to get us to our current position.  We should not have been required to push the banks to get this far.  I do not want the message to be that not much has happened in respect of this situation.  A lot has happened.  There has been a lot of progress and much of it will crystalise into more payments to more people in the coming months.  There remain outstanding issues.</p></speech>

No, I do not.  I will tell Professor Lane why.  Some of the banks which have appeared before the committee told us that customers would not be paid until next year, perhaps even late next year.  One bank brazenly told us that it would not meet the deadlines.  Its representatives sat there and told us that the bank would not meet the deadline and it would not give us the figures we asked for.  They told us that, in fact, the bank would not tell us anything until this thing was over.  That is the kind of respect it showed for the Irish Parliament.  That bank is licensed in this country.  I do not have great faith in it.</p> <p>  The other issue is that in 2016, the Central Bank spend &euro;7.3 million on legal fees.  I wonder how much will be spent in 2017.  I am not critical of the Central Bank spending the money - it has to - my criticism is that it has to.  My criticism is that the banks are forcing the Central Bank and the Irish taxpayer to pay even more money in the course of 2017 to try to resolve this issue.  It will cost even more money.  In terms of professionals, did Professor Lane ever ask the auditors or the legal advisers in those banks about this particular tracker issue?  Did they know about it?  Surely if they audited the books in the way in which they should, they would have known about it.  Is it not amazing that every single bank had the same problem at the same time?  They all had tracker issues.  It has happened to them all and they are all fighting it in the same way.  Can we not call it what it is?  It is a cartel.  It was an arrangement.

If one extrapolates the figures from that to the larger number, it is going in the direction the Deputy has indicated.

However, from what we know now, the indications from the extrapolation are consistent with what the Deputy is saying.</p></speech>

Bank customers and many members of the public are irritated because approximately &euro;300 million of their money is resting in the banks' accounts when they are experiencing financial distress as a result of the banks not returning their money to them.</p> <p>  I will now focus on the compensation scheme.  When the representatives of the Central Bank appeared before the committee last year, I made the point that the schemes the bank had to sign off on were inadequate.  I welcome the fact that the bank has challenged two of the schemes.  When a person has been overcharged by &euro;30,000 on a tracker mortgage, that money is stolen from him or her.  I know some individuals in this position.  I have sat in their houses and listened to their concerns.  They have cried in front of me when they told how their children's childhoods were taken from them and how matters were made worse when they did not have the money to cover medical procedures.  Some people blame the financial distress this caused them for the breakdown of their marriages and no longer having access to their children on a 24-7 basis.  A person who has had &euro;30,000 stolen from him or her by a bank is being offered &euro;3,000 compensation, which amounts to &euro;1 for every day he or she did not have access to his or her money.  In Professor Lane's view is that level of compensation adequate?</p></speech>

Compensation is proportionate and we would expect higher rates for the more severe scenarios.  The back-up is that one can appeal the level of compensation within the framework.  The circumstances of every individual are different.  The lender is supposed to take into account the circumstances of the individual when making the initial offer.  If, however, the initial offer is not enough, then the independent appeals process provides a mechanism to challenge it.  If the outcome of the independent appeals process is not to the satisfaction of the customer, then the ombudsman stands ready to take his case.  Finally, there are the courts.  In cases where the losses have been really severe, I would expect that these other mechanisms to kick in when the initial offer of the bank is not enough.  I will ask my colleague Ms Rowland to elaborate.</p></speech>

In other banks, the average compensation is 12%.  I would like to understand how our guests think that is an adequate level of compensation.</p></speech>

The framework that was put in place had a set of principles or high levels that the lenders were required to adhere to or to consider.  The compensation scheme's amounts and proposals are approved by the banks and the lenders and it is they who put them forward.  They were required to look at the groups of people affected from the viewpoint of different experiences that they had, from the gravest which is the loss of home ownership and loss of property and all the horror that brings.  Certain proposals are being made by lenders.  Another variant is that the proposals are not uniform, because it is the boards of the lenders that are approving the offers.  I am sure the Deputy heard different information about various categories from the lenders that appeared before the committee so he knows very well that they vary.  That is at the most severe.  Taking legal proceedings has an impact.  One makes choices on whether to enter into legal proceedings on the overpayment.  One may decide not to take legal proceeding because of the money.  Responsibility for signing off on the schemes rests with the lenders.</p></speech>

Some of the discussion we have had today is about the frustration with the progress and why we are not further down the line.  This is because the Central Bank team did an enormous amount of work in challenging the banks in respect of all sorts of dimensions of their proposals.  Proposals came to the Central Bank to the effect that there was no need at all for an appeals mechanism because whatever compensation the banks were putting forward was enough.  The team successfully challenged that.</p><p>Then more of the proposals were, "Yes, that person is in scope and they are impacted but nothing really bad happened so there is no compensation at all".  The team successfully challenged that.  Over time, the team successfully took the time, which was a good investment of their energy, to challenge those proposals to bring them up from where they were.</p></speech>

The Central Bank put the framework in place, challenges and pushes, and does not allow the worst excesses of unacceptable, but the lender's board decides the scheme.  Given that we knew this was the scenario that was being built, that is the reason none of them is allowed to even start without the appeals mechanism.  People might be forgiven for saying: "Why bother with that appeal part of it at all because it does not deliver a monetary sum?"  However, these are supposed to be starting level amounts and some of these were proposed to us as closed amounts that would not be varied or improved.  We see the appeals process as a way by which a lot of more detail about personal circumstances, if needed, can be brought forward.  One of the benefits of the scheme is that people get the payment upfront so they have it and there is no disincentive-----</p></speech>

With regard to the hundreds of millions of euro that has been wrongly taken from customer accounts by the banks, does the Central Bank believe that was done unlawfully?</p></speech>

The strategy has been to try to get payments to those affected as quickly as possible, but that will be backed by the enforcement-type investigations assessing what has happened here and what codes were violated.  There are issues to do with our codes and the sanctions that can be imposed.  If we see evidence - again there is a low threshold of evidence - that triggers by a report by us to the Garda, we will do that.  Those are the different steps in this process but there is not a blanket answer.  I emphasise, coming back to why this examination is taking place, we are going beyond the legal issues.</p></speech>

The lawyers on their side may argue, "We think this is legal", but we are saying that is an arguable issue and to do what is right on behalf of the consumer is to put that to one side and accept that a reasonable person would say a harm was done and make payments on that basis.  It is, therefore, not only about the legal issues.</p></speech>

There was no barrier to the banks moving forward with redress and compensation as soon as they could.  This goes back to differentiation.  Some banks moved a lot earlier to implement those schemes.  The 30 September 2017 deadline was the universal hard deadline but the banks could have moved a lot earlier and, in many cases, we had to push back in terms of what they were trying to submit.  It is not the case that they were all waiting until 30 September 2017 to issue these reports but the hard enforcement deadline was the end of September.</p></speech>

First, eight of the financial institutions had not issued a penny in redress by the deadline and, therefore, it is not the case that they were all waiting.  Even though they were entitled to and the redress element was supposed to run concurrently, they have simply not done so.</p><p>Instead, a year into the examination, the Central Bank extended the deadline by 12 months.  When exactly was it extended?</p></speech>

One of the few powers the bank has, and is willing to use, is to direct banks to issue reports.  In December 2016, the Central Bank did this.  It set clear timeframes for phases one and two but despite all what we have heard to the effect that the Central Bank was pushing the banks, it gave them another 12 months to come up with a figure of how many customers they had taken money from.  That is simply unacceptable.  I am sure the individuals before us are upstanding people and are trying to do the best for the country and for the individuals affected but I know some of these people personally and I know their stories.  I do not understand why they allowed the banks another 12 months and it flies in the face of the witnesses' claims that they are trying to push the banks into action.  The banks have strung their customers out and three quarters of those identified have not yet had a penny in redress.</p></speech>

Various banks moved ahead of that but various others resisted the scale of the cohorts to be included, as well as the nature of redress and compensation.  There was a long and continuous engagement with the banks on the final deadline but a lot was also done before that.  It was not that nothing happened before 30 September 2017.  Some banks moved as quickly as possible and others less so.</p></speech>

In 2010, the Central Bank wrote to the financial institutions on the tracker mortgage issue.  It stated that it would take administration sanctions but, seven years on, we still do not know how many people are affected.  We know that, seven years after the Central Bank issued the letter, at least 13,000 customers have been identified.  The banks are taking a hand to the Central Bank because the latter is a dog that is refusing to bark, never mind bite.</p></speech>

There have been changes to the codes to reinforce the importance of handling these mortgages correctly and these may have avoided even more cases during the period in question.  It is disappointing that, despite these interventions, this went on in such a comprehensive way.  We are now trying to push the banks to offer redress and compensation as quickly and as comprehensively as they can and we are proactively trying to hold the banks to their promises in this regard.  Some 13,000 cases have been accepted.  In 3,000 cases, there has been an initial payment and we think a lot has been done.  If we could have done more at an earlier point, it would have been better, but a lot was done in the initial phase.  In 2014, the enforcement against Springboard happened and this examination was unprecedented in the way we pushed the banks to do the right thing within what we could legally do.</p> <p>  We are doing a lot to sort out the problem.  We believe there are banks which should have moved more quickly.  Some banks did comply and engaged with the process fully from the word "Go" but we want to get to the end of the process now.  We want to show the degree to which this examination process will yield good results for those who have been affected while allowing people to turn to the traditional mechanisms to get satisfaction if necessary.  This has been effective to a degree and there is more to come.  It is important to reassure those affected that a lot will be delivered by this examination and saying we have been ineffective does not send out the right message.  We are pushing the banks quite a lot.  A lot will be achieved that would not have been achieved if we had not intervened.  We are working on behalf of those affected and this is the most effective way to deal with it.</p></speech>

A fairly detailed report was published by the Central Bank in March this year and the answer to the issue of the deadline lies on pages 6 and 12 of that report.  Phase two of the examination is said to be ongoing, and in regard to meeting the December 2016 deadline, on page 6 it states that nine lenders had submitted the phase two reports with the remainder being engaged in phase two reviews.  It goes on to explain the use of powers and on page 12 it explains that the timelines have been set but continue to be monitored on a lender-by-lender basis because they have to take account of the size of the relevant lender's loan book, the scale and complexity of issues and the complexities associated with a thorough review being completed.  The original deadline was met by nine institutions but the quality of the work being done was an issue and this explains the extension.</p></speech>

Had the nine institutions submitted their final report by the original date?  Ms Rowland said that no repossessions were allowed to take place in the examination period.  I had a lengthy conversation with an individual last night who lost his property on 16 January 2016, at the start of this examination and when the Central Bank told the banks to examine their tracker mortgage issues.  He is one of the 100 or so people who lost their property and the bank has now put its hands up and admitted it was wrong.  He should have been on a tracker all the time, but the property is lying empty.  There is no electricity, gas or heating and what the banks have done is ridiculous.  Ms Rowland tells us that nobody should have lost their property during this process.</p></speech>

Maybe the expectations we have of the Central Bank are unrealistic but if it needs additional powers it would be pushing at an open door and we would provide them.</p><p>We would welcome any request to this committee in that regard.</p><p> I cannot understand this for the life of me.  This was the biggest financial swindle in the history of the State to the value of &euro;500 million.  People have taken their own lives as a result of it and many others have contemplated it.  There have been mental health breakdowns, marital breakdowns, health implications and all the stolen years from so many people.  It is not just the account holders but their families and how the situation affected their extended family.  After all of this is done and dusted, nobody will lose their job and nobody will go to prison.  There is no accountability whatsoever.  What we hear from the Central Bank is that letters were sent in 2010 and an examination was set up two years ago.  There were only two on-site inspections although 15 institutions are involved.  What the public would expect is that the Central Bank would be in there going through not just the assurance by the banks that they have identified the right tracker mortgage victims, but who was responsible.  Is it correct that the only on-site inspections in terms of institutions are those that have already gone through enforcement proceedings?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1915" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101900002#KK00200"><p>I am sorry, but if I might raise two things.  The first is that we welcome the reference to additional powers.  To be clear, we will consider that very carefully and keep that under review.  We will take that very seriously and look at the powers that we have, the way they can be used and see if there is something that we should ask for or could consider that would be an addition to the increase in powers that the Central Bank received in 2013.  That is very important to say and we welcome it.</p> <p>  When we were discussing on-site scrutiny of documents and paper assurance, that is entirely and only in the confines of this examination.  I left outside of that discussion any talk of what goes on inside enforcement investigations because we normally do not talk about those until they come through to conclusion.  That does not talk about what happens in enforcement.  Enforcement involves interviewing individuals in the institutions, acquiring the information and looking at the minutes, so it does not cover what is involved in the forensic enforcement approach, which is running separate to the examination.  There is a twin-track approach.</p></speech>

However, separate to that, there are two enforcement investigations open and under way, the names of which are in the public domain.  There are two more that are in train and more are going to follow.  They follow their own particular methodology which involves document acquisition and witness interview in the way that an investigation requires.</p></speech>

A total of 26 individuals being assigned to this task is not enough.  I know the Central Bank is under-resourced.  More people are working in my corner shop than are working on this &euro;500 million fraud.  I feel really sorry for the individuals who have this huge burden of expectation that the Irish public has that those 26 staff will deliver this.  How many financial institutions has the Central Bank gone into for the purpose of enforcement where it has gone in and looked at the minutes, seized documents, tried to find out who was responsible, whether a cartel was in operation, if directors made a decision, if there were internal whistleblowers and if there were issues of dissent within the banks?</p></speech>

The answer to the question is that there are four enforcement investigations at various stages.  I do not want to discuss the details of the enforcement investigations until they come to fruition, which they will.</p></speech>

In these reports we are focusing in on how we are trying to deliver redress and compensation to those affected because all of those individual families require and deserve that as soon as possible.  Our normal way to make sure our regulations are upheld and that violations are sanctioned is through enforcement and that is ongoing.  The reality of the enforcement process is that it takes a long time and it will be ongoing.</p></speech>

That is 11 in total.</p></speech>

Two enforcement investigations are ongoing and they were named in the update &ndash; Permanent TSB and Ulster Bank.  Two more investigations are in train, according to the term used.  In relation to enforcement investigations, is it the case that there are a number of on-site visits and investigations in general?</p></speech>

It does so through the use of compulsory powers and it supplements that with face-to-face interviews with people, either as witnesses, who will have information about that or subjects of the investigation as well.  Some of that is done on site in the Central Bank where we have facilities for tape recording of interviews and where one is required to attend for formal interview.  If necessary, the officers would go to the institution but quite often the paper or the data are acquired from the computer systems.</p></speech>

I will clarify.  In the course of the on-site assurance, in the examination there was talk of there just being two of those investigations but two are complete and nine more are under way, so there are 11 of those.</p></speech>

On the question of powers, we have gone through the 2013 issue, aside from the 2013 Act is it the case that the Central Bank already had the powers and retained the powers to do an enforcement investigation outside of the 2013 Act?  Is it the case that the administrative sanctions procedures are available outside the 2013 Act so the bank has the power to go into banks, do investigations outside of that Act but what it did not have was the power to impose redress?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1934" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Derville Rowland" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101900002#KK02100"><p>That is the case.  In 2004, the Central Bank was given enforcement powers for the first time.  It is called the administrative sanctions procedure.  Members will recognise it from television and living in the world.  It is a normal, legal based investigation where one acquires all the relevant documentation so one can prove the underlying breaches and then there is a very comprehensive system for hearings to determine in the usual way whether those facts are made out and if a breach can be proved and if one moves into that stage then there is a possibility of imposing sanctions, both with respect to regulated entities, the lenders, and with respect to persons concerned in the management of those regulated entities.  Since the crisis in 2010, the Central Bank has done some considerable investigations of scale and size and for the first time into INBS and Quinn and we have been involved in High Court litigation on five occasions to secure the use of those and the constitutionality of those powers.  To date, we have settled or concluded more than 100 cases, bringing in more than &euro;60 million in fines.  We have disqualified individuals and fitness and probity powers have come on stream also.</p><p>There was a very big increase in enforcement powers, and fitness and probity powers, before the 2013 Act.</p></speech>

This goes back to retrospectivity.  The fines are now, I believe, 10% of turnover at its highest or &euro;10 million, whichever is higher, but that came into effect when the law was changed.  From memory, I cannot remember the exact year the change came in.  Prior to that, it was &euro;5 million.  There are also disqualifications and other powers.  There is another perspective to this, which is a very powerful tool, as the Central Bank absolutely believes transparency and publication is more important, or just as important.  Not just in Ireland but throughout the world, if one speaks to other regulators or has discussions in other jurisdictions, it is often the case that fines are one dimension to measure what went wrong but reputation is very important.  Transparently publicising in as much detail as possible the outcome of enforcement cases is a very important tool in achieving regulatory compliance within the institution that was the subject of the case itself.  It sends a very important message across all of the institutions, not just in that area but in all of the other areas of the markets.  The Central Bank of Ireland has committed completely to that perspective in its enforcement approach, in so far as we are able to within the confines of the law.  After cases are concluded one will see all of the information we are able to put into the public domain about those cases.  I believe there was a discussion at one of these hearings about one of those very cases.  We put this into the public domain and it is a very important tool.</p></speech>

Is the Central Bank able to convey to those people its view that they have been impacted?  Those customers receive a letter from the bank stating it has looked at their cases and decided they are not impacted but that they can go to the ombudsman, and meanwhile the Central Bank believes the people have been impacted but it cannot tell them.</p></speech>

As we move through this process and come up against issues, we will look at them with our powers and seek to solve them.  Requiring institutions to write to individuals makes sure they are on specific notice of their situation, and that is very important.  The Deputy is referring to the big information asymmetry between individuals and lenders and the Central Bank.  We are certainly going to look at doing the most we can to assist with this to the fullest extent possible.  We have already met the Financial Services Ombudsman and opened a dialogue on exactly this, and we will look to be of maximum assistance.</p></speech>

We cannot have a situation where a bank is writing to customers telling them they are not impacted, but the regulator knows they have been impacted and the customers do not know this.  Ms Rowland has to see this point and I ask her to consider it.</p></speech>

What are the views of the Central Bank on prohibiting any discrimination by lenders between new and existing customers?  The Governor may say it does not apply any more and, to be fair to most lenders it does not, but there are cases where different treatment still occurs.  If we take, for example, Permanent TSB's existing customers, when it comes to a fixed rate offering the lowest offer they will receive is 4.2%, irrespective of their loan to value ratio.  New customers can get a rate as low as 3.2%.  This is one example of clear discrimination between new and existing customers.</p> <p>  The Competition and Consumer Protection Commission did a paper on mortgage options and looked at the issue of cashback offers in the mortgage market.  It made the point these offers and their marketing are potentially exploitative of consumer biases and may result in consumers making decisions for short-term gains that over the medium or long term are not in their best interests.  It has recommended that a joint working group examine the issue further.  The focus groups that have been done have found that many consumers are confused and unable to really assess what is in their best long-term interests.  What is the Central Bank's view of prohibiting these cashback offers?</p></speech>

It is a feature of many markets and not just financial markets that this type of differentiation takes place.  So long as we have a commercial banking system, if some lenders chose to make that differentiation, short of writing the law the Deputy is suggesting what is open to those existing customers comes back to the general switching debate.</p><p>We exhort everyone who has a mortgage to on a regular and repeated basis take a look at and ask what else is out there.  We currently have our consultation document on mortgage switching.  We advocate the switching process.  Already there are lots of gains to be had.  The suggestions we have in the consultation document will make it even better.  We advocate greater ability to switch.  That is absolutely the case.</p></speech>

They are looking at a new customer coming in to the same bank as them in the same circumstances on a better rate.  That is unfair.  From a consumer protection point of view, it cannot be stood over.  I ask the Governor's view on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.1964" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Professor Philip Lane" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101900002#MM00300"><p>From the perspective of those customers who are in that situation, the perception of unfairness is there but in the end, this is a commercial market.  It is a commercial mortgage market where we advocate, through consumer protection, having as much transparency as possible, as much information as possible, and extra protections for those in arrears.  One now sees in the mortgage market all sorts of different offers which, I do not disagree, are hard to process.  How does one compare all of these different offers?  There is definitely a challenge in that regard but that is the nature of a commercial mortgage market.</p> <p>  On the cash back, no doubt there is a potential risk to some consumers.  For others, there is a value.  People's lives are different, for instance, there is the value of saying that one accepts one will pay more over the long run but one accepts that because one's short-run needs are such that the cash back is valuable to him or her.  In other words, there is a trade-off that maybe it would protect some types of households who are genuinely making an error and not properly calculating the cost, but others can make that calculation and with full eyes open decide cash back is their preference.  There is a global debate about behavioural finance, not only in terms of paternalism but in terms of at least ensuring there is enough information and transparency, and having online calculators so that people can plug the numbers in as easily as possible.  That is where the balance is.  Maybe Mr. Sibley will add something.</p></speech>

In the circumstance when an existing customer is in the same position as a new customer, the point Deputy Michael McGrath makes has a degree of validity to it.  If that is the decision that is taken, we would adhere to it.</p> <p>  There are differences in how different banks market and price their products.  As in any commercial system, there is a reliance on a degree of inertia between new and old.  The precise circumstance the Deputy describes, which suggests that there are customers who are in exactly the same position and are offered different things, is-----</p></speech>

Certainly, when we have looked at this previously we have not seen that circumstance.  We have seen the circumstance where there is a reliance on inertia which is a different matter and that customers have the ability to switch internally even where they do not have the ability to switch externally, for example, if they have or have had arrears.  That is a different circumstance.</p></speech>

The cash back product absolutely is a valid product in that, as the Governor has referred to, there are circumstances where borrowers, because they have just moved in and they have got to buy furniture or whatever it might be, value that cash back up-front.  There is validity in the product.  However, it is being used in circumstances to protect the back book by not having to re-price the entire book when they are looking to compete on price.</p></speech>

As we have indicated, the 2013 Act has given us a lot of powers on a forward-looking basis.  We are independent in terms of resourcing and we make our own decisions.  We are expanding and have expanded quite a bit in recent years.  That is an independent decision that we make about how many staff we want to employ.</p> <p>  If I may come back to this 26 number, this is reinforced by having additional input from various consultants, etc.  That is not the full scale of the people we are using to pursue this investigation and examination.</p></speech>

The Governor has not asked.  That is a "yes" or "no" answer.  The Governor either has asked or he has not.</p></speech>

For example, there is a new mortgage directive that came in.  There is the markets in financial instruments directive, MiFID, coming in.  There are new regulations about product oversight.

It is not a matter for us to draft them in the final analysis.  However, we certainly made significant and extensive suggestions for regulatory and supervisory powers to ensure that the regulatory framework in the future would be comprehensive with a strong set of powers, and that was done.</p> <p>  It is not for the Central Bank to opine on whether it is permissible at all, pursuant to law, for a new power with a punitive aspect to it to operate retrospectively; it is a matter for the courts.

Given the Central Bank's consumer protection role, does it have a number of people to engage with the public?  I acknowledge the witnesses have said that transparency is profoundly important to the Central Bank but people feel they are being kept in the dark on all this.  They would really appreciate some transparency in the ongoing process and clearly outlining their options.  Does the Central Bank have provision to carry out that consumer protection role in engagement with-----</p></speech>

That has to be understood.  We are very happy to take contact from people and to answer them as best we are permitted.  I fully appreciate the perception that the Central Bank is not sharing the information.  The Central Bank operates under a strict rule of confidentiality as the regulator of the regulated firms; that is a fact.  I can understand how frustrating that is.  Where we can be transparent, it is really important to be transparent.  We have been quite different in this case and these cases from every other case.  The Senator and her colleagues will normally hear responses from the Central Bank to the effect that it cannot say or that it is a live supervisory matter.  That is the norm.  To the most we are able to do so, we have made a big effort.  It may not feel like it is enough.  We have pushed ourselves to be as transparent as we can because we recognise the importance of and interest in this by publishing reports and updates.  We have done this in two ways, both through live supervisory work, which puts the legal decisions and the approaches under scrutiny, which is not always the best thing to do, together with trying to be open about the enforcement cases as well.</p></speech>

Is the Central Bank examining the quality of the communications?  I am concerned that reports are being submitted to the Central Bank with banks claiming to have had six engagements with customer A in the past 12 months.  When we examine those engagements, they say absolutely nothing.  People who telephone get robotic responses.  Is the Central Bank examining the quality of the communications from the banks or is it just taking it as read if they claim to have had six communications?</p></speech>

Part of that is in this phase.  We have received information about the communications and we have acted upon that.  After getting information previously, we issued an edict to them about their communications.  If the Senator has information for us, we would be happy to look at that.  If that points us in a particular direction or highlights a particular deficiency we can do something about, we would be very willing to do so.</p></speech>

People have been extremely patient to the detriment of their mental health and many other things that were outlined earlier.  They have run out of patience.</p> <p>  Ms Rowland mentioned "punitive".  When punitive comes to mind, I think of the punitive charges and interest rates that banks charge to consumers, particularly if they overrun and money is owed to the banks.  How long does it take to make very simple calculations without looking at the compensation and just the redress element?  If somebody is owed &euro;10,000, it cannot take much time for somebody in a bank to calculate the interest and to be able to tell the person that while the bank has not yet looked at the compensation element in terms of quantifying the impact it has had on the person's life, this is the figure for redress being offered.  Why can that not be done promptly on a large scale across all these accounts?</p></speech>

My guess is that they are holding back until they are more certain about what exactly they are offering to the individuals.  Rectification has happened in the vast majority of cases where somebody was on the wrong rate; that needed to be fixed as soon as possible.  In the case of roughly 3,000 individuals, redress and compensation has been paid and they have received that.  As more of these schemes are close to being triggered, a lot will happen in the months to come.  I agree it has been frustrating.  The bigger issue is about who is included.  In other words-----</p></speech>

If the Central Bank believes that a person is impacted but the bank will not agree, then the customer can go to the Finance Services Ombudsman, FSO.

In that circumstance, we will consider all that can be done.  That might be a matter for the FSO to look at from its own perspective.  It is something we will consider as these issues crystalise between us.  We are hopeful that this may not follow that pathway and that the banks might just do the right thing.</p></speech>

If it involves a difference of opinion on a legal contract, an on-site inspection will not add a lot of value to the formulation of one's opinion.

It is really important to know that there is nothing in the way of the redress and compensation schemes being run, which is a priority for us, while the challenge piece takes place in the background.

Redress should be standard, because redress is basically putting people in the position they had been in.  It should be cut and dried.  It should be based on the rate they should have been on versus the rate they were on.  It should be straightforward.  Compensation is more arbitrary.  Did the Central Bank not consider coming up with standard measurements or metrics on how to calculate compensation, such that we would not have this arbitrary over-and-back with the banks?</p></speech>

That idea was mooted by the industry, but that would flip responsibility onto us.  It is their responsibility.  These banks have created this situation.  It is up to the banks.  They cannot have a get-out-of-jail option by saying the Central Bank told them a given amount was all they could offer.  It is up to the banks to offer appropriate compensation.  If it is not accurate, the appeals process is available and the Financial Services Ombudsman is available.  For the most extreme cases, the courts system may have to be invoked.  It would be a digression or side-stepping of where the responsibility is to yield-----</p></speech>

It comes back to this point about perception.  If it turns out there is a general perception that the compensation is inadequate, the people who will have approved it are the boards of those banks.  They cannot then turn around and say that is is not their responsibility because the Central Bank told them to do it.  It is the responsibility of these banks.

Even post-2013 the redress is all we can manage.  This comes back to the fact that it is such a system-wide large-scale situation.  One might say the natural way to work out compensation is through the Financial Services Ombudsman and the courts.  We are trying to accelerate this by saying that we know compensation would normally only be through the ombudsman process or court process.  We are asking the banks not to require people to go through that.  We are asking them to make reasonable offers now to avoid thousands of people having to seek compensation through the normal mechanisms.  In normal times for normal disputes between banks and customers the ombudsman framework is in place.  However, in this scenario we are making a call to avoid or minimise that by the banks awarding voluntary compensation.</p></speech>

First, let us see if it becomes necessary.  It is still a live issue in respect of whether we think these groups are impacted.  Let us see whether it proves necessary to go along that line or whether the banks reconsider.</p> <p>  We are saying that we will provide an update by the end of quarter 1, 2018.  However, given that it is possible we may uncover more cases and so on, we cannot say that is the absolute deadline.  We are trying to do as much as we can as quickly as we can.  Let us suppose it arises that we find more.  We may have to say that, to meet our deadline, we will have to declare that we are no longer going to press banks on these cases.  We will continue to press.  It may well be the case that some cases go beyond that.</p></speech>

We really only have half the equation.  We have the Central Bank &ndash; the regulator.  The more I think about the banks, the angrier I get.  Most of these banks were bailed out by the taxpayer.  I suspect that if this investigation, late and all as it was to start, had never unfolded, then the banks would have pretended this was not going on.  I have had people come to me in Limerick with various cases involving these institutions.  They have sought documentation.  They were being switched from tracker to fixed and from fixed to variable.  Most of the time they cannot even find out precisely what the arrangement is.  Many people were getting so worn down that they were going away by stealth.  Manners must be put on the banks.</p> <p>  The banks cannot expect that things are back to normal.  I remember in July 2008, the banks came before this committee.  Many of them said there were no problems.  One of the institutions, Bank of Ireland, said there were problems.  A short time later they were back with the begging bowl looking for taxpayers' money with a night time raid on Government Buildings.  The problem is that they are having it both ways.  Let us consider the people on tracker mortgages.  The banks are getting their money - I was going to say that it was resting in the banks' accounts.  The banks are taking customers' money from over-charging them.  Second, they are taking the same customers' money from the hard-paid taxes they have paid for services.  That money ended up going into these banks.  It was double jeopardy for the ordinary punter or tracker-mortgage holder.</p> <p>  I expect that the Central Bank would apply the firm arm of the regulator to ensure this matter is resolved post-haste by the end of the year.</p></speech>

The number of tracker mortgages in those banks is proportionate to the scale of the mortgage market.  It is inevitable that one will see more cases because they are larger.</p></speech>

Our regulatory powers go beyond what one can legally insist on with regard to rectification and redress.  The power of being a single regulator with the full range of regulatory powers gives us much leverage on banks.  Splitting away conduct would greatly diminish that, which I think is experienced in other countries where the conduct regulator is split away and has less influence.</p></speech>

In March 2016, the phase one plans came in.  Those are the plans in which the institutions would have scoped their proposals to do the job.  This was subject to scrutiny and third-party assurance regarding the reasonableness of the proposals in the context of the scale of the job in hand.</p> <p>  Nine institutions submitted their phase two reports, not in September 2016 but by December 2016.  Two further lenders had to have a longer period in which to submit their phase two reports.  I am told that was done subject to scrutiny of the reasonableness of that request given the size and scale of their job.  They did submit their phase two reports.  One was submitted in March 2017 and the other in June.  The Central Bank will have challenged and checked, and it has completed on-site assurance work with respect to the two institutions involving the biggest zones of difference, and this work is ongoing for the balance of the nine.</p></speech>

We are saying in our report that the reports were inadequate in a number of cases and have required a to-and-fro exercise, all in the direction of making them better.  The reports were submitted and we said in our report that some banks should have done a much better job in terms of specifying more generous redress and compensation schemes, appeals mechanisms and so on.  Those phase two reports that were submitted have required a lot of push-back from us to bring the banks along with a view to making better schemes.  The delay is because we did not accept the banks' initial proposals.  The delay, as we have indicated in our report, is where we do not accept the original proposals made by the banks.</p></speech>

It set deadlines but neither September 2016 or September 2017 were actual deadlines.  When the Central Bank examines reports or engages in push-back, as it calls it, it should note that if the banks were as afraid of the Central Bank as their customers are of them, they would have given the Central Bank 100% of the information asked for.  They would have made it possible for the Central Bank to engage in less challenging and pushing back.  The reason the banks feel they can challenge the Central Bank and push it around, just as they bully and push around their customers, is because the deadlines keep slipping.  This is how the bank officials, who are hard-nosed individuals, see it.  That is the difficulty I have with the dates.  If the Central Bank lets little things like this happen, the banks will take more and more time.  That is the part that is not acceptable.   If the Central Bank used the powers it has, it would be a lot easier to bring the banks into line.</p></speech>

The point is to achieve redress and compensation for those affected.  We have been trying to be as effective as we can in the interest of the affected customers.  This means the balance between imposing short deadlines, on the one hand, and saying we do not accept what is happening and pushing back, on the other, must be struck in the interest of those harmed.  The push-back is in the interest of those harmed.  That is one dimension.</p> <p>  A second dimension, on which I agree with the Chairman, is that some banks did not take this sufficiently seriously.  This has been a big negative in the behaviour of some of the banks, but we continue----- </p></speech>

Why was some sanction not introduced to indicate that if the banks were not going to play ball with the Central Bank and meet the deadlines, which are pretty loose, they would be fined?</p></speech>

The enforcement process is a process by which the sanctions in question can be imposed but we cannot preview the outcome of those enforcement actions.  By their nature, we can report on them only at their conclusion.</p></speech>

Those banks treat the Central Bank as something that can be pushed around.  As the witness indicated, they are forcing the Central Bank to challenge them in the context of how they understand the Central Bank's intentions of ensuring the wrong is put right.  This goes back to what I said earlier.  If the banks were wrong after 2013, they were wrong before it.  Some mechanism must be found to ensure the banks are brought to heel.  That does not seem to be working.</p></speech>

We are ultimately agreeing that a wrong was done here.  The fact that a wrong has been done means we are going beyond what might be adjudicated in a court of law as being possible.  We are saying that even in scenarios where banks think they have a legal defence, they should look beyond it at consumer interest so as to put forward redress and compensation schemes in a generous and wide-scale process.  That is instead of forcing those who are damaged or affected by this to go to the ombudsman and the courts.</p></speech>

Coming back to the regulatory set-up, this is why it is more effective to recognise the redress power - it is redress and not compensation - only applies from 2013 onwards.  We share and identify the same set of concerns as the members regarding the damage done to so many individuals.  This is why we think we are right in what we are doing in pushing the banks to set up these schemes in advance of invoking the kind of legal framework of the ombudsman and the courts.  We want them to move more quickly, generously and broadly.  I will not disagree with the Chairman as the moral case for these banks comes not just from us as the regulator to push them.  The work of the committee is proving to be effective and the Government can say what it is like for these customers.  Consumer groups are also involved.  All the attention should be directed to the decision makers in these banks, as they are responsible for-----</p></speech>

The discussion would tend to focus on the prudential perspective but it would also be a leading indicator in terms of governance arrangements within a firm.  It is looked at both from a governance perspective and also from a safety and soundness perspective.  There is also consideration of the business models.  If we think about what the firms are saying about the primacy of the customer and whether that transpires in their behaviour, it is a legitimate question for a prudential supervisor to ask as to whether they are operating in a sustainable fashion.  That is where we are trying to push very hard in our interaction with the banks.</p> <p>  The groups of people with known disputes arise typically where the bank sought legal advice and indicated they are on legally solid footing in deciding there is no need to offer any redress or compensation.  We are pushing on the basis that whereas that might be legally correct, it is the wrong outcome for the customer.  It is inconsistent with the statement-----</p></speech>

The ECB is responsible overall for the supervision of the banking system within the eurozone.  It is directly responsible for the prudential supervision of what are called the "significant" banks, or the biggest banks operating in a particular country.  The heads of teams that supervise banks, again from a prudential perspective, are employed by the ECB and the teams are staffed by both ECB staff and, in the case of Ireland, Central Bank staff.</p></speech>

There is a legislative process and there are all sorts of European regulations and directives to try to improve the way financial services are provided to consumers.  That is led by the European Parliament, the Commission and national frameworks.  That is an ongoing trend to try to bring about improvement.  They are called financial services but are they providing services to consumers and small businesses?</p> <p>  Year by year and all the time there are efforts to improve the framework under which these banks operate.  The legislative process, including directives and regulations, is ongoing in trying to improve this.  In the US, under the previous administration, there was a big push to elevate consumer protection.  Within our bank we have a dedicated financial conduct pillar and we have been very active in developing our consumer protection framework.  There is much there to try to hold banks to account in terms of putting the consumer first.  This examination is a crucible, and it is critical as it goes beyond the narrow legal interpretation of various contracts and paperwork.  It goes back to what we can do and what the public spotlight can do in convincing the boards of these banks that the right action is to solve this once and for all, draw a line under it and focus on delivering a better job in future.</p></speech>

In line with the way in which this examination is being conducted, however, it does not matter who now holds the loan.  If the original lender put someone on an inappropriate rate or refused to put them back on a tracker after fixes and so on, it is that original lender who is responsible and who will have to offer redress and compensation.</p></speech>

If some of the loans sold to vulture funds are now under pressure to honour the increased payments, then the next step is eviction and some have been threatened.  Is this the kind of repossession that the Central Bank will insist the original lender, in contact with the vulture fund, act to stop?  We said earlier on that there would not be repossessions.</p></speech>

I noted earlier that the Central Bank officials look at paperwork in the banks they go into.  It has been widely reported that customers have been told that documents are missing and that conversations in particular years have not been recorded.  What would the Central Bank expect of the banks with regard to their paperwork and to these recordings in particular?</p></speech>

In the course of this examination the banks have been clearly instructed that any area of doubt, any lack of paperwork, or any ambiguity should be resolved in favour of the customer.</p></speech>

If a bank tries to claim that it does not accept a particular case because it cannot find documentation or because something is missing, then we reverse that and refuse to accept it as a barrier to a customer receiving due redress and compensation.  Our approach is, I agree, different from a court case where lack of information poses a problem.  In our examination, however, our approach is that if there is a doubt then that doubt should be resolved in the customer's favour.</p></speech>

This is why this has been, and will continue to be, a much more effective way to resolve this matter than asking individuals to go to the Financial Services Ombudsman or to the courts.  The Central Bank can, through its regulatory influence, impose many expectations on the banks.  If any individual were to run this in a bilateral dispute then there might be difficulties.  Given that this is a system-wide examination, however, we can make our expectation clear that these situations go in favour of the customer.</p></speech>

In its examination of paperwork, has the Central Bank ever come across a situation where a bank was running a second account in the name of a customer without that customer knowing about it?  I refer to a second internal account, a shadow account, as it were, which the bank might claim only exists for internal purposes.  This account would be identified in the customer's name and designated for the payment of fees, professional and otherwise, in that name.  The bank denies the customer any statements or background to the bank account.  Is that a common kind of account or is it an unusual situation?</p></speech>

I believe it is an administrative matter and purely for the posting of transactions.</p></speech>

The Deputy's contact should therefore be reassured that this examination is providing a mechanism by which the banks will make these offers to those affected while they still have the option - again, thanks to the legislation that Members passed - to seek compensation and redress through the ombudsman over the lifetime of the contracts if the offer from the bank and the appeals process is not to the satisfaction of those affected.  This goes back to the fact that what we are doing is quite unusual.  We will not just do the legal minimum; we are pushing the banks to do the right thing and telling them to introduce these schemes even if we can agree that the issue does not involve legal compulsion.</p></speech>

Ulster Bank, for example, gave us its figures: it has identified 3,500 impacted customers, 2,500 of whom have been restored onto the correct rate, while 1,000 have redeemed or switched lenders.  That is quite a high proportion.  Close to a third of its impacted customers are no longer mortgage customers of the bank.  Furthermore, many of the 15 lenders in scope sold on their entire book, which may have been sold on again.  What confidence does the Central Bank have that contact will be made with the end customers who were affected?  Is there not a risk that many of these people will fall through the cracks and never be contacted?</p></speech>

As one moves through this process and procedure, any other breach in the storyline, as I call it, is always taken into account.</p></speech>

Regarding decisions taken in the courts, I refer to an example in which an individual decides to take a bank to court.  The judge rules that the bank was negligent and took the individual's money - or perhaps a company's money - unlawfully and issues an order that it must restore those funds to the individual.  In some cases this may amount to tens of thousands, in other cases it could be in excess of &euro;1 million or so.

We would be aware of those.  I think the Deputy asked if there was an automatic trigger and if the court finds that the bank was at fault, should that not automatically trigger a regulatory action.  I do not think there is an automatic connection.  I would say that how enforcement cases are initiated would be based on any information that comes to the bank, whether it is supervisory information or public information such as a court decision.  That information would be relevant to how we think about enforcement actions.  There is not a mechanical link but I think it is a reasonable-----</p></speech>

The Central Bank has a lot of documentation, including the stage two reports, etc.  Given that the Central Bank expects there will be more enforcement actions, why has it taken so long to make a decision on whether the other seven banks are subject to enforcement action?</p></speech>

I tried to make it clear that the supervisor's focus is on getting the reports in, looking at the numbers of groups that are identified in those reports, looking at the schemes and their quality, and challenging and externally  checking those details.  All of that yields quite a lot of information but it does not yield the full picture.  All of that feeds into the enforcement case as the starting point for what regulatory breaches one thinks may or may not have occurred.  One platforms from that because then one has to go deeper in a different direction.  It would slow the supervisor down if he or she had do that level of a forensic acquisition of information because he or she would not get to looking after getting the redress for people.  The supervisor would have to stay in the data, the data analytics and that information trawl for longer so it is best to have two teams.  All of the information that is yielded by the examination is very fruitful for the basis of the enforcement case.</p></speech>

They move forward then into looking at this issue and what caused it in the context of the enforcement case.

Instead, one has to use the fining powers that were in place at the time the breach occurred.  The fining powers from 1 August 2004 to 1 August 2013 had a cap of &euro;5 million and involved several different fines.  Under the new fining regime there is a ceiling of whichever of 10% of turnover or &euro;10 million is the higher and that is the high-level consideration when one considers apportionment.  On our website, we have published at a high level and in detail the factors taken into consideration in deciding the components of a fine.  Those factors are the nature, scale and gravity of the breach, the demeanour, any rectification of the issue, whether the breach was systemic or on a large scale, criminality, how the breach was fixed and how the bank behaved in that rectification, along with any other relevant consideration.  There are other factors.  One considers in a legal sense the nature of the breach, the gravity of the matter, the impact on the public, the reputation of banks and the system, the bank's conduct in terms of whether it self-reported or was brought to heel over the matter and whether it did the right thing on a voluntary basis or by anybody it may have hurt.

Bank of Ireland is by far the biggest bank operating in the UK.  AIB has a much smaller operation.  It is similar in size in Northern Ireland but in terms of Great Britain, Bank of Ireland is easily the biggest.  I cannot really talk about specific outcomes of stress testing on a UK mortgage book without really referring to one institution, which I am limited in doing.</p> <p>  We are broadly comfortable with the approach that the Irish banks are taking now in respect of Brexit in terms of making sure that they have considered it from a stress case perspective, to make sure they are sufficiently capitalised to address a severe stress associated with Brexit.  Where I have more concern is in other sectors such as insurance, where the level of preparation is not as high and the organisational arrangements are different.  For example, there are not always separate subsidiaries in terms of the UK operation.  Both AIB and Bank of Ireland operate a separate subsidiary in the UK.  They are both well capitalised and have high capital requirements set by the UK Prudential Regulation Authority, with which we interact along with our ECB colleagues.  From a capital adequacy perspective, we are satisfied they have sufficient capital at this stage.</p></speech>

I would expect that Mr. Sibley would be able to provide us with some picture of high-level exposure in respect of Irish banks.  Without going into the individual institutions, which would be counterproductive in terms of market sensitivities and so on, under the three scenarios of the Central Bank's assessment, can he give us a sense of just how exposed the financial sector is to UK mortgages?  Is this something not to worry about at all?  Is that what the report concludes?  Is there anything to worry about here?</p></speech>

Bank of Ireland UK has a balance sheet in excess of &pound;20 billion.  Its main lending activity is mortgage lending in the UK.  There is some level of unsecured lending also.  From memory, AIB is in the region of about &pound;6 billion.  It has a different mix within that, different proportions, with some mortgage lending in Northern Ireland as well as some SME and other lending.  In the North of Ireland, Bank of Ireland has a similar model but in terms of Great Britain, it is primarily in mortgages.  That is the exposure.  We have done stress testing and the previous stress tests from a European Banking Authority perspective were published in 2016.  They showed significant losses associated with the Irish banks but that was mainly to do with the Republic of Ireland book.</p></speech>

I am looking for the conclusions.  The Central Bank has assessed, under the different scenarios, what the likely loan default rate would be in respect of UK mortgages for Irish financial institutions.  What type of rate are we looking at?  Potentially, how many accounts could go into default under the three different scenarios?</p></speech>

However, stress testing is in no way a forecast.  The way I would look at stress testing is that it gives a degree of sensitivity analysis.  It shows how sensitive a bank is to different scenarios or issues emerging, rather than giving one, two or three definitive answers.</p></speech>

The basic message and the overall judgment here is that these banks have enough capital to withstand the kind of stresses we see in these scenarios.  If we give out the individual numbers, it could be easily inferred that they were bank-specific and we cannot do that given the small population of banks involved in the UK.</p></speech>

However, the Central Bank has the data based on the models it has used under the three different scenarios of WTO, Norway, Sweden and so on.  Are the witnesses telling the finance committee that there is nothing to worry about in respect of the most adverse scenario in Britain in terms of the exposure of Irish banks, that they can comfortably withstand the most adverse scenario that is painted out in the Central Bank's assessment?</p></speech>

When we say a bank is well capitalised, the bank may make losses which will reduce its equity value and in turn that may also raise funding challenges for the bank.  It is not to the degree where we think they would violate the minimum levels of capital that we would require.  In other words, it is not something that I think would cause an existential crisis but of course it would be damaging to these banks if they made significant losses on UK lending.  It is a concern.  We are concerned and that is why we make sure ourselves in respect of the subsidiary in the UK that there is enough capital to be able to absorb losses, even though the investors would lose out on them, without threatening the underlying existence of the institution.</p></speech>

Let us assume - I hope it does not materialise - that the most adverse scenario from the Central Bank's assessment comes to pass and that we will see capital being used up in respect of those loan defaults.  Is it Professor Lane's view that the capital remaining within the institutions would be sufficient, or would there be a requirement for the bank to raise additional capital?  On foot of this assessment carried out by the Central Bank, will it require or encourage financial institutions with exposure to the UK mortgage market to increase their capital levels?</p></speech>

In the event of the most adverse scenario materialising, does Professor Lane believe that Irish banks would need to raise additional capital?

This is consistent with the EBA approach.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.2378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101900002#BBB00400"><p>I will come to the specific question but, as I did earlier, I will provide some background.  We operate as part of a European system of banking supervision.  Setting capital levels for banks, which are what are called significant institutions and include the main Irish retail banks, takes place within the Single Supervisory Mechanism.  We, as part of that mechanism, with the ECB and the other competent authorities across the eurozone, make the determination as to the appropriate level of capital to be held within any bank that is deemed significant.  We have an important and active role to play in terms of the execution of the work, the methodologies that are used and the final decision making process.  Every year we complete our risk assessment taking into account the issues the banks face today as well as on a forward-looking basis.  We consider what are reasonably plausible stress scenarios.  We would expect the banks to be undertaking their own capital planning, including stress testing, as well.  We use that to set up minimum capital requirements for banks to hold.</p> <p>  We also issue capital guidance which we expect them to hold over and above the hard requirement.  In theory, the banks have some degree of choice as to whether they hold it but in practice they are all above it.  Typically, capital requirements are set towards the end of the year.  We are coming to the very end of that process now and are setting capital requirements for all of the Irish retail banks.  These will take in all our considerations as to the risks they face on a forward-looking basis, whether it is Brexit-related, the conduct risk that we have thought about or other factors.  That sets a minimum capital requirement.  We have a small buffer on top as guidance.  In reality, we expect the banks to hold a bit more above that.  We do not like to see banks that are just on the surface or with very little margin between the regulator requirements and the requirements they hold.  That will capture the Brexit risk.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.2380" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ed Sibley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017101900002#BBB00600"><p>How I can answer that is somewhat limited.  If we look across the European system, historically - and this is partly driven by our experience in the crisis - the level of capital that we require banks in Ireland to hold would probably be slightly higher than is the case in other jurisdictions.  There has been a degree of normalisation of that through the consistency and level playing field that is trying to be driven through banking union.  In-built in the capital requirements, as of last year and into this year, was the outcome of the 2016 European banking authority stress test.  As referred to by the Governor, that was a severe stress test, particularly for the Irish banks, because it brought in comparisons with historical loss levels that had been incurred by banks in the recent past.  Where banks were operating in systems whereby they had high loss levels, which was evidently the case in Ireland, the stress test outcome was more negative than that in those jurisdictions which did not have a history of credit losses.  That would also have influenced the capital levels which would have been set coming out of the EBA stress test in 2016 and, broadly speaking, what we expect to see in terms of capital levels and capital requirements this year is for them to be consistent with those that were set in 2016.  There are perhaps different drivers underneath that, but overall we expect capital levels to be broadly the same.</p></speech>

Brexit is one factor but there are many others.  Some of them drive down capital levels and some of them drive those levels up.  The overall net outcome is relative stability.</p></speech>

As the report indicates, insurance in this country has been a major headache.  There was volatility due to underpricing, lack of proper assessment of risk and so on, which, in turn, led to the surge in premia in recent years.  I totally agree with the general story that the insurance market has been dysfunctional.  I will ask Mr. Sibley to deal with the behaviour in individual firms.</p></speech>

I have discussed a number of letters at this committee about the dysfunctionality of the insurance industry.

It goes on to state that the Central Bank was powerless to act in this regard.  There is a lacuna in the law as a result.</p></speech>

As the system of insurance regulation is fundamentally shifting with Solvency II, the requirements in terms of the data we receive are far more general than previously.

It seems that, if an individual supplied false and misleading information to the Central Bank on insurance reporting matters, the Central Bank would have no powers to act because it would have to establish that the company itself was deliberately providing false information and this provides a veil of protection for the individual who provided the false information.</p></speech>

This is undertaken on a regulatory footing so if there is a failure to report or inaccurate reporting, it would be a matter for enforcement.

Under Solvency II, insurance firms have to undertake regulatory reporting and if they fail to do so, or report inaccurately, we can and would take enforcement action.  The insurance firms themselves would say the requirements are onerous and they certainly are a significant uplift in terms of the data and the quality thereof they must submit.</p></speech>

Solvency II came into force after that letter was written.  The Central Bank has a significant selection of powers but the Deputy is correct that unless they are used in the first instance, in the case of information provided to the Central Bank not on foot of a statutory request, the bank cannot then action its powers on false or misleading information.  Those powers have to be invoked in the first instance.  Notwithstanding that, strong information powers have been put into Solvency II.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right about the construction of the administrative sanctions procedure.  Unless the individual is proved to be participating in a breach committed by the regulated entity, it would fall away.  That is a matter of legal construction.  There might also be fitness and probity considerations but that would be rare.</p></speech>

We are expanding.  Insurance is one area in which we have expanded.  There is a commitment to increase staffing levels.  It is not the case that the supervisory system is somehow compromised or at risk as a result of a lack of staff.  We want more staff, especially in insurance for Solvency II and so on.  We have a big insurance sector here.  There is not a mission critical lack of staff.  We are growing and we want to grow more.  It would be wrong to say there is a severe gap between what we need and what we have.  We are fulfilling our responsibilities as the insurance regulator and as the regulator for other sectors.  With more staff and also with the accumulation of experience by existing staff more can be done over time.

It will have a cross-sector impact.  There is a gap between where we are today in terms of our current headcount versus the approved headcount.

At the end of August, the number was 1,682.  September is a natural time to expand staffing.  The approved total is 1,857 so there is roughly a 10% gap.  That total is, in part, forward looking.  We are saying we know from what we see in some areas that requirements that are not there now will be there in future.  We know we will be rolling out new requirements over the next year or two so we are staffing now in anticipation of that.  With regard to Brexit, we know as firms come in we will need more staff.  The fact is we are continuing to expand.  If one goes back in time to 2014 or so, there was probably more of a severe gap but we have grown by 5.5% between 2015 and 2016 and by 5% already this year since 2016.  We think there is more to come this year.  A lot of time and resources are involved in those net increases.  We also recognise that we lose people all the time because lots of other people want to hire our staff.  If one looks at our website and human resources, one will see the effort we make and the videos we put out.  We are doing a good job of recruiting within the framework of being a public service organisation.</p></speech>

We will increase our staff to the extent needed to fulfil our mandate.  In various parts of the public sector, there is a moratorium or restriction on hiring but we do not have that.  We make our decision about how many staff we need.  We have that independence.  It is our responsibility to staff in proportion to what is needed.

At one level we are neutral.  If they meet the conditions coming forward, we will authorise them.  We recognise that for public banking to be introduced, such as the Sparkassen or Kiwibank model in New Zealand, which is quite interesting to study, it requires some public entity to capitalise those banks.  Ultimately, it will be a policy decision somewhere in the State system that it wants to capitalise a bank.  The Sparkassen provides one example; Kiwibank provides another.  Around the world there are various State-owned banks.  In one scenario, such as that of Kiwibank, in case the commercial banking system goes into crisis, it is important there remains a bank which is available.</p></speech>

Ultimately what the banking system should look like is not a question for the regulator.</p><p>The Central Bank is the regulator; we do not set the rules.  It is in part a commercial decision, with the firm deciding if it wants to enter commercially.  On top of that, it is a public policy decision where public policymakers make decisions on the types of entity they want to have.  Essentially, we are neutral in the sense that if an entity meets the authorisation conditions laid out, it will be authorised.  I ask Mr. Sibley to add to what I have said.</p></speech>

I will not disagree.  As we move forward one way to have more competition is through the record of profitability in this country which may trigger commercial entry.  Another way is if there is a starter bank with other objectives beyond just commercial values.  That is where public policy comes in.  It would be possible for an entity to decide its goal was not to satisfy some private shareholders but to have wider community objectives.</p></speech>

There is a degree of recovery in the retail banks.  We are seeing expansion again in what I would describe as the internationally focused banks.  They do not spend a lot of time serving the Irish economy and Irish customers, rather they enter Europe.  Credit unions obviously have an important role to play across the country, particularly from a financial inclusion perspective.  The sector faces some challenges, but we are supportive of credit unions in trying to deal with the viability challenges they face.</p> <p>  Something at which we look very closely is the uncertainty surrounding financial innovation and potentially a degree of fragmentation in banking-like services being provided.  Specific niche entities are coming in.  We see it particularly with the providers of payments services.  What we have not seen to date - this is the ultimate aim of banking union - is more cross-border activity across the eurozone.  What has happened post-crisis is there has been a continued degree of retrenchment from international to national-focused banks.  The aim of banking union is to expand this out.  There is also capital markets union which aims to better serve SMEs.</p></speech>

The evidence from the United States is that once cross-state banking was permitted there, banks became much more efficient and could be a cheaper provider of credit because of the diversification.  A community bank which raises funding and lends locally has positives but also has the negative of exposure only to that region.  If a region in Ireland is reliant on an industry that gets into trouble, the local bank will get into trouble because it is so concentrated in a locality.  There are pros and cons in having these locally focused banks.</p> <p>  In the end I ultimately agree with my predecessor.  We need a variety of banks.  With consolidation in Europe, there will be some large banks which will be hyper-efficient because they will have the scale and technology to run the underlying systems cheaply and at the same perhaps supplement them - this is a public policy decision - with some more locally focused banks.</p></speech>

It is absolutely true - this is a pan-European issue - that we are putting renewed pressure on the banks to deal with their non-performing loans, but that does not mean that we are saying the way to do it is through selling these assets.  Part of the solution could be restructuring these loans.  The solution to non-performing loans is not necessarily just to sell them off, even though that may be part of it.  I will ask Mr. Sibley to outline our strategy for dealing with non-performing exposures.</p></speech>

Non-performing loans need to be reduced in a sustainable fashion for the banks operating in Ireland, while at the same time those customers in distress need to be protected to ensure the solutions put in place for them are sustainable.</p></speech>

First of all, I think the Senator is referring to the fact that the ombudsman made decisions prior to all of this, which fell either side of the pro and the con for consumers.  They won some and they lost some.  When we started the examination, we were aware of that.  We have a very good line of information between the consumer protection area in the Central Bank and the ombudsman.  Since we were aware of it and thought it should be looked at again in a wider way, we put it in as one of the requirements of the framework.  We have tried to be really clear about it and started at zero again.  Every tracker-related issue was put inside this examination.  That is why it is so huge.  We did not want to come back and have to gather up parts of this again and say it was problematic.  It started at the widest possible parameter and moved in to any kind of tracker-related issue or mortgage where a change had happened - we set out quite a degree of detail about that.  Inside of those criteria also would be the cases from the ombudsman, notwithstanding that the ombudsman may have found against those people.  The lenders were told to look at the cases again within this wider lens.  That is what is happening.  I hope that answers the Senator's question.</p> <p>  The issue of the limitation period is actually something different.  What we had in mind was time delay for long-tailed cases.  It is important that if they are very serious cases, they could be permitted to be brought before the court without difficulty and in addition to the ombudsman's office.  The matter has been subsequently amended to the benefit of people and therefore seems to have dealt with itself.</p></speech>

He might be conflating two slightly different issues.</p> <p>  On his question on whether credit unions can invest in different entities, the answer, subject to the final policy decision we are making, is that there is a degree of opening up somewhat different options for credit union investments.  With the consultation paper, we consulted on allowing them to invest in approved housing bodies, for instance, which they would not have been allowed to do previously.  We are considering the feedback we got on that consultation paper.  That will then become a policy statement, which will then issue.  At that point, the policy and requirements change.</p> <p>  There is also a question around authorising or allowing a different type of firm to come into the State.  In that circumstance, it would have to go through an authorisation process, presuming it would undertake regulatory activity.  We have a clear, robust, transparent and well-tested authorisation process to deal with all manner of firms.  If, in this particular circumstance, it had a well-thought through proposal, we would be happy to engage with the entity.</p></speech>

The letter from the Commissioner's office stated that liquidity ratios are set by the Central Bank in its role of economic governance.  It continued that in 2012 and 2013, the Central Bank notified An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, in accordance with its statutory function, that it intended to deal with these breaches of liquidity ratios with the bank in question, Unicredit Bank Ireland plc, through administrative sanction procedures.

He specifically said at this committee that he had reported the matter to garda&iacute; at Rathmines.  They, in turn, had noted it in the station book.  Afterwards, the detective unit informed him a banking specialist would be in touch but that did not happen.  When the committee asked the Garda Commissioner's office to comment on this and explain at what stage the inquiry was, we were told the Central Bank had suggested it was dealing with it and that it would be dealt with through administrative sanction procedures.</p> <p>  I presume from that letter that the bank was in some way sanctioned by financial penalty or whatever for this breach, which apparently was 20 times more than what was allowed.  In response to the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's letter, what was the sanction?</p></speech>

In August 2007, the original notification came in.  There was an inspection by the Central Bank in early October 2007 and the investigation concluded that the reported breach did not suggest a wider and more systematic erosion of overall liquidity and that the bank was back in compliance within the limits within 24 hours.</p> <p>  Additional claims were made in 2010, both in the media and the Seanad, that there had been numerous breaches of liquidity by the firm in question.  A further investigation was undertaken at the instruction of the Central Bank.  An independent third-party firm was engaged to check compliance with the liquidity requirements.  This investigation did not highlight any further breaches.</p> <p>  There was significant investigation of the issues raised and the matter is closed.  More generally, the overall message reflected in the letter cited by the Chairman is that if there are liquidity breaches, the correct way to deal with them is through investigation.  If an investigation establishes a systematic regulatory violation, the administrative sanctions procedure would be invoked.  The general answer is correct.  If we see systematic breaches, that is how it would be handled.</p> <p>  In this case, the initial breach was closed quickly and did not suggest a wider or more systematic erosion of overall liquidity.  That was double-checked because not only did the original investigation take place, a further investigation took place, including a cross-check from an independent firm.  There was no indication that any further breaches had taken place.</p></speech>

I cannot accept, however, what the Governor just said.  The legislation at the time referred to a breach.  A breach is a breach.  Every single breach on each day was a breach.  Accordingly, it was a breaking of the law in the context of the legislation at the time.  I have the analysis here in front of me.</p> <p>  The breach in question was 20 times the limit and, as I recall, involved a substantial amount of money.</p><p>The letter from the commissioner's office is specifically about the Jonathan Sugarman case and how he had reported the breach.  From the letter, it is clear to me that this liquidity breach was to be dealt with through administrative sanctions, according to the Central Bank at the time.  I find it unacceptable that a bank of that size breached the legislation and broke the law such that the individual concerned took it upon himself to report it to the Central Bank.  Despite that breach and breaking of the law, no action was taken.  The commissioner, however, has said someone within the bank had to have communicated some form of message to the bank, on the Jonathan Sugarman issue, to say it would be dealt with through administrative sanction procedures.</p></speech>

If we receive information through a whistleblower, we take it very seriously in trying to ensure the protection of the whistleblower.  This instance is in the public domain and was thoroughly investigated twice.  We formed a view on the seriousness of the issue associated with the allegations raised by the whistleblower.  We follow up in a proportionate manner.  There are a number of tools we can use in dealing with breaches.  They relate to the proportionate approach, the seriousness of the breach, its persistence and so on.  Some of these actions may be private in nature such as the giving of a supervisory warning, while some may be more public in nature.  This applies in areas such as those when we talked about transparency.</p></speech>

Not all breaches across the regulatory spectrum will end up as an enforcement case.  One would not be able to bring that volume of cases.  We have a strategy of targeted and reactive enforcement.  Reactive enforcement occurs in the most serious cases and we make the space to give resources to bring them forward.  The tracker loan issue is a very good example of that approach.  We also have targeted enforcement where we predefine areas where we see that compliance levels are low and it is very important to bring them up.  We take a targeted set of enforcement measures to improve them.  Transaction reporting in the markets area was another example.  During the years we have taken quite a number of prudential focused cases in different areas that were very important.  To be clear, from the very beginning of the enforcement strategy, as stated in 2010 until now, there has not been a total zero tolerance threshold for every single breach across the spectrum of regulated areas.  We may take one or two of a particular type where we see non-compliance in an area and may take more.  There are other regulatory tools in the escalation pyramid that are also used as enforcement measures to complement it.  That is the general approach.  We also have supervisory warnings as an enforcement tool which are private between the entity and the regulator.  As the breaches move up the threshold, the procedures become full enforcement.</p></speech>

If I give information to him that I have received as Chairman rather than go through it now, will he give me a written response to the queries raised in the letter?  A liquidity breach nearly 20 times over the limit is significant.  There were a number of other breaches and nothing seems to have been done about them.  This goes back to the earlier point that it sends all the wrong signals.  A risk manager - in this case Mr. Sugarman - went to the bother of doing what he did and the answer from the Central Bank was that there was "nothing to see here, move on".  There was proof - it is here - that the liquidity requirement had been breached and there were serious questions to answer.  I want to know, rather than delay the delegates, if I give Professor Lane all of this information which is in the public domain, will he respond comprehensively to the committee on this matter?</p></speech>

In early October there was an inspection by the Central Bank and the conclusion was that the breach did not suggest wider or more systematic erosion of overall liquidity regulations.  I accept that there might be a difference of views on this investigation and the beliefs of Mr. Sugarman.  There was a second wave that involved not just our own understanding of the issue when, as a cross-check, an independent third party firm was engaged to go over it again.  There have been two waves of investigation, but the conclusion was that there was not a systematic breach of liquidity regulations.  To underline this, we considered the particular case to be closed at the time.  We will undertake to respond.  If the committee writes to us, we will, of course, always write back.</p></speech>

We take a proportionate approach to the breaches which are most serious and warrant public sanction and our whole supervisory framework is underpinned by that.  We have teeth and we use them.

The liquidity of one subsidiary within an international banking group is different from the liquidity of a retail bank operating here.  If one likes, it is not as simple as the speed limit in traffic law.  There is a wide range of factors here that are taken seriously.  Two investigations are taking place.  Going back to the issue, the administrative sanctions procedures is not the only type of sanction.  There could be supervisory, supervisory warnings, remediation programmes and so on.  Many things can happen when there is a breach but the conclusion in this case was that the breach was temporary, not systemic and not persistent, and the bank stands over that assessment.</p></speech>

The risk manager reads the legislation and the law and understands fully his obligation.  He is so frightened by what is happening in the bank about not just one case one day, but a number of them, that he decides to risk his job and tell the Central Bank that there is something wrong.  He went to the Garda and said that he had broken the law and told them to arrest him.  He could be imprisoned for up to five years.  However, nothing happened to satisfy the fact that he had reported this wrongdoing.  He lost his health and he lost his job.  He did it pursuant to the obligation on him under legislation to report to the Central Bank.  If the Central Bank does not want these international banks that are here to bother looking at the law, why would we have the law?</p></speech>

When one breaks the law, in accordance with the banking rules, regulations and legislation, there are sanctions and penalties.  This is why questions are always asked about the Central Bank and how it behaves towards bigger banks and what it expects of individuals in the bank.  That individual and individuals like him also deserve the protection of the Central Bank because they are an arm of the Central Bank.  They are reporting to it where necessary.</p></speech>

Taking the point that a meeting has been agreed with Mr. Sugarman and the Chairman, which is very good, we are now in 2017.  These events date back to, I believe, 2007 and that time.  Since then, in this jurisdiction, significant whistleblowing legislation has been passed and brought into force.  There has been more than one type.  It is a really important signal of confidence in the Central Bank and its current whistleblowing and listening obligations.  As Mr. Sibley has already stated, we take those obligations extremely seriously.  We have a whistleblowing desk.  We take the information in.  Employment law protections are now built into the system in this jurisdiction which I do not believe were there before, so the legislative framework is different.  We have a dedicated whistleblowing function so that when information comes into the Central Bank it is sent immediately to the line supervisors, as they are the experts with regard to the institutions that they supervise, so that they can assess that information and action is taken.  That is an important point to make in terms of the structure of the system now and the formulation of whistleblowing legislation and how it has been brought in as an important part of the infrastructure in this jurisdiction.  It is not, I believe, just in financial services, but right across the board, and it is right that it is.  It is right that I am clear about our support for that and the importance we place on it.</p></speech>

Therefore, in the spirit of that legislation and in arranging this meeting with Mr. Sugarman, we need to explore all of that.</p><p>I am prepared to park this part of the questioning until we meet, but I will come back to it.</p><p> I also want to send the Central Bank some information on the Consumer Credit Act 1995 and some questions arising from that Act relative to the banks and the information that they collect to get a general view on the questions.  I will not go into them now.  It would take too long.</p><p> The final matter I will ask Mr. Sibley about which was raised here is GRG.  Is that ongoing?  On the last occasion, we questioned the bank concerned.  Has the Central Bank an investigation ongoing in relation to GRG?</p></speech>

Maybe there is a better arrangement that we the committee and the Central Bank can come to on hearings such as this because we are trying to get to the details of parts of the Central Bank's wide remit.  For example, insurance was not even discussed here and it is an issue on which all members want to have an engagement with the Central Bank.  Maybe there is a more regular way of dealing with this in shorter meetings where we can set out the issues and the Governor can give his view on how we might deal with this range of issues.</p></speech>

It is something on which maybe we can engage with the Governor at a different time.  Lastly, in terms of vulture funds and how they manage accounts, I asked the Governor about the general communication from banks.  I have to tell him that in dealing with some of the vulture funds, such as Capita, and their managers, it is unacceptable the rounds that one has to go to to get the information relevant to one's case.  For instance, they do not return calls as efficiently or quickly as they should because they are dealing with a party on the other end who is stressed in more ways than one.  In attending the meetings I was taken aback by the attitude, as I stated today in the D&aacute;il, to sit opposite one of these, Capita, and to hear staff tell the borrower that he or she should get the money from parents, brothers, sisters, neighbours or the local credit union, but that it wants the money.  I am taken back by the general attitude within Capita to the management of its different property loans, etc.  It does not give the individual a chance.  It is only by intervention of outside help that individuals get the basic information that they are entitled to.  It is not acceptable for that message to be sent out through them.  The Central Bank should take note of the type of attitude that individuals are experiencing when they come up against the big monied well-armed legal people, such as the one I have dealt with so far, Capita.  It is shocking.</p></speech>

I hope members understood that greeting.  I thank the Chairman and the joint committee for giving me the opportunity to be here as part of my first official visit to Ireland.  I come with a very open mind and ready to listen in the spirit of all the dynamics and changes that are taking place in the European Union.  I will begin with an overview of what is ongoing in terms of EU transport policy, including the various challenges facing the transport sector.</p><p> Before I jump into policy, I will say a few words about something that is close to my heart.  I very much regret the losses Ireland experienced in recent days as a result of Hurricane Ophelia.  I pay tribute to all those who have been working hard to get transport, power and water services back to normal.  Unfortunately, these events will become the new normal.  As the effects of climate change are felt everywhere in the world, we will have to get used to these events and prepare plans to respond actively when they occur.</p><p> Last month the President of the European Commission, Mr. Jean-Claude Juncker, gave his annual state of the union address.  He spoke of a Europe that had been through a great deal in recent years, as all of us can confirm.  It included terrorism, managing the flow of migrants and refugees, the economic crisis, especially its consequences for the social welfare of citizens, and the British decision to exit the European Union, an issue I will address.  If that were not enough, the new political stance of President Trump has created many new opportunities and challenges on a global scale.  These challenges which would usually occur over a period of ten years are all part of the reality we have had to deal with in the past two and a half years.  They have been a serious test for the European Union and its member states.  I hope members share my view that the Union reacted in a mature way and developed the tools we needed to respond to these developments.  I am confident that we will be able to deal with anything that arises in the future because we gained each other's trust that we can agree on the most essential elements needed for governance and further sustainable development.  We have not solved all of these issues, but we are making progress. </p><p> I will address transport priorities which have very much been empowered by the positive mood reflected in the speech of the Commission President.  Data collected throughout Europe show that people are much more aware of the benefits of the European Union and much more prepared to re-engage with the spirit of union.  Since I took office almost three years ago, I have set out clear priorities for transport which I propose to share with the committee.  They are very simple and this is a simple story.  European transport is focusing on two core objectives, namely, efficiency and connectivity within the European Union, with neighbouring countries and globally.  This is empowered by people-focused legislative standards and all other activities related to transport.  We put people's needs in the centre, while at the same time doing whatever is possible to encourage all stakeholders to have a global perspective and be able to use scaleability and create value globally.  At the same time, we are focusing on two driving forces, namely, decarbonisation and digitalisation.  Decarbonisation is required because transport contributes more than 24% of fossil fuel emissions in the European Union and is the second largest emitter behind energy.  If transport grows at its current pace without action being taken, it will become the largest polluter.  We are strongly engaged for this reason.  I will speak also about what we are doing on the issue of decarbonisation.</p><p> The second driving force, digitalisation, is completely reshaping the way in which transport is managed and used.  I am certain that we will see dramatic changes in this area in the next ten or 15 years.  Mobility will be much different in 2030 or 2040 than it is today.  I dare to speculate that there will be many interoperability and multi-modality solutions which will be strongly service oriented and based on the needs of customers in contrast with the current highly static transport sector.  None of this will be possible if we do not strongly push for innovation and investment, the two areas where one sees many changes at European Union level.  The European Union is engaged in a market oriented approach to innovation in which research and development and research and innovation are becoming two different areas.  We are trying to address in a very systemic way all phases of innovation processes and cycles and prove that the European Union is not only a good inventor but also a good innovator in that we know how to market our products and scale them globally.</p><p> I am highlighting the issues of decarbonisation, digitalisation and investment, but that does not mean other areas are not important.  If members have questions on other key priorities, I will be more than happy to highlight them.  As I indicated, decarbonisation is one of our focuses.  We paved the way for our plan to address decarbonisation with our decarbonisation strategy which we passed last year.  The strategy has thee distinctive pillars, namely, clean vehicles, infrastructure for alternative energies and better organisation of transport.  Nine new initiatives will be launched in the area of transport in November.  I have joined forces with the Commissioner with responsibility for the Internal Market, Ms Elzbieta Bie&ntilde;kowska, and the Commissioner for Climate Action and Energy, Mr. Miguel Arias Ca&ntilde;ete, to develop a full package for the decarbonisation of road transport that contributes more than 60% of all CO2 emissions in transport and is 92% oil-based.  This area, therefore, presents the greatest opportunity to make a difference and we will focus strongly on this particular mode of transport.  Members will probably have noted that we are supporting this with new, innovative financial mechanisms and tools to boost the deployment of these initiatives at member state level.  Moves are also being made towards greater electrification of the road sector on two levels, namely, boosting the deployment and use of electric vehicles and building the infrastructure required to make the energy available to users of electric cars.  Ireland is a good example of a country which is learning lessons in this area.  Incredible investments have been made in infrastructure but somehow users did not avail of electric cars.  The country is now taking further steps which I hope will work and we are using the case of Ireland to further encourage other member states to take bold steps.</p><p> The primary driver of digitalisation is to boost efficiency which contributes directly to decarbonisation.  We must create new opportunities, including for employment, seize the moment, create blue oceans and lead globally in this sector.</p><p>That also contributes directly to decarbonisation.  If we lead globally in the digitalisation segment, we will be able to seize the moment by creating "blue oceans", or new opportunities for new jobs.  As I have said, everything started on a new level with the strategy in this sector.  We focused mostly on roads in our strategy on co-operative intelligent transport systems, which we put forward last year.  We are taking further steps towards autonomous transport mobility solutions that involve connected and autonomous vehicles.  Road transport is not the only area in which this is happening.  Autonomous ships are emerging.  Drones and autonomous airplanes have moved from the conception phase to the testing phase.  Autonomous trains are being deployed more and more often.  This automation is driving a change and a shift in the mobility sector.</p><p> Our real motivation, which goes beyond the infrastructure and the vehicles, is safe, integrated, efficient and clean transport.  This is probably something the members of the committee want to hear because I am sure it is close to their hearts.  I am concerned about the negative effects of transport, including the socioeconomic costs related to it.  Development and prosperity always have other sides which are not so prosperous.  We need to address such issues.  I will explain what I mean by that.  Every year, Europe loses over 25,000 people in road accidents.  In addition to those 25,000 fatalities, over 135,000 people are seriously injured.  It is estimated that the socioeconomic costs associated with that are over &euro;100 billion per annum.  I ask members to imagine what could be done if this money could be used for a positive agenda in areas of the social agenda like schooling.  Such investment could boost entrepreneurship and create new opportunities.  I invite the committee to pay attention to this aspect of the matter.  It is estimated that expenses of &euro;120 billion per annum arise from the health issues caused by noise or air pollution, so we are already on &euro;220 billion per annum from these negative effects.  In addition, based on our estimates, congestion costs approximately &euro;1 billion per working day.  This brings the negative costs to over &euro;500 billion per annum.  That should motivate us.</p><p> This is about our citizens, the way we live and our future.  I invite the committee to join forces with me very strongly so we can address these kinds of issues.  Digitalisation can play a really important role in this regard.  Approximately 90% of accidents are caused by human factors.  That is why we are pushing for automation.  We are moving towards more automated mobility solutions so that the human factor can be excluded from transport, or can at least be limited.  I would like to draw attention to some of the exciting things that digitalisation can bring.  I have already alluded to seamless ships and seamless traffic.  We are now creating the new concept of the so-called urban aviation space.  By 2019, we will test for the first time flying cars and drones that can be fully integrated as mobility solutions, especially in urban contexts.  This will position the EU in a leading role globally in this segment.  I hope that will mean business, jobs and growth for the EU economy.</p><p> The last part of the strategy I would like to discuss is investment.  We have four different ways of funding transport.  First, we continue to support grants to address projects that cannot attract private investors but are of strategic importance to bridge development gaps or boost areas which are recognised as having future opportunities but do not yet have market value.  Second, all projects that have a high market value can be financed by loans or by private investors.  Third, a guarantee scheme has been provided for at EU level for the first time as part of the Juncker plan, which also provides for the readjustment of legal frameworks and project pipelines, in order to bring private investors and banks on board for riskier projects and to reduce the risk factor of projects that have a strategic value for the EU.  I am proud of the entire team because since we started to deploy this model less than three years ago, we have succeeded in bringing on board an additional &euro;230 billion of fresh investment in the EU in areas like infrastructure, small and medium-sized enterprises, research and innovation and research and development.  We will continue with this in the next multi-annual financial framework, when it will be an even stronger component of our financing investment model.  A fourth way of funding transport, in addition to grants, loans and guarantees, has recently emerged.  I refer to the so-called blending mechanism, which has been successfully tested.  In order to boost investment even further, especially in the cohesion countries where we need to bridge development gaps even faster, we have introduced a blending mechanism whereby a grant can be topped up under the EU guarantee scheme to lower the risk factor dramatically before banks or institutional private investors are brought on board.  In our first call, when we dedicated &euro;1 billion to this kind of blending, these high-level projects were over-subscribed to the tune of &euro;1.6 billion.  That is a great encouragement to continue with this.</p><p> Additional investments are happening through dedicated innovative financial tools.  When European cities recognised that they needed support to decarbonise public transport more quickly and asked for help to move towards decarbonised buses, together with the European Investment Bank we created in record time - less than a year - a financial mechanism or tool that is now used to co-finance this kind of shift in cities.  I am glad that 63 cities have already joined this initiative.  We already have the first actual deployment.  This is moving fast.  Believe it or not, even the EU can take steps quickly when it is recognised that there are opportunities to create European value.</p><p> Members will be familiar with the connecting Europe facility, or CEF, model that is used to support core network corridors.  I am glad that Ireland has had some very successful deployment of this model.  It was used well in the Dublin Port project and in the Dublin city centre railway signalling project.  A total of 19 projects have been approved, which is a good number.  Ireland is using its opportunities well.  Some &euro;756 million has been dedicated to these projects and this has resulted in &euro;3.2 billion of investment by capitalising on the market.  I think that is a fairly good amount.  I hope Ireland will continue with that.  The CEF model will continue to support Irish initiatives.</p><p> I appreciate that I have spoken at length, but I would like to say a couple of words about Brexit before I conclude and the discussion is opened.  I would like to make it clear that Ireland is not alone in this.</p><p>The European Union is engaging seriously with all stakeholders in Ireland to address the preparations for and the different consequences of Brexit when it happens.  It is confusing because we do not have clear signals as to what, when and how things will evolve, but we have the power to be well prepared.  I often say, "Let us behave as if nothing will happen but let us be ready for a hard Brexit that will happen tomorrow".  In this spirit I invite all business stakeholders to engage with the European Union and to start creating options that we can discuss seriously.  There is no point in spreading fear, uncertainty or uneasiness among the Irish population.  If we engage in the creation of constructive solutions, then we will feel better because we will feel like we are in charge.  The European Union cannot create these options without the input of Ireland.   I invite members to engage in a constructive relationship with all of us.</p><p> I am very much aware of what the transport sector means for an island country with an open but small economy such as Ireland.  As Transport Commissioner, we are trying to find solutions to the transport challenges in the context of North-South co-operation.  Again I invite the stakeholders to start planning, to prepare contingency plans and come up with proposals for investments that will be required in order to change the capacity of some of the ports, especially to ensure that connectivity with mainland Europe will remain at the highest possible level based on need.</p><p> What will happen to hauliers on the Border with the North?  We discussed this issue with them and I will prepare plans and run simulations so that we can really see the alternative routes that hauliers can take.  We will need to discuss this further today, not on the day that Brexit happens.  There is a need to stimulate widespread discussions on options to deal with the problems that will emerge and then I invite members to forward the solutions they believe can work to me at the Commission.  Then let us work together on the options that are more likely to succeed.</p><p> A major concern is what will happen to the current policy of the Single European Sky and the hundreds of flights daily.  I will not comment on the statement made by the British Minister but this is one of the hottest topics.  I can assure members that after the three key elements of borders, finances and people, transport comes fourth in importance.  </p><p> We meet weekly with the key negotiator, Mr. Barnier, and share our concerns and the emerging solutions that can be put on the table when he starts negotiating.  That is why it is so important that Ireland acts now and works with the Commission so that we can prepare options for Mr. Barnier in order that he will know what he can juggle.  Ireland's welfare is the most important part of the Brexit negotiations.  Of course, the outcome of Brexit is important for all member states, but Ireland is the country most affected.  If Ireland can come up with good solutions that work, it means the solutions will work for others as well.  I ask members to come on board.</p><p> Tomorrow Brexit will be on the agenda of the European Council meeting and the negotiations will continue in the months to come.  I know the outcome of the negotiations on Brexit is uncertain but the only certainty is that the date of Brexit, 30 March 2019 is approaching quickly.  It is only months away.  Brexit will bring a new reality and I hope Ireland is prepared for it.  Knowing Irish history, I am aware that Ireland has gone through a number of changes, but somehow has found the internal strength to overcome them.  Now Ireland has the 26 other member states behind it.  Ireland needs to show how it wants to co-operate with the rest of the member states in the European Union and must try to bridge the challenges that it will face.  I am not going to say it will be easy.  I am not going to say it will be trivial because it will not be that easy but together we can bridge the challenges.  Believe me, the country that I was born in does not exist anymore.  The country I know best is doing very well now, in spite of the fact that overnight it lost 70% of all market share when the changes happened.</p><p> Let me repeat that Ireland has the advantage of support from the other 26 member states who really care about Ireland.  Let us be active and be in preparatory mode and try to anticipate as much as we can.  Let me highlight that the Government has dedicated &euro;300 million scheme for start ups to help them to readjust their businesses to the new conditions.  That is a good move by Ireland.  We should look for other solutions in the same spirit.</p><p> Life always provides challenges and once you win the challenge, it is incredible how many new opportunities arise.  Please do not be discouraged.  It is just another step in the history of the European Continent.</p></speech>

I represented this committee in Tallinn recently, where Ms Bulc addressed the meetings of all of the transport committees throughout Europe.  That meeting was very informative on the progress that is being made.  Today, with Brexit in the offering, we are talking more about problems than solutions, but it is important to acknowledge the many good things that are happening in the transport sector in connecting Europe.</p><p>That said, the solution everybody wants is a soft Brexit.  All of the different stakeholders want it but it seems it will be very difficult to achieve.  We must plan for the situations the witness outlined.  Some of the policies of the European Union at present - I mentioned this issue in Tallinn also - are based on Britain being part of the Union.  One example is the TEN-T policy.  Part of that policy, which was finalised in 2014, was that it could not be examined again until 2020.  Obviously, if there is a soft Brexit everything will be okay but if there is not we will have a difficulty in that regard.  That is the first issue.</p><p> The second issue is connectivity with Ireland and the European Union.  Mainland Europe is hugely important but we have issues with connecting Ireland.  We have the Ireland 2040 plan.  When the collapse occurred a number of years ago much of the work on road infrastructure stopped.  Most of those projects were about connecting Ireland.  I am from the western part of Ireland and that infrastructure is vital.  I hope matter that will be addressed in the capital spending plan for the future that will be announced shortly.  We talk sometimes about the disconnection between the member states and the European Union.  One of the issues is state aid rules.  There is a reference in the briefing documents to regional airports.  There is a vital regional airport in western Ireland.  The number of passengers is 1.1 million and 750,000 of them relate to Ireland West Airport Knock.  It is very difficult, and this is part of the disconnection, that when the Government might wish to help it cannot do so because of state aid rules.  We should continue to connect Europe but it is also important that we facilitate connections within our country that require support also.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.2597" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1250" speakername="Robert Troy" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017101900002#E00200"><p>I welcome the European Commissioner.  She is appearing before the committee at a highly opportune and appropriate time given the challenges that face us as a consequence of Brexit.  Being pro-European we must ask ourselves why the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union.  How we deal with how the United Kingdom leaves the European Union will be a testament to the Union.  In the case of how this country is dealt with, we must see the benefits of being a fully paid up and engaged member of the European Union.</p> <p>  I will refer to the key areas the witness mentioned.  One is the transport infrastructure and the funding streams under the EU investment plan or the Juncker fund, as it is commonly known.  At present, Ireland has the second lowest level of capital spending in the European Union.  Is the Government using this funding effectively to increase our net infrastructure outside the parameters set down by the fiscal rules?  In her contribution the European Commissioner complimented the use of public private partnerships in respect of our fabulous road infrastructure.  What is her opinion on the Department of Finance cap which limits PPP investment to 10% of total annual capital expenditure?  Does she think this is too arbitrary or does she think we should relax that and avail of the Juncker funding?  As yet, this country has not put forward a single transport proposal for this funding.  Perhaps the Commissioner will comment on that issue.</p> <p>  With regard to the challenges of Brexit and the funding for the European transport network, the European Commissioner referred to the Connecting Europe Facility, CEF, as the main source of funding from Europe.  Will there be an opportunity to review the comprehensive TEN-T network in the light of the fact that Northern Ireland will be leaving the European Union?  The only rail infrastructure at present is from Belfast to Dublin and to Cork.  Will we be able to avail of the CEF funding if that connection or network is broken?  Can we consider new networks and new connectivity, such as the Rosslare Europort?  At present, 80% of our exports go through the landbridge.  Should we be considering investing in Rosslare Europort to make a direct link to mainland Europe and will there be a facility to review the TEN-T network in the future?</p> <p>  Ms Bulc talked about the challenges faced by the freight industry and complimented the establishment of the &euro;300 million fund in the most recent budget.  However, that is a fund that offers a low interest rate.  Has the European Union considered relaxing the state aid rules?  A certain number of our export dependent companies will need direct capital investment and grant aid funding, not just the ability to avail of low interest rates.  I would welcome Ms Bulc's opinion on that matter.</p> <p>  The aviation sector will be severely impacted in that regard.  The European Commissioner spoke about the hundreds of flights.  There are thousands of flights every week between Ireland and the United ingdom.  It is the second busiest intercity connection in the world and the busiest in Europe.  In that context can the witness confirm, due to the wider economic importance, that an aviation deal will be dealt with separately under a separate agreement?  It must be dealt with earlier and independently of the wider trade negotiations.  As the European Commissioner said, the date of exit is fast approaching.  Seats are sold one year in advance so it is critical that a deal is done in the near future.  Some of our key players made this point recently at an EU committee meeting in the European Parliament.</p> <p>  Would the Commissioner support maintaining the current aviation market access arrangements?  Would she support the retention of the open skies policy?  Would she support the reintroduction of duty free sales on EU-UK routes as soon as the European Union becomes a third country as a means of softening the Brexit blow for the industry?  Has she learned from any of her experiences with the lengthy approval process required for Norwegian airlines to get an operating licence recently?  How does she envisage the United States evolving in respect of the open skies policy?  It took almost two years to get a route opened between Cork and the United States and now the United States is imposing extraordinary taxes of 30% on the Canadian Bombardier Inc. company.  Is the European Union going to press the United States to deal in a more open way with the Union with regard to the open skies policy?  In addition, there are standards across the European Union with regard to aviation.  How does the witness envisage those standards being maintained?  Does she envisage the United Kingdom being able to retain the same standards as Ireland?</p> <p>  The European Commissioner referred to decarbonisation and a suite of measures or packages.  Given the negative cost of &euro;500 billion per annum, there is a real incentive to roll out initiatives to make people transfer.  I am conscious of some of the measures introduced in the recent budget.</p><p>The reply to a parliamentary question I tabled recently indicated there are more than 6,000 vehicles currently in State ownership but only six hybrid or electric cars were purchased on behalf of the State last year.  We are not leading by example in this matter.  Will the Commissioner comment on that matter?</p></speech>

Ms Bulc noted that she is from a large country which subsequently became a smaller one.  That political experience will serve her well and will be for the good of Europe in the context of the Brexit negotiations.</p> <p>  Every time there are changes in climate agreements, the transport sector immediately experiences the greatest hit.  For how long can that continue to be the case?  Soon cars will be stripped down to something that no longer resembles what they used to be.  In the case of motor cars, we have good tax incentives in place in this country, but until we get the heavier goods vehicle to adjust to cleaner energy use, we will not succeed in meeting our targets.  Some EU countries, most notably Germany, are very dependent on the automobile industry.  We are talking about getting rid of the diesel engine altogether.  Brexit, in whatever form it takes, will impact on Germany's exports, Britain being a major importer of luxury cars.  Will compensation measures be put in place for those companies?  Such compensation has been provided in the past for the agriculture and food sector.  The ending of the sugar beet industry, for instance, saw compensation being awarded to some manufacturers.  Does the Commissioner envisage the same happening in respect of the motor trade, whereby there would be compensation for loss of business?</p> <p>  What is the status of the major EU infrastructural initiatives such as TEN-T?  Some three or four years ago, the European Union presented a lovely diagram showing the various infrastructural projects being undertaken across the Union, including in Ireland and Britain.  Is all of that work on hold until we know where we stand in regard to future connectivity?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-10-19a.2603" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="11:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017101900002#F00600"><p>The Commissioner is very welcome.  I was going to ask whether she has seen much of Ireland but she indicated in her opening statement that this is her first visit.  If she had a chance to travel around the place, she would have seen that infrastructure, right across the island, is in dire need of investment.  The rail network, for example, requires an input of &euro;500 million in the next five years.  The level of under-investment in our national rail network is so dire that serious safety concerns are being raised.  The motorway network is incomplete and regional and secondary roads need an investment of &euro;3 billion just to bring them up to a steady condition.  I expect and hope the Commissioner will accept that, in the main, it is EU fiscal rules that are preventing us from investing in our infrastructure.  With Brexit coming down the tracks in 18 months, many sectors right across the island require significant investment.</p> <p>  The Commissioner referred to the usefulness of public private partnerships.  I respectfully disagree that such arrangements facilitate the efficient delivery of infrastructure.  In fact, they are more expensive in the long run because they require a greater investment on the part of the State.  PPPs are popular with right-wing Governments in this country because they allow them to keep spending off the balance sheet.  The reality, however, is that they ultimately are more expensive for the State and place a burden on taxpayers by way of the additional taxes they require to be levied in order to compensate the Exchequer.  The contracts entered into under these arrangements leave a lot to be desired, with private companies being compensated at every turn for contracts lasting 30 years.</p> <p>  In regard to Brexit, I am from the Border county of Louth and we will not accept any return to a physical hard border.  We are looking to the European Union to support us in this matter because the Brits do not know what they are doing.  They are going from crisis to crisis with no comprehension of what is ahead.  We hope and expect the European Union will recognise that Ireland needs a special designated status to protect it from the impact of Brexit.  Has the Commissioner or her colleagues given consideration to loosening up the fiscal rules to allow us to invest, in the context of our unique position with respect to Brexit?  What is the status of existing agreements to address the cross-Border infrastructural deficit?  Will the Commissioner give a commitment to honour those agreements?  What, if any, work has been done in her office on this issue and will she help us to deliver the investment necessary to honour those cross-Border initiatives, which include the A5 road project and the Narrow Water Bridge project.  These are all vital infrastructural developments and an integral part of the agreements that were delivered following on from the Good Friday Agreement.</p> <p>  Has the Commissioner given any consideration to the requirement for further investment in Irish ports and airports in the context of the EU directive regarding state rules and exemptions and our reliance on Britain as a land bridge?  </p> <p>  Will the Commissioner comment on the aviation sector, specifically the attempts to secure an open skies agreement and the impact of Brexit on regional airlines?  If there is a failure to reach agreement, will it require a legal framework in order for those airlines to operate?  What effect might this have on EU passengers travelling to Britain and on EU nationals living in the United Kingdom?</p></speech>

I have only one question, concerning privatisation in the transport sector, which is under way in Ireland.  In the case of provincial bus services, for instance, recent Governments have positively encouraged the arrival of private operators onto the scene and have hamstrung the semi-State company.</p><p>Recently, under a EU diktat, 10% of Dublin Bus services were put out to public tender.  Incredibly, even though Dublin Bus, the State provider, had submitted the lowest bid, the tender was awarded to the other competitor, a private company from the United Kingdom called Go Ahead.  We touched on the matter of Brexit this morning.  The British Prime Minister, Mrs. Theresa May's vision for Britain is of a bargain basement Brexit with US style regulation and a lack of workers' rights.  Go Ahead is a company which typifies and personifies bargain basement Britain.  We know that more privatisations are under way in this field owing to the EU diktat.  The privatisation of transport services in other European countries happened before it happened in Ireland.  Other countries have had many years of experience of what happens when one goes down the road to transport privatisation.  It has been a fairly bitter experience for many countries and led to a rethink.  In recent years there has been a reversal of policy away from privatisation towards remunicipalisation and renationalisation of services.  As the Commissioner will be familiar with them,I will just instance a few.  In Portugal, in Lisbon and Porto, the country's two biggest cities, there has been remunicipalisation where privatisation has been reversed.  The same process has occurred in London and Tyne and Wear in the United Kingdom, in Kiel and Solingen in Germany; while in France in Toulouse and Clarement-Ferrand, Nice and Cannes there has been a move away from privatisation and towards remunicipalisation.  In Austria it has happened in Vienna and Nieder&ouml;sterreich, while in the United Kingdom there is a question of renationalising rail services.  </p><p> Why has this happened?  Dr. Tom O'Connor of Cork Institute of Technology recently presented a conference paper in which he highlighted three issues, the first of which was private sector failure, in which regard he instanced the collapse of transport public private partnerships in London.  The second was greater efficiency and lower costs, with public authorities being almost always able to borrow at lower rates than private companies.  There is also the cost of tendering and monitoring tendering which can add 10% or more to contracts.  Third, there is the achievement of public service objectives.  It is easier to do this when a utility is publicly owned rather than when it is in private hands serving shareholders by maximising profit.  One cannot control what one does not own.  </p><p> Given that the experience of transport privatisation in Europe has been a bitter one and that governments and cities have drawn lessons and are moving away from privatisation towards renationalisation and remunicipalisation for sound reasons, why is it that the European Union and the Commission continue with this privatisation mantra and drive it under the guise of tendering, although we know from the Dublin Bus experience what tendering means which is more privatisation, even though it has been seen to fail?</p><p> What is the Commission and the European Union doing to encourage the manufacture of buses to make them more accessible for people with mobility issues and a visual impairment?</p></speech>

I hope the Commissioner will return after this visit with an understanding of the importance of achieving a new agreement, not only for the island of Ireland but also the entire European Union after Brexit.  I hope this afternoon's Council meeting will be successful and that we are getting closer to being able to move on to deal with the three key issues which will allow the discussion of other matters.  </p> <p>  Regarding a new EU-US-UK open skies agreement, Ireland geographically is much more exposed than many countries on the Continent.  We are also exposed in the airlines that use our airspace.  It would be an easy fix or win for all three parties concerned after Brexit.  Unfortunately, there is considerable reluctance in the United Kingdom to admit that there is a problem.  I do not believe British Airways has commented on it yet; easyJet has belatedly come out on the matter, while Michael O'Leary and Ryanair have been at the forefront, although I know that Mr. O'Leary is not currently very popular.  It is key that we send back that message, that this deal must be sorted out before March to allow airlines to sell into the market.</p></speech>

In the Commissioner's presentation she spoke about a review of the air passengers rights Regulation (EC) 261/2004.  A review began in 2013, but I understand it has been blocked.  Will the Commissioner update us on the review?  It is particularly important that when the rights of passengers are not honoured that we know what the issue is.</p></speech>

There are a lot of them and as I only have ten minutes in which to reply, I may not be able to reply to all of them.  I will try to deal with ones of a similar nature together and hope cover most of members' concerns.  </p> <p>  On the last question about Ryanair and passenger rights, the European Union is the only political union in the world that has very clear passenger rights.  We proposed improvements.  As the Deputy pointed out, these got stuck because of the Gibraltar issue, but that does not mean that we do not have the rights; we do and all operators are obliged to follow them and it is up to national authorities to enforce them.  We call on the Irish authorities to ensure passenger rights are well respected.  The new guidelines have been published and we call on the Irish authorities to follow them.  The Ryanair issue is unfortunate, but we need to follow the rules and take care of passengers.</p> <p>  The most common question was related to TEN-T.  As members correctly noted, the TEN-T review is coming up in 2023.  In other circumstances this would be the dynamic we would follow, but TEN-T has a special legal framework within which changes can take place; therefore, it is not up to the Commission to decide that there will be a change to the TEN-T network or funding.  Extraordinary circumstances call for extraordinary actions.  The conditions in which Ireland now finds itself and the challenges relating to the corridor with Great Britain qualify as extraordinary.  That is why I have already invited all stakeholders today and will continue to do so to come up with proposals for how they may be readjusted in the future.  We will talk about this issue.  I ask members to, please, be active on it and make sure EU values are considered and that they provide something that will deal with the conditions we are all in.</p><p>Please also bear in mind that corridor logic involves many member states.  Let us call a meeting as soon as possible.  There are co-ordinators for each corridor in the European Union and a meeting should be called where the co-ordinators start to synchronise the activities on the corridor.<br/><br/>Regional airports are a special subject and one of the elements identified in the aviation strategy that was published by the European Union in 2015.  We have addressed them already by the accreditation of state aid rules and how they can be applied to regional airports.  I am fully aware of the case that Deputy Robert Troy raised as I have been informed about it.  We are now taking a closer look at how we can address it in the spirit of Brexit.  We will talk about it.  I will also discuss the issue with my colleague, Commissioner Vestager, who is in charge of state aid rules, and I will try to explain the special conditions to which Ireland West Airport Knock is subject.  However, now I cannot give Deputy Robert Troy a final answer.<br/><br/>Some member states had a very good capacity and tradition for using different mechanisms and picked up really quickly on the mechanism of the European Fund for Strategic Investment, EFSI.  Other member states, all cohesion countries, have responded very poorly, or with zero projects.  That is why we started with roadshows and special advisory boards that help to build the capacity either through a national promotional body or through the European Investment Advisory Hub.  Things are improving.  For the first time we have graduates coming on board and I hope Ireland will use this opportunity and also become more engaged, especially because everywhere one sees the revenue flows, this should be used.  Please encourage stakeholders to use the EFSI mechanism.  At the beginning, people were sceptical of PPPs but new forms of PPPs are emerging.  One that we saw in transport was the revenue sharing model.  It has nothing to do with ownership but is based on revenue sharing.  That is an interesting one also, which we will also put in a bucket of different options.<br/><br/>I will say a few words about ownership, although I may not be the most appropriate Commissioner to discuss this.  We really need to distinguish between privatisation and competition.  We are very much pushing for competition because we see in a competitive environment that development is better and of higher quality and new opportunities can be implemented and used faster.  We rarely interfere with the ownership structures, but sometimes we have ownership and control rules for aviation.  It is clear that 49% of foreign capital is in aviation, but that is it.  We do not say whether this should be private or public capital.  The same thing has happened in the fourth railway passage.  We said that we need to decouple infrastructure from services because it is hard to imagine that one could have many competitors in railway infrastructure.  That is why we set rules as to how much profit the railway infrastructure can make in order to ensure there is fair competition on a service level.  We are not saying, however, who has to own it.  We are saying there must be competition in order that there can be German, French, Irish, Polish, Slovenian national operators who can bid for services.  It is not about private or public ownership, it is about competition.  This was the purpose of the fourth railway package<i>per se.</i><br/><br/>If members have more specific questions and have cases, as was mentioned previously, could they submit them in writing and we will go into more detail on the subject?<br/><br/>There are many questions about aviation.  I am fully aware of the sensitivity of the topic in Ireland, as Ireland is the front runner in the transformation of European aviation and also the major winner of the Single European Sky.  As I mentioned, there are three lead priorities that need to be resolved before we move forward: people, money and borders.  Transport comes next and is the fourth priority.  Within transport, aviation is the most sensitive and urgent issue because of the policy on a Single European Sky.  One may ask whether I can predict anything.  I cannot as I do not know how Brexit will evolve.  We are getting ready for all scenarios: hard Brexit, soft Brexit, no Brexit.  We need to work with Ireland on this issue and I hope it will be a very active member.  I want any agreement that is put on the table to be as liberal as possible, because I am liberal, but we will have to deal with constraints within which we operate on this sensitive issue.  I cannot predict anything more than that we will work hard to be prepared, that things will not surprise us, and that we will know what to do, based on the outcome of negotiations or based on the results we will get on 30 March 2018.<br/><br/>I am quite proud that we managed to resolve a couple of very heavy duty issues with the United States in a spirit of co-operation.  One of them was potential laptop ban on all European carriers.  It was a very sensitive issue.  We engaged in a dialogue and very constructive negotiations.  I am glad we came out with even stronger co-operation between the United States and the European Union, which resulted in a three-phase approach, where we join forces to improve the security and safety of our aviation at the same time, and here all EU member states acted as one together with the Commission.  I was very proud of the way we demonstrated our unity and that is why we got a good deal.  Technical negotiations and technical co-operation with the US Open Skies treaty is really on a high level.  We meet periodically all the time regardless of the new sort of signals that are coming from the United States.  At this point I cannot say that they treat us any differently, but one saw an announcement two days ago between Airbus and Bombardier.  I think this is an incredible solution that came out of these completely new circumstances.  I very much welcome moves of this type.  We need to react with wisdom and new business models when new conditions occur.  I met the CEO of Airbus, who reconfirmed the commitment to move on and this is a success story for him.  He used the new conditions to his advantage.<br/><br/>I am never sceptical.  Troubles appear, they are unpredictable, but the strengths we show are to resolve the problem, and so far I can only rely on successful negotiations that have got us out of critical situations.  Have faith.  If there is a problem, we will solve it.  Sometimes it takes a little longer.  The issue with Norwegian airlines is typical.  We insisted and were insistent and there were numerous negotiations, but now we have a deal that enables Norwegian Air International to fly.</p><p>The outlook seems positive to me on this issue.</p></speech>

If the worst scenario happens in the case of Ireland and Brexit, we already have good experiences with neighbouring third countries in terms of dealing with TEN-T projects.
