    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.6" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017012500002#F00200"><p>The first petition for consideration is Petition No. P00020/16 from Mr. Desmond Lafferty which is entitled, "Negotiating Norms".  The petitioner has engaged on a number of occasions with the Ombudsman and former Ministers of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  He is not satisfied with the outcome of this engagement to date and in his new petition is requesting the following: that the Ombudsman recognise the contradictions, mistakes and negligence of her staff in handling his case; that an external office monitor an ombudsman; a declaration that the previous committee was negligent and ill-informed in its handling of his petition; and the establishment of an explicit set of rules that would recognise the inalienable right of a private citizen to negotiation, reason and jurisprudence - the theory or philosophy of law - and that apologies not be casually retracted.  It is proposed to inform the petitioner of the changes to the remit of the committee in respect of its engagement with an ombudsman, that the committee will not revisit a decision taken by the previous committee as petitioners can resubmit a petition and write to the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade requesting that it outline the procedures followed in dealing with complaints of this nature.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  The next petition is Petition No. P00026/16 from Ms Laura English which is entitled, "Driving test requirements".  This is the second time the petition has come before the committee.  The petitioner is of the opinion that driving lessons are too expensive and that the cost precludes some persons from being in a position to learn how to drive and apply for a driving test.  The petitioner outlines that a phased method of completing essential driver training, EDT, would be more beneficial.  At its meeting on 15 November 2016 the committee agreed to write once again to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport requesting clarification on who had responsibility for regulating the price of EDT lessons and whether it would look favourably at following in the United Kingdom's footsteps in having no limit on the number of lessons required.  The response from the Department confirmed that the lessons delivered in Ireland were more structured than in the United Kingdom and that statistics showed it took an average of 47 lessons in the United Kingdom to pass a driving test.  The cost of lessons, while not regulated by the Department, is set by market forces in a competitive market.  It is proposed that we forward a copy of the response to the petitioner and close the petition as the committee has taken it as far as it can.</p><p>Senator Kelleher signalled.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017012500002#G00200"><p>Agreed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.9" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017012500002#G00300"><p>The proposal is agreed by the members.  In discussing the petition, it is clear there are pure market forces driving the cost of driving lessons.  One has some sympathy for the plight of the individual driver in this instance because of the cost of the lessons.  The committee has articulated a view but is limited in its scope.  If the members wish to comment, they are welcome to do so.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017012500002#G00400"><p>I have some sympathy with the petitioner.  We have taken the petition as far as we can go within the remit of the committee.  However, as I said, this is something one is required by law to do, yet there is no ceiling to the cost it might incur for the individual.  This is a difficulty for many citizens, particularly young people starting out.  On top of rental costs and other things, it can be quite a significant cost to people.  As I said, it is beyond our remit but we have some empathy and sympathy for the petitioner's situation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.11" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017012500002#G00500"><p>We have agreed a course of action in respect of the petition.</p><p>The next petition for consideration is petition No. P00029/16 in the name of Mr Ois&iacute;n Tuohey, entitled &quot;Reduce Maximum Working Week to 40 hours&quot;.  The petitioner seeks to amend the Organisation of Working Time Act 1997 to reduce the maximum average working week for many employees to 40 hours per week.  It is currently at 48 hours per week.  The petitioner is of the view that this amendment would boost productivity and relationships in the workplace and result in fewer days of holiday and sick leave being taken and could reduce stress.  The Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation has responded, outlining the reasons for the legislation.  It is proposed to forward a copy of the response received from the Department of Jobs, Enterprise and Innovation to the petitioner and close the petition.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The last petition for consideration is petition No. P00035/16 in the name of Mr. David Geary, entitled &quot;Financial Ombudsman Review&quot;.  The issues raised in this petition arose after the petitioner submitted a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, regarding his standard variable rate mortgage provider.  He was not satisfied with a decision taken by the FSO regarding his case and requests the committee to undertake the following actions.  He wishes to have the decision of the Office of the Ombudsman independently reviewed to see if the handling of the original complaint was correctly adjudicated in accordance with the statute and to rectify any other similar cases in which the ombudsman has come to an incorrect decision, request that the ombudsman confirm if it was in compliance with the Central Bank and Financial Services Authority of Ireland Act 2004 regarding the petitioner's case, and quality assure and review the appeals procedures of the ombudsman.  The FSO has commissioned a comprehensive review of its operational services and, following this review, has implemented significant changes by the introduction of a dedicated dispute resolution service and the issuing of preliminary findings regarding complaints received.  It is proposed therefore to inform the petitioner of Standing Order 111C(1)(<i>h</i>), which precludes the committee from examining parts of this petition, and to forward a copy of the response from the Financial Services Ombudsman to the petitioner and close the petition.  It is important to note that we intend to invite the Financial Services Ombudsman to appear before the committee regarding this petition to discuss the outcome of the independent strategic and operational review and its progress to date and into the future.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>I now turn to No. 10, which relates to the role and remit of the committee.  I wish to inform members that the committee received correspondence dated 20 December 2016 from the clerk to the Standing Sub-committee on D&aacute;il Reform regarding a request of the committee to broaden its role and remit to include matters of general public concern or public policy.  The sub-committee, at its meeting of 14 December, agreed not to allow this request.  Along with the request from the committee to broaden its remit, the Sub-committee on D&aacute;il Reform also received correspondence from the Ombudsman Forum expressing its concern that the remit of the former Committee on Public Service Oversight and Petitions has not been retained and requesting that this decision be reviewed.  On this issue, the sub-committee agreed the following: &quot;Where a Select Committee does not under Standing Order 84A(8)(<i>b</i>) consider an Ombudsman report, or a portion or portions thereof, within two months (excluding Christmas, Easter or summer recess periods) of the report being laid before either or both Houses of the Oireachtas, the Committee shall proceed to consider the Ombudsman report, or any portions thereof not considered by the Select Committee.&quot;  At this stage I open the correspondence to the members for further discussion.  As we have previously discussed, there was a genuine expectation that the role and remit of this committee would be expanded.  This was articulated through interactions I had as Chairman when attending the Working Group of Committee Chairmen.  It is a statement of fact that the role and remit of this committee has been reduced relative to the equivalent committee that sat under the previous D&aacute;il.  It is arguable that if we are the first line of contact for the petitioner, the citizen, it is perhaps not adequate that the committee's role would be reduced to such an extent that we are left only to consider sectoral committee ombudsman reports that have not been considered within a two-month period in the various sectoral committees.  In other words, we are left only to consider those sectoral reports that have not been considered by other committees and petitions that come before us.  I open the floor to the members to give their opinions on the role and remit of the committee.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.12" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1362" speakername="Denise Mitchell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017012500002#G00600"><p>I am disappointed by the correspondence received, as I believe is the committee.  I generally thought our remit would have been expanded, if anything, considering what we are.  This committee is about the public interest, and if we are limited in this regard, we will just be here to take petitions.  There will not be much teeth to the committee or work to be done.  If we are about the public and its interest, we must be able to work on public policy.  Otherwise, we will just be sitting here doing petitions.  I do not see that as being of any benefit at all to the public in general.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1430" speakername="Colette Kelleher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017012500002#G00700"><p>I absolutely concur with Deputy Denise Mitchell.  This is absolutely the wrong signal to give for the reasons I outlined in private session.  There are real threats to democracy and democratic institutions, the likes of which we have not seen since the 1930s, and that is not an exaggeration.  We need only look at the landscape of Europe and some of the elections coming up there and what has happened in the US recently.  We have an opportunity to build on steps we have taken in the Irish Parliament to connect with citizens in a real and meaningful way.  As I said in private session, the Citizens' Assembly initiative was recently commended by a leading thinker, David van Reybrouck.  In an open letter published across Europe in November, he pointed to Ireland as a model of good practice.  Ours is the most innovative democracy in Europe.  A few weeks ago, a random sample of 100 Irish citizens drafted by lot was brought together into a Citizens' Assembly.  That which brought us the Citizens Assembly also brought us this committee, which we are now beginning to water down before it has even begun to take root in the public mind or begun its real work.</p><p>This is at a time when democracy and democratic institutions are being questioned and under threat.  There is a need to make the most of the committee and for us not to sulk in a corner but to get on with what we have to do.  At the same time we must promote the work of the committee through the Citizens Information boards and others and connect with these bodies.  We should go out and about to ensure we will not be seen a group of people in a privileged position in an ivory tower and that we are trying to connect with people who ordinarily would not be able to work the system.  I am thinking of people with intellectual disabilities who may not be able to read and those in nursing homes who may have very important issues of public interest to raise but who are not able to access the process.  They may have grievances, issues and complaints to make.  They are very dependent on public systems.  We should, therefore, make an effort to reach those who are hard to reach.  We also need to continue to support the Chairman in making the case for extending the remit of the committee and to point to the context in which we are working in order that when he meets the Taoiseach he will be able to put petitions in that context.<br/><br/>Stephen Collins wrote in <i>The Irish Times</i>that mainstream politics had not failed, it just needed to connect.  The committee is absolutely pivotal in making that connection.  Brexit and the election of Donald Trump raise deeply uncomfortable questions about the future of western liberal democracy.  European Union countries have been given a fair warning of the dangers.  If Marine Le Pen is elected in France ,it will put a question mark over the entire European Union project.  That will put everything we have been working on nationally and internationally in a very different place.  We should not take these issues lightly.  Dealing with petitions is an honest attempt to connect with the citizenry; therefore, this is not a committee that should be watered down but one that should be promoted and expanded.  Stephen Collins said the big failure of western governments had been their growing inability to connect with the wider public and communicate the nature of the choices and trade-offs that were an essential part of democracy.  He went on to note that at a wider EU level a much greater effort had to be made to communicate with citizens on what the institutions were doing if people were to be persuaded to stick with a project that had delivered so much for the continent.  People do need to see the bigger picture in terms of the work we are doing.  We should make the case, not just for ourselves as members but also for the sake of democratic institutions in Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1237" speakername="Martin Heydon" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017012500002#H00200"><p>As a member of four Oireachtas committees, I believe we should not have a duplication of work.  It is important to ensure two committees are not doing the same work at the same time.  However, I share some of the sentiments expressed.  Of all the committees, this is probably the most connected to the general public.  The ability of Joe or Josephine Bloggs to raise an issue and have it discussed in detail in Parliament is very important.  We must be careful if we are seeking to narrow the scope and ability of the committee to deal with issues in the public and the national interest.  What is in the public interest is subjective, depending on which member of the public is involved, but everyone is entitled to have his or her say.</p> <p>  There are a number of procedural aspects of how this D&aacute;il operates that frustrate me.  It is crazy that there are only five hours a week to deal with legislation in the D&aacute;il Chamber.  There are Private Members' Bills all the time when we talk about what we should be doing, but the time available to actually do anything is limited.  Similarly, the committee schedule is a source of frustration.  Such decisions need to be revisited and discussed further.  As a committee member, I mandate the Chairman to go back and express our views in that regard.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1276" speakername="Se&aacute;n Sherlock" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CPP2017012500002#H00300"><p>Members are unanimous in their view that there is a role for the committee.  There was a legitimate expectation in our interaction with the working group of committee Chairmen that its role would be expanded, that it would not seek to duplicate the work of other committees but would work to complement it.  If an issue of public policy arose at this committee, for instance, it was to liaise with the sectoral committee and seek to have a workflow that would not necessarily be facilitated in the sectoral committee because of the sheer volume of work being done by it.  We are all members of other committees.  I do not understand why the sub-committee on D&aacute;il reform came to the conclusion that it did, but we have agreed that we will write to it and seek to engage further with it.  As has been said, there is a legitimate role for the committee.  This is the first line of contact for people if they wish to raise an issue and see it elevated within the the Houses of the Oireachtas.</p></speech>

That is also an important body of work.</p></speech>

We could play a very relevant role in that respect.</p></speech>

I will be happy to share that paper with this as well as the other committee for which it was commissioned.  It is something we need to be better at.  In some respects we are seen to be the leader in this area.  The future of democratic institutions depends on how well parliaments can innovate, adapt and connect with citizens in all forms and formats.  We fully endorse the Chairman's efforts to follow through on this issue and fight the good fight for citizens in strengthening the role of the committee.</p></speech>

It is very much appreciated.</p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure, I am required to draw attention to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the joint committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.

This is not a brand new issue but something that has been highlighted for quite some time.  The issue of carrying schoolbags affects large numbers of children in Ireland and around the world.  It is a global issue.  One of the factors that tends constantly to raise its head is the weight of schoolbags.  It is where most of the emphasis of the research is but there is a lot of evidence, including our own, to support the fact that the weight of the schoolbag is not the main factor when it comes to causing musculoskeletal pain in children.</p><p>Some countries have established guideline weights, and they have actually legalised them.  Throughout Europe and in the United States, Australia and New Zealand, the guideline weight tends to be around 10% of the child's body weight.  However, there is increasing evidence that 10% of body weight is not a reliable measure.  In the current climate of obesity in children, that weight is also very unrealistic because 10% of a child who is obese is not a fair method of assessment of how much he or she would be able to carry.</p><p> From our research, we concluded that there is no merit in establishing guidelines for children based on the schoolbag weight alone, so we looked at other issues and what could be done.  We took a more proactive outlook on this and looked at other aspects of the schoolbag, such as the type of bag, how it is carried and when it is carried.</p><p> Another factor that came out of our research was that there is very little evidence to identify whether parents are aware of the schoolbag issues.  We recently got ethics approval to do a study on parental awareness of what their children are carrying and how they are carrying it.  There is no evidence that parents have ever received information about this topic, and we believe that if parents received information they would be better informed and they might be able to tackle the issue in a much more positive and proactive way.</p><p> One of the positive factors regarding schoolbag carriage is that children require exercise and movement to develop in a healthy way.  The carrying of a schoolbag is considered to be moderate to vigorous activity for children.  As is widely known, children are supposed to have 60 minutes of moderate to vigorous activity a day.  Looking at this in a positive way, carrying a schoolbag could in fact be considered to be part of a child's daily activity.  This is an important point at the moment, where children are very sedentary.  This could be seen as a very positive thing.</p><p> I am very keen to try to heighten awareness of the issues in a very well structured way so that parents, teachers and all the stakeholders who are involved in this process have a better understanding of what carrying a schoolbag is about.</p></speech>

Dr. Dockrell was part of the original group that reported back in 1998.  The report has been out there in the ether since and very little has happened, so this is an ideal opportunity to try to kick off the debate again.  I am on the National Parents Council, post-primary.  I am chair of the sub-committee that develops policy documents on a range of issues, and as part of the briefing documentation we provided our policy document on the weight of schoolbags.  This reflects support for the initiative taken with the report of 1998, and it has appealed for the past 17 years for a proper implementation process.</p> <p>  In my submission I have said that in fairness to the Department, under the terms of the report it has sent out several circulars over the years requesting implementation.  Unfortunately, requesting implementation and asking schools to be more aware of the subject matter is not amounting to a heap of beans.  It is the single most common topic that we are contacted by parents about on an annual basis, particularly starting in September, which is the first time many parents experience what their children are expected to carry home.  By pure coincidence a parent in Donegal was on the radio on Monday, on Ocean FM, saying that his 12 or 13 year old son was carrying close to 12 kg in his first year.  He put forward all the arguments as to what can be done about it, referencing that the report had been published in 1998.</p> <p>  In the past year Senator Gerard Craughwell, in a statement he issued, referenced that there should be action and that there should be some sort of study undertaken to see what schools were doing about it.  We think that we need to get a grouping together, including all the stakeholders, with the report on the table.  There have been minor changes and developments in this area over the last 17 years, but the report has substantially still to be implemented.  Implementing means that the stakeholders have to be pursued to take up the matter.</p> <p>  The Department of Education and Skills has been sending out circulars and reminders.  It may have had a poster campaign.  From a National Parents Council perspective, what disappoints us when it comes to Department of Education and Skills' circulars is that all circulars rightly state that relevant documentation should be circulated to all parents councils.  History and evidence is to the contrary when it comes to schools and boards of management circulating the relevant information to parents.  If that was done there would already be a forum within schools to tackle this problem.  </p> <p>  Our recommendation would be to include stakeholders.  Included in that list of stakeholders should be the Union of Secondary Students in Ireland, which could be an important part of the process because it has modern intake and suggestions that could be made.  From that grouping would come some sort of process where we could get some implementation.  As to the form that might take, I can only reference to when we set up the National Parents Council a number of years ago, which was a post-primary education forum to discuss educational issues common to all educational partners that were of concern.  The post-primary education forum had high-up people from the two teacher unions, the three management bodies, and the National Association of Principals and Deputy Principals, NAPD.  That is the sort of forum that we would suggest, and it would be good to add in some expertise from the likes of Dr. Sara Dockrell.  As it is of national importance, the head of the National Parents Council primary, Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch, will speak as to how the issue is affecting primary students.</p> <p>  We need a process and a key driver.  It will not be enough to get a feel-good factor from us agreeing that something should be done.  If we put something in place we need someone to drive it.</p></speech>

When we were invited to the committee just over a week ago we struggled as to how to be genuine in representing parents' voices as we had a very tight timeframe.  We wanted to ask parents for their views, but we normally have quite a while to develop a survey when we ask parents about a particular issue.  We were under a very tight timeframe, but we felt that even if we got a sample we would put it out.  The fact that in the four days the survey was out we got over 3,000 responses is the first point I would raise as to how important this issue is to parents.  We put a survey out last Thursday and closed it on Sunday night.  There were 3,009 responses in that time.  Since we closed the survey we have had a number of parents contacting us disappointed that it was closed so quickly because they felt that it was a very important issue and they wanted to have a say in the matter.  There is scope for consulting parents more on this issue.  That being said, over 3,000 responses gives us a good flavour of parents' feelings around the issue of schoolbags.</p><p>Before I go into the survey results, it is important to look at the situation we are in with school bags and the weight of them at a primary school level.  On behalf of the National Parents Council, primary, I have been to a committee meeting before to talk about the cost of school books and how we can reduce that cost.  The whole school book issue, which is causing the majority of the weight, seems to be going around in a number of different guises.  I suppose one of the things that we would be concerned about is the question of whether all of those books are needed in the first place.  Is that actually examined?  When we are looking at the cost and the weight of them, are we asking ourselves whether we need them in the first place.  The 1999 primary school curriculum was written in a way that would suggest that we needed fewer books.</p><p> There are also a number of reports.  I have referenced one in the submission that asks if we are over-relying on textbooks.  That report was from the Education Research Centre, specifically looking at the curriculum subject of maths, and suggested that maybe there was an over-reliance on textbooks.</p><p> I will frame all the survey results in the fact that I think we need to go back a few steps at primary school.  Before we start to find ways of carrying and paying for books, maybe we need to find out if we need the books in the first place, what teaching and learning look like in our classrooms, and what we intended it to look like.</p><p> I am not going to go through all the survey results but some that I want to highlight will reference some of the points that the previous speakers have already made.  We asked how children get to school.  Some 32% of parents said that their children walked and 57% said that they got a lift.  Parents were asked if they were concerned and what their concerns were about the weight of schoolbooks.  Some 89% of parents said that they were concerned about the back health of their children and 45% were concerned about their child's general well-being because of the weight of schoolbooks.  Some 31% said that their child could not walk because of the weight of schoolbooks.  The weight of the schoolbag at primary level is preventing their child from being able to walk in a situation where they otherwise would be able to walk, and that raises concerns about exercise and activity.  We asked parents how concerned they were about the weight of the schoolbag.  Some 38% of the 3,000 said that they were extremely concerned and 31% said that they were somewhat concerned.  They were the two highest ratings.  Nearly 70% of parents had some level of significant concern and the rest were slightly concerned or not concerned at all.</p><p> We asked what options were provided by the school to reduce the weight of schoolbags.  That alludes to Mr. Beddy's comment on trying to find out what schools are doing about it.  Parents said a number of options were available in the school from storage facilities to duplicate books and all those kind of initiatives.  Some 39% said that there were not aware of any measure taken by schools to reduce the weight of the schoolbag.  It is important that schools do something and that parents and children know that they are doing something.  It is not necessarily the case that 39% of schools are not doing anything but clearly it is not known about by parents at the school.  We asked parents if their child had ever experienced an injury or pain which they believed was a result of carrying their schoolbag, and 22% of parents said that they felt that their child had.</p><p> Dr. Dockrell's point around information to parents is really important.  Some 80% of parents said that they would like their children to receive information from the school around how to lift and carry their bag.  They also want them to learn organisational skills about what books to take or not.  I think it is particularly important at primary school when children really struggle with, and are only learning, those skills.  Some  71% of parents said that they would like to have more information about carrying and lifting techniques and things like that.</p><p> There is a little bit more detail in the survey but I think they are the key points of it.  We really feel strongly at primary level that before we start to address the weight of the books in the bag, we need to look at whether all those books need to be in the bag in the first place.</p></speech>

I am very interested in some of the comments made in that it is clearly the number one issue for parents that are making contact with Mr. Beddy.  It is an issue, considering the number of students and parents at any one time.  I have often heard people refer to the back - I know Dr. Dockrell would be a lot more competent in this area - as being like a credit card in that onr can keep bending it and bending it, trying to crack it, and eventually something snaps.  That is the danger here.  Maybe their backs are not giving way under the schoolbags, but they are certainly wearing them down over time.</p> <p>  I have six children going out with schoolbags every morning and do not take any notice of it but I was prompted to suggest to the committee before Christmas that we would look at this issue by my wife who is from Estonia where they are looking at legislation.  The Estonian Parliament is talking about bringing in legislation, although guidelines were brought in in 2001.   Maybe the committee has to decide what the way forward is because circulars are by their very nature advisory and temporary.  People are reminded but life goes on.  As we can see with this issue, nothing has changed 20 years on.</p> <p>  There is one other issue I would like to mention before I open the meeting up to questions.  With the advent of e-schooling, iPads and all that, this should not be an issue.  Why is it still an issue?  Of course many schools have trialled iPads and are moving away from them.  I do not accept that the advent of e-schooling is a solution.  I reference Estonia again, which would be one of the most advanced countries in Europe for the whole e-school project.  They are still talking about bringing in legislation on the weight of schoolbags.  I think it is a very real issue that we have to touch on.</p> <p>  I call Deputy Rabbitte.</p></speech>

I am very interested in the survey that was carried out, and particularly about how it was communicated to parents.  Was it through the parents' associations or was it through the boards of management?  How did it get to the parents?</p></speech>

We ask every parent who comes into contact with us as an organisation if they would like to go on our contact database.  We now have a contact database of around 7,000 parents of children in primary school.  We send it out through that.</p></speech>

I am a parent of a child in a national school and I sat on a parents' association for a number of years.  We did not have that bit of communication.  I also have a child in secondary school.  There has to be a joining up of the dots.  That is the piece that strengthens Ms Lynch's presentation because she has a document saying that parents have or have not heard.</p></speech>

Communication at second level is tied up in data protection by the boards of management.  Whereas we can get access to the school, we cannot get the boards of management to approve an amendment to the admissions policy allowing us to tick the box on whether people would like their details to be forwarded to the National Parents Council, post-primary.  When it comes to surveys, we are limited to the 700 odd schools and the magnanimity of the principals to forward that survey on to a parent to complete.</p></speech>

The former Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Jan O'Sullivan, is smiling at me.</p></speech>

That is where the communication with the parent comes in.  That is where everybody has a role to play and where everybody can feed back in and have a comment.  As well as asking the questions, one is developing an awareness and engaging the parents, the school and the boards.  One is then bringing it to a higher plane where somebody will eventually take ownership of it.  Having three children myself, I know the weight of the bag is staggering.  It varies from year to year, whether they are second class, fourth class, or whatever.  Schools vary in how they administer it.  On Friday evenings, some children do not bring home their bags. or there is a light bag on a Friday and a light bag going in on a Monday morning.</p><p>It amazes me how some schools cannot engage in the green schools initiative because schoolbags are too heavy for children to walk to school.  It also defeats any initiative for pupils to be physically active.  There have to be simpler solutions such as leaving a set of books in school and having fewer copybooks.  Everything suggested is reasonable and effective.  However, the key is that if we do not address the weight of schoolbags, we cannot get pupils active and fit.  I believe it is falling down owing to the engagement with boards of management.  As I sit on a board of management, I am being critical and observant.  The message is not getting to parents.  Teachers are busy and overworked.  However, in expecting a child to lift a heavy schoolbag every weekday for 38 weeks of the year we are not looking after his or her best welfare and meeting his or her health and safety needs.</p></speech>

Twenty years on since the working group reported on this issue in 1997, I am sure schoolbags have got heavier.  The baseline for musculoskeletal pain must be impacted on by the extra load.  It was stated that prior to the weight of schoolbags becoming an issue, children had reported musculoskeletal pain.  Is it what we used to call "growing pains"?  Obviously, the weight of schoolbags impacts on children.  As a mother of three, I watch them go out the door and wonder if they will make it.  They are like ants falling back.</p> <p>  The link with obesity has been proved and the issue needs to be tackled.  However, there is the double bind of children having too many books to carry.  Could physical education, PE, classes be used to provide training in manual handling?  Parents also need to be shown how best to handle a heavy schoolbag.  E-books will be significant in reducing the weight of schoolbags.  However, research findings were presented last summer on the negative impact of e-books, laptops and iPads on children's developing vision.  We need more information on this.</p> <p>  While it is great to talk about having two sets of books, affordability is an issue.  It costs &euro;800 to send a child to school every year, which figure can be significantly higher in examination years.  For the majority of families, affordability would rule out the luxury of having a double set of books, unless they were subsidised by the State.</p></speech>

We have moved past the issuing of guidelines and it is time to legislate.  I do not care how schools manage to do it.  They just have to do it because it is in the interests of children.  It should be done in conjunction with schools and parents, by providing them with guidelines on how they might reduce the weight of schoolbags.  It would be open to them to decide how the figures we set might be achieved.</p> <p>  With which measurement do we assess which figure is too much weight to carry?  We need this information to legislate and enforce it.  While we could develop guidelines, the legislation and its enforcement are key.  What would be an acceptable level of enforcement?  How would we go about enforcing the legislation?  Should there be, say, an annual spot check in 10% of schools nationally?  Should there be a three-strike rule and then one would be penalised?  Should there be an appeals mechanism?</p> <p>  There should also be a certain onus on parents to purchase a suitable backpack capable of carrying a certain weight, as well as ensuring the weight is distributed properly between the shoulders and the hips to avoid impact on the back.  I am not sure we need to consult parents further to determine if this is a problem.  It is.  We need to consult parents on how they would like to see legislation drafted, how it could be enforced and how they would work with schools to meet the requirements and obligations under such legislation.  I would take a much harder view.  It is our job to legislate.  The issue has been discussed for 20 years.  Obesity is a problem.  There are children in secondary school who are larger than me because they are overweight.  There has to be another way of assessing the matter.  The delegations need to help us to legislate.</p></speech>

Children should be just as much involved in producing guidelines.  While we can work on guidelines for parents and ways of delivering them, children need to be involved too through, say, school projects.  They are innovative and probably have solutions to the problem themselves.  They are the user group that is missing in the debate.</p> <p>  On the baseline for pain, it is a confounding problem when one assesses the level of pain of children.  If one asks any group of children at any point in time if they suffer pain, there is a large prevalence.  When we asked 529 children to identify where they felt pain on a body discomfort chart, they told us.  It is sometimes difficult to tease out what is and is not schoolbag-related pain.  Feeling some pain is not the end of the world for children.  They get on with it and play sports.  They hurt their feet, fall, trip or bang their heads.  We should not get overly anxious about this.  Children suffer some discomfort when they carry schoolbags, but there is no evidence that long-term damage is done to their backs or other parts of their bodies as a result.  Schoolbag carriage tends to be of short duration.  In agreement with research findings from all over the world, we found schoolchildren tended to carry schoolbags for less than ten minutes at a time.  It is not a serious issue, although I understand it is a concern when one sees a child under duress in carrying a bag.</p> <p>  I agree that manual handling should be part of what children learn.  It is done in the workplace and well legislated for.  The difficulty is that children are not employees of the Department of Education and Skills.  As they are not sick either, they are not taken care of by the Department of Health.  The matter falls between two stools.  That said, there is definitely scope to make children more aware and train them to deal with the issue themselves.</p><p>It is also about educating them on the best way to carry their schoolbags.  I am not suggesting for one minute that they carry very heavy loads, but that is not the main issue.  There are many factors involved.  When we looked at and analysed it thoroughly, we found that there would be no merit in recommending a weight guideline.  We will not be able to legislate to impose weight limits, either in absolute terms or relative to the size of the child.  We will not be able to come up with guidelines over which we would be able to stand.</p><p> The idea of having e-books is interesting.  I am aware of a survey that found that there was no significant difference in the weight of the schoolbags of children who attended e-schools, that is, schools that used iPads.  In that sense, e-books are not the answer.  Perhaps the technology is not being used properly, but their use has not made a significant difference.  Furthermore, there is more evidence of musculoskeletal problems arising from technology use than from carrying schoolbags.  Therefore, we need to be very careful in that regard.  We cannot go down the route of scrapping schoolbags and telling children only to use laptops, tablets or iPads because there are proven problems with their use.</p></speech>

If the committee, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, let it be known that serious consideration was being given to the development of legislation, that could be sufficient to focus the attention of all the partners on finding a solution to a problem that is solvable.  Once there was agreement between all of the stakeholders, it would be down to implementation and the monitoring thereof.  I share Dr. Dockrell's concern about legislation, but the threat of it could help to focus minds.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.50" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017012500002#E00400"><p>On working with boards of management to address the issue, at primary level the first thing we need to do is to consider how many books children need.  When we have done this, we can look at boards of management which are ultimately responsible for policies in schools.  All schools have health and safety and risk management policies, the mechanisms through which boards of management can address the issue.  The development of a book list is the responsibility of the class teacher.  As such, class teachers need to be educated on the non-educational implications.  They need to consider issues such as the size of a book when they are drawing up a list for six year olds, for example.  We must look at textbook requirements at primary level and then work with boards of management on the issue.</p> <p>  I would be very cautious about taking the legislative route because if we were enforcing legislation, we would potentially be criminalising people.  Are we going to criminalise the parent or the school teacher?  We spoke about children's responsibilities too.  I am not sure that is the way to go to reduce the weight of schoolbags.  Educating and supporting parents and teachers in making better choices are much better ways to go.  </p> <p>  On a parent's responsibility to ensure his or her child has a suitable backpack, the comments section of our survey showed that some parents were buying very expensive, specially designed, ergonomic backpacks made in Germany.  We must understand the bigger question of the cost of going to school.  While parents have a certain responsibility, specially designed backpacks come at a huge cost and are beyond the financial ability of many parents.  </p> <p>  It is very important that the voices of children are heard on this issue.  We do have mechanisms to survey children, but we just did not have time to do so in advance of this meeting.  There would be no harm in providing manual handling training.  When we asked in our survey if parents or their children would benefit from receiving such training, a number of parents said training was not the issue; they said the sheer weight of the schoolbag relative to the size of the child was the problem.  When one is talking about six or seven year old children, the issue is not how they lift the schoolbag but the fact that it is just too heavy.  While I would not be against providing information on lifting and carrying, the actual weight of schoolbags must be addressed, particularly for very small children.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.51" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1325" speakername="Jan O'Sullivan" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017012500002#E00500"><p>I thank the delegates for their contributions.  Mr. Beddy's idea of gathering the stakeholders together is a good one; it is something the committee should recommend.  I also agree that the school students' unions should be included in that gathering.  In the case of primary school children, obviously the National Parents Council - Primary has access to many parents, but there are also student councils in most schools, in which each class has a representative.  They could provide a mechanism in passing on information to children.</p> <p>  Two of the delegates have said they do not think legislating would be appropriate.  Legislation is being prepared on a parents' and students' charter which might provide a mechanism in dealing with the issue.  It would not involve a punitive legislative system whereby people would be criminalised if their children were carrying heavy schoolbags, but it would involve an enunciation of rights.  Perhaps we might recommend that the appropriateness of the weight of schoolbags be included in the charter.  In that way, we would not be pushing for the drafting of new legislation and would be linking the issue with legislation already promised.  I ask the delegates to comment on this.</p> <p>  Ms Lynch made the point that it might be a question of having fewer books.  One school of which I am aware facilitates the photocopying of pages from books required for homework in order that children can leave their books in lockers in school.  I know that the availability of lockers, particularly in primary schools, is an issue.  That said, most second level schools have facilities which allow students to leave at least some of their books in school.  Perhaps all schools should have such facilities.  I ask the delegates to comment on this.  If students are using a very heavy chemistry or history book, for example, the class teacher could simply photocopy the relevant pages and give them to the students to take home, rather than the heavy book.  I ask for comments on the practicality of doing this.</p> <p>  Dr. Dockrell said carrying a schoolbag could be seen as part of daily activity and that most children only carried a schoolbag for about ten minutes.  Ms Lynch, on the other hand, said many parents would not allow their children to walk to school because their perception was that their schoolbags were too heavy.  I ask Dr. Dockrell to address this issue.  If parents think schoolbags are too heavy, they will not allow their children to walk to school.  As a result, their children will not get exercise.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.52" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1287" speakername="Donnchadh &Oacute; Laoghaire" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017012500002#E00600"><p>I have a number of questions for the delegates.  The issue of carrying technique is interesting, as is the issue of the quality of schoolbags.  Are there minimum standards for schoolbags?  There is a wide variation in quality, but features such as hip straps would make a significant difference in weight distribution.  If there are no minimum standards, should we consider introducing them?  That might have cost implications, but perhaps the State might consider providing a subsidy in the same way as it does for meals, books and school clothing.  Are schoolbags included in the existing school clothing scheme for low-income families?</p><p> In terms of Dr. Dockrell's research, much of the discussion centred on the mean travelling time for students to school, which is approximately ten minutes, but travel time for some children can be much longer than that.  They might have to walk five minutes to the bus stop and on boarding the bus all the seats could be occupied and they might be standing on the bus for another five to ten minutes.  They could be carrying a bag on their back for a period ranging from 15 minutes up to an hour a day.  Were there any outliers that showed that there was a greater incidence of skeletal muscular injury among students who had longer travel trips to school?</p><p> Similar to Deputy O'Sullivan's point, I am conscious that teachers are already under a great deal of pressure in terms of administration, but we should also be talking about the publishers.  It should not be difficult to break up large textbooks into a number of small modules that could be sold together and taken home from school as required.  Often a student will only need to refer to five to 12 pages of a textbook in a particular subject.  That might be the case for five or six subjects and suddenly a student is bringing home 1,000 to 1,200 pages of text, particularly at post-primary school level.  Should the possibility be explored of larger textbooks being sold as a unit that could be separated into modules which could be brought home from school as required?  I take on board the point regarding avoiding an over-reliance on textbooks and I would be interested in that aspect.  That is an educational issue to some extent, aside from the health implications involved, but it is an interesting point.</p><p> Are Mr. Paul Beddy and Ms &Aacute;ine Lynch aware of any schools that have identified models of best practice that they would recommend be followed?  In that context, I note the responses to question five in the questionnaire used in the survey of primary schools show that close to 30% of teachers stagger the homework.  Is that a practice that should be considered, and if there are models of best practice, how can they be incorporated into guidelines?  A great deal of the issues involve relate to the level of homework given.  The 15 year old me could not live with myself if I did not take this opportunity to call for the abolition of homework.</p></speech>

We are taking it a step further and straying into the remit of the Committee on Education and Skills.  I call Deputy Neville to be followed by Deputy Funchion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.55" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1328" speakername="Tom Neville" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017012500002#F00300"><p>Has there been engagement with the book manufacturers on this issue?  As opposed to having a double set of textbooks as was mentioned, would they consider publishing a book in two parts?  I was a post-primary teacher in a past life and I saw students carrying a big chunky textbook, part of which they might not use until they were  halfway through second year but they would have carried it in their bags all through first year.  Similarly, students in primary school might use part of a textbook in third class or fourth class but only certain sections of it would be used at certain times of the year.  In the first half of the year, the first half of the book would be used and in the second half of the year, the second half of the book would be used.  Have there been any discussions with the book manufacturers about manufacturing large textbooks in two or three parts?  To alleviate the cost, the parent could buy the three parts of the textbook together and two parts of it could be stored in the student's locker for six or eight months and the student would only have to carry one part of the book in his or her bag.</p> <p>  As was mentioned by Deputy O'Sullivan, photocopying pages from a textbook is a good idea but it is difficult to organise for students to have that and it is even difficult to organise for adults to have a few pages of a document.  I see that at committee meetings where there is a great deal of printed material. To try to do that for students is a whole different ball game.  There is the matter of the additional workload that would put on teachers and there are also copyright issues around that.  Has there been a discussion on that aspect?    Has there been engagement not so much with the retailers but with the book publishers?  There are procurement agreements in place with retailers and publishers.  They know that in the context of school textbooks there will be return business every year.  It is not as if there is high competition attrition.</p></speech>

Has any research been done on the weight of the schoolbags relative to the level of homework that is given?  Children get far too much homework and I wonder about the benefits of it.  The homework might be limited to a certain period of time and schools might take up that practice.  I am regularly told by my children's school that homework should take no more than 30 minutes to complete, but it takes far longer than that.  If the homework given was limited to one or two subjects per night, that would reduce the number of books a child would have to take home.  Has any research been done on schools that have after-school homework clubs or study clubs, where children leave all their books in the school, and on the possible benefits of that?</p> <p>  I would make two points.  I would take issue with the recommendation about parents buying lightweight backpacks.  One does not often have a choice.  One has to buy whatever backpack the books fit into.  Even at junior infants level, many of the smaller bags one would think would suit a junior infants child do not because the books do not fit  into them.  In terms of children bringing home only the books they need, that is the problem.  They have to bring home too many books because of the level of homework.  If there was a system whereby the amount of homework was limited, that would limit the number of books that would have to be brought home.</p> <p>  I may be being unfair to schools but in my experience I do not know of any school that is proactively trying to address this issue.  I regularly tell my children to ask the teacher the books they can leave out of the bag or else the bag will not be brought to school.  As parents, we have to say that there is no way our children are going to school carrying bags of that weight.  It is crazy.  I have a five year old and a ten year old.  They are not secondary school children but I experience that every almost morning.  This is good work in terms of trying to educate parents but I do not know any parents who are not aware of the issue because they must feel the weight of the bags.  However, parents need to put their foot down, address the issue with the schools and tell them their children will not carry bags with that level of weight and that some compromise has to be found.  Something should be done about the level of homework that is given.  That is a key factor in the weight of the books bring brought home every day.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.58" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1336" speakername="Lisa Chambers" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017012500002#F00700"><p>I wish to ask a follow-up question.  The committee members were provided with a policy advice note that was prepared for the committee.  As part of the background information, we were told that studies conducted around the globe have found that schoolbags should weigh no more than 10% to 15% of a child's body weight.  International studies advise that there should be a weight restriction on schoolbags, which goes against what the witnesses have told us today.  Also a working group that was established here in 1997 recommended that students should not carry in excess of 10% of their body weight.  Our study that was published 20 years ago recommended a weight restriction on schoolbags.</p> <p>  No disrespect is intended but I find this conversation quite frustrating because we are saying that things are not okay, that the weight of the schoolbags is too heavy but I am still no better informed as to what the witnesses want us to do.  What are they recommending?  What do they want us to do?  If they do not want legislation to be introduced and they do not want weight restrictions to apply to schoolbags but they are concerned about the cost of backpacks and additional books for parents, I do not know what we are supposed to do after this meeting to advance the issue.  I would say to Mr. Beddy that suggesting that we should threaten legislation but that we would have no intention of legislating is a very bad road to go down because it undermines the credibility of the work we are trying to do.  What do the witnesses want us to do and how do they want us to do it?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.59" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1261" speakername="Jim Daly" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017012500002#F00800"><p>I have a few brief questions.  I was going to ask the witnesses the same question Deputy Chambers posed.  In the next contributions as they sum up they might advise the direction they would take on this issue.  We as a committee will have to make our call on what we will do afterwards, but what would the witnesses suggest we should do to progress this issue?  They will have noted the frustration Deputy Chambers expressed.  We do not want simply to say that we aired this issue, put it out there, discussed it, left it at that and walked away from it.  We want to be more proactive on it.</p> <p>  Dr. Dockrell referred to employees and to legislation covering the workplace.  Are the witnesses aware of a case of this nature that may have been taken or where the issue of liability arose?  I am not sure where the liability would lie if I as a parent were to take a case against what would ultimately be the school, and I suspect it would be the board of management and not the Department that would be liable.</p><p>That the responsibility does not lie with the Department might suit it.  Do the witnesses have any thoughts on the liability issue?  I think someone compared this to the Army deafness claims in that there could be a raft of students claiming that they were made to carry excessive weight.  If it happened in the workplace, there would be a liability.</p><p> I jocosely mentioned Michael O'Leary and how he, given his track record, would be the man to bring down the weight of bags.  We need to see schools being more proactive and showing more awareness.  We can have the debate about introducing legislation afterwards, but every time we walk onto a plane we have to put our bags into a thing.  If there was one of them with a weighing scales in every school and children were encouraged to throw their bags up on it to see the weight of the bags, it would create awareness and conversations would start.  This goes back to an earlier question.  Are the witnesses aware of any examples of good practice in schools or has any parent highlighted any such example?</p><p> My final comments relate to what is happening in Iceland where, on schoolbags days, occupational therapists visit schools.  They talk to the children about the weight of schoolbags and how to carry them correctly.  This again goes back to creating awareness.  Iceland reports that it does not have an issue with excessive weight.  The matter is mentioned periodically but it is not an issue in Iceland because of these schoolbag days.  I would be grateful to the witnesses for their thoughts on those matters.  As Deputy Lisa Chambers stated, perhaps the witnesses would focus on suggestions to the committee and then we, as a committee, can make our call on it.</p><p> I know there was a lot in that.  I call Dr. Dockrell.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.61" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Sara Dockrell" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/CYJ2017012500002#G00200"><p>Starting with the Chairman's last point, I agree wholeheartedly about raising awareness among children, in particular, who are very receptive to advice that they are given, especially in primary school.  I would advocate a structured awareness raising and education campaign.  This is not just about teaching them how to lift and so on but about the risk assessment, that is, all the different factors that contribute to it.  Give them the knowledge and let them, their parents and their teachers decide.  We need a lot of different people involved in the process and I agree wholeheartedly that publishers should be involved.  We would suggest that a bag should fit the child.  In other words, it needs to be the size of the child's back.  It does not need to be down sort of at their bottom because that interferes with how they walk.  Anthropometric measurements will tell us, for instance, how long children's backs are generally and a junior infants book should not be much bigger because it will not fit in a schoolbag that would be suitable for a junior infants child.  There is a lot of scope.  There are a wide range of stakeholders, including the children, their parents, teachers, various boards, representative councils, student councils, health professionals, schoolbag designers, manufacturers, retailers and publishers.  They all need to be included in the discussion to break down the problem into manageable processes.</p> <p>  We need to have a proactive approach.  Being heavy handed is not the way to go.  People respond better to proactive health promotion.  They respond better when they understand what they are being asked to do and the reasons behind it.  I do not think that introducing legislation to say that something should or should not be done is the way to go.</p> <p>  Coming back to the point about weight limits, there is research that states that schoolbag limits should not be any more than 10% of the child's body weight, but the same amount of alternative research states that that is not the case.  It is a difficult one to call, which is why most of the recent research, including our own, emphasises that we should not hang our hats on the schoolbag weight limit, but rather we should consider it in the context of all manner of other issues.  As I stated, I am not suggesting for a minute that we should expect children to carry excessively heavy loads, but carrying a weight on one's back is not necessarily a problem.  That has been identified in a lot of research.  It changes our posture and we say that children are bent forwards when they carry, but that is fine.  We all bend forwards when we sit, but we do not stop children from sitting.  They carry a bag for ten minutes or so every day but they sit for hours every day, yet we do not say that they should not sit for long periods.  However, that is another story.  They should not sit for long periods.</p> <p>  On duration of carriage, I was asked about the length of time children carried their bags and I said it was less than ten minutes.  In fact, we know that the children did not carry their bags for very long periods of time because during our study we collected objective data and our survey was researcher assisted.  The questions were asked by the researcher one on one with the children, so when they said how long it took them to walk, we quizzed them on where they lived and how far away that was.  We therefore got them to give us the most accurate answer they could give.</p> <p>  It is interesting that people say they will not allow their children to walk to school.  Many parents state they must drive their children to school because the schoolbag is too heavy, but we found that the weight of the schoolbags of children who travelled by car were not significantly different from the weight of the schoolbags of the children who walked to school.  It is interesting when viewed from that perspective.</p> <p>  Summing up, the idea of a parents' and children's charter, where we raise the issue in a strong way, is a great one.  There is definitely scope for us to plan perhaps further research into what can be done, but awareness campaigns to date have been minimal.  It was mentioned that flyers have been sent around and so forth, but we need to take it further.  We need more research and we need to involve the children, the teachers and the parents in the research.  If we get them involved in that way, it will become a much more live issue for them.  It will also allow them the opportunity to reflect on what can be done and perhaps not look just at the one issue of the schoolbag weight but to look at it in the context of all the other factors.</p></speech>

In response to Deputy Lisa Chambers, this would not be the first time the State has threatened to legislate for something if what it is asking someone to do is not done.  In this particular instance, there is a frustration after 18 years which might prompt someone to phrase something like that.  I think the capacity exists within the stakeholders to come up with implementable solutions that everyone accepts.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Sullivan's suggestion about the parents' and students' charter is a good one.  I will meet representatives of many south Dublin schools this evening to discuss that particular topic, so it will be timely to add this matter to the discussion.  On the general question of research and the soundings and feelings we have taken about books and making them smaller from publishers etc., it has all been done and is available.  Everyone has had their say.  What is missing is the process of getting all these people together.  For example, I can tell Deputy Neville that there is a company which has been established for a couple of years in Ireland that provides a way of splitting schoolbooks into two or three parts and allows them to be reattached later.</p> <p>  Getting the message across has been poor, as has its implementation.  Deputy &Oacute; Laoghaire mentioned schoolbags at second level.  We have very little control over that issue because what they carry on their backs is substantially dictated by what is fashionable.  As a parent, what we think they should wear is not always what we can get them to wear.  Then again, the responsibility lies with the parents.</p> <p>  The process begins by bringing the stakeholders together.  If we have a statement from this committee on it, we can, in conjunction with the Department of Education and Skills, put a process in place that includes all the stakeholders and tell them bluntly that 18 years on, we have not seen much progress.</p><p>If we cannot come up with a process for implementation that we all agree on, I am afraid the State might just legislate.  As we said we are expressing outline reservations over going down that road.  We are quite a mature society now; it is not beyond us to sort it and implement it.</p></speech>

I think it is more about setting the relationship between parents and children in schools.  The parent-student charter should be drafted so that it can deal with the weight of schoolbags or any other issue that comes in.  However, if it becomes a list, it will dampen the impact of such a charter.</p> <p>  The issue of photocopying of pages comes up quite regularly from parents.  They buy a schoolbook and then have to pay to have the pages photocopied to be sent home as well.  Parents often get a yearly charge for photocopying.  As a practical solution, at one level it works, but how it is implemented can cause frustration for parents.  It comes back to the point that it is very hard to look at weight without looking at other issues as well.  It has been mentioned a few times around the homework issue.  We are about to embark on research with the NCCA on what the nature of homework should be in primary years.</p> <p>  Deputy Lisa Chambers asked what we were looking for.  At primary level we are clearly stating that we are looking for a view on how much textbooks are needed and relied on; that is it.  If we muddy the waters with weights, costs or what homework should look like, we keep missing the point.  We raise it at every opportunity we can, not just for the weight of schoolbags or the cost of schoolbags, but the educational benefit for children as well.</p> <p>  The curriculum at primary level is set for a certain type of learning; that is experiential learning, learning in groups and experiencing the subject, starting where the learner is at.  Those things do not tend to go towards textbook-type learning.  Whereas certain textbooks may be needed at primary level, the question is whether we need as many as we have.  Rather than keep talking about the cost, we need to start talking about what is required for children's education at primary level in order for them to have the best education they can have.</p> <p>  Parents often tell us that they buy quite heavy and expensive books, but that only a fraction of them are used.  These are the kinds of issues we need to address.  If we just concentrate on one particular problem with a textbook, we may not finish up with the right answer.  That is the most direct way I can answer the question of what we are looking for.</p> <p>  There is no minimum standard for schoolbags.  It is very much up to a parent and child.  They can bring them in a carrier bag if they want to.  I agree with Mr. Beddy that the concentration on the current fashion with bags has a huge part to play.  The survey asked parents about waist straps.  Very few parents responded that they had backpacks with waist straps.  There are no standards or even recommendations.  Parents do not get a list of the types of things they should think of when buying a school bag and cost also comes into it.</p> <p>  Is there too much homework and is the level of homework correct?  We need to look again at the type of homework.  We would argue that when children are learning at home it gives a much richer environment to the classroom environment.  Children do not have to sit behind a desk; they can learn in different styles.  However, children's homework still tends to go along the lines of siting at a table, looking at a book and learning in that way.  So if children do not learn particularly well using that style, they are not given other opportunities to learn or to learn within the rich environment outside the classroom.  The type of homework needs to be looked at and that would impact on whether a child needs a textbook at home to do the homework.</p> <p>  On examples of good practice, in Ireland it is very teacher-specific, meaning that each teacher decides their own booklist.  Some teachers might have a very small booklist, with just a reader on it.  It does not mean that they are infants, or fifth or sixth class; it might just be their style of teaching to the curriculum.  Because it is so teacher-specific, there are excellent examples of good practice with some teachers and then there are other teachers who are very reliant on the textbook.  The NCCA's own review of the curriculum at primary level and other reports would indicate that textbooks can be linked to teacher confidence in subject areas, particularly when it comes to science and other areas.  Reports indicate that much of children's science learning is done from a textbook rather than experiential learning within the classroom.  That can be linked in certain cases to teacher confidence.</p> <p>  Given that there are so many issues relating to textbooks, looking at the weight in isolation may be missing the larger point.</p></speech>

I understand the point about fashion and the rest of it.  While some may choose to take things in a carrier bag, nonetheless items are sold in shops as schoolbags.  I see no reason for not having minimum standards there.  For example, many of the hurling helmets that were fashionable when I was a teenager cannot be bought anymore because they were not safe enough.  There are minimum standards under the EU and all the rest of it.  If we were to have minimum standards here, it would make a difference.  I think the thickness and distribution of weight are important, and should not be ruled out.</p></speech>

I believe the Chairman mentioned it.  We have a schoolbag policy guide and the parents' associations in conjunction with school management at a number of schools have issued policy guidelines.  What is missing from nearly everybody's thinking is addressing the textbooks themselves.  We do not want to issue national guideline policies without more engagement with the publishers.  It is actually giving in to the fact that the weight of the book is the weight of the book or the question of providing split books.  The short answer is that there are schoolbag policy guidelines and some schools implement what they have come up with as their own local policy.</p></speech>

There are a number of features of the water sector in Ireland that are relevant in this context.  The nature of our topography and population dispersal means we have an extensive number of small, mainly surface water sources, rather than single large aquifers which can be the case in other countries.  The evolution of water services in rural areas has been largely dependent on private or group water investment.  Thus, the public water utility, Irish Water, is not the exclusive provider of water services but provides drinking water to 83% of the population and wastewater services to 64% of the population.  Therefore, from a broader perspective, water policy seeks to ensure the appropriate stewardship of all of the nation's water resources and that all citizens have access to quality drinking water across a sector that has multiple stakeholders and varying ownership and delivery structures.  That being said, the majority of citizens receive water services from Irish Water, the State's public water utility, and the concerns raised regarding potential privatisation of water services are focused on Irish Water.</p> <p>  A key principle in addressing the fragmentation within the system and bringing delivery and strategic planning into a single water utility was that this would be a public utility, that is, a State body in public ownership.  The objective of moving from a system of water services delivery by 34 water services authorities towards a single utility approach was to achieve economies of scale, greater efficiency and more effective long-term strategic planning.  This approach is further underpinned by the confidence and supply agreement agreed between the Government and Fianna F&aacute;il in the context of supporting a minority Government, which reflects a commitment to retain Irish Water as a single national water utility in public ownership, responsible for the delivery of water and wastewater services.</p> <p>  In my experience, having worked in this area for a number of years, the strong policy intent has always been to maintain public water services in public ownership.  This was already reflected in the Water Services Act 2007 and in transferring functions from local authorities to Irish Water in 2013, the protections in that Act against the alienation of public water assets were carried forward into the new arrangements.  Nonetheless, concerns have been raised that the reform process initiated in 2011 could lead to the future privatisation of water services.  Recognising these concerns, the previous Government twice legislated on the issue of public ownership of water services to give further protections.  The Water Services Act 2013 places a clear prohibition on the shareholders of Irish Water, namely, the Ministers for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and Finance as well as the board of Ervia, from alienating their shares in the utility.</p> <p>  Subsequently, in 2014, the Government introduced a further safeguard through the Water Services Act 2014.  Arising from this Act, were a situation ever to arise where any privatisation or part-privatisation of Irish Water was to be contemplated through alienation of any share in Irish Water to anyone other than another Minister, this could not occur without three specific actions.  First, both Houses of the Oireachtas would have to pass a resolution approving such a proposal.  Second, a majority of voters in a plebiscite would have to give their approval to the proposal.  Third, the Minister would then have to initiate legislation to privatise Irish Water or alienate any share held by the Government.  Existing legislation, therefore, already provides a statutory prohibition on the privatisation of Irish Water and sets out a range of steps that would need to be taken in the event that the statutory prohibition involved was to be removed.</p> <p>  The provisions on the plebiscite reflected in the 2014 legislation were brought forward as an alternative to a constitutional provision in the light of concerns at the time regarding potential unintended consequences of such a provision.  They also reflected the fact that the operations of State structures are usually described in legislation approved by the Oireachtas, rather than in the fundamental legal document of the State.  However, in the intervening period, Opposition Deputies published four similar Bills proposing a constitutional amendment to enshrine public ownership of the water system in the Constitution.  The Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government has informed the D&aacute;il that he is open to considering workable proposals that provide the necessary certainty regarding the future public ownership of Irish Water.</p> <p>  On 9 November 2016, the D&aacute;il debated one of these Bills, the Thirty-fifth Amendment of the Constitution (Water in Public Ownership) (No. 2) Bill 2016.  The Bill passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il on 9 November 2016 and has been referred to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for Committee Stage.  While the Government did not oppose the Bill, the Minister indicated that, due to the complexity of issues involved in any potential constitutional protection, he reserves his position to propose a Government amendment to the wording on Committee Stage.</p> <p>  The Minister has stressed the need for the legal and technical issues to be carefully teased out during the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill.  He and the Department are fully committed to assisting the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in this endeavour.  Among the issues to be considered in drafting a constitutional amendment are wording challenges arising owing to the range of categories of infrastructural ownership, achieving balance between principles reflected in the Constitution and the more detailed policy to be reflected in legislation, and addressing the risk of unintended consequences.  Issues around the wording of any amendment also arise from the plurality of water infrastructure ownership categories.  These include private bore holes, private group water schemes, private group schemes that are sourcing water from the public network and water infrastructure located on privately owned land.  There are also issues to be considered around the potential for unintended consequences that could impinge on individuals' rights to private property.</p> <p>  As I indicated, the Bill has been referred to the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  In parallel, the Department is working with the Office of the Attorney General on the issues arising to provide advice to the Minister and Government as the Bill progresses through the Oireachtas and possibly bringing forward amendments to address some of the issues I have outlined.  I trust this clarifies the position and I will be pleased to respond to questions.</p></speech>

My function is to deal with the constitutional amendment which is in the Committee Stage phase.  I am here to explain the reasons the amendment is necessary in view of public concern about the possible privatisation of water and to give such detail, as is appropriate, on the placing of the particular amendment to the Constitution in the article in which it is proposed to insert it.  This is the article dealing with the Government position on possible privatisation.</p><p>I will read the amendment into the record, in both languages.  The proposed amendment is to the Schedule to the Bill which as pointed out by Ms Graham is awaiting Committee Stage consideration.  I note Ms Graham has also said that the Minister may want to bring forward other amendments on Committee Stage, which I appreciate.  I am grateful to Ms Graham for alerting us to that possibility.  However, any such proposals could only be a watering down of the existing proposal.  The amendment is to be inserted into Article 28 as Article 28.4.3 of the Constitution, which will displace two of the existing Articles.  The text of the proposed amendment to the Constitutions reads:</p><blockquote>3&deg; Beidh an Rialtas go l&eacute;ir le ch&eacute;ile freagrach as an gc&oacute;ras uisce poibl&iacute; a chosaint, a bhainist&iacute; agus a chothabh&aacute;il.  Cuirfidh an Rialtas in &aacute;irithe, ar mhaithe le leas an phobail, gur faoi &uacute;in&eacute;ireacht phoibl&iacute; agus faoi bhainist&iacute; phoibl&iacute; a fhanfaidh an acmhainn sin.<br /><br />3&deg; The Government shall be collectively responsible for the protection, management and maintenance of the public water system.  The Government shall ensure in the public interest that this resource remains in public ownership and management.</blockquote><p>The Right2Water campaign has obtained legal advice, mainly from myself, on the adequacy and correctness of the proposed amendment.  As a proposal, I stand over it.  <br/><br/>With the permission of the Chairman, I would like to comment briefly on Ms Graham's submission, but in my concluding remarks if that is helpful.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.99" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. S&eacute;amas &Oacute; Tuathail" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FFJ2017012500002#D00300"><p>I am grateful to Ms Graham for her presentation but there are one or two comments I would like to make on it which may be of assistance.<br/><br/>As members of the committee will have already seen my submission to the committee, I do not propose to read it in its entirety into the record, although I stand over it.  The are three issues which I would like to address: the appropriateness of providing constitutional protection, which has been a motivating factor in the campaign to include this amendment in the Constitution; the adequacy of the protections currently provided by existing legislation, including the Water Services Act 2013 and the Water Services Act 2014, in regard to the possible disposal of Irish Water, which Ms Graham has addressed, and the risk of unintended consequences of any constitutional protection, including in regard to water supplies owned by individuals and groups.  I come from a part of the country where people's water is obtained from wells or a group water scheme.  B'fh&eacute;idir go bhfuil an Cathaoirleach sa ch&aacute;s c&eacute;anna sa Spid&eacute;al.  I am aware that neither private wells nor group water schemes were discussed much during the political campaign which preceded the imposition of Irish Water some years ago.<br/><br/>I will deal first with the importance of access to water, which is covered in paragraph 1 of my submission.  Different parts of the world have had experience of water shortage and with privatisation of water.  In this regard, I mentioned the recent experiences of the city of Detroit and the State of Michigan.  In regard to privatisation, the adequacy of existing protection is provided for in the Water Services Act 2007, the Water Services Act 2013, the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 and the Water Services Act 2014.  There have been changes to all those Acts, as people familiar with them will know.  The Water Services Act 2013 created the vessel to which functions created for water authorities - the local authorities - under the Water Services Act 2007 could transfer.  This vessel was established in the form of a company, now a designated purpose company limited by shares under the Companies Act 2014.  This new company would be a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is &Eacute;ireann, now Ervia, and would be called Irish Water.  It was prescribed that the memorandum and articles of Irish Water would comply with this Act.  The legislation also provides the legal basis for Irish Water to install and maintain water meters in dwellings.<br/><br/>The Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides primarily for the transfer of functions and property from the water authorities which were provided for in the 2007 Act to Irish Water under sections 7 and 10, respectively.  Provision was also made under that Act that Irish Water would be empowered to charge for water.  The Water Services Act 2014 was enacted to provide for the statutory requirement of a plebiscite on any proposal to go before either House of the Oireachtas under which the shareholding of Ervia would be transferred from the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance.  The Act also provides for a cap on water charges, a grant and, <i>inter alia</i>, the establishment of a public forum on water.  <br/><br/>I would like now to deal with the statutory prohibition on the alienation of the shareholding in Irish Water derived from the aforementioned Acts.  The share capital of Irish Water is valued at &euro;1 million, divided into 50,000 A shares of 0.1 cent each and 50,000 B shares of 0.01 cent each.  Section 5 of the 2013 Act provides that the shareholding of Irish Water will be divided among Ervia, the Minister for the Environment, Community and Local Government and the Minister for Finance, with one share with voting rights going to Ervia and the remainder being divided between the two Ministers, with no voting rights.  Initially, there was no prohibition on the alienation of the shares only.  In other words, Ervia could not alienate its share without the consent of the two Ministers.  This was changed by way of amendment of section 46 of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 to provide that neither Ervia nor the two Ministers could alienate their shareholding.  Section 2 of the 2014 Act provides that a public plebiscite must be passed in favour of selling the shareholding of Irish Water before a Bill allowing for such could be enacted into law.  The constitution of Irish Water - the memorandum and articles of association - under the Companies Act 2014 reflects the statutory prohibition on the alienation of shares and plebiscite requirement, as it must be in keeping with water services legislation.  However, and this is the point I want the committee to note, both the requirement of non-alienation of shares - the Ministerial shares - and the requirement of a plebiscite can be removed by subsequent amending legislation of the D&aacute;il.  This means that statutory protection of the shareholding can be undone by the consent of current or future Governments by way of support for a vote in that regard by the D&aacute;il.  Hence, the concern of the Right2Water campaign that the privatisation of what are now public water supplies could proceed at some future time.  Of greater concern are the wide powers given to Irish Water under its own memorandum of association in terms of disposing of assets via the transfer of assets under contract to private interests.</p><p>Also, borrowing against the asset means that the assets can be taken legally in satisfaction of a debt.  Only ministerial approval is required for the exercise of some, though not all, of those powers.  I will depart slightly from the point to mention that we already have a history in this respect.  We have seen the privatisation of Telecom &Eacute;ireann.  We have seen, with European law, the removal of waste services from public councils around the country, and we have seen sky-high bills going out to people for the collection of the bin on the side of the road.  This is a real fear.  This is what the water campaign wishes to stress.<br/><br/>I agree that existing protections in terms of possible events are wholly inadequate.  The only act that is prohibited under statute and in the memorandum of association of Irish Water is the alienation of the share capital, which is only valued at &euro;1 million in total.  The requirement of a plebiscite is a statutory requirement.  These requirements can be undone by the consent of a Government with a majority in D&aacute;il &Eacute;ireann using statutory amendments to remove them.  This is not to say that we are in any fear of a D&aacute;il vote in that direction, but the possibility is there as an issue of simple legality and laws of the Oireachtas.<br/><br/><b></b>I mentioned that previous Governments have sold shareholdings in various former public sector companies, which have in certain cases resulted in detrimental consequences for the public.  I give the example there of the Eircom sale.  That sale gave rise to a serious lack of investment in key technological infrastructure, and hindered greatly investment by industry into areas of the country not supported by broadband, but in dire need of job creation.  I could add, perhaps, Aer Lingus to that list.  I have mentioned Telecom &Eacute;ireann and the privatisation of bin collection.  I will go ahead from that to deal with the appropriateness of constitutional protection, which is one of the main excuses that I have to be here today.</p></speech>

I say that the Constitution is the appropriate mechanism to ensure that provision of water is protected from privatisation into the future.  It is clear that it is for the people, who are sovereign under the Constitution, to decide whether they wish to amend their Constitution in this manner, on a critical matter of public policy, which is of grave public concern.</p> <p>  I would like to say a few words on the issue of private wells and group water schemes.  Private wells and group water schemes are clearly distinguishable from the public water system.  If group water schemes were part of the public water system, there would be no need for a provision for the transfer of ownership, in order for them to become part of the public system, by being taken in charge, voluntarily or otherwise.  Their privately held assets and associated rights are also protected under Articles 40 and 43 of the Constitution, dealing with property rights, and the same principles apply to private water infrastructure in dwellings and commercial buildings as they are equally privately owned.</p> <p>  Finally, I will come back to Ms Graham's point as I read and heard it.  I have the highest regard for Ms Graham's contribution.  She has said that the nature of our topography and population dispersal means that we have an extensive number of small, mainly surface water sources, rather than single large aquifers, which can be the case in other countries.  The Geological Survey of Ireland is a State body.  I can recall some years ago being told that there is a huge aquifer on the border between Dublin and Kildare which could supply Dublin's industrial and domestic needs for 30 years.  That is my own sense and experience of this matter.  The aquifers and that position should be examined and the Irish Geological Survey should readily and probably have already published that information.</p> <p>  Ms Graham is pointing out in terms of privatisation that both Houses of the Oireachtas would have to pass a resolution approving such a proposal.  I agree with Ms Graham on that, but again point to concern for the people who are worried about their domestic water supply being taken into private ownership.  A majority of voters in a plebiscite would have to give their approval to the proposal.  The Minister would then have to initiate legislation to privatise Irish Water or alienate any share held by the Government.  I do not entirely agree with that, given the structure that exists at the minute, but the way to deal with that fear is to support the constitutional amendment proposed by Deputy Joan Collins.</p> <p>  Finally, Ms Graham has quite honestly pointed out that the Minister reserves his position to propose a Government amendment to the wording on Committee Stage.  That threat is there.  I should perhaps not call it a threat, but that possibility is there.  It would not be mentioned by Ms Graham if there was not some reality to it.  Finally, issues around the wording of an amendment also arise with water infrastructure ownership categories, and these include private boreholes, private group water schemes, private group schemes that are sourcing water from the public network or water infrastructure located on privately owned land.  None of those four categories, in my submission, would be affected by the proposed amendment to the Constitution.  That amendment - and I will use a phrase borrowed from the recent swearing in of the newly elected American President - is aimed at preserving, protecting and defending the public right to water, as heretofore we have enjoyed it.

I too am disappointed that Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail is not able to deliver his contribution in Irish, but such is the technical nature of this room, with the equipment that is in it.  I appreciate the commentary that he and Ms Graham provided.  I want to make one point which has been made already, but I believe that it should be given an airing, and that is that the committee is currently engaged in replication of another committee's work and I would imagine that the witnesses here will be invited before that committee as well.  It is a replication of all of our work and I want to make that point from the start.  I appreciate the legal opinion expressed, particularly given that it has come from someone with such extensive experience as Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail.</p><p>The wording of the Bill presented by Deputy Joan Collins appears to be very straightforward.  However, one must always bear in mind the unintended consequence of good intentions in terms of what has occurred in the past, particularly regarding other amendments to the Constitution.  Our legal guest has rightly pointed out two clear and obvious issues regarding the existing legislative protections for the protection of ownership of water infrastructure.  The first is that in the event of this country becoming bankrupt at a given point in the future with off-balance sheet lending versus Irish Water, as he rightly pointed out, there would have to be an asset transfer in order to repay the debt.  I fully accept that point, which is fairly obvious to everybody concerned.  The second concerns the whim of a Government, but it has been expressed by every political party and none that there is no desire to privatise the utility of Irish Water or the assets of that utility because they are in the ownership of the State.  The Minister has reserved the right to amend and that is appropriate.  Does Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail agree that if some unintended consequence is discovered in the course of this process, particularly when it goes to the Attorney General's office at some point in the future, this provision is important?  Does he accept that a constitutional issue could arise as a result of the deliberations that take place in the Houses of the Oireachtas and the Department?</p></speech>

I will not go into any other controversies but unintended consequences can be dealt with through subsequent referenda.  Here we have a public that has been battered by the bank crisis and various privatisations that have gone wrong for them in many respects.  The public is simply asking for the reassurance of being allowed to vote on the matter.  The referendum must be carried under Article 47 if it is to be successful.  We are not dealing with the whim of a future Government.  We are dealing with the worries of the current population.</p></speech>

My question related to the prospect of an unintended consequence arising.  In Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail's legal opinion, is it not appropriate that the Minister would reserve the right to amend a proposed amendment to the Constitution before it is put to the people?</p></speech>

It would be appropriate to do this on Committee Stage of any legislation.  We have had experience in the transfer of assets and sometimes it is not as clear as it might seem on the face of it in terms of what is the public water system and what is not.  This is a matter for debate.  Obviously, there are other groups such as the National Federation of Group Water Schemes that would also have a view on that aspect.<br/><br/>I draw members' attention to section 31(12)(<i>a</i>) of the 2007 Act which basically states that a water services authority shall not enter into any agreement or arrangement with another person for the provision of water services which involves the transfer of the assets or infrastructure.  That was the protection I spoke about.  I know the later ones tend to refer to shares but this is the one that concerns the protection of the assets.  I just wanted to clarify that point.</p></speech>

The only other question I have concerns the potential for impact on private schemes or private water supplies.  One of the nuggets of information derived from Irish Water, the Department and others has been that there are a number of privately owned water supply systems that are sourced from the public supply.  As far as I am aware, they are part of group schemes they are paying into, but I am not aware of there being any payments to the State.  From a legal perspective, in terms of the continued supply, is it possible for the State to continue to supply water to a private scheme that, as far as I am aware, is not paying for its water other than for the provision of the pipes it has put in because the source is from the State but the scheme is private?</p></speech>

There are two types of schemes - those with their own private source and their own private network and those which purchase the public water from the public utility, having previously done so from the local authority and then owned the network.  They would also receive capital funding and subsidy from the State but at a lesser level which reflects the fact that they have a different cost structure.  There are provisions for the takeover of such schemes but as this reform has gone on, and we are looking at the rural water sector, some of these would have fallen into abeyance.  What we have found is that some schemes that were group water schemes no longer have committees.  The landscape is complicated.</p></speech>

Those fears are not exclusive to Right2Water.  I think everybody around this table from all parties and none all agree that Irish Water should be kept in public ownership.  Fianna F&aacute;il certainly agrees that this should be the case, which is why we were prepared to support Deputy Joan Collins's Bill with the amendment that has been read out.  We would have supported it had it been opposed.  It is also reflected in the supply and confidence agreement.</p> <p>  I want to clarify one or two points.  I agree that legislation can be changed by any future Government so legislative protection is not the level of protection we envisage for Irish Water.  A constitutional amendment is appropriate and is the right direction to go.  Ms Graham referred to the alienation of assets, which the 2007 Act prevented.  My understanding of some of the information I read - perhaps I did not read it slowly enough or did not give enough time to it - is that this Act was overruled by the later legislation which does not prevent the alienation of assets.  If that is the case, the legislative protection is a joke because all that is prevented in the alienation of shares - about &euro;100 million - whereas the valuable assets can be freely transferred.  Irish Water was set up in certain way with the intention that it would be able to pass the EUROSTAT test and be able to borrow off balance sheet so that the borrowings of Irish Water would not be reflected in the State's debts.  It has failed the EUROSTAT test and, in my opinion, there is no possibility in the foreseeable future that it will pass it.</p><p>Would it not be a better solution to remove Irish Water from the status of semi-State company and turn it into some sort of agency of the State?  That would obviate the need for a constitutional referendum and all of the unintended consequences that might ensue therefrom.  If we pass a constitutional referendum along the lines Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail outlined, will that in any way prevent Irish Water entering into public private partnership arrangements or hiring private contractors to do some of its work?</p></speech>

The provisions of the 2007 Act were carried forward.  As such, the functions of water services authorities, which had been local authorities, became the functions of Irish Water under the No. 2 Act of 2013.  The provision on the protection of assets remains in place except that one reads "Irish Water" instead of "local authority" into the legislation.  The ownership structure and funding model for Irish Water are two different issues.  It is a State company.  It was set up to be a wholly-owned State company and there are many examples of State companies getting State funding notwithstanding their establishment as companies.  As such, that issue is not related to how it was to be funded.  It is set up as a company but that establishment is under statute.  All of the protections under statute are associated with its accountability to the Oireachtas and the Minister and it is covered by the code of practice applying to all State bodies irrespective of their statutory form.  That is the point I make in response to the question.  Obviously, Irish Water is accountable to the State for any State funding it gets in whatever form it is going and whichever Minister is accountable for it.</p></speech>

I am not disagreeing totally with Ms Graham in this matter either.  The powers which had been provided under statute for the water authorities under section 31 of the 2007 Act would not seem to have been transferred and were deleted.  Section 7(2) of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that references to a water services authority under the 2007 Act in so far as they relate to functions transferred under the No. 2 Act would be construed as references to Irish Water.  I concluded from that that references to a water services authority in section 31 of the 2007 Act remain as references to local authorities.</p></speech>

I reiterate the point I heard from Deputy O'Dea that I am not aware of any political party or Independent, elected or otherwise, that is in favour of the privatisation of Irish Water or its resources.  It is important to record that.  I look forward to debating Deputy Collins's Bill.  Many colleagues here are members of the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government and I urge this committee to provide that one with a remit to do the heavy lifting and technical analysis on the Bill before reporting back here.  It could be helpful to this committee in its work.  I ask for permission on that.</p> <p>  With regard to the contribution of Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail, it seemed to me that a lot of it was based on fear, concern and lack of trust and he even mentioned the word "threat" as well.  That is fair enough from his perspective, but it is important to state the following.  Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail mentioned the sale of a lot of semi-States including Telecom &Eacute;ireann and others where lessons have been learned.  The previous Government did not sell ESB Networks, which may be the most profitable semi-State in the country, during Ireland's worst economic crisis.  If it did not sell that then, there was clearly no privatisation agenda.  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail if his fears are really that legitimate given the experience of the previous Government.</p> <p>  While the legislation introducing the triple lock mechanism to protect the public ownership of Irish Water went far enough as far as I am concerned, it is obvious that others do not agree.  I ask Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail for further information and views on that.  The triple lock mechanism requires any change in respect of shares in water resources to be approved by both Houses of the Oireachtas, a majority plebiscite of the people require legislation.  To me that seems strong but obviously it is not strong enough for Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail and the Right2Water network.  I would like to hear an expansion of his view in that regard.</p> <p>  I agree with Deputy Alan Farrell.  Irrespective of how qualified he or she may be, no one legislates perfectly.  That is why we have an Oireachtas to analyse and scrutinise legislation.  While I understand Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail's cynicism towards the Minister where he said that he might water down the legislation Deputy Collins has brought forward, I ask him whether he recognises that any Minister of the day reserves the right to amend legislation to ensure first and foremost that it is constitutional and that Ministers must take advice from the Office of the Attorney General.  He might clarify his position on that.  It is a function of all Deputies and Senators as legislators and policy makers to scrutinise legislation to ensure as far as possible that it is constitutional.  No matter how perfect we feel we are, none of us can claim at all times that our legislation is perfect.</p></speech>

It is the people who have given the Constitution to themselves.</p><p>There is widespread concern about the possible privatisation of water.  Then the question is, and I do not know the answer, why not test that concern by holding a referendum and seeing whether a simple majority are in favour of that view, or for any other view, under Article 47.  Unfortunately, in terms of the language used about fear, concern and even possible threats, anybody living in Ireland has seen the marches and campaigns by people worried about the cost of this measure, and they are dealing with other costs coming down the track from the recent past.  </p></speech>

Yes, fear exists but it may not always be legitimate.  It may be stoked up.  I recognise that there may be an element of scaremongering.  It is fair where people have a genuine fear.  The work of this committee is to get to the facts of the matter.  We want to see what legislation protects and reassures people with these fears.  That is what I am trying to get at, Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail.</p></speech>

There is a consensus that the Constitution overbears statutory requirements and that statutory requirements in the various Acts can be altered in the D&aacute;il.  Therefore, the general public possibly have a right, certainly in a constitutional referendum campaign, to make the decision.  The people who are for or against the privatisation of water services do not make the decision.  The general public do so when they vote in a referendum.  That is the purpose of the amendment tabled by Deputy Joan Collins.</p></speech>

If there is a majority in the D&aacute;il to carry a vote for a referendum then so be it and if there is not then so be it.

Whether one agrees, disagrees or wonders if it is possible, identifying them is useful.  The first mechanism is to sell the share capital of Irish Water as an entity.  The second mechanism is to prevent the assets underneath the share capital being transferred or borrowed against and leading to Irish Water ending up as a shell company.  We need to establish here that there is inadequate protection, as things currently stand, for either of those vehicles of privatisation.   </p> <p>  My questions are for Ms Graham.  She said: "The Water Services Act 2013 places a clear prohibition on the shareholders of Irish Water from alienating their shares in the utility."

We are working with the Attorney General's office on those kinds of issues in preparation for the beginning of scrutiny by the other Oireachtas committee.

Even though ownership was not part of the group's original terms of reference it has made a recommendation for us to consider.  It is in that context that we are having this discussion.  I agree with Deputy Alan Farrell and Senator Paudie Coffey that our job is not to get into the detail of the legislation but to deal with the principle of whether there should be constitutional protection.  That is what we have been asked to consider.</p> <p>  It is also important to remember that significant parts of the public water service delivery system have already been privatised.  We already have a very significant number of design-build and design-build-operate treatment plants and the Government is tied into those contracts, at a cost, for periods of between 15 and 25 years.  That is an important part of our deliberations.  </p> <p>  I had expected more from Ms Graham's presentation about the basis upon which the Department believes there are wording challenges or unintended consequences.  That is not in her submission.  Is it the Government's view that private bore holes, private group water schemes or privately owned land on which public water infrastructure sits is part of the public water system or could be considered thus and if so, what is the legal basis of its concern, whether in Irish or European law?  That is my first question for Ms Graham.</p></speech>

We must ensure that the group water scheme sector, for example, in the context of a constitutional provision, could continue to act in the same way as it has done heretofore.  The same concern arises with regard to people with private wells continuing to act as before.  This is part of the teasing out work that we are doing with the Office of the Attorney General.  What do we mean by the public water system?  If one puts words in the Constitution, unlike legislation, there must be absolute clarity and that is where the potential for unintended consequences comes into play.  Most contributors here have referred to the desire to have the public water system in public ownership but in practical terms, what does that mean?  The day-to-day operation of the water system means that there are way leaves for pipes through private land, for example.  It is those kinds of issues that -----</p></speech>

Under law, there are public assets, that is, things that the public owns and there are private assets, that is, things that private property holders own.

If that is the case, I ask Ms Graham to share it with us.</p></speech>

In terms of Irish law, one of the concerns relates to practical issues.  Irish Water is responsible, statutorily, for the delivery of public water services and through service level agreements with local authorities is operating the system and controlling the assets.  There is a process under way of transferring those assets and when we went into the detail of doing that, it was not as straightforward as we had thought in terms of ownership.  That is at another level, as the Deputy will appreciate, in terms of what is on folios and so forth.  If, for example, a local authority had built a wastewater treatment plant, it may have, as part of its engagement with the community, made land available for football pitches or allotments.  A process had to be put in place to answer the question of what is the public asset and what is the local authority asset.  It is in the detail -----</p></speech>

The 2014 Act makes it very clear that privatisation in the context of those additional protections is to do with the sale of shares but of course, as other members have said, privatisation is also to do with the sale of assets.  It could also relate to extraction rights or the privatisation of the public delivery of the service.  I am a little confused and I ask the witnesses to clarify an issue related to the restrictions on the sale of assets contained in section 31 of the 2007 Act.  Do all of the restrictions in the 2007 Act now apply to Irish Water?  If not, which ones do not?  I also ask them to clarify whether those restrictions would require, for example, ministerial approval for assets to be sold rather than the additional requirements in what a member referred to as the "triple lock" contained in the 2014 Act?  I further ask the witnesses to confirm that clauses four and seven of the constitution of Irish Water give widespread powers to Irish Water, with ministerial approval, to dispose of assets.  It is really important for people to know the answers to those questions.  While the stronger legislative protection of the 2014 Act obviously covers the sale of shares, it provides a much weaker level of legislative protection for the sale of assets.  If that is correct, would it not be possible for Irish Water, with ministerial approval, to sell off very substantial portions of its assets, thus reducing Irish Water to a shell or a holding company?  In that context, the sale of its shares would be immaterial because the bulk of its assets and work would effectively have been privatised.</p> <p>  My last question requires a "Yes" or "No" answer from both witnesses.  I ask them to tell the committee, on the record, whether they believe constitutional protection of the public water system would be stronger than legislative protection..</p></speech>

On the other part of the question, I refer to the written text inserted in the other official language.  The powers which had been provided under statute for the water authorities under section 31 of the 2007 Act do not seem to have been transferred and many were deleted.  Section 7(2) of the Water Services (No. 2) Act 2013 provides that references to a water services authority under the 2007 Act in so far as they related to functions transferred under the Act will be construed as references to Irish Water.  Therefore, references to a water services authority in section 31 of the 2007 Act still remain as references to local authorities.  I appreciate-----</p></speech>

I do not want to upset my friend here, but that is my view.  One must also remember that in common law water and air are incapable of ownership.  This is reflected in the title deeds of the Duke of Devonshire for the Munster Blackwater.  After the Battle of Kinsale, he was granted by Elizabeth I the bed and soil of the river and the fish that flowed therein.  What was missing, of course, was the water because in common law water was incapable of ownership - air likewise.<br/><br/>I will quickly read Article 10 of the Constitution:</p><blockquote>All natural resources, including the air and all forms of potential energy, within the jurisdiction of the Parliament and Government established by this Constitution and all royalties and franchises within that jurisdiction belong to the State subject to all estates and interests therein for the time being lawfully vested in any person or body.</blockquote> <p>Anybody who has ever looked at a land folio in Ireland has seen the reservation that while A or B becomes the owner in fee simple of the land, the air, minerals and underlying assets belong to the State.  That is reflected in the article.  What we are talking about in essence is raw water which is fluoridated and piped and, therefore, converted into potable domestic water.  However, in reality the State already has some jurisdiction over water, even though it is not capable of ownership in common law.  However, the Constitution includes air and all forms of potential energy and natural resources which would include water.</p></speech>

I do not know anyone who has posited a case to the contrary.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail for his presentation.  T&aacute; br&oacute;n orm mar gheall ar na deacrachta&iacute; a bhain leis an aistri&uacute;ch&aacute;n.  One of Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail's statements brings us to the nub of the issue.  Nobody is arguing that we are in favour of privatisation.  What we are wondering is whether a referendum is necessary.  We must be clear that this is the focus of the debate.  Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail has stated privatisation of water provision "poses a serious threat to access and quality."  This explains the reason so many submissions were made on this issue.  While I accept that people fear privatisation, in my humble opinion statements such as this generated this fear which has been blown up and made more real than is necessary.  The opposite of this statement is that the public ownership of water protects access and quality, which is not the case.  Thousands of my constituents do not have access to water and its public ownership does not guarantee supply.  We should ask people in Galway who had to put up with cryptosporidium for their view on the issue.  They will tell us that public ownership of water does not guarantee quality.  Let us be honest - there is an element of fear stoking and remarks such as Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail's on privatisation go to the heart of it. </p> <p>  If it is argued that the reason for holding a referendum is precedent, what will be next?  Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail statement that access to water is essential to public health is very interesting.  Does he believe any other entity or commodity is essential to public health and should, therefore, be afforded constitutional protection?  For example, should we have a referendum to guarantee that the health service cannot be farmed out to private ownership?  Should we then have one to prevent education from being farmed out to private ownership and guarantee access to education?  The blood transfusion service is a life-giving service that is essential to public health.  Should we also hold a referendum to guarantee it would remain in public hands?  My point is whether this will become an endless exercise in which the State inserts guarantees on everything in the Constitution or whether Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail regards water as unique and considers that no other service, commodity or entity has the same standing. </p> <p>  If a referendum were to be held, I do not know if there would be a "No" side.  Who would argue in favour of privatisation?  There is an onus to provide for a balanced debate.  In that case, while I acknowledge a few people would be tempted to do so, who would populate the airwaves to provide for a 50:50 balance and argue in favour of privatising water services?  The referendum would be nonsensical and completely one-sided because there would not be a debate.  Those who want a referendum to be held and hope people will become exercised about the issue would be engaged in a self-defeating exercise because no such debate would take place.  I wonder how this would play out.  </p> <p>  Would a referendum have a knock-on effect, positive or negative, on the thousands of my constituents who do not have a public water supply?  They would be extremely bored during the referendum campaign because it would be irrelevant to the one third of the population who do not have their wastewater collected whether the water service was publicly or privately owned.  Would a referendum have a knock-on effect for them?</p></speech>

There is no precedent when it comes to a referendum and there never is.  While there may be one in case law, the courts and so on, in terms of holding a referendum, in the Constitution there is no such thing as a precedent.  There are referenda on different subjects at different times.  The various examples the Deputy mentioned are a type of <i>reductio ad absurdum</i>.  He is moving down a scale of things that make a nonsense of the proposal.  The proposal is to be considered on its own merits and has considerable support.  The ultimate outcome would be the outcome of a referendum, should one proceed.<br/><br/>On the Deputy's other complaints which I fully accept are all valid in rural Ireland, I will quote one of the examples I gave to highlight the need for a referendum.  I have cited the citizens of Paris, a huge city in France, who saw the cost of water increase by 265% over a 23-year period.</p><p>When it was re-municipalised, &euro;35 million was saved in water charges by the city council.</p></speech>

Those are not answers to the questions that I asked.  I asked about the necessity of a referendum.

The Minister has recognised the sincerity of the proposals being made and the concerns that have been raised, and he is open to a work-up of proposals.  For that reason, the Bill was not opposed and it was suggested that it needed legal and technical scrutiny when on Committee Stage.</p> <p>  A constitutional protection is always higher than a legislative provision.  We have discussed the issues with wording.</p> <p>  Regarding voting, Ervia is owned by the State and Ervia owns Irish Water.  Ervia has the voting rights, not the Minister.  Rather, he has the economic rights.  However, there is a range of provisions under the legislation for which ministerial consent is required.  The Minister also gives Ervia what is called a shareholder's expectation letter, which sets out the range of activities that he, as the shareholder in the State company, expects Ervia to perform.  That involves a number of metrics and is common to the NewERA family, as it were, those being, ESB, Gas Networks Ireland, etc.</p><p>That would set out a range of things to do with dividend policy, water policy, and energy policy, etc.  While the Minister does not have a voting right, there is obviously a policy construct within the legislation, within the NewERA legislation, and within the specific ministerial consents that are set out in legislation.  </p></speech>

There have been clear expressions of concern at the possibility of privatisation.  Deputy &Oacute; Broin made the point that the majority of submissions have raised this issue.  It is on that basis that I want to state clearly that we are in favour of a referendum.  In that context, the specific wording of the proposed amendment that is going before the committee, while it is a matter for that committee, we must be satisfied that that wording would achieve what we want to achieve.  As I understand it the wording concerns the protection of the water system.  I am concerned that we accurately define what we mean by that.  Is it the assets and the infrastructure?  Does it protect the utility as it is now and therefore tie people's hands to change the nature of Irish Water into the future?  My concern is to protect the assets and the infrastructure.</p> <p>  I challenge Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail.  The Minister has every right to consider possible amendments, but so do the rest of us.  We actually have a duty to scrutinise legislation, to look at it on Committee and Report Stages, and if we think that the wording is inadequate then we all have a duty to propose amendments.  I want to make that point clearly.  We may not agree with the exact wording of Deputy Joan Collins.  We agreed it on Second Stage but we may not agree with the exact wording.  That is our duty as public representatives.  That does not mean that we are not absolutely in favour of a constitutional referendum being put to the people.  My concern about wording is that we have to make sure that it does what we want it to do, which is to protect the assets and the infrastructure not necessarily tie down the utility in stone as it exists today.  </p></speech>

Ms Graham in her opening statement mentioned the initial set up of Irish Water and how it was envisaged that the utility would be a public utility, a State body in public ownership.  Some of the contributions seem to suggest that all the problems around this emerged out of nothing, or <i>ex nihilo</i>, as Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail suggested.  I am interested in what Ms Graham says was the original intention.  It is worth briefly recapping on why we are here, and how it became so muddled and confused for people.  It looked suspiciously like Irish Water was being prepared for privatisation through a whole series of actions.  This was not something in people's imaginations, despite what the original motivation might have been.  The Government at the time went against its own consultant's report in setting up Irish Water as a subsidiary of Bord G&aacute;is.  Parts of Bord G&aacute;is were subsequently privatised and sold off.  That gave rise to suspicions.  It was given to Bord G&aacute;is on the one hand because it was stated that Bord G&aacute;is had the operational capacity to deal with it yet there was this necessity for huge sums of public money to be paid out to external consultants for Irish Water.  Demonstrably, Bord G&aacute;is did not have the capacity to deal with all the aspects of it.  There was the speed with which it was set up.</p></speech>

The public ownership and the lack of confidence the public developed over time in Irish Water were key findings of the commission.  That was not something created by the Opposition.  It was created by the manner in which Irish Water conducted itself.  My questions are these.  Was the privatisation of water services ever agreed or discussed with the troika at any stage?  Is there anything available on that?  Has the Department ever considered a model such as that currently being rolled out in England, and already exists in Scotland, where the network would be retained by Irish Water but where private operators could sell wholesale?  If Irish Water or the Department had considered that, would a proposed constitutional protection safeguard against that?  That question is directed to Ms. Graham and to Mr. &Oacute; Tuathail.  Thank you for your forbearance on this, Chair.  We have talked about constitutional amendments, and Mr &Oacute; Tuathail is convinced that that is the only way to handle it, so as a citizen and public representative I am interested in two aspects of this.  Did you write the wording for the right to water campaign?</p></speech>

The water services legislation of 2007 was approximately ten years in gestation, and it was considered serious enough at that point to put protections in against the privatisation of assets, before Irish Water was contemplated.  That was an important point at that stage.</p><p>When we moved into the reform process, PricewaterhouseCoopers was specifically asked to report on the use of State utilities.  Because of the time available to us under the agreement with the troika to establish the new utility, we were given a series of points which would have to be satisfied were we to have it under an existing utility such as Bord G&aacute;is.</p><p> I have been involved in the water sector since 2009.  I think I attended all of the meetings with the troika and the issue of privatisation was not raised.  The Department only looked at the models included in the PricewaterhouseCoopers report such as the local authority agency model, among others.  The question of privatisation or preparing for it was never on our agenda, pre or post-Irish Water.</p></speech>

I have been doing a little first-hand research of the Irish health system over the past couple of weeks and I hope I will get through this okay.</p> <p>  I begin by sincerely thanking the committee for the invitation to address it today.  It is a great honour and a privilege to be asked to contribute to the very important work that the committee is undertaking and I hope my appearance today will be of some assistance in this regard.  It is worth acknowledging that despite its flaws, the Irish health system has its good points and these should not be forgotten.  Patients are generally happy with the treatment they receive in hospitals, although access can be a problem.  Most people can receive a same-day or next-day appointment with a GP, something that is not always the case in other countries.  Life expectancy and self-assessed health status are both above average in Ireland.  Our health system is getting some things right and those areas that are working well need to be built on while addressing the shortcomings in other areas.</p> <p>  When examining the workings of a health system, economists sometimes use what is known as the health care triangle, which is illustrated in figure 1 in the presentation.  Unlike most goods and services, health care often, although not always, involves a third party purchaser, which pools contributions and purchases care on behalf of contributors.  Citizens provide funding to the third party purchasers, which allocate funds to providers, which deliver care to those who need it.  Using third party purchasers involves an element of social solidarity, as a large group of people pay into the pool while not all will require treatment.</p><p>This system thereby reduces the risk that would be faced by citizens if they were obliged to pay the full cost of all of their care themselves.<br/><br/>In Ireland, it could be argued that we have two health care triangles operating alongside each other.  In the public health system all citizens pay taxation that is pooled by the Government and allocated, via the HSE, to providers who deliver care to public patients.  Simultaneously, we have a private system where nearly half the population pays premiums to private health insurers which pool those funds and allocate them to providers, which deliver care to private patients.  There is also a system of direct, out-of-pocket payments, which are paid directly by some citizens to providers for care.  Examples would include payments to GPs by patients who do not hold medical cards or GP-only medical cards, and payments to pharmacies for prescription medication up to the drug payment scheme threshold by patients who do not hold medical cards.  One source of difficulty in the Irish system stems from the fact that public and private patients are often treated by the same providers, while the allocation mechanisms of the public and private funds differ.  Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures from 2010 show that of those patients with private health insurance who had been hospitalised as inpatients in the previous 12 months, over 60% were treated in public hospitals.  A significant proportion of consultants, meanwhile, have contracts that allow for a mixture of public and private practice.  For hospital treatment, public hospitals and consultants are paid on a fixed basis, with some adjustment for case mix for hospitals, for treating public patients, while they are paid on a fee-for-service basis for treating private patients.  Treating more public patients therefore does not yield more income, whereas treating additional private patients does, thereby creating an incentive to treat more private patients.  I am aware that moves are under way to roll out a money-follows-the-patient system in public hospitals, but depending on the relative reimbursement rates for public and private patients, there may still be an incentive to favour private patients even under this new system.  Although Ireland is not unusual in having a mixture of public and private funding and delivery mechanisms, Ireland is unusual in the degree of overlap between them.  This overlap does not all go in one direction either, as some public patients have been treated in private hospitals under the National Treatment Purchase Fund.  On the funding side, the State partially subsidises the purchase of private health insurance, the most obvious subsidy being the tax relief at source granted on private health insurance premiums although this was capped in 2013.  Meanwhile, public hospitals receive hundreds of millions of euro per year from private health insurers for the treatment of privately insured patients.  I believe that one focus of the committee&rsquo;s plan for the next ten years should be to try to disentangle this overlap between public and private funding and delivery.  The committee&rsquo;s terms of reference refer to the need to establish a universal single-tier service where patients are treated on the basis of health need rather than on ability to pay.  Although this is a noble aspiration, I do not believe that an entirely single-tier system for all health services is achievable, given that the private health insurance market and the private hospital system are both well established.  Rather than try to eliminate these, consideration should be given to what role they will play in the Irish health system into the future.  Bearing this in mind, the concept of a universal single-tier service needs to be defined as the destination will determine the route to get there.  That being said, I believe that it is important to try to reduce the degree to which public patients seeking treatment in public hospitals are impacted by the treatment of private patients in these same hospitals.  One possible way of doing this would be to move to a situation where public hospitals are used to treat public patients only, bearing in mind that those with private health insurance do not forsake their right to be treated as public patients.  It may be considered acceptable for those with private health insurance to use that insurance to pay for better accommodation, but not to receive faster access.  This would, of course, require contract renegotiations with consultants and additional State funding for public hospitals.  If access issues facing public patients in public hospitals were addressed it would remove one of the main drivers of demand for private health insurance, thereby naturally reducing the two-tier nature of the hospital system.<br/><br/>It should be borne in mind that, while the Irish health system is often referred to as a two-tier system, where private patients are better off in terms of receiving services than public patients, it is actually more nuanced than that.  While it may be the case that private patients are better off in terms of hospital treatment, the opposite is often true at primary care level, where services are provided free at the point of use to those with medical cards and with GP-only medical cards, while private patients -  that is, those who are not in possession of a medical card or a GP-only medical card - must pay significant out-of-pocket charges for services.  In this case, those who have to pay privately may be reluctant to access services because of cost and research has shown this to be the case.  One paper, by Dermot O&rsquo;Reilly and others, published in 2007, showed that over 26% of people without medical cards had put off going to see a GP on cost grounds in the previous 12 months, compared with fewer than 5% of those with medical cards.  While some of these people may get by without seeing a GP, undoubtedly in some cases the delay in seeing a GP will contribute to the illness getting worse before they eventually have a consultation, which may result in some of them requiring hospitalisation, which is a far more expensive form of treatment.  The removal, or at least reduction, of the financial barrier to accessing GP services should be another priority of the ten-year plan.Although moves have already been made to do this, with the roll-out of universal entitlement to GP-only medical cards for the over-70s and children under six, I believe that priority should now be given to those on lower incomes rather than those in certain age brackets.  GP-only medical cards do not give increased access to GPs <i>per se</i>, but rather they remove the financial barrier to accessing GP services.  This financial barrier is more acute for those on lower incomes, for whom the cost of GP visit at an average of over &euro;50, represents a significant proportion of their weekly income.  Therefore, I believe that serious consideration should be given to raising the income thresholds for GP-only medical cards.  While this might be more administratively cumbersome than rolling out eligibility by age group, I believe that it would be more beneficial to those who struggle to afford GP services.<br/><br/>It should also be remembered that it is not just GP services that pose financial challenges for people.  For those without medical cards, the drug payment scheme threshold, which must be met before the State funds prescription charges, is &euro;144 per month, which represents a significant proportion of many households&rsquo; income.  Furthermore, this threshold has increased since the onset of the economic downturn, as have a number of other charges as shown in table 1 of the presentation, while prescription charges were also introduced in 2010 for those with medical cards, and these have also been increased since then.  These increases in user charges were introduced as a result of a shrinking public budget available for health services, and they, combined with significant increases in private health insurance premiums over the same period, led to an increase in the proportion of total health spending coming from private sources, from 21% in 2008 to 31% in 2014.  As private sources of funding, including private health insurance premiums and user charges are regressive sources of funding, meaning that those on lower incomes pay a higher proportion of their income, while public sources, including taxation, are progressive sources, meaning that those on higher incomes pay a higher proportion of their income, the shift from public to private sources has adverse implications for equity in the system.<br/><br/>I spoke earlier about the health care triangle.  Citizens are the ones who fund health services.  This is the case irrespective of the funding mechanism used.  Therefore, the debate in terms of cost shifting is not so much about who pays but rather about how the burden of payment is spread.  Ideally this should be spread in as equitable a way as possible.  This raises the issue of how to fund public health services.  The main options used around Europe are taxation, which is the main source of funding in Ireland, and social health insurance.  The latter has also been proposed for Ireland.  I believe, however, that rather than changing the funding mechanism the focus should instead be on the allocation of funds and delivery of health services.  One key focus should be any incentives that exist within the system or that are created by any redesign of the system.<br/><br/>It should also be borne in mind that significant improvements in the public health system in Ireland will entail significant costs.  It needs to be acknowledged that the Irish system is under-resourced in a number of areas.  According to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, figures, we have 2.7 doctors per 1,000 population, compared with an OECD average of 3.3 and within our figures we have a lower than average proportion of specialists.  The OECD figures also show that we have 2.8 hospital beds per 1,000 population, compared with an OECD average of 4.8.  If we were to try to reach the OECD average figures, we would require 2,800 additional doctors and over 9,000 additional hospital beds.  Although we currently have a younger than average population, which may mitigate these numbers to a degree, Ireland's population is growing and ageing, which will affect the demand for health services.  CSO projections suggest that our population will increase from 4.6 million in 2011 to somewhere between 5.0 and 6.7 million by 2046.  Furthermore, the proportion of the population aged over-65 is projected to rise from 11.6% in 2011 to between 21.6% and 27.9% by 2046.  The proportion of the population aged over-80 is projected to rise from 2.8% to between 7.2% and 9.4% over the same time period.  Evidence shows that those in older age groups have, on average, a higher utilisation of health services than those in younger age groups.  The ageing of the population, coupled with an increasing incidence of chronic illness, is engaging health policy makers in many countries, not just Ireland.  As demonstrated by the resource figures in table 1 of the presentation, our system is perhaps less well equipped to face these challenges.  The Irish health system never fully recovered from the cutbacks in the late 1980s and early 1990s, and this is affecting our ability to meet the health needs of our current population, let alone provide for the anticipated increase in demand resulting from our growing and ageing population.  While one major area of focus is trying to keep people out of hospitals and ensure that they are treated instead at primary care level, and this is a worthwhile focus, it will require significant investment in primary care in order to ensure that resources are in place to fulfil this ambition.  Significant investment will also be needed in our hospital system, which still has fewer beds than it did in 1980, despite a significant increase and ageing of the population over that time.  While it is true to say that it is not all about money, it is also the case that what we want to achieve will not be achievable without significant additional funding.  I hope that this opening statement provides some food for thought for the committee.  I thank the committee for the invitation to appear before it, and I wish it every success in its important work.</p><p>I thank Dr. Turner.  I will open the debate to members and I propose to take members in groups of three.  Will Dr. Turner note the question and deal with them in groups?</p><p> I call Deputy Naughton.</p></speech>

I am particularly interested in his comments that the health service is under-resouced in terms of consultant numbers and the number of hospital beds per 1,000 of population.  Dr. Turner gave the OECD average bed capacity per 1,000 of population as 4.85 compared with 2.8 in Ireland.  The Department of Health is carrying out a bed capacity review.  Is there any other metric, other than the OECD figure, to identifying our bed capacity needs?</p> <p>  Does Dr. Turner hold the view that the Department of Health should commission an independent review of bed capacity?  In his opening statement he referred to the fact that the private hospital sector is deeply embedded in our health system and that it would not be possible to do without some form of private health service.  Will he expand on that point as it will form a key part of the discussions that will feed into our report?</p> <p>  I would be interested to hear Dr. Turner share his top priority actions that would have a great impact on the health service.</p></speech>

In the course of his presentation Dr. Turner states that he does not believe an entirely single-tier system for all health services is achievable but I would be interested to learn if he thinks we should aspire to a single-tier system, if nothing else.  I understand that we are the only country, bar the US, that does not have a single-tier system.  Will he explain his views on whether it would be completely futile to have a single-tier system or whether we should aspire to an universal health system?</p> <p>  In the course of his presentation, he referred to the incentivisation to treat private patients instead of public patients.  With regard to the dismantling of that incentive, were we to go down the road of eliminating the subsidy that is available to those who purchase private health insurance, that could generate in the region of &euro;350 million to &euro;355 million, which is a fairly conservative estimate.  What is his view of the impact of the possible elimination of that subsidy on the perverse incentive to treat private patients and the possibility of reinvestment of that money in the health service?</p></speech>

I want to track back to a point he raised at the outset.  Please correct me if I am wrong, but it seemed to me that Dr. Turner's argument was that because of the embedded private health insurers and private hospitals within the health services, the concept of a single-tier health service was not achievable and that in his view, a more realistic goal was to try to moderate the character of the two-tier health service we have?  Let me flip the argument on its head as our mandate is to deliver single-tier health care.  Is Dr. Turner saying that a single-tier health care service could only be delivered if we were to effectively nationalise the private hospitals and bypass the private insurers by developing a tax base system which provides health care free at the point of use?  Obviously that would involve a far greater level of upheaval and change and that is a matter to be debated by the committee.  Will he clarify whether he is he saying that if one wants to achieve the goal of a single-tier health care system, one would need to take steps of that kind?</p></speech>

Our mandate, as Deputy Barry states, is to draw up a strategy for the introduction of a universal single-tier health service.  That does not necessarily preclude any private health sector but what it does mean is that any State subsidy to private services would cease.  We know that in the United Kingdom, which has the NHS, 10% to 15% of people have private health insurance but there is no State subsidy of the small private sector health service.  That is the key point.</p> <p>  Will Dr. Turner response to those questions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.313" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Turner" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017012500002#D00600"><p>There is quite a bit of content but there is an overlap between some of the questions.  In terms of the under-resourcing of the system, we do not necessarily need to reach the OECD bed capacity average as we have a younger than average population, but I was putting the figure out there to give members a sense of the scale of the challenge facing the Irish system.  We need to increase the resources for both hospital bed capacity and to increase the number of doctors.</p> <p>  Ideally, the Department of Health review of capacity should be independent but the last independent review of which I am aware was undertaken in 2007.  I suspect that bed numbers have not changed radically since then, and if memory serves, our bed capacity at that point was approximately 15,000 beds.  That compares with 18,000 hospital beds in service in 1980.  I acknowledge we are trying to move people out of hospitals and the trend is to move from inpatient to day case procedures, which is reducing the need for beds.  That reduction of bed numbers from 1980 to the present day, when the population has increased by one third and an increase of two thirds in the number of people over 65 years who are disproportionately likely to have a need for hospital services, puts a significant a significant strain on the system.</p> <p>  As the OECD figures are the figures with which I am most familiar, they are the ones I tend to use.  One may ask how did the OECD arrive at its figures?  I presume it got them from the HSE and the Independent Hospitals Association.</p> <p>  In terms of private hospitals, I was possibly being a little provocative by saying it might not be feasible to have an entirely single-tier health system.  What I was trying to do was stimulate a debate on what we mean by a single-tier health system.  It is very hard to think of any country, certainly in Europe, that has an entirely single-tier system for all health services.  There is usually a mixture of public and private funding and delivery.  Where we need to focus is on trying, as the Chair suggested, to separate out the two systems.  For example in the UK, the take up of private health insurance is about 11% to 12%.  I remember reading a figure a few years ago that only 1% of the treatment of patients in NHS hospitals was of private patients, which is a very different picture from the one in Ireland.</p> <p>  One other reason I suggest the embedded nature of the private hospital sector and the private insurance sector in the Irish health service will affect the attempts to move to a single-tier health system pertains to the judgment Mr. Justice McKechnie delivered in 2006 in the High Court case that BUPA Ireland took against the State in 2003 on the risk equalisation scheme.  One argument BUPA Ireland was making that having set up in Ireland, it had a right to continue its business in the State.</p><p>I am not a legal expert.  As a non-cognate, my interpretation of what Mr. Justice McKechnie said was it is not beyond the bounds of possibility that the insurance sector could be taken out of the picture in the national interest but an argument would have to be put forward to do so.  Given that no system in Europe, that I am aware of, has gone from a two-tier system to removing the private sector, it would be difficult to make an argument for same.  I suspect that if one tried to do so one would face significant legal challenges from the insurers and the private hospital operators that are highly dependent on insurers.  In addition, depending on whether the private system is completely removed or incorporated into the public system, one could be looking at significant job losses.  There are 8,000 jobs in the private hospital sector.  I am not sure how many jobs are in the insurance sector but I suspect it is about 2,000 jobs.  That means 10,000 jobs rely on the private sector.  Care needs to be taken when deciding whether to eliminate the private system or incorporate it into the public system.  </p><p> We must define what we mean by a universal single-tier health system and whether it is public or private.  A universal single-tier public health system is achievable.  I am not sure that a universal single-tier health system for everything is achievable but it certainly is not in a ten-year timeframe.  Having said that, if we are here in ten years time debating health matters I will be delighted that my assertion has been proved wrong.</p><p> I have been asked what one thing I would prioritise, which is a tricky question to answer.  Extra funding at primary and secondary care levels is the short answer.  We are moving towards increasing our reliance on primary care.  Before we can move people out of hospitals we must ensure that resources are available in the primary care sector to deal with them effectively.  I would say extra funding is my number one priority if someone put a gun to my head for an answer.  </p><p> Deputy O'Reilly asked about the suitability of a single-tier system.  I have talked a little about an entirely single-tier system.  Every European market has a private health insurance market and how it operates can differ.  In some cases, private health insurance can be substituted for a statutory system.  In other cases, it can be complementary so covers things that are not covered or partially covered by the public system.  In Ireland we have a largely supplementary system that gives people additional benefits such as faster access, a greater choice of provider or superior accommodation.  The nature of the health insurance system is part of the problem.  Interestingly, when the current health insurance market was established in 1957 following the passing of the Voluntary Health Insurance Act, the top 15% of earners did not have access entitlements to public hospitals.  The scheme was designed to give them the option of paying for their care if they fell ill without facing significant hospital bills.  The scheme was not limited to the top 15% of earners.  One can argue that it was a substituted system for the top 15% of earners but a supplementary system for anyone else who decided to avail of the scheme.  </p><p> The access entitlements to the public hospitals system were increased over time with hospital accommodation taken care of in 1979 and treatment by hospital consultants taken care of in 1991.  At that stage the nature of the system had changed greatly but no consideration was given to whether the health insurance system was still needed.  Very shortly afterwards in 1992 the European Third Non-Life Insurance Directive was introduced thus ensuring that all member states opened all of the non-life insurance markets to competition.  Once that happened it became much more difficult to consider the role of the private health insurance system.  We must take this aspect into account when figuring out what we want to achieve.  A single-tier public hospital system is achievable.  A single-tier primary care system is achievable.  I do not know whether it is possible to eliminate the private hospital and private insurance markets.  </p></speech>

As the Chairman has correctly pointed out, we cannot prevent people from purchasing private health insurance.  The biggest single incentive to not purchase private health insurance is getting what one needs from the public system.  Should we not aspire to that situation, notwithstanding the constraints?  Should we copy what was done with the NHS bill in Britain?  On that occasion people sought what they wanted and made choices.  Is that not preferable to highlighting all of the reasons we might not get there or get there quickly?</p></speech>

Surveys repeatedly show that one of the main drivers of demand for private health insurance is people's lack of confidence in the public health system-----</p></speech>

I will preface my supplementary question by stating the following.  In terms of the conclusions reached by the committee on how to deliver single-tier health care, my position is that noting is ruled in and nothing is ruled out.  Evidence has been given to this committee that following the example of Canada would be a powerful assistance in achieving a single-tier health system.  Canada has taken steps to tackle private health insurance by providing a credible tax based alternative to people.  I will not rule anything in or out in terms of the committee's proposal.</p> <p>  I shall ask my supplementary question.  A contradiction exists because private hospitals and private health insurers are, using Dr. Turner's phrase, embedded in the system.  He mentioned the interesting scenario of single-tier public hospital care and single-tier primary health services without subsidising the private sector.  If one did that with any real measure of success more people, progressively and incrementally, would be brought into the public health care system and, progressively, fewer people would use the private health care system.  At a certain point issues would arise with the 8,000 jobs in the private hospitals system and the 2,000 jobs in the private insurance system.  Problems could be averted by nationalisation because the sectors would be integrated on a different basis and jobs would be protected.  One cannot have a big public health care sector used by masses of people and a big private health care system used by masses of other people yet have anything approaching a single-tier health care system.  The more successful the public system is the greater balance will be achieved.</p><p>Would Dr. Turner not accept that that is the case?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Turner" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017012500002#F00200"><p>I would.  That raises the question of what the natural level of demand for private health insurance is.  If the public system and the private system were reasonably comparable in waiting times and services, how many people would choose to have private health insurance and open up the access to additional hospitals?  I do not know the answer to that question.  At the moment, there is so much treatment of private patients taking place in public hospitals that if that was taken out of public hospitals as a first step, there would be plenty to keep the private hospital sector going.  As the demand for private health insurance winds down, we are getting to a scenario of how much is sustainable.  I do not have a simple answer to that.</p></speech>

She mentioned &euro;355 million.  That is the latest figure from the Revenue Commissioners for 2014, which is down from about &euro;450 million in 2013.  The difference is largely accounted for by the rule of the bed designation.  I have sent an e-mail to the Revenue Commissioners.  There is possibly a small bit of the &euro;355 million that is accounted for by historical adjustments to the interim measures prior to the risk equalisation scheme, but it will be close enough to the &euro;350 million.  If that incentive was eliminated, it would certainly be available to the public system.  Having said that, if we removed the private patients from the public system, then we would have the additional cost of treating public patients in the beds that would be freed up by the private patients.  Therefore, it would probably more than offset that figure, but there is certainly an offsetting figure there.  I think that covers the questions asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.333" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017012500002#F00500"><p>I welcome Dr. Turner.  I declared to the committee last week that we commissioned Dr. Turner to independently evaluate universal health insurance as proposed by the previous Government and other funding models.  That was independent, as opposed to Fianna F&aacute;il policy.  I wish to be very clear on that.</p><p>There are a few issues that have been consistently raised.  There are also the ideological debates on the funding of health care and access to health care, but I wish to get back to the pragmatics of it.  Dr. Turner said that we have a very intertwined public health system and private health system in this country due to the fact that many beds are used on a daily basis to treat private patients in public hospitals.  If we are trying to get to a single-tier universal health care model, how would Dr. Turner propose to disentangle that dichotomy of private patients in public hospitals?  Is there capacity enough in the private system for private patients to be treated there?  In very complex cases in which the private system simply cannot treat the complexities of individuals, what sort of funding model could be put in place to ensure that the public health system is fully reimbursed?</p><p>There is the other issue of the disparity in access for diagnostics and treatment between public and private, which is always pointed out and rightly so.  How could it be possible to have a single list of people in both public and private who are trying to access public hospitals, if the witness understands my meaning?</p><p>When we talk about health care and the public health system and say that the private system should be reduced or not depended on, we must remember that the vast majority of primary care is delivered through the private sector in terms of GPs.  By and large, they are sole traders and operate independently, subject to the contract itself.  Where does Dr. Turner see the role of GPs and the broader primary care system in the delivery of a universal primary care system?  Does he see a need to expand salaried GPs?  How would the witness bring that to a situation in which there would be an obligation on GPs to deliver a fully-funded universal primary care system?</p><p>How does the witness see the issue of tax relief for private health insurance?  A view is sometimes put forward that people who retain private health insurance are somehow queue-jumping elitists.  Of course, half of the population have private health care.  They are subsidised to a certain extent by the fact that they get tax relief for their private health insurance.  The <i>quid pro quo</i>is that they are equally subsidising the State by the fact that they do not depend on the public health system for their health care.  In the event of there being a universal health care system, then they would be dependent or could call on the State to ensure that it would provide health care for them.  This is an area in which affordability is going to be a key issue.  We cannot dismiss this as a committee if we are to move towards expanding the public health system to deliver a universal single-tier health system.</p><p>The witness spoke about additional GP numbers of 2,900 and additional beds of 9,000.  While it is aspirational, how affordable would it be to expand capacity out in the short, medium or longer term?  It would be a folly not to at least use the capacity of the private health care providers in the short and medium term to expand the capacity of the public health system.  There is the National Treatment Purchase Fund, which I accept is a short and medium-term solution to overcrowding and waiting lists.  </p><p>With regard to the recruitment of consultants and consultants' contracts, there seems to be a huge issue with incentivisation, where consultants are more incentivised to treat patients in the private health system rather than the public health system.  How does Dr. Turner see that issue being addressed if we are to disentangle the whole concept of public and private?</p></speech>

I apologise for being absent at the beginning due to parking difficulty.  I have the submission in front of me.  A consultant friend of mine has identified - according to himself, anyway - that medical economics is public enemy No. 1 insofar as the delivery of health services is concerned.  He cites the extent to which medical economists have been in favour of the reduction of bed numbers and bed capacity over a number of years, resulting in what we see now.  He cannot understand that.  What is Dr. Turner's response to that?</p> <p>  What is Dr. Turner's response to the phrase we often hear that the health service has an insatiable appetite for money and that no matter how much money is thrown at it, it will absorb it, consume it and be back for more?</p> <p>  How does the witness address the comparison with other jurisdictions in order to achieve the bed levels that other OECD countries have?  Recognising the cost involved, how does Dr. Turner feel other jurisdictions are doing in dealing with health services, given that a number of crises have emerged in a number of them in recent years and more are emerging?  For instance, how does the witness view the health service in the Netherlands, which was very good a couple of years ago, but is not deemed to be so effective and efficient now?  How does Dr. Turner respond to that?</p> <p>  I am sorry for the number of questions, Chairman.  I will only contribute once.  There was a suggestion referred to slightly by Deputy Kelleher that the private health sector feasts off the public health sector in terms of the resources available and that it advances at some cost to the public sector.  How does the witness respond to that suggestion?  A programme was done on RTE a couple of years ago which strongly suggested that.  I would be interested in the comments of Dr. Turner on that.</p> <p>  This is my last point.  If there are long waiting lists, which there are in this country and a number of others at the present time, it certainly points to a deficiency somewhere.  Is it a lack of personnel, bed accommodation, management or expertise?  What is the cause of it?</p><p>For example, a consultant can only work a certain length of time per day.  It is not a good idea to work for 18 hours if one is performing surgery.  What is the optimum ratio of consultants per 1,000 population?  At what level do we get the best performance?</p><p> Why is it necessary to have waiting lists?  If someone has a list of people waiting, they have either been taking time out or there are too many people coming into the office.  How do we marry demand to the available facilities?</p></speech>

In his opening statement, Dr. Turner mentioned the current funding model, but he also referred to a reallocation of that funding.  Will he expand on what he meant by that?  Where would he prioritise and reallocate the funding?  Would a new bed capacity review be needed to get exactly what we need as an answer for where the system is failing?</p></speech>

Part of the disentangling of private treatment in public hospitals will require contract fee negotiation with consultants.  I am aware that the last contract renegotiation took about seven or eight years, so that will not be easy.  However, it should not stand in the way of trying to achieve a single-tier public hospital system.</p> <p>  There is some suggestion that the private hospital system has capacity at the moment, and certainly the waiting times are not as long.  There seems to be a better capacity situation in the private system than there is in the public system at the moment.</p> <p>  As regards complex treatments, people do not give up their right to be treated as public patients if they have private health insurance.  For complex treatment, people can still be treated in public hospitals as public patients.  We would need to get waiting times down, however.  People who currently have private health insurance are used to shorter waiting times.  If one removes private treatment from public hospitals they may well face longer waiting times.  There may be some push-back from people with health insurance in terms of any reforms to the system.  That being said, we have to design the system for the population as a whole and not for any sub-segment.</p> <p>  The privatisation of the GP service is an interesting point.  GPs are private contractors and they see a mixture of public and private patients  Although every so often there are anecdotal stories to the contrary, by and large there is no discrimination between public and private patients in GP care.  That is certainly something from which we can learn.  Why is it that GP services are accessible by all patients, whether public or private, within a reasonable timeframe?  Could we replicate that in the public hospital system, at least in the short term, while we move to try to disentangle the public-private overlap?</p> <p>  Affordability is an issue in tax relief.  There is a temptation to characterise the public-private divide as haughty businessmen with bunions kicking little old ladies on social pensions with heart conditions out of beds.  It is not quite as caricatured as that.  About one third of those with private health insurance are in the C2 or DE social classes, which would be typically referred to as working class people.  Therefore, membership of private health insurance schemes goes right across the social strata in this country.  Obviously, however, those on lower incomes will be most affected by any increase in price as a result of removing tax relief for private health insurance.  The compensation for that would be that if one is investing money in the public system and the public system becomes more accessible, not as many people will require private health insurance in the first place.</p> <p>  The affordability of increasing capacity will be key.  That is why, in my opening statement, I mentioned that we need to be upfront about this.  It will cost a lot of money.  We are not talking about hundreds of millions but billions if, for example, we were to increase our bed capacity by 9,000.  I do not think it will happen, certainly in the next ten years, but our current bed capacity is roughly 15,000 so we are talking about a 60% increase.  Let us say that we increased bed capacity by 50% in the public sector.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, figures suggest that, in 2014, Government spending on hospitals was about &euro;4.5 billion.  Therefore, by increasing capacity by 50%, we are talking about roughly &euro;2.25 billion, although there are a lot of adjustments to be made.</p></speech>

Is it affordable?  That is something the committee needs to examine in terms of how much one is willing to pay for our public health system.  Using private capacity in the short to medium term is a pragmatic solution.  Long term, however, we should be aiming for a separation of the two.</p> <p>  I am aware that the consultant contract and the recruitment of consultants is an issue, particularly in certain specialty areas.  It would need to be looked at in the context of any contract renegotiations as to what would attract consultants.  I have a debate every so often with a colleague of mine about how much consultants should be paid.  His attitude is we should pay them whatever they want given what they do and what we do.  He believes we should pay them a multiple of what we are on because they are saving lives.</p></speech>

In fact, most of them are calling for the opposite, that is, increases in bed numbers.  The reduction in bed numbers in the 1980s and 1990s arose from the financial situation at the time.  It was not necessarily something that was requested.  It was more about trying to live within means.</p><p>In terms of health services having an insatiable appetite for money, it is an unusual service in being very much demand led on the basis that if it is built, people will come.  We have limited means to provide health care, yet we have not quite unlimited needs for health care but very significant needs.  It is rare to find a system where everybody can be treated within a reasonably short space of time when needed.  There is always some rationing of health care.  That is why it is necessary to have a waiting list because that is one way to ration it.  Another way is on the basis of affordability but that gets into a two-tier system.  Waiting lists are a rationing mechanism.  That is cold comfort to those on waiting lists.  Every country that I know of has some degree of waiting for medical services.  It is a case of what is an acceptable way.  It is not normal for somebody to wait two years for an outpatient appointment.  That is very high by international norms.  We need to bring that down.  </p><p> To answer how other systems deal with demand, one of the reports often referred to in debates about international health systems is the European Health Consumer Index.  On that index we do quite well in some respects.  We need to acknowledge that we are getting some things right.  We are joint eighth out of 35 countries on prevention and joint tenth on outcomes, but we are falling down on accessibility where we ranked joint lowest.</p></speech>

We are overspending on pharmaceuticals relative to other countries but at least we are ranked number one on that.</p> <p>  Many people pointed to the high rank of the Netherlands as evidence that managed competition, the system introduced there in 2006, was working.  Interestingly, it was ranked either first or second in 2005, in other words, prior to the reforms, so it was getting something right.  The Netherlands has had problems particularly in respect of affordability in recent years. </p> <p>  Someone mentioned that consultants can work only a certain number of hours per day.  In conversations with some consultants, they point out that they have access to theatres for only a certain number of hours in the day.  They could make more use of the theatre time if it were available to them.  </p> <p>  The optimal consultant number per 1,000 head of population is hard to say.  The figure of 2.7 doctors per 1,000 includes specialists and non-specialists.  The Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, OECD, average is 3.3.  It is hard to know exactly what is the optimal number.  That is the OECD average but the health systems are designed in very different ways.  Some would have a higher focus on primary care, some would rely more on secondary care.  It is hard to put a figure on it but we are below the average in numbers of doctors per 1,000, and a lower than average proportion of those are specialists.</p> <p>  Deputy Buckley referred to the reallocation of funding. </p></speech>

Mr. Turner speaks of our need to spend lots of money.  Can he put that in terms of the overall spend of &euro;19 billion, which is pretty close to the top of the European spend?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.365" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Turner" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017012500002#H00800"><p>Based on the 2013 figures in the health system, we were ranked seventh or eighth in the OECD in terms of <i>per capita</i>spending.  Just under &euro;6 billion of that is private spending.  Slightly over half of that again would be out of pocket payments and slightly under half would be private health insurance.  A small element would be charitable spending.  I mentioned in my opening statement the increased cost sharing in recent years in terms of the increased drug payment scheme threshold, the introduction of, and increase in, prescription charges, increased accident and emergency department charges and the increased statutory bed charge.  If we were to try to reduce the burden of out of pocket payments and unwind the cost shifting that happened in 2008 and 2014, that would have implications for the approximately &euro;3 billion spent on out of pocket payments out of that &euro;19 billion.  How far and how quickly to go would be a matter for discussion.  Out of pocket payments, which is one of the most regressive forms of health funding, amounts to approximately &euro;3 billion.<br/><br/>A new bed capacity review would be needed to get an exact figure.  I am not sure we would need a bed capacity review to tell us we are under-resourced for beds.  We would need a review to put a figure on it.  In the meantime, there is probably broad agreement that we need more hospital beds.</p></speech>

Mr. Turner said that &euro;3 billion of the &euro;19 billion spend comes from private health insurance.  How is it that 46% of the population is covered by private health insurance?  Does that not imply a major subsidy from public to private?</p></speech>

The subsidy element is one.  By and large, private health insurance gives people benefits for hospital treatment.  In recent years there has been more of a focus on giving money back on day to day benefits, such as GP visits, physiotherapy, optical and dental services.  There would not be the same kind of spending from private health insurance on items such as prescription drugs, long-term care and social services, or the social end of health care visits.  They are focused on hospital services more so than other areas of the health system.  Even within that, there is a subsidy as well.  Approximately 13% of health care funding in 2014 came from private health insurance despite the fact that 46% of people were covered.  There is a mismatch there in the allocation of funds.</p></speech>

Approximately 50% of the population have private health care.</p><p>When one adds the numbers of beds in private hospitals and private beds in public hospitals, about 50% of the beds are available to patients with private health care insurance.  That percentage of the population are well treated because they have access to a service.  It is very obvious that the other 50%, those who do not have private health care insurance, do not have the same access and are, therefore, not receiving the care they need.  It is agreed across the board that once a person gets into the hospital system, he or she is well looked after; it is getting access to a hospital bed that is the problem.  In his summary Dr. Turner states we need to consider the possibility of public hospitals treating public patients only.  I want to focus on that very strong statement.  How could we bring it about?  Let us strip back the service.  We are looking at better primary care and step-down facilities, but let us deal with the hospital issue.  It is very obvious that a person who is economically more attractive to a hospital is given priority.  That is happening.  We have discussed the issue at length.  Do we have to re-examine consultants' contracts, the contracts of nursing staff and those of staff at al levels?  Is it necessary to have a complete revamp to make a service available?  There might be staff in the system who might have a contract that is to run for another 20 years.  Unless we tackle and deal with the issue, we will go around in circles.  I would like to have more meat put on the bones in expanding on the particular comment made.</p></speech>

I have two questions.  When the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Tony O'Brien, appeared before the committee a number of weeks ago, he referred to the need for transitional investment funding to stimulate a change in the system to make it more efficient, change the emphasis from being on secondary care to primary care and begin the transfer of resources from secondary care to primary care services.  What is Dr. Turner's view in that regard?</p> <p>  My second question is on the funding of a new single tier service.  Dr. Turner suggests use of the taxation system is better than use of a social insurance system.  In that regard, will he comment on the necessity to have co-payments for certain services?  There would be a suite of services that would be free at the point of delivery but for other services there might have to be a co-payment or there would be others that would not be part of the single tier system.</p></speech>

This applies not only to bed capacity but also to staff.  Last week we heard that the majority of staff in the private health sector came from the training schools in public hospitals.  That is a phenomenon that needs to be dealt with, given the staff shortages in public hospitals and that the IMNO is stating it is unsafe for nursing staff to work owing to insufficient staff.  It has highlighted the need to recruit and retain staff.  The significant question is how can public hospitals recruit and retain staff?  This is linked with the point Dr. Turner made about the need for 2,800 additional doctors, as well as extra nurses, GPs and so on.  If we are to have a public health service to which people will want to buy in, we need to increase capacity.  We need consultants, nurses and other staff whom we need to keep in the public sector.  We could decide to recruit and train 150 student nurses annually in the next five years, but how would we retain them in the public health sector?  That is the question the committee must consider.  One suggestion is that the public sector pay for the training of doctors and nurses if they remain in the public sector for 20 to 25 years.  Does Dr. Turner have a view on how the public sector could benefit from the expert training medical students receive in Irish colleges and retain them in the public sector?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.378" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Turner" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017012500002#J00700"><p>Deputy John Brassil is correct when he states roughly half the population have very good access to care.  When we read analyses of the health system we tend to look at the overall funding for the public and private sectors and focus on the worst outcomes which tend to be in the public system.  There is a dichotomy in access to hospital care, in particular.</p> <p>  On how we would achieve a single tier public hospital system which would focus on public patients only, we need to renegotiate the consultant's contract.  I am not sure of the numbers, but to the best of my knowledge there are still some consultants on the old category one and category two contracts.  The new category A consultants have been contracted to work in public hospitals only.  The category B and category C consultants have different terms and we need to re-examine these contracts.  One possible way of doing so is to say that if a consultant is able to treat private patients, he or she can only do so in a private hospital.  I think the old category two consultants had an entitlement to engage in private practice off site, whereas the new category one consultants do not.  If one wants to treat private patients, one should treat them off site.  Another option which was discussed in the context of hospital trusts five or six years ago would involve a consultant being contracted to work for a hospital or a hospital group and only being allowed to work within that group.  As I am not an expert on contract law, I do not know how one would do that.</p> <p>  On incentivising the treatment of public patients, having the money follow the patient might help in that regard.  The difficulty is how would one cap the numbers to ensure spending on hospital patients would not spiral out of control because it is a demand-led service.  Again, it would depend on the relativity in reimbursement for treating a public and a private patient.  Currently, having an additional public patient does not mean any additional income, whereas having an additional private patient does.  Under a system under which the money would follow both patients would bring additional income.  Therefore, it would becomes a matter of relativity, but the incentives would be greatly reduced in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Michael Harty raised the issue of transitional investment funding.  It will certainly be needed because before we start to move patients out of hospitals, we will need to ensure the necessary infrastructure at primary care level is in place in order that they will not fall through the cracks.  </p> <p>  On the funding of health service reform, it must be borne in mind that costs will accrue in the short term, whereas savings will accrue in the long term.  This might prove difficult politically.  That is the reason having a ten year plan is worthwhile.</p><p>On the issue of taxation versus social health insurance, while I am not against the latter, we already have a tax based system and I do not think the nature of the funding is the issue.  I do not think a move to social health insurance will necessarily improve matters for us.  It will, however, take up a lot of resources in terms of time and effort.  I do not see that as being a necessary step towards improving the situation.  </p><p> There is some merit in the co-payments option.  The report from the group chaired by Professor Frances Ruane which was published in 2010 looked at that issue in the context of payments for GP services.  The report suggested that people below a certain income threshold would not pay anything for GP services, while people in the next income band would pay no more than &euro;5, those in the next band would pay no more than &euro;10, those in the next band would pay no more than &euro;20 and so on.  Such a model, with a certain amount of co-payment linked to income, might work.  The roll-out of free-at-the-point-of-use GP care does not necessarily have to mean that all GP visits are covered.  We could decide that everybody gets five free GP visits per year and after that we go with the banded co-payment system as suggested by the Ruane group.  There are options there that could be explored further.</p><p> In terms of services, anything that is not medically necessary should not be covered under a universal, tax-funded health care system.  For example, if someone wants cosmetic surgery, the taxpayer would not be happy paying for that.  If a service is medically necessary, then it should be either free at the point of use or available with a subsidy or some kind of co-payment, depending on the nature of the service.  Not everything has to be covered.</p><p> Deputy Joan Collins asked about recruiting and retaining staff in the public sector.  That is certainly an issue and I do not have a short answer to it.  I am not sure exactly how to do it.  I certainly would not be opposed to having a stipulation that people who received their medical education in Ireland, subsidised by the State, should repay the State by working for a certain length of time in the public system after graduation.  That would be an acceptable way of getting junior staff into the system.  The issue then is how to recruit and retain senior staff, which is more complicated.  If the necessary investment is made in the health system and if it becomes a better system in which people want work, that will help.  Part of the problem at the moment is that some elements of the system are quite chaotic and frustrating for medical personnel but if we invest in the system and improve it, some of that will naturally dissipate and we might be able to recruit and retain more senior staff.  Certainly at a more junior level, the idea of a payback for the State subsidisation of medical education is a worthwhile option to pursue.</p></speech>

It is important to point out that we are not proposing to ban private health care.  We would not have the power to do that.  Indeed, all countries have some element of private health care.  We are not talking about eliminating all that or eliminating the jobs in that sector.</p> <p>  The other point we are making is that with a properly functioning public health system, we would need to greatly expand capacity, both in primary care and hospital care.  We would envisage significant numbers of people being recruited to the public sector in order to provide critical primary, community and social care supports.  It is six of one and half a dozen of another and it is important not to engage in any kind of scare mongering in that regard.</p></speech>

Deputy Harty made reference to a suite of services but I would prefer to call it a menu.  Who does Dr. Turner believe is best placed to draw up the basic menu or suite of services to which people will be entitled?  How will that be worked through?</p><p>Deputy Barry spoke about moving things from one system to another.  Does Deputy Barry's analogy assume that demand is static and that nothing new emerges as a treatment?  Let us say we are moving services from the private into the public health system.  Our population is increasing and ageing and at the same time, the costs of modern medicine, with drugs being a prime example, are escalating.  In that scenario, we will be fighting a losing battle.  Demand for services, whether essential or non-essential, will be constantly increasing.  I ask Dr. Turner to outline his views on that.</p><p>Dr. Turner's opening statement refers to out-of-pocket payments and suggests that the roll-out of universal access to GP care should involve increasing the income threshold on the GP visit card.  The logic behind giving universal access to children under six was to get them into the system early.  I know that many questioned why people with sufficient means should be able to bring their children to the doctor for free.  Speaking as a community pharmacist, I know that during the recession I was often faced with the difficult decision of whether to refer someone with three children to a doctor because it could cost &euro;150.  Even people with a good income might not have &euro;150 to spare.  I believe that free GP care for children under six is a good thing.  That said, I have three children under six and I am probably more likely to bring them to the doctor now.  </p><p>Does Mr. Turner believe it would be better to improve access for people with co-morbidities, like diabetes, obesity, heart conditions and maybe cancer?  Should we not try to deal with people with complex medical needs before giving universal access to, for example, 12 year olds who have no major medical needs?  How can one justify providing access to one group over another, even on an economic basis?</p><p>In terms of barriers to GP access, Dr. Turner suggested that we could consider giving everyone five free visits per year and then charging for any additional visits.  I ask him to elaborate on where that idea comes from and to outline whether there is research to back up the suggestion that five visits per year would be enough.  Would someone who is asthmatic, for example, also be entitled to half-an-hour with a specialist nurse per year?</p><p>On the question of disentangling the public and private systems, how would we go about doing that?  Does Dr. Turner believe that doing it on a specialty by specialty basis would be the way forward?  Before Christmas we discussed maternity services and the fact they are universally accessible, although many people opt to pay for private maternity care.  Would that be a good place to start?  Those who opt for private care pay approximately &euro;3,000 on top of their private health insurance in order to have a consultant leading their care.  They do so because they believe it is the safer option.  If we roll out the national maternity strategy and implement it in full, resulting in more confidence in the public system, then that might be a good place to start in terms of disentangling one from the other.  </p><p>Dr. Turner referred to the need for more money.  This seems to be a constant issue.  At almost every meeting, the Chairman refers to the fact our health spending, <i>per capita</i>, is one of the highest in the OECD.</p><p>I am conscious of a demand-led system and this unsustainable draw on revenue, especially when in another section Dr. Brian Turner said the system is not maximised and doctors are not used to their optimum because there are no theatre or scanning staff, for example.  I am concerned an economist would say we should give more money without creating efficiencies or making the system better.<br/><br/>What I took from Dr. Brian Turner&rsquo;s point about consultant pay is that it is not a pure matter but must be related to the average industrial wage or relative to living expenses.  Does he have data on why Ireland is unique and unusual in that we are required to spend almost the highest in the OECD on consultant pay?  Obviously, we are spending the highest in the OECD <i>per capita</i>but that is because of houses, school fees, wages, etc, impacting on that.<br/><br/>Dr. Brian Turner referred to the reduction of bed numbers in the 1990s due to the financial situation then.  I assume that was never rolled back on or compensated for when times became good.  Was that reduction ever addressed when Exchequer funding was available?  Will he elaborate on his statement that waiting lists are one way to ration services?  Is that hoping that people will get worn out waiting or might die?</p></speech>

It is an issue with which I have a problem.  This is never suggested for architects or anyone else who has the capacity to avail of a good education system.  Can we find a way to incentivise our health professionals?  It is not that long ago when nurses left college, went abroad for six months or a year and then came back to work in the public health service.  There was no need to coerce them to do so.  If we insisted health professionals had to give back, would Dr. Brian Turner not agree we would have to do it for every cohort of professionals?  I do not know what arts graduates like myself would give back.</p></speech>

We heard evidence at the committee late last year from Professor Allyson Pollock of Queen Mary University of London in which she stated the committee might consider the Canadian model.  The two characteristics of this model, as she presented it to the committee, are that it is a tax-based, single-tier health care system, free at the point of use, somewhat like the National Health Service in the UK, but perhaps taking a step further down the road.  This is linked to a ban in Canada on private health insurance.  Professor Allyson Pollock suggested this could be considered as an option by the committee.  I object to that approach being described as scaremongering.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.393" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Brian Turner" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FUH2017012500002#L01200"><p>On Deputy Kate O&rsquo;Connell&rsquo;s question on who should determine medical services, it has to be clinician-led.  Based on the thematic review of responses received on the White Paper on the universal health insurance proposal, one area of concern for many was with the basket of services.  This would need to be handled carefully.  Who decides what services are covered in public hospitals now?  It basically seems to be medically necessary services.  I am not sure there is a menu anywhere of what that covers.</p> <p>  Demand is increasing on an ongoing basis.  If one looks over time, the proportion of GDP, gross domestic product, spent on health care across the world is on a long-term upward trend.  There have been debates in several countries about sustainability.  A good report written by John Appleby for the King&rsquo;s Fund in 2013 suggested public spending on health in Europe, as a proportion of GDP, could increase from 6.7% to 13% by 2060.  He discussed sustainability issues around that.  There is no assumption that new treatments do not become available.  Medical technology is improving all the time.  If anything, there is an implicit assumption that treatments will advance on that.</p> <p>  On the changing eligibility for GP-visit cards from age-based to income-based, I was looking at it from the point of view of who has the most trouble accessing services and for whom is there a significant financial barrier to accessing services.  There are two groups, namely those who visit their GP more often and those on low incomes.  With the under-sixes and the over-70s, we have largely covered the people who visit more often.  In expanding it to the six years to 11 years age category, I stated in a submission to the public consultation on this that at the press conference on budget 2015, the then Minister, Deputy Varadkar, suggested expanding free-at-the-point-of-use GP care to that age group would not cost a huge amount because the capitation rates are lower as that age category would not visit the GP as often.</p> <p>  If that category does not, then maybe we should focus instead on those for whom there is a significant financial barrier to accessing GP services.  The people who delay going to their GP may end up needing hospitalisation by the time they go about getting treatment.  There are always trade-offs and no right or wrong.  My suggestion, however, would be that we should focus on income rather than age.  Those with complex needs is another issue to be considered.</p> <p>  On the question of a certain number of visits per year, I threw five out there as an example.  The Central Statistics Office quarterly national household survey module on health in 2010 broke down the number of GP visits per year by various different cohorts.</p><p>If memory serves me correctly, the average number of GP consultations among adults who reported those consultations was 4.3.  If we include the number of people who did not see a GP, then the average number of consultations was 3.2.  There is evidence to suggest that the typical number of visits per year is somewhere between three and four.  Obviously, that is complicated by the fact that some patients have medical cards and would tend to go more frequently.  Others may be younger and, therefore, would go less frequently.  If one were to go down that road, more analysis would be needed to come up with a figure.  That is one option to deal with it.<br/><br/>I was asked about distinguishing between public and private health care.  The provision of maternity services is an interesting example.  In Cork, Cork University Maternity Hospital is the only show in town in terms of maternity services.  Public and private patients are mixed together there.  Maternity services are unusual in that we cannot exactly have a waiting list for certain maternity services.  Maternity services are also unusual in that they are not fully covered by health insurance.  There is a significant co-payment, even for those who have private health insurance.  Certainly, it is an example of where we could start to examine the system.<br/><br/>Reference was made to the high health spend <i>per capita</i>relative to the OECD average.  Yet, people say more resources are needed.  Again, to a certain extent this stems from the under-funding for over a decade in the 1980s and 1990s and the fact that the resulting deficit was never fully unwound.  Our bed numbers are still below what they were in 1980.  The number is approximately 15,000 at the moment, compared with 18,000 in 1980.  We are below the historical figures in terms of bed numbers.<br/><br/>A question was asked about moneys versus efficiencies.  I do not think it is a question of either one or the other.  We need to spend more but we also need to ensure that we spend wisely and that efficiencies are harnessed.<br/><br/>Reference was made to waiting lists as one way of rationing care.  I am not for a moment suggesting that people should be made to wait until they give up.  From an economic point of view, no health system in the world has sufficient resources to give everyone the care they need when they need it.  Resources have to be rationed in some way.  The use of waiting lists is one way of rationing services.  Eligibility to services on the basis of ability to pay is another way to ration services, but it probably has more adverse consequences for those who cannot get into the system.<br/><br/>Deputy O'Reilly referred to the possibility of medical staff being asked to stay on while we do not ask the same of those working in other areas.  To a large extent we do not have the same shortages in others areas as in health.  However, I understand Deputy O'Reilly's suggestion that we are perhaps singling out one cohort.<br/><br/>The question of incentivising health professionals to work in Ireland or to return to Ireland was raised.  Again, if we invest in the system and improve the public system, there will be a natural element of people seeking to work in the system or, to put it another way, not wanting to not work in the system.<br/><br/>Deputy Barry referred to the Canadian system.  I would not profess to be an expert on the Canadian model.  I was under the impression that rather than private health insurance being banned, there is a ban on private health insurance covering anything that is covered by the statutory system.  In other words, private health insurance can cover care not covered by the statutory system and it operates purely as a complementary health insurance system.  I am open to correction on that point.  Certainly, the Canadian model has been proposed as a good model, although in terms of health spending as a proportion of GDP, Canada is at the higher end of the scale.  I gather it is one of the higher spending countries, notwithstanding the fact that we are, temporarily at least, one of the highest spending countries.<br/><br/>Another point to note relates to the peculiarity of the figures in looking at health spending as a percentage of GDP.  Given the 26% increase in GDP in 2015, our health spending as a percentage of GDP in 2015 will, I imagine, suddenly come down below the OECD average again.  We will come down the rankings simply because our GDP has gone up and the denominator has increased.  Health spending <i>per capita</i>may be a more useful measure in that sense.<br/><br/>Deputy Durkan asked about the hospital services generally retaining and recruiting professionals in other countries.  The honest answer is that I am unsure how they do it or what the mechanics are.  Certainly, we are facing a shortage of professionals.  Some other countries are below the OECD average in this regard.  However, I have not undertaken any investigations into why that is the case &ndash; I would rather not hazard a guess.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.402" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Emily O'Conor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#F00300"><p>May I begin with an apology?  Despite the committee's invitation being dated 16 December, it got to me at 3 p.m. yesterday.  The absence of a more prepared opening statement reflects no disrespect to this committee, but rather reflects the reality that the executive of the IAEM is a voluntary organisation with no administrative support and composed of consultants working full-time in emergency medicine.  As I am sure that the committee is aware, it has been a busy few weeks.</p> <p>  I thank the committee for the invitation to speak.  There are one or two factual inaccuracies in its draft of my opening statement, but I will submit a corrected version to the secretariat and this will be available to members.</p> <p>  Crowding in emergency departments is caused by the boarding of admitted inpatients on trolleys in those departments because there are no beds available on the wards.  These patients have completed their emergency phase of care.  They are not so-called inappropriate attenders, drunks or those with minor illnesses or injuries.  That group of patients does not need hospital beds.  Inpatients on emergency department trolleys cannot be diverted from needing a hospital bed by improving general practitioner, GP, care, at least not in the short or intermediate term.  General practice needs investment in its own right and, in the long term, its role in preventative medicine and chronic disease care will reduce the need for hospital care.  However, that is in the future.  Patients boarding on emergency department trolleys are not victims of poor care from GP or emergency medicine.  Mostly elderly, they are victims of a lack of capacity across the entire health care system.  They need hospital beds.</p> <p>  Crowding in emergency departments - the boarding of admitted inpatients on trolleys in emergency departments - is the overflow valve of the Irish health care system.  We do not say "No".  We do not close our doors.  We should not be allowed to become "full".  Crowding in emergency departments is not caused by the departments themselves, but by a capacity deficit across the entire health system.  Crowding in departments causes significant reputational damage to Irish health care and emergency medicine in particular.</p> <p>  Approximately 1.3 million citizens attended emergency departments in 2015.  Last year, the number attending the emergency department that I work in, Connolly Hospital Blanchardstown in west Dublin, rose by 8.7%.  That is likely reflected across the system and should come as no surprise.  Our population has grown, our people's health care needs have become more complex, we are surviving for longer with conditions that previously would have killed us, and we expect and are told to expect timely care.  Adding the 8.7% to which I referred to the 2015 figure of 1.3 million emergency department attendances means an extra 100,000 attendances last year.  Approximately one quarter of people attending go on to need hospital beds.  In broad terms and based on my calculations, an extra 20,000 to 30,000 patients needed admission from emergency departments to hospital beds last year.  We need more beds.</p> <p>  This is not to say that crowding in emergency departments is new.  Patients have suffered boarding or warehousing on emergency department trolleys for nearly two decades.  I remember statements from Members of the Oireachtas in the past.  I believed that the situation would improve.  It did not.  It is getting worse.  There were 520 people on trolleys yesterday.  One of the inaccuracies in my submission can be seen here.  I wrote "286", but last year's target for the maximum number of patients to be boarded on trolleys during the winter initiative was actually 236.  For those patients, even that target was unambitious and posed an unacceptable clinical risk, but did we ever have a hope of meeting it?  The answer is not with current bed capacity.  We lost so many beds from the acute hospital sector in the 1980s and 1990s that we are now down to 2.8 acute hospital beds per 1,000, which is well below the OECD norm of 4.3.</p> <p>  Over the decades, processes have improved across the system, even if that improvement has been patchy.  We tried to cope and keep patients moving through the system, but we failed.  We fail patients every day.  The UK has approximately the same percentage of acute hospital beds per thousand.  There was significant investment in process change in the UK.  It started just after I left there in 2000 and saw the introduction of targets, leading to a reduction in trolley waits.  However, that improvement has reversed because the UK has run out of bed capacity.  The NHS is experiencing crowding in emergency departments because of inadequate bed capacity across its health care system.  I have included in my submission a reference to the Royal College of Emergency Medicine, which has a great deal of information on this matter.</p> <p>  Ireland needs capacity built into general practice, community care and home care, but we will see headlines about the trolley crisis again next year unless acute hospital bed capacity is built or commissioned now.  Hospital beds must be commissioned, built, opened and staffed.  Crowding in emergency departments causes a greater risk of preventable deaths, poorer medical outcomes and longer lengths of stay and lessens the chances of those aged over 75 years returning to their pre-admission health levels.  Evidence from high-quality international studies is freely available and widely accepted.  I can supply references to committee members if necessary.</p> <p>  Overcrowding is also undignified and uncomfortable.  It is noisy and always bright.  In one's moment of crisis, imagine giving intimate details to a doctor - me - in a corridor where it is so noisy that one has to shout.  Imagine having diarrhoea and queuing for a single toilet cubicle with 20 other admitted patients.  This happens.  Imagine having an ECG or heart trace done in a public corridor.  Imagine being immunocompromised, perhaps post chemotherapy, and sharing a corridor with ten others all coughing loudly.  Imagine shouting at the nurses and then feeling guilty because one knows it is not really their fault.</p> <p>  Imagine being a nurse coming onto a night shift to care for ten patients who are over 75 years of age and have all been on trolleys since one left the night before when one promised them that beds were coming.  Imagine that feeling of hopelessness that they are still there.  Imagine being an enthusiastic doctor who comes on shift every day knowing that there are lots of patients in the waiting room who have been waiting hours to be seen and there is no place to see them.  The doctor takes a history in the corridor, but there is no place to lie the patient down for an abdominal exam.  The doctor circles the department for any spot that will provide a bit of privacy.  He or she finds a space, but before the doctor gets the patient there, another patient takes it, so the doctor starts again.  Imagine how enthusiasm wanes.  Imagine how relationships turn sour.  Spend years doing this and understand how it breaks morale in a department and in a specialty.  Are we surprised that recruitment is difficult?</p><p>We are again going abroad to recruit nurses while we export our own to countries with better resourced emergency medicine.</p><p> Ireland has excellent medical schools with large numbers of students interested in emergency medicine.  We have excellent core and higher training in emergency medicine, delivered by consultants in emergency medicine, as well as producing high quality consultants in emergency medicine.  However, they cannot work in our public system.  The conditions for patients are too poor, the environment too hostile.  There are more Irish consultant emergency physicians in the Australian state of Victoria than in Ireland.  We produce five home-trained consultants in emergency medicine every year,  I can only name one or two who have gone through a Public Appointments Service competition over the past several years and have been appointed to a permanent post.  Instead, they are going into temporary locum posts, full-time private practice or leaving the country.</p><p> Ireland has 80 consultants in emergency medicine spread over 29 emergency departments.  Some emergency departments do not have a consultant in emergency medicine on call out of hours.  This is not acceptable.  The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine, IAEM, has done work on a staffing document showing how appointing consultants in emergency medicine gives breadth and depth of care.  With adequate numbers, we can look at extending hours of direct shop floor care and resuscitation.  We can have consultant-delivered clinical decision units and ambulatory care to further deliver admission avoidance.  Without more consultants in emergency medicine, we will continue to have a pyramidal system with most care delivered by doctors in training rather than fully trained consultants.</p><p> Consultants in emergency medicine, both in leadership and direct clinical care, are essential for the running of high-quality emergency medicine care.  However, we do not work in isolation.  On the shop floor seeing patients and supervising NCHDs, non-consultant hospital doctors, I need diagnostics and not just between nine and five.  I need to be able to access community beds and services and not between nine and five, Monday to Friday.  We need to move away from pretending that patients come for medical care just between nine o&rsquo;clock and five o&rsquo;clock.  We must stop making them wait until the next day or the following Monday to get the diagnostics or services they need.</p><p> There is hope, if the Government can deliver bed capacity and conditions to allow trained staff to stay.  Irish emergency physicians are trained to the highest standards.  Irish emergency medicine is delivering on training.  We know what good care looks like.  Let us keep our doctors at home.  Irish nurses are internationally sought after.  Let us keep them at home.  The Government needs to create capacity by building beds where needed, perhaps modular, and staffing beds where they already exist.  We must allow people to get good emergency care, allow them to come in from the waiting room to a vacant cubicle to be seen and allow them flow through into a bed when they need one.  We must also allow them home or into other care when they are ready.</p><p> Processes need to be efficient and we have done extensive work on this.  In 2012, the National Emergency Medicine Clinical Programme published a model of care which describes in some detail the processes needed and our path forward such as trauma networks, emergency care networks, local injury units, clinical decision units, staffing levels and advanced nurse practice.  We know where we need to go.</p><p> We have leadership in emergency medicine locally and nationally to show the way.  The Government must give us space to do our job and allow patients to move on from trolleys in emergency departments so that the incoming patients can be seen.  Access to public emergency care is a cornerstone of our society.  How we treat our citizens in their moment of crisis marks us.  It marks committee members and me.  The Government must stop warehousing or boarding inpatients on trolleys in our emergency departments.  It risks killing them.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.405" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Patricia King" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#G00300"><p>The Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, is pleased to address the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health on the critical and topical issue of overcrowding in all our hospital emergency departments.  This engagement is all the more important days after 612 patients, admitted for inpatient treatment, were left on trolleys in our overcrowded hospitals.</p> <p>  ICTU has monitored with increasing concern the marked increase in hospital overcrowding in recent years.  We note that it is the elderly and ordinary workers, as well as their families, who suffer most through that overcrowding and the compromising of care that follows.  Congress has also been informed on an ongoing basis of this situation through the work of our health union affiliates and, on a daily basis, by the trolley-ward watch figures released by the Irish Nurses and Midwives Organisation, INMO.  In that regard, and to graphically measure the extent of the growing crisis, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to appendix 1 in our written submission.  This records the unacceptable increase in the number of admitted patients on trolleys in emergency departments or throughout hospitals over the ten-year period from 2006 to 2016.  These figures confirm that, notwithstanding the measures taken, the reality is that overcrowding continues, unabated, with a record number of admitted patients on trolleys in 2016 of 93,621.</p> <p>  In terms of a political response, we remind the committee that, in 2006, the then Minister for Health and Children declared that 486 people on trolleys was a national emergency, which required a significant and sustained response.  Regrettably, history shows the required response was not forthcoming.  After 2008, the economic recession saw our public health service subject to significant contraction in overall financial allocation, staffing numbers through a recruitment embargo and the resultant closure and curtailment of services including the closure of public acute/long-term care beds and the restrictions on community nursing and support services.</p> <p>  This contraction, which was unmanaged and undertaken without any risk assessment or reference to the growing concern of health service staff who saw the implications, has, without doubt, been a major contributory factor to the record levels of emergency department overcrowding now taking place.  In addition, and as a direct result of flawed decision-making and policy analysis, emergency department overcrowding was exacerbated under the guise of the reconfiguration of services particularly in such areas as the mid-west and the north east.  I refer the committee again to appendix 1 to see the damage done when budget considerations determine health decisions, regardless of their impact upon services, patients or staff, for example, Limerick and Drogheda.</p> <p>  In the context of the current, record, level of overcrowding ICTU believes the problem must be addressed, with both short and medium-term measures, recognising overcrowding in emergency departments is not the fault of emergency departments.  It is simply the outward manifestation of a public health service too small to cater for the demands being placed upon it, year on year, through changing demographics, health expectations and scientific developments.  Hospital overcrowding cannot be laid at the door of senior managers who are not given the resources, both in terms of acute and community-based services, to adequately respond to the demands being placed upon any given hospital.  It is also worth noting that any individual hospitals ability to respond to this ever increasing demand is influenced by its own bed capacity, access to transitional or long-term care beds, access to primary and social care services, including public health nursing or home help and other supports.  In other words, capacity, both in terms of capital and human resource, are central to resolving this problem.</p> <p>  Short-term actions must include an immediate requirement that all hospitals roster senior clinical decision makers over the extended day on a seven-day week basis, at least until the end of this winter period.  This will aid the speed of decision making in the hospital environment, thereby assisting patient flow as decisions to admit or discharge or refer are made quicker.  Special measures must be taken to alleviate the staffing crisis which exists right across our hospital services at this time.  This will have to include, at least for a defined period, incentivised measures so that we minimise the impact upon patient care arising from overcrowding.  Special measures must also be taken to allow for the re-opening of public acute and long-term care beds, again including incentivised measures where required, so that we make maximum use of all available bed stock.</p> <p>  The committee must note that, as of today, approximately 150 acute beds are closed with hundreds of long-term public beds closed all due to staff shortages.  Senior management, who can make resource decisions, must also be present on a seven-over-seven basis until the end of the winter period.</p><p> In terms of medium-term solutions, by which we mean a three to five-year period, congress believes the capital and current funding necessary to increase acute bed capacity by at least 1,500 must be provided, with the additional beds being allocated in areas where the need is greatest.  We remind the committee that, if one refers to OECD figures, Ireland has 2.8 beds per 1,000 population.  The OECD average is 4.8 beds.  Congress believes there is also a need for a significant and sustained investment to increase public long-term bed capacity which would have both a capital and ongoing cost.  This is in recognition of the massive change in demographics that will occur in the coming years, given the reality that this will see us with an ageing population with co-morbidities requiring high levels of intervention and support to maintain people's quality of life and, where possible, their independence.  </p><p> There is also a need for investment in primary care-community services, which would see them operate on an extended day basis in a seven day cycle.  This should help to provide access to services and individual care supports, as required, as an active and more effective alternative to attendance at an emergency department.  This would also require significant and sustained investment as currently most primary care-community services are available on a Monday to Friday basis, with only urgent and priority cases being serviced at the weekend and on public holidays.  This is not a model of delivery which keeps people out of hospital.</p><p> ICTU holds the view that the ever increasing levels of overcrowding in hospitals must be viewed as being totally unacceptable and a reality which, notwithstanding the economic constraints, cannot be allowed to continue.  No public acute hospital can function safely with bed occupancy rates of up to 100% when anything over 85% is viewed internationally as overcrowding.  It can only be addressed, however, by a complete realignment of our current approach to health care which views emergency departments as separate from all other parts of the public health system.  The only way in which we can address the overcrowding is by integrating care services through a series of initiatives which include increasing acute bed capacity, transitional-long-term care bed capacity and expanding community nursing and other support services, as well as home care services.  ICTU and, in particular, its health union affiliates will fully support all investments and new ways of working designed to increase public health services capacity, ensure full integration of care services, from the home to supported living, long-term care and acute intervention.  We reference congress's submission to the special Committee on the Future of Healthcare to demonstrate our commitment to such radical change.</p><p> We thank the committee for its time and look forward to engaging with it in order that we can elaborate on this submission or answer other questions it may have.  My colleagues, Mr. Doran, will field many of those questions.</p></speech>

I also thank the staff of the committee who helped us to put this presentation together.  <br/><br/>I will begin by telling the committee about Patient Focus.  I will then discuss our perspective of overcrowding in emergency departments.  <br/><br/>Patient Focus is a national patient advocacy service.  It was set up in 1999 and established as a company with charitable status shortly afterwards.  It has four staff and is funded by the HSE at the rate of &euro;216,000 per annum.  Last year we also received some funding from the national lottery.  Each year we provide support for between 500 and 600 new clients who have been damaged in some way in the health care system.  Most have suffered damage, much of which is very serious.  Some have been damaged in emergency departments, as also happens in all other areas of hospital care.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  Our approach to healing hurt caused in the health care system is by means of patient centred advocacy.  It is not widely known that many people are hurt, injured or die each year because of the provision of inadequate care.  We are best known for our work in supporting and advocating for patients on several major issues.  They include baby deaths and injury in Portlaoise and elsewhere; miscarriage misdiagnosis; unnecessary caesarean hysterectomies and ovary removals at Our Lady of Lourdes Hospital; and symphysiotomy.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  It seems to our clients and us in Patient Focus that much of the public discourse on emergency departments is about overcrowding and the dangers it undoubtedly creates, particularly at times of pressure during the winter months, at weekends and during bank holiday weekends.  Our clients tell us of a service that is at skeleton levels at these times.  They also tell us of a service in which adverse events occur during normal times all too frequently.  The examples they have given us in recent years include problems with unborn infants not picked up at birth, despite the mother raising concerns, and with small children who were brought to emergency departments and whose mothers were not listened to when they raised concerns.  Examples also include children not being transferred in a timely fashion to specialist centres; misdiagnoses of illnesses leading to a shortening of life and-or permanent injury;</font>a man being found dead in a hospital corridor that was considered to be a &quot;virtual ward&quot;; no staff being available to assist in helping a patient from a trolley to meet their toilet needs, resulting in forced incontinence; and no proper meals.  <font color="#2F2F2F">These events are not reported in the media unless they can be linked with a daily trolley count.  In our view, this tends to set the media agenda in a way that is not helpful to patients.  It is easy for the media to cover issues of quantity, but, in our view, it serves to put the resolution of issues of quality and safety even further down the line.  It is our strong feeling that, for these issues to be resolved, every group must buy into the finding of long-term solutions.  Problems in emergency department are related to problems in other parts of the system.  The dignity and safety of patients are sometimes sacrificed.  It is almost as if the system, with its competing vested interests, seeks to maximise the horror at critical periods.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  Those who work within the system have a duty to ensure their individual professional approach is patient centred.  They also have a duty to insist on their representatives not seeking to maximise the lack of dignity and safety in a way that is ultimately anti a systemic solution.  It is hard at times to escape the impression that some interest groups like to use the chaos in unhelpful ways.  This is easier than working with others to seek long-term solutions to the chaos.</font>If there are groups within the system which are acting against the interests of patients, it needs to be said.  Courage is needed, but sometimes it seems as if it is sadly absent.  HIQA made several national recommendations about how emergency departments should be run to ensure the safety and dignity of patients.  We believe that where there is a will, there is a way.<br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  We have suggestions for improvements.  Community services need to be developed and expanded on a statutory basis as a matter of urgency.  Nursing care teams must be extended, including employing more advanced nurse practitioners.  Public health nurses must be upskilled to carry out procedures in which some are not currently skilled or do not see as their role.  GP services must be more effective such that sending a patient to an emergency department is seen as a last resort.  GPs should be able to make direct referrals to the specific speciality and patients should be seen on arrival rather than having to sit for hours in an emergency department waiting for assessment and referral to the speciality.  Good social care services independent of the health service need to be set up because there is duplication of assessment procedures.  Palliative care services in the community need to be available nationally, including a 24-hour service supported by public health nurses.</font><br/><br/><font color="#2F2F2F">  Developing medical, nursing and social care services in the community is expensive.  However, in the longer term it is cost effective and, most importantly, provides safer care for patients in their preferred place of care - their home.</font></p></speech>

My questions are directed at all of the delegates.</p> <p>  The programme for Government gives a commitment to the establishment of a performance management unit.  What are the delegates' views in that regard?  Do they think it would have a chance of working or would it just be like the special delivery unit and not deliver anything special or otherwise?</p><p>On the conversion of agency staff, the first two submissions mentioned the need to recruit additional staff as being central to the creation of more capacity within the system.  I have questioned the Minister on this several times, and I am interested to hear from those at the coal face how the job of converting agency staff into directly employed staff is working.  It is obviously cheaper to employ direct staff.  Is the spare money being used to employ additional staff?</p><p> On the bed capacity review, have any of the organisations represented here been involved in that?  I understand that it is under way at the moment.  I would appreciate a comment on how the Irish Congress of Trade Unions, ICTU, is able to identify that there are a minimum of 150 beds available and yet the Government says we need to have a bed capacity review.</p><p> On primary care, there are separate budgets.  We have heard this from the HSE many times.  The budgets for the acute services and primary services are kept separate.  How willing is the system to give up some of the budget in the acute sector in order to fund the primary care sector?  How are we going to bridge that gap?  To use the phrase that Professor Drumm used to use, everybody is in a big silo.  Until people start talking to each other we are not going to be able to see very much progress.</p><p> My final question is specifically for ICTU.  Special measures was mentioned twice at point number eight.  Will ICTU elaborate on the special measures envisaged, and the timeframe for implementing them?  What is the ambition for the outcome?  If the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, came in here and granted the special measures, what are they?  Will ICTU tell us?  How soon are they going to have an effect in terms of bodies physically present and working on the front line?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.412" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#J00200"><p>I thank the witnesses for their detailed presentations.  On the basis of the presentations made, it would appear there are around 26,900 people per week attending accident and emergency departments, or around 3,800 per day.  If there is a 20% increase in that there is huge pressure on the system, and a sudden 20% increase would not be unusual.  On the 29 units, it was said that some of the units do not have consultants on call at particular times.  I recently had a meeting with the Mercy University Hospital.  It has a consultant on call for only 55 hours, yet it has a 24/7 accident and emergency department with over 30,000 attendances per annum.  How many units do not have a consultant on call, and during what periods are consultants not on call?</p> <p>  An issue was raised with me by young general practitioners recently who are afraid of starting out on their own in general practice because they are afraid of the job insecurity.  I recently spoke to a GP working in Canada who works a number of sessions in the local hospital.  We do not seem to have that connection.  The young GPs said to me that they had no problem starting up a new GP practice if they could also get hours in the local hospital.  I came across someone who practiced paediatrics for five or six years and then dropped out of the system and went into general practice. That person has huge experience in paediatrics, yet cannot use that experience in a hospital.  Has employing GPs ever been looked at from the hospital point of view.  I am not saying full time, but rather three or four three hour sessions a week so that they have security of income.</p> <p>  We speak about the increase in accident and emergency all the time but we have not focused on the issue of excessive drinking and how that contributes to the increases.  What kind of percentage are we talking about?  I know that previously 30% of people were attending accident and emergency as a result of accidents related to excessive drinking.  While we are focusing on accident and emergency departments, the HSE and the Department, we are not really focusing on people's own responsibilities as well.  I would appreciate an outline on that issue, which is an important one.</p> <p>  I agree with Ms King about the number of beds.  The Minister was in the Seanad earlier today and said that the last time a major hospital was built in this country was 1988.  Even at a time when there was money available we did not focus on this, and we still have 2.8 beds per thousand when the OECD average is 4.3.  What type of programme would people like to see over the next ten years with regard to new hospitals, and how many new beds should be created over that time period per annum?</p></speech>

I will start with Dr. O'Connor's comments, which I agree totally with.  I worked in Blanchardstown hospital as a senior registrar under Mr. Derek Barton a few years ago, and I know first hand the pressure that doctors are under.  Indeed, in my time, the recess room was located in a prefabricated building to the side of the emergency department.  I also note the increase in attendances of 8.7% in the last year, and that 25% of these people require admission.  Longer delays often lead to poor outcomes, with people failing to return to their pre-admission state.</p> <p>  Opening community beds outside of the nine to five model that we have currently was mentioned.  Ms King also touched on the fact that 150 acute beds have been closed and hundreds of long-term public beds have closed.  I know first hand from my own experience as I run a small community hospital in Belmullet, and we have had bed closures due to staff shortages.  We need to look at the role of the community hospital network in this country.  It should not be seen as a relic of a bygone era.  I am not talking about nursing homes here.  I am talking about community and district hospitals.  They truly alleviate the pressures of secondary care insofar as GPs can admit directly to the community hospital for problems such as urinary tract infections and chest infections which do not require admission to acute hospitals, thus preventing admissions to the acute sector.  They also facilitate discharges from the acute hospitals, for example, in the case of patients who perhaps after having had a hip replacement can be transferred back to a community hospital post-op and have their rehabilitation carried out with the help of a community physiotherapist.  That frees up a bed, which allows an emergency department patient to move into that bed.  There is another nuance here in that the community hospital network could act as an interface between the fair deal system and the acute sector.  If someone is in an acute bed and applies for the fair deal scheme to enter a nursing home, he or she could be waiting ten to 12 weeks in that acute bed.  There is nothing stopping us from transferring that patient to a community facility in the interim, prior to being transferred into a nursing home.  I would value any thoughts on that.</p> <p>  On what Ms Doherty said concerning some of the suggestions for improvements and that GP services must be more effective, I am a GP in a rural area and I totally agree with her.  On one day over Christmas my two practice nurses and I saw 141 patients, and we referred one patient to the emergency department.  That is because I have two practice nurses, who are both excellent.  They are both prescribers.  However, the system we have at the moment is that the HSE will fund one practice nurse per general practitioner which is insufficient.  We have a shortage of GPs.  Practice nurses are highly skilled and can carry out many of the roles a GP does.  We should look at funding more practice nurses for general practices, especially in rural locations.  I am 50 miles away from my local emergency department so I cannot be referring everything to the emergency department so we deal with it in the surgery.</p> <p>  On the Institute of Community Health Nursing, I am very supportive of that group.  I had on a Commencement debate today and I asked the Minister for Health to look at the funding for it.</p><p>They do terrific work and their client base is the community so we should value their role.  I would appreciate Dr. O'Conor's views on this and the other matters I have raised.</p></speech>

I understand that it is a continuation, or a remodelling, of the special delivery unit.  The Irish Association for Emergency Medicine has not been invited formally and an invitation has not been discussed.  I have heard the announcements the Deputy has heard but I do not have any further information.</p> <p>  Another question was on recruitment and on agency versus permanent staff.  I have experience of both.  Many nurses who came to us as agency nurses, and formed part of our number on a night shift, have been converted to permanent nursing staff following interviews.  I am aware of some progress in providing funding for new posts, particularly on the medical side.  In my own hospital we have had funding for an extra registrar on a temporary basis, which is an extra body on the payroll.  Until very recently there was a ceiling on payroll numbers for new staff.  Hospitals took any other means possible to get new staff on board without having to put them on the payroll and the only way we could do this was through agencies.  I knew doctors who wanted to do shifts with us as locums but I could not take them on myself.  They had to register with an agency and the hospital had to pay hugely inflated fees, both to them and the agency, to get them to come.  It is very welcome that the ceiling has been lifted so that we can take on board our own staff and it is really important that the ceiling does not come in again.</p> <p>  I was asked if we were invited to the bed capacity review.  No, I did not see a formal invitation and I am the president of the association.  We feel that if there is to be a review there should be no delay in starting to make things better.  We are not opposed to a review but we do not feel it is necessary before we get the ball rolling.  We have a short window of opportunity, whether this involves doing modular builds in certain hospitals which do not have enough beds or recruiting staff to open beds in hospitals that have closed wards.  We have a small window to get it started before it is too late to make any difference in time for next Christmas and new year.  We will participate in any bed capacity review but not at the expense of starting to commission beds, which needs to happen urgently.</p> <p>  I was asked about the primary care budget being separate and moving money from acute to primary care.  Both need funding.  We are very interlinked and if we have less money in acute care GPs will not be able to access the service and it will put more pressure on them.  Both areas need higher budgets and I am glad I do not have the job of allocating them.  The question on special measures was directed at ICTU.</p> <p>  Senator Burke asked about emergency departments.  My department saw an increase of approximately 8% last year but I have not seen the HSE increases.  I would say the increased attendance at emergency departments will be between 5% and 10% and between 25% and 28% of those patients go on to need an acute hospital bed.  I wanted to demonstrate how, based on the numbers alone and not taking into account increasing frailty and the higher complexity of conditions, we will need more hospital beds.  He also asked about the number of Departments where there was not a consultant in emergency medicine on call at night.  We have 29 departments and 80 consultants, an average of over two consultants per departments.  I cannot name them all but we have nine or ten emergency departments which do not have consultants in emergency medicine on call at night, though there may be a consultant surgeon or physician.  How would members feel if we ran obstetric units without a consultant obstetrician on call at night?  We do not feel this is acceptable.</p> <p>  We do GP working sessions in local hospitals and several GPs work on a sessional basis in our hospital.  It is a model that seems to have gone under the radar a little bit but it is in many departments around the country.  We have GPs contributing to our minor injuries stream and our ambulatory stream.  We cannot, however, give them security.  They are not permanent members of staff but come out of our special budget and I cannot say that budget will not be rearranged in the future.  Lots of GPs like to get their hands dirty, so to speak, by working in emergency departments but I cannot give them permanent contracts, even those who have been with us for many years.  It is extra income for them but is not a source of security.</p> <p>  I was asked about excessive drinking.  As an physician, I am entirely non-judgmental as to why patients need to come to an emergency department.  There are many societal bad habits that mean people end up in crisis and excessive drinking is one of them, as are drug use and lifestyle and behavioural issues.  I have no role in telling people what they should and should not do before they come to the emergency department.  I just want to be able to deal with them when they come.  I have heard of bad experiences of drunk people being kept in prison cells or Garda stations overnight.  If a young person, or an older person, is drunk to the extent that they are not fully conscious they cannot protect their own airway and they need to be in an emergency department.  We need to be resourced to look after them so that they do not compromise the care of other patients but it is the right place for them to be.</p> <p>  I was also asked about the type and number of new beds and the community care model.  I agree with Senator Swanick about our public care model for beds, not just the private nursing home sector.  There has been success in freeing up acute hospital care beds, including such measures as the winter initiative, and in reducing delayed discharges.  These people have completed their acute episode of care and need to move on to another type of bed.  We may have further improvement as the years go by but I do not know if we can change things for patients on trolleys between now and next Christmas.  We need to start opening acute hospital beds because, while process change should continue and there should be a continual improvement in step-down beds, transitional beds, community and nursing home beds, this will not be fast enough for patients lying on trolleys in our department.  We need current beds, opened and adequately staffed.  Where there is not enough physical bed space new beds need to be commissioned, in whatever form that can be done.</p> <p>  I fully agree with Senator Swanick and would like to see long-term care in community hospitals as well as in private nursing homes.  GPs can admit to community hospitals but I do not have much experience of this.  I fully agree that GPs should have a role in post-admission and transition care.  Transitional-type beds already exist in the system and for patients applying for fair deal there is a system whereby we get funding for these beds while they are waiting for fair deal to come through.  I hope the community care hospitals are involved in that.</p><p>With regard to busy GP practices, I am well aware that our GP colleagues have been absolutely overrun this Christmas.  They have felt the pressures as much as the acute hospital sector.</p></speech>

The fundamental problem is that our health service is too small, too narrow, not integrated and cannot cope with demand - full stop.  That has to be acknowledged.  It does not matter how we shape it up or talk about process.  That is the harsh reality of it.  No matter what measure we apply, acute bed, continuing care bed, traditional care bed or community-based services, none of them is sufficiently wide, deep, high or long to meet the demand that is placed upon them.  That must be accepted politically if we are to address this problem.</p> <p>  I will run down through the questions.  In fairness, my colleague, Dr. Emily O'Conor, has answered some of them on which we would not differ.  The programme for Government and the performance management unit was mentioned.  The one thing we are not short of with regard to emergency departments and health is management measuring.  What we are short of is anyone doing anything about it.  We can measure everything with regard to emergency departments now: age profile, length of stay, what colour socks a patient has - you name it, we can measure it.  However, it has gotten worse.  I will say quite clearly that we would not support more performance management people to oversee managers who oversee front-line staff who are understaffed, overworked and always held accountable when the thing goes wrong.  If we are going to empower, we have to empower the front line.  We have to address the consultant issue, the nursing numbers and the support staff issue.  We do not need more management.  We know what the problem is.</p> <p>  With regard to agency staff conversion, the committee should know that the latest figures we received from the HSE just yesterday confirmed, for example, that &euro;80 million was spent on agency employment for nursing staff last year.  That is roughly 800 staff per day, every day, for the year.  That figure is responding, as we understand it, to approximately 60% or 65% of the calls.  That is not the full need of the service.  The agencies cannot supply the full need because they do not have enough people on their books to do so.  That is-----</p></speech>

We could talk for six or seven years about the recruitment embargo and how that absolutely decimated the workforce, but in terms of managing it now, when a hospital seeks short-term relief, the people are not there.  Whatever chance there might be in Dublin, and it is a slim one, there is no chance at all outside of Dublin.</p> <p>  The nursing staff who wish to work are working, and that is good.  However, we do not have enough of them to meet service demand.  The &euro;80 million is the cost.  The conversion of that into permanent employment is an absolute must.  There have been repeated efforts to do it.  However, we are then in the arena of employment ceilings, pay ceilings and so on.  A hospital is told that, while it needs the staff, it is over the pay budget that it was given or is over its employment ceiling.  The only way a hospital has of getting someone in is if a director of nursing feels there is an absolute clinical need to go to the agency.  Does that deliver continuity of care and is it the way to staff a service?  Absolutely not.  In this year's service plan, there is a mention of 1,000 extra nursing posts.  I do not mean to be parochial.  That is to be funded primarily by that conversion.  That is very welcome, but we have to make it happen, and even if it does happen, it does not increase the overall nursing man hours in the system.  There will still be shortages and so on.</p> <p>  If I may, I wish to make a straightforward statement on that.  There was an outcome of an expert group report from last August that said that at least 107 nurses are required to look after admitted boarded patients in emergency departments on a dedicated permanent basis.  The idea of that is that the emergency department staff are then more free to look after their normal emergency department throughput.  The admitted patients would have a dedicated cadre of staff.  That expert group reported last August.  The Department and the HSE met.  There was ping pong between the two of them as to which was going to do anything about it.  We met them last Friday and were told that there was nothing in the 2017 budget or service plan to allow for the employment of those 107 nurses, end of discussion.  That is the reality of emergency department admitted patients and having a dedicated nursing staff for them.  There is nothing in the budget or the service plan for them, even though an expert formula has said that at least 107 are need.  We would argue that even more are needed.  However, nothing is being done about it.</p> <p>  On the bed capacity review, 150 beds is the tip of the iceberg.  The health strategy of 2001 called for 3,000 additional acute beds, with 650 of those to be private.  That was parked.  There was then the co-location idea in the 2006-2007 period, which was supposed to bring on about six hospitals with about 2,500 private beds on a co-located basis.  That was parked.  Whether one liked or disliked it, it would have meant an increase in our bed capacity in large acute hospitals.  However, it was parked.  We have done absolutely nothing about our acute bed capacity and our needs.  We have particularly done nothing about our continuing care and long-term care bed capacities.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Connor is absolutely right and we have to be very clear here.  While we argue with the HSE and so on, the one success story and good thing that has happened this winter is the reduction in the delayed discharges that took place.  Roughly 13 or 14 months ago, we had 800 or more people that were discharged but in an acute bed.  I think that is down to around 440 at the moment.  That is being driven by additional transitional care beds, additional home help under the winter initiative and a de-layering of the bureaucracy in access to the fair deal scheme, for which the waiting time is now about four weeks rather than ten to 12 weeks.  That has to be welcomed.  It is late, but it has to be welcomed.  The difficulty we have is that the demand for those types of beds will continue to increase.  Where are we going to get them from?  It does not matter how we de-layer the bureaucracy.  Where are we going to get the additional transitional and continuing care beds?  There is no plan to develop.  The capital thing about bed capacity is not just about the attention-seeking acute hospitals.  It also has to be about our long-term care.  We must remind everyone that 20,000 to 25,000 people will turn 65 every year for the foreseeable future and will increasingly present with comorbidities that will have to be addressed either with supports at home or in some kind of primary or acute care environment.  The bed capacity issue is massive and we have to address it.</p> <p>  How willing is the system to share?  Deputy O'Reilly asked that question.  It is simply not.  My money is mine and the Deputy's is the Deputy's and we do not share.</p></speech>

If an initiative might improve the patient flow and patient experience in one area but might incur cost in another area, it does not happen because it does not transfer.  This touches on Senator Swanick's comment about properly using district and community hospitals.  We have got to develop district and community hospitals in order that they can address a certain level of acute illness in their patient population.  That means that they must grow their nursing staff, expand their roles and so on.  We are on record of congress as wanting to do that since 2007.  The then CEO of the health service called it elder abuse to transfer people from a continuing care setting to an acute hospital when their situation could be managed in that continuing care setting through the expansion of roles.  We are still waiting to be engaged by the continuing care setting managers to deliver that, whether it is first-dose antibiotic, fluid balance, phlebotomy or whatever.</p><p>That has not happened and, recognising reality, it needs to happen.  The sharing of budgets is very poor.  It is very siloed and there is no integration.  The one thing we have done, badly at that, is we were moving towards integrated care structures in the health system and we have gone backwards in the past two years and become more siloed.</p><p> A question was asked about special measures in respect of the labour market.  Nurses and medical staff are no different to anybody else.  They respond to labour market realities.  When we talk about special measures, that includes monetary solutions but it is also about terms and conditions of employment and access to continuing education.  I am very passionate about developing access to a buddy hospital system whereby if I am a nurse in an emergency department, ED, perhaps I could have a contract which would send me over to the United Kingdom to do a specialist programme in emergency nursing and come back to my permanent job.  So it is about monetary compensation but it is also about issues of professional development, which are not available at the moment.  I wonder why nursing staff and support staff go in every day to emergency departments.  It is an absolute miracle that they go in every day to the same problem and try to cope with it when the situation around them has got worse.  We need special measures.</p><p> In terms of the numbers presenting, for the record, the national figure for attendances is up by 5.3% year-on-year to the end of December, according to the latest figures from the task force.  It is steadily increasing every year.  The point is very well made about lack of consultant cover.  As to whether the GP system is working, integrated care happens and then it does not happen in some spots.</p><p> In terms of causes of attendances, there is a problem undoubtedly about lifestyle.  We will not comment on the whys and wherefores of it but in terms of whether emergency departments are staffed to deal with that presentation, I do not think that is the case.  Thursday, Friday, Saturday and Sunday nights are very heavily influenced by alcohol and related issues and that presents huge challenges, not just for the staff but for the patients who are there for normal reasons and have to put up with the shouting and so on.  Security is very poor.</p><p> Bed capacity and timeframe issues will not be solved without the nettle being grasped.  We have not been invited to contribute to the bed capacity review from the point of view of either congress or my own house but I do not think it requires much science to work out that we need additional beds.  The trick is &ndash; this is a political issue &ndash; that there are greater needs in some areas than others.  The level of overcrowding has noticeably reduced in Dublin hospitals but outside of Dublin the situation has become significantly worse.  I do not say the situation in Dublin is good but it is not as bad as it was, whereas outside of Dublin it is about 20% worse than it was two or three years ago.  Hospitals are now experiencing overcrowding that never did before, for example, the level of overcrowding in Kilkenny and Tullamore is very bad.  The patient experience time is also very bad and staff are completely overburdened.</p><p> We have discussed community district hospitals and we have touched on transitional care.  The practice nurse is a vital cog in the wheel.  The practice nurse is part of the nursing infrastructure for the community and we hear a lot about primary care and community nursing.  For the record, at the end of December 2016, there were three more public health nurses employed than at the end of December 2015 but yet we speak about reorienting care into the community.  I listened to the submission by Patient Focus on growing the role of public health nursing and I agree with what was said.  A public health nurse is a highly educated professional and currently such nurses are not being properly utilised.  We had 1,700 and now we have only 1,500 because of the recruitment moratorium in the past eight years.  Only three have been added in the past 12 months.  That is not a sign of a commitment to offering an alternative to hospital care and to give a safety valve to the emergency departments and keep the frail elderly in particular out of hospital.  The Institute of Community Health Nursing does excellent work and we often work with it.  Such entities have a role to play in trying to devise policy but ultimately this problem will not be solved without making the health service bigger.</p></speech>

I will ask one or two questions before we move on to the next group of speakers.  On process and integration, is there a value in integrating primary care and secondary care in a much more active manner?  We have a model in Kilkenny where there is a highly developed integration between primary and secondary care which involves the streamlining of the flow of patients both into the hospital and out of the hospital.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Conor might respond to my second question.

Whether patients come via GPs directly to wards, via the MAU or through an ED, MAUs are not the solution to overcrowded emergency departments.  They offer an alternative process to getting to the acute bed but they will not solve trolley waits.  Kilkenny is experiencing significant trolley waits despite having an MAU at the moment.  If one only has 20 chairs, and one has 50 patients trying to get into them, it does not matter how many doors one puts into the room; they will not all get a seat.  We must remember that when we are talking about processes.</p> <p>  I can only speak for myself and I must be careful because the meeting is in public and my hospital manager probably has access to it.  What I experience is a tiered level of management.  I may have a good relationship with my local hospital manager but I work in a HSE hospital and much of the real decision making seems to be happening at group level and I have no access to the group CEO.  I depend on my voice being transmitted through the management executive team up to where the power and the money seem to be, which is at group level.</p> <p>  I am only one of many problems faced by my hospital manager.  She is trying to do the impossible task of managing elective bed capacity versus emergency bed capacity.  On some days, the elective care waiting lists are more of a priority for her boss and sometimes the number of patients on ED trolleys are more of a priority in terms of the pressure coming down from her boss.  Sometimes, no matter how loud I shout, the elective care cannot all be accommodated in the same acute bed pool.  Sometimes my voice seems to get through and at other times the voice of my surgical colleagues seems to be heard best because the emphasis is on waiting lists.  I would love to be more involved in management locally and I would love to have access to the real decision makers who seem to be the CEOs of hospital groups.</p></speech>

I am sorry that perhaps I am speaking from cynical experience, but the emphasis will go off trolley waits in the next couple of weeks.  We will still have lots of patients on trolleys but the media will stop picking up on it and, without meaning to cause offence, governmental interest will stop focusing on it.  Media interest might go onto patients waiting for elective surgery.  They are real patients who need to be seen.  Hospital management will have to respond to that.  We often use our surgical day ward capacity as a safety valve.  The surgical day ward does not normally take patients off the waiting list but on occasion, hospital management would close it to the waiting list and open it to the ED and yet that means patients will be off the elective waiting lists.</p><p>Our management will respond to the directives from above.  It is a see-saw and there is simply not enough bed capacity to accommodate both.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.435" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Doran" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#N00200"><p>I can only echo Dr. O'Conor's point about integrated care.  Everybody is for integrated care, with GP access to diagnostics and so on.  I will give a figure for Kilkenny, although I do not mean to be smart because I come from Kilkenny.  It does not please me to have to say this.  In 2010, there were 140 people on trolleys there for the whole year.  Last year, there were 3,144 people on trolleys.  That is in a unit that has really worked hard and that has great people in the clinical arena, including Dr. Garry Courtney.  They are just overwhelmed by a lack of beds and so on.</p> <p>  I can give some figures about the level of overcrowding.  In Dublin in 2007 we had 27,000 people measured on trolleys and last year we also had approximately 27,000 people measured on trolleys.  That number stood still with a growing population.  Looking at the hospitals outside Dublin, in 2007 there were 23,000 people on trolleys but last year there were 66,000 people on trolleys.  It has become three times worse outside Dublin because of the growth in the population, demographics, demand for services and so on.  Even when we have tremendous integrated care and collaboration with the general practitioners, practice nurses, primary care teams and the acute hospital, if we do not have enough beds, the end game is overcrowding because the accident and emergency door can never close.</p> <p>  With regard to clinicians in management, I do not have to choose my words quite as carefully as my colleague, Dr. O'Conor.  I do not have to go back to any hospital.  We have heard the phrase "clinicians in management" for years and two issues arise, with respect.  One is that general management do not like it; for example, they do not like putting nurses and doctors into management roles.  It is a case of nurses nursing and managers managing.  The other difficulty, with respect, is that clinicians at times find it difficult to move into the arena of the difficult job of management, where one must make choices.  Nobody is in any way downsizing the challenges facing a senior general manager, who has not got enough resources to respond to need.  It is very difficult.  There is a clinical director who is supposed to co-ordinate the work of all consultants and, if we are brutally honest, that can be a difficult job for that consultant, as his brothers and sisters do not always like him or her because of what they are required to do arising from that management component.  Clinicians have a clinical focus and they do not really want to do the management component.  Clinicians in management sounds very good but it often does not happen as well and it does not make the material difference as one might expect.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.436" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Brigid Doherty" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#N00300"><p>We absolutely agree with Mr. Doran's opening statement and Dr. O'Conor echoes how we feel exactly.  We do not need another report or review.  We must get on with this.  Personally, I am passionate about community care.  That money must be ring-fenced and we must do something now, even if we start small.  It concerns me greatly that there are community intervention teams in some parts of the country but not in others, so if I need antibiotics and I happen to live in Thurles, I will get them if I have a medical card but if I have VHI, I will not.  Neither will the VHI cover my patch so I will have to sit in Kilkenny hospital for three weeks purely to get antibiotics.  Something must be done about that.  It is a two-tier system, with medical card care by the community intervention teams provided by the Health Service Executive, HSE, versus the high subscriptions to private health care where they pick the patches for community care.  That is unacceptable and the issue must be examined.</p> <p>  There is the issue of developing community care teams.  There are plenty of skilled nurses out there and they need to be developed.  Particular care does not need to be provided in the accident and emergency departments.  I will go to the basics, like block catheters etc.  When a patient arrives, he or she must arrive by ambulance and these people will sit all day in the accident and emergency department before being taken home by ambulance.  There are dreadful conditions, with bursting bladders for example.  That is very basic but how it is.  There are many other aspects to consider but we must get on with it, even if we do it in small patches and not necessarily the whole country together.  Palliative care specialists do brilliant work and I ask that they integrate their services with community nurses as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.437" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#N00400"><p>I thank the delegations for coming before us.  I almost feel I am friends with them at this stage as I see them at so many committee meetings.  I will try to be as quick as possible and I will have to excuse myself immediately because I am supposed to be attending the water committee meeting as well.  I must show my face but I will look back at the replies here.</p> <p>  The figures for overcrowding are increasing outside Dublin but in Dublin they have basically remained the same but demand has increased.  Could one say things have improved?  Is that taking it a bit too far?  If capacity has not increased and demand has increased, are people just making this work?  Are there efficiencies?  I just want to tease out the issue in Dublin.  If we had not used private hospitals in the past eight weeks, what would we have been faced with?  Is there data on that?  Could Mr. Doran say from experience what sort of mess we would have been in if we did not have that capacity or the "valve" to release pressure?</p> <p>  The success of the winter initiative would be a reduction in delayed discharges.  Has there been any other success or anything else that was positive?  Could we learn something for next year?  I worked as a community pharmacist for the Christmas period and I do not think I have ever dealt with as many people in an awful state in that time.  I was working until after 8 p.m. on Christmas Eve dealing with people.  Is there anything we could do in the view of any of the witnesses to try to improve matters next year?  Do we need to examine buffers?  This year we had a strain of flu that was particularly difficult for older people so how could we predict that?  Taking that to a natural conclusion, what would happen if there was a massive disaster?  How would it leave trained clinicians like Dr. O'Conor with what they deal with already?</p> <p>  The comment that illness is a 24-hour phenomenon as opposed to something that happens from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. is quite interesting.  I remember speaking with an accident and emergency consultant one night who explained that a farmer had come in one night with a massive gash on his arm.  Instead of being able to deal with it at that point, remedial treatment was given and the fellow was kept stable.  There was no capacity to deal with it fully and the doctor had to make a decision based on what was available.  There were three or four subsequent operations with multiple doses of intravenous drugs to try to deal with it.  I think there were maggots in his arm by the end.  When something is not dealt with properly in accident and emergency departments, in the experience of the witnesses, what sort of knock-on effect is there?  I realise it is difficult to get metrics on that.  Are we constantly in this cycle of causing ourselves more problems?</p> <p>  In a health committee meeting this morning we had an economist who told us there were 3,000 beds taken out of the system in the 1990s.  It went from 18,000 to 15,000 beds.  Despite demographics and people expecting greater access to health care, are the witnesses saying the imbalance has never been addressed?</p><p>There is a plus three figure for public health nurses.  My mother is a public health nurse who retired last year or the year before that.  Is that a pure plus three or does it take into account senior nurses who have been made retire at 65 years of age, even if they do not wish to?  Obviously, if they wish to retire it is fine, but I know a number of people who do not wish to retire at 65 years of age.</p><p> To return to the management, Ms O'Connor mentioned her experience.  I do not wish to get her in trouble at work but could it be said, perhaps, that prioritising of patient need is not being done by clinicians but by management?  Is it fair for me to say that?  If that is the case, it must be exceptionally challenging for people bound by codes of ethics and registered with the Irish Medical Council and the like.</p><p> Finally, if there were three realistic things the witnesses could do tomorrow - I know that Dr. O'Conor's first would be more beds - or that they think could be done to try to fix things, will they say what they are?</p><p> I thank the witnesses.  I am sorry but I must excuse myself.  I will watch the rest of the committee's proceedings tomorrow.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.439" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#O00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their presentations.  The Committee on the Future of Healthcare is working in parallel with this committee and the witnesses have made presentations to that committee in that context.</p> <p>  The big challenge will be whether the State will have the ability to deal with the capacity issue in the health services.  That is something we will have to assess both in the political sphere and in society, in terms of how we are willing to fund, and who is willing to pay for, expanding the capacity of the broader health system.  When the witnesses talk about bed capacity they are referring to acute bed and intensive care unit bed capacity.  Then one moves out to the community care setting and to the home, using that bed capacity in the context of home care, home care packages, home care supports and intensive home care packages.  It is not just the acute hospital system - there is a lack of capacity across the system and in the nursing homes.</p> <p>  This meeting is primarily about emergency medicine and the overcrowding in our emergency departments in the last number of years.  If memory serves, a previous Minister declared a national emergency in 2006.  Then other emergencies were declared.  It was seen as the horror of all horrors.  There were 612 people on trolleys on the first Tuesday of 2017, so we have not addressed it.  I am putting questions so I can get answers or at least opinions on what we must do, so these are not my stated views but questions to which I wish to get answers.  I cannot get my head around the fact that, as an Opposition Deputy, I could have prepared a press release for the first Tuesday in 2017 last October, as a result of the trends over the past seven to ten years.  On the first Tuesday of every year there is a spike in the numbers on trolleys.  On every Tuesday of every week there is a spike in the number of people waiting on trolleys in emergency departments across the country.  While there is a huge capacity issue there is also an inability in the system to anticipate what will come through the front door, even though we all know it will come through that door.  In terms of rosters or preparedness to deal with the overcrowding in emergency departments, even on a short-term basis, why are we incapable of just anticipating what will come through the front door next Tuesday in the emergency departments?  We all know today that there will be a spike next Tuesday.  Why is it that management and stakeholders cannot collectively try to deal with that issue?  Why is it that there is a spike in numbers on the first Tuesday of every year and on Tuesday every week and why can we not deal with that?</p> <p>  Regarding Mr. Doran's point about dedicated staff for admitted patients, I have visited emergency departments once or twice myself or to visit a person in an emergency department or as an Opposition Deputy trying to help, or perhaps hinder, but at least to observe.  There appears to be no transitional place for patients who have been admitted to the inpatient system.  They are warehoused in busy corridors or in nooks and crannies in our emergency departments.  I always wonder why there is no capacity to build a proper annexe near the emergency department for people who are assessed, whose emergency treatment is over and who are now awaiting proper admission to the acute hospital system.  Why are they still on trolleys in corridors?  Could they not be on a trolley in a nice ward area before they go up to the hospital proper?</p> <p>  The reason I raise this is that Mr. Doran says we need dedicated staff.  We do not have that capacity in the beds in the acute hospital system.  In the meantime, patients on intravenous drips, people who are incontinent and people who are 90 to 100 years of age are waiting in corridors.  Is there any transitional place where patients could be put while waiting for acute beds to free up in the hospital proper?  I know it has been considered, but why has there not been action on it given that we have the emergency medicine task force?  It is a flawed name because the word "emergency" should not be there at all.  It has not been an emergency but has been very lethargic in assessing and anticipating potential problems or issues to ensure appropriate structures, processes and controls are in place.  Many of the witnesses are familiar with this.  There appears to be a neverending language about communication and the exchange of platforms between the HSE and relevant stakeholders, but for the last ten years we have had the most appalling incidents of people waiting inordinate lengths of time just to get to a place that is quiet and peaceful, before they are admitted to the hospital proper.</p> <p>  There was reference to the fact that we have 80 emergency medical consultants.  We have 29 hospitals that provide some form of emergency care.  Why are there only 80 consultants?  Is it because there has been no recruitment effort or because nobody wishes to work in the environment?  Is it because it is not remuneratively attractive?  What are the reasons for only having 80 emergency medicine consultants?</p> <p>  I seek clarity on another issue.  While there is bedlam and chaos in the emergency departments, the other end of the hospital is serene, tranquil and nicely managed.  There is 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. discharging and 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. access to diagnostics, five days a week, although I am aware that it has gone to 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. in some places.  Is there an onus on the stakeholders at the other end of the hospital, that is, the consultants and union representatives, to promote the concept of moving beyond 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.?  Let us be honest, Ms O'Connor has colleagues who are operating from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. while she is down in chaos.  Why is there not more emphasis on the professional or representative bodies to promote that concept of expanding hospital hours?  There was resistance by consultants to nurses being able to discharge, so it is not all just about the elephant in the room, which is the lack of capacity.  Are there any opportunities for us to improve and do better with what we have, bearing in mind that everything the witnesses and I have said here today must be funded by taxation?  Until recently the State simply did not have the capacity to fund even what we had, so that must be borne in mind.</p> <p>  On the issue of elderly people and nursing homes, Mr. Doran mentioned public health nurses.  We know the demographics and the assessments that will confront this nation in the next number of years in terms of the aging profile, life expectancy and the demographics in age profiles.  There will be huge demand in geriatric services and for geriatricians, nurse specialists, community care and so forth.  At the same time, if there is a difficulty in a nursing home in the evenings or out of hours it is quite likely that a locum doctor will attend.  They might not be familiar with the patient or even with the nursing home.</p><p>It is inevitable that the elderly person will be transferred by ambulance into an acute hospital, such as the one where Dr. O'Conor is working, in a state or crisis.  Why is there not more emphasis on the need to enhance geriatric services to include geriatricians and consultant geriatricians in our public and private nursing homes to ensure there is confidence in the system and to allow older people to stay in the nursing home?  Having spoken to representatives, I believe there is a reluctance to allow palliative care in nursing homes because it does not read well if people are passing away in nursing homes and there is the urgency then to move them on.  Is this an issue that must be addressed to deal with the points about overcrowding as outlined by Dr. O'Conor?</p><p> On the issue of discharging, earlier in the discussion I referred to the lines of demarcation and prescribing.  If one mentions to some GPs that nurses might prescribe, those GPs have apoplectic fits because they see it as a complete crossover into their area.  It was mentioned that pharmacists should have more of a role in front-line care provision which is another no-no for some people.  There is a need within the medical professions to embrace a bit of flexibility in the area of needing to accept that things must change for the betterment of people who avail of the services.  This applies also to the stakeholders and workers' representatives,</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.441" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#P00200"><p>I welcome our guests and thank them for their interesting presentations.  Going back to this morning's discussion, a medical consultant had previously intoned to me that medical economists were the cause of the problem, and he may not be wrong.  I recall a different era when it was fashionable to say that we wanted fewer beds.  I remember raising that question during the design stage of a hospital and a fairly long argument went on about the issue, an exercise about which I could not see the purpose, but the theory put forward was that people would be staying in beds for shorter periods.  That did not work either.  There is something in what my consultant friend said and was right about.  There is a problem that needs to be dealt with and I agree entirely.  We do need more beds.</p><p>I had occasion to be in a hospital in recent years and found beds in every corridor, in the waiting areas and at the reception area, with people being fed, bloods being taken and all at the same time and in the same place.  I asked why this was happening when a couple of wards were decommissioned around the corner.  I was told that it was less expensive to maintain the beds in the corridors.  My conclusion was to ask whether it would not be cheaper, or almost free, to have the beds out in the car park.  Pardon me for being cynical but these questions must be asked from time to time.  My conclusion remains that we need extra accommodation and we need to have it active, available and ready for emergencies.  The question then arises about how to utilise the spare capacity in ordinary time.  If we have the adequate capacity to meet the emergencies, and it must be made available, then the hospitals must have some way to deploy that spare capacity in ordinary time.</p><p>Will the witnesses explain how they deal with the recruitment issue?  For instance, are medical services people paid less in Ireland than in other jurisdictions such as the UK, France or the Middle East, which is the place everybody wants to go to nowadays?  Are we paying enough or are we paying less?  What is the comparison between rates of pay in the UK and Ireland, for example, for nurses, consultants and doctors, and how do we address the issues emerging from that?</p><p>The operation of the fair deal scheme is another issue that drives me up the wall.  One of the things that bugs me relates to geriatric care, as my colleague Deputy Kelleher has pointed out.  This care is delivered by way of nursing homes and by public, old-fashioned community hospitals.  On the one hand we have the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, decommissioning public facilities and reducing bed and ward capacity in accordance with some mysterious policy.  I do not know if this makes any difference to some patients.  Generally speaking, elderly patients in a nursing home like to be able to talk to each other, their ward neighbours or the people down the corridor.  I wonder what exactly the cause is and where the inspiration came from that money should be spent in subdividing wards to create less space at a time when more space is required.  It bugs me that in the assessment used by the fair deal scheme, which I understand is being reviewed at the moment, the family home of the person is taken into account, even where the family home is not available for a particular reason.  Maybe a person with a disability or a long-term illness has an entitlement to the family home for many years to come or <i>ad infinitum</i>, but the home is still taken into account in the assessment of the means of the person concerned, ultimately making it more difficult for the person to gain access to the scheme and so to leave hospital.  That is a factor in the blockage in step-down facilities.</p><p>In looking at costs and comparisons with EU figures for consultant and GP ratios, I know that Ireland, for example, does not have a similar GP system to Germany as they operate different systems.  In the witnesses' opinion, which is the best system operating now and how can Ireland aspire to it? We heard about the Dutch, French and Canadian systems - some magical system somewhere - that is obviously better than ours.  Yet Ireland has a reasonably good system.  Once upon a time, not so many years ago, a gentleman in this House said that in the days when we had no money there were lots and lots of beds and one could gain access to a hospital anytime one wished.  Admittedly, it is true that we had a smaller population then.  If the population is growing, however, and it has become fashionable to reduce the number of hospital beds, where do the two meet?  What was the purpose of that exercise?</p><p>There is something I still cannot understand.  I know there are many primary care centres throughout the State now.  There should be some indication as to the extent of their intervention in alleviating the overcrowding at accident and emergency departments and in the system generally.  How are they operating and gelling into the system? How are they interlinking with the community care system on one side and with the general hospital services on the other side?  Are the primary care centres doing the job intended for them?  We were informed last week that these centres are state of the art.  I am delighted to hear that but we must remember that they are structural edifices within the system and if they do not contribute to alleviating the burden on the community care and general hospital services systems, of which they are part, then I would like to know why the primary care centres do not relieve that burden.  Somebody somewhere must be able to tell us this.  I have raised questions in the House and with people before this committee many times about this and I have not yet had an answer.  There is, however, an answer to be had.  If our health services system is to work, we should see how it works well here.  I remember a similar situation in Northern Ireland many years ago when it was quite possible to deal with emergencies in what was called a health centre at the time but which was effectively a primary care centre.  They were quite capable of dealing with emergencies without any difficulty at all.</p><p>What exactly are we doing?</p><p> I wish to comment on the cost of medicines.  It is only part of the system but the cost affects the extent to which funds are available to run the health services.  I have always held the view that we should procure medicines at an EU level where there is a massive market.  Ireland is in the Single Market and membership is supposed to carry clout and weight.  Modern technology allows countries to transfer money and debt across borders very quickly.  I cannot understand why we cannot transmit the necessary messages to avail of the buying power of 500 million people as it carries must greater clout than the Irish population of 4.5 million.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.445" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Emily O'Conor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#Q00400"><p>I will start.  If I forget anything, members should feel free to remind me as I go along.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy O'Connell, I have no data on how or if private hospitals alleviated pressures over the Christmas period.  I do not know whether the HSE has the data.  We have a two-tier health service.  Private hospitals work hard for the cohort of patients who can pay and provide a service to that population.  I believe, having worked in the public sector, is that private hospitals cherry-pick non-complex cases that are profitable because of their business model.  I do not see private hospitals taking on the complex cases of our frail and elderly population that the public sector takes on every day and every night.  We do not run a business.  There is absolutely no profit in the vast majority of what I spend my time doing every day.  I would never be a profitable investment given what I do with the complex cases of elderly patients.  We need to consider this aspect as we move forward.  </p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether the winter initiative was successful.  The delayed discharge initiative was a success but we need to keep going.  If the funding for transitional care beds is stopped then the number of delayed discharges will build up again.  The initiative was a win.  We do not know yet whether it is a permanent win or only a temporary win while the transitional bed funding was available.  The Deputy asked me to identify other wins.  Although I am not part of the task force I know that at its meeting after the trolley crisis peaked that out of the 55 beds, that had been promised to be opened before the winter, that 17 beds had opened.  Perhaps more beds had opened that I do not know about.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked whether we could cope with a massive disaster.  I have huge concerns about that.  In terms of the emergency departments in University Hospital Galway, Cork University Hospital, University Hospital Limerick, the hospital in Drogheda and my department which copes very well, if there was a massive disaster that generated a sudden influx of hundreds of patients into the system then we would struggle to deliver care.  We are already over 100% capacity but we would do our best to cope.  We have highly trained people so we would all step up.  We would do our best to make the system work but I have grave doubts about how we would cope with a disaster.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked about moving outside of the 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. model, as did a couple of other members.  As a society we used to accept that doctors and nurses were just available between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.  Even when I was growing up, one did not wake up the doctor, unless one was half dead.  People delivered their babies at home with no help.  One accepted that granny died in the corner during the night.  One accepted when one's baby died.  One accepted that children died.  We have moved on as a society.  We have much greater expectations from the health service.  We are unwilling to wait with our child who has a tummy pain until a doctor wakes up in the morning.  We are not going to let granny die in the corner from a chest infection because she is 75 years old and getting on.  We want things to be different.  Wondering why we used to have many empty beds is because we, as a society, have moved on and have greater expectations.  Patients get sick outside of the hours between 9 a.m. and 5 p.m. so we should move towards providing 24-hour care but that comes down to what we can afford as a society.</p> <p>  In response to the comments made by Deputy Kelleher, medical and nursing care is very hands-on and very expensive.  We, as a society, must decide how much we can afford.  In the interim we are looking at consultant delivered care or consultant shopfloor care operating between the hours of 8 a.m. and 8 p.m.  We are actively moving towards that model in emergency medicine.  I am not here as an industrial relations representative for emergency medicine so I will not discuss contracts, remuneration, etc.  Most consultants working in emergency medicine have moved to working between 8 a.m. and 8 p.m. most days of the week but not all.  This was done before contracts were decided or remuneration was agreed simply because we saw a need to do so.  There have been variable approaches to working these hours outside of emergency departments.</p> <p>  The hospital system will respond outside of the hours between 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. for critical care.  That means if I telephone another service in my hospital and say I think my patient will die before tomorrow morning, of course the system will open up for him or her and on-call services will come in.  I cannot open up the system simply because I believe a person could go home on the same night if I got a certain treatment for him or her.  The system is so thinly spread that I cannot make such demands at 10 p.m.  Most of the services that work until late at night are unavailable the next day due to a lack of resources.  Therefore, I must choose carefully which cases I get the radiologist out of bed for at night.  My hospital's radiographer travels from her home when I need a CT scan to be done at night.  Every time I get her out of bed she cannot work the next morning.  We must pick and choose when logistics are at stake.  We do not have to choose when a person is critically unwell, has suffered a major trauma, need acute resuscitation or where I think the person will die before the morning.  The service does open up in such cases.</p> <p>  How many beds are required?  Do we need 2,000 new beds in our system?  I want politicians to tell me how we will fund the provision of 2,000 new beds.  We need to be ambitious.  I do not think the numbers we have heard so far are adequate.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Connell asked whether the decisions on the prioritisation of clinical need are made by management rather than clinicians?  Hospital managers have no choice but to make decisions on whether they are going to bring in elective or acute care.  I will always believe that a patient in an emergency department is in more immediate need of an ICU bed than, for example, a major esophagectomy case that is on a waiting list for cancer treatment who also needs an ICU bed.  If it is my patient who is in the emergency department then the surgeon and I will not agree on which patient has greater priority.  Therefore, hospital managers must make difficult decisions and bring balance to the situation.  The problem is there are not enough ICU beds.  The people I feel sorry for in our system are the nursing staff who have moved on to bed management roles.  They must telephone people to tell them their operation has been cancelled.  They must negotiate with management about whether to bring in electives or whatever.  They must also clear emergency department trolleys, which is a horrible job.</p></speech>

Based on what patients got from private medicine last year, they would now have a stretch target on top of that from private income.  I asked the HSE to explain, if there were two patients on trolleys - one with private health insurance and one without - which one of them would get a bed.  Does Dr. O'Conor have any insight into whether or not managers have influence?  I think Deputy O'Connell's point was that concern was expressed by members of the committee that in a clinical situation the stretch targets may, in fact, take over.  Where there is only one bed, but two patients with competing acuity, what influence do managers have?</p></speech>

I cannot say more than that.  Thankfully, in the emergency department I do not even look at who has health cover or not.  I could not tell, looking around at patients on trolleys in my department, who has got cover.  Thankfully, it is something I do not have to deal with.  My hospital managers do have to come in on budget and make a certain amount of income, but I cannot give the Deputy any insight into how that is done.</p> <p>  We need to start commissioning modular bills for places that do not have enough acute hospital beds.  We need to open every single bed, along with nurses and care assistants, that we have already built in our hospitals.  I am not in IR, but from a medical staffing viewpoint, we need to sort out our contracts, conditions and remuneration for consultants or else they will not come home or stay.  I would love that to be sorted.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher has raised some good societal decisions.  We have gone from what Deputy Durkan was describing, which was not needing acute hospital beds, to everybody needing an acute hospital bed.  We have huge expectations for what will happen in end-of-life situations.  As a society, we have to deal with what we want for ourselves at our end of life.  When I am 90, if I get sepsis from a chest infection in a nursing home, I will not want to go to an acute hospital for treatment, even if it means I am going to die.  That is happening all the time for patients at the moment, however.  It is really difficult.  We are coming from a society where Catholicism was prominent and it was God's will.  One did not discuss interfering with God's will at the end of life, but I think we have got to start having that discussion.  Our age group needs to start doing that so that we do not leave this burden to our children.</p> <p>  At the moment it is hard for nursing homes to hold on to patients.  All nursing home deaths are reportable to the coroner.  HIQA has strong statutory reporting responsibilities for nursing homes, so the paperwork must be correct.  There is really good practice out there.  We have an example in my hospital with what is called a nursing home liaison geriatrician who spends half the time in the hospital and the other half seeing patients in nursing homes.  It is a fantastic model.  I can send someone to a nursing home and say: "It might be a risky discharge.  Could you see them in 48 hours in the nursing home?"  They will say: "Yes.  We'll call in and make sure everything is okay."  If we could expand that model it would really help.</p></speech>

It was started off by Siobh&aacute;in Kennelly, a geriatrician in Connolly hospital.  If we could expand that service it would be wonderful.  Currently, we cannot give intravenous antibiotics in nursing homes.  We need to be able to do that to prevent patients coming in to us with infections.</p> <p>  Geriatricians also introduce good practice for end-of-life planning.  They are difficult conversations to have with patients and relatives, but they are bringing in good practice on that.  I can only support that model.</p> <p>  As regards the predictability of surges, I could not have said it better myself.  We know when the surges happen.  Why do they happen on Mondays and Tuesdays?  It is because we have peaks in attendance at emergency departments on those days, generated significantly by GP referrals on Mondays because the clinics re-open and, thus, GP referrals increase.  In addition, theatre lists for elective surgery open up on Mondays and Tuesdays, so there is a surge from both sides on beds.  We are therefore always going to have difficulties on Mondays and Tuesdays.  Should we have elective theatre lists on Saturdays and Sundays, and all weekdays?  There is a lot of medical literature to say that evening out elective surgery across the seven-day week would improve one's ability to deal with surges through the emergency system.  </p> <p>  As a society, we close down for six or seven days over Christmas.  We all want to do that, yet people still get sick.  How can we expect the system to cope?  This year there was a Saturday and Sunday, and the bank holiday, so the system re-opened for three days before it shut down again for four days.  Are we surprised therefore that things back up?  When I say "shut down" I do not just mean the acute hospital sector.  I also mean that it is very hard to get someone out into the community on Christmas Day or St. Stephen's Day.  It is hard to arrange for a public health nurse to visit a patient on Christmas Day.  Society makes these decisions.  We all want Christmas Day off to be with our families.  If we want people to work on these highly valued days in the year, we need to staff them enough and incentivise people to work then.  </p> <p>  Weekend discharges are not as good as we want.  It has definitely improved in some hospitals, particularly on Saturdays, although it is still not great on Sundays.  That is not just because consultants are not doing ward rounds, it is because access to community follow up is difficult at weekends. </p> <p>  This committee is not about emergency medicine.  I would love to sit here and tell members of the committee all the good things about emergency medicine, but I am not allowed to do so because this is about overcrowding.  So do not confuse both - emergency medicine is not simply overcrowding.</p> <p>  The transitional space or annexe for patients is not safe.  We used to have models where we shoved all the admitted patients out into a room and they could not be seen.  They were having cardiac arrests out there and no one could get to them.  Patients need to have nursing and medical care, even while they are waiting on trolleys.  They are easiest to nurse when they are visible and they are visible on the corridors.  Not all departments nurse on the corridors.  We do not nurse on the corridors in my department, but that means that I do not have cubicles to bring patients in the waiting room into.  Therefore, nursing staff have to balance where the biggest risk is going to be.  If we do not have enough nurses to nurse patients the best thing we can do is to put them into a visible space where we can see them.  That is why they are on the corridors.  I am sorry if it is undignified, but clinically it is the safest place for them to be if we have no beds for them.  If we have money to build annexes for them, we have money to build beds, so I would not support building annexes.</p></speech>

At the moment, the current cohort of emergency department nurses that are there to staff emergency department patients are also looking after these admitted in-patients.  Therefore, instead of having five patients to look after, a nurse might have ten to look after.  The safest place for nurses to nurse them is where they can see them.  There is a clinical risk to putting patients away if one cannot staff them.  As I said earlier, if we can build annexes we can build proper beds and staff them.<br/><br/>Why do we have 80 emergency department consultants in emergency medicine?  That is all we have ever agreed on.  The national programme for emergency medicine has much higher numbers.  We need over 200 consultants in emergency medicine, but there is no money for it.  We have jobs filled on a <i>locum</i>basis and there are unfilled jobs because of working conditions and remuneration.  Both need to be sorted.  I have addressed 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. working, but I can speak more about that if the committee so wishes.  <br/><br/>Can we improve with what we have?  I think we can, yes.  We can continue to improve the way we work.Working from 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. and improving how the system works out-of-hours is part of that.  By God, however, we have worked on process change so much over the last few years, and we have made progress.  We have managed to keep trolley waits static in Dublin emergency departments despite the increase in numbers of attendances, so there have been improvements, but give us room to breathe and hopefully we can improve processes more.</p><p>Yes, the elderly in nursing homes come to emergency departments out of hours.  More advance planning led by consultant geriatricians and palliative care teams in nursing homes might prevent some of that.  Nursing homes need to know there will not be adverse reporting and family expectations because the loved one has not been transported and has subsequently died.  We as a society need to be mature about this.  I see very debilitated patients transferred to emergency departments for a blocked catheter etc. at night.  We could do better.  In addition, we need to be able to die in nursing homes.  </p><p> As for nurse prescribing, we have lots of nurse prescribers for emergency medicine and ionising radiation.  We are one of the best practices for crossover of clinical skills between nursing groups and consultant groups.  We have clinical nurse specialists and advanced nurse practitioners.  We have really good practice on crossing skills and the boundaries are not as demarcated in emergency medicine as they are perhaps in other specialties.  We can lead out on that if the committee wishes.  </p><p> Deputy Durkan, I have already addressed previous times.  Societal expectations have changed, which is the main reason, and population has increased.  In the United Kingdom, the Royal College of Emergency Medicine is fighting back again because there is still talk there of reducing bed numbers.  That could happen if we got processes so perfect that most patients could be seen in ambulatory manner.  Yes, in an ideal world we might have fewer beds but not in the short or medium term with our current processes or those in the UK.  Yes, it would be less expensive to maintain patients in car parks.  The Deputy is right it is less expensive to maintain patients on trolleys in emergency departments than to open wards and bring in nurses to do that work.</p></speech>

The wards were very big at the time with perhaps 50 patients.  I do not suggest that as a resolution but it would be better than having patients in a corridor or anywhere else.  At the same time such patients would be under observation because one nurse can observe several patients in a larger arena as well as or better than they can in a corridor.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.460" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Emily O'Conor" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#S00500"><p>I will refer that question to Mr. Doran because I do not know the nursing reasons for moving from Nightingale wards to smaller wards.</p> <p>  On recruitment of consultants, pay is greater in Australia but there is a more significant point. In my department we see approximately 35,000 new patients a year.  There were two of us for the past ten years and we have worked very hard and we hope to have five consultants soon.  In a department of the same size in Australia - I know this because my trainees go to work in them - there would be 22 consultants, working 33 hours a week on shifts.  While it is a question of money, it is also a question of working conditions.  The starting salary in the UK is lower but there are significant increments as they go through their career.  Being honest, the starting salary for new consultants is not enough.  They suffered the special 30% financial emergency measures in the public interest, FEMPI, imposition.  I have a young colleague working with me and with that 30% drop, it simply is not enough.  The only people taking that contract at the moment are those with domestic responsibilities who feel they have to.  That needs to be changed. </p> <p>  I am not an expert on the fair deal.  I will pass over those questions.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Murphy O'Mahony, yes, all emergency departments employ triage 24 hours a day, seven days a week.  It is called the Manchester triage symptom and is delivered by trained nurses.  Most places have a computerised system for that but some do not.  The system is standardised and reproducible.  We did not have a triage scale suitable for children but the emergency medicine programme has recently introduced the Irish children's triage scale, which is going national now.</p> <p>  In response to the question about the number of trainees compared with consultants, we have always run a pyramidal system where the top of the pyramid is very thin and the base is very broad.  That is the tradition in this country and that is how I trained.  We want desperately to overturn the pyramid so that most of the care is delivered by consultants with a few trainees coming through for experience and training.  Consultants are expensive to train and employ and that will take investment but medically that is the way we need to go. </p></speech>

We had a submission from the chief executive officer of the Mid-west hospitals group, Ms Colette Cowan, who is dealing with one of the biggest emergency problems in the country, in Limerick.  I represent Tipperary.  On one side there is Limerick and on the other there is Clonmel, two of the worst emergency department situations in Ireland.  They are chaotic.  People in Tipperary are afraid to attend emergency departments.  In her submission, Ms Cowan made clear that the solution is to take a large portion of her budget from her and put it into the community to prevent people ending up in the emergency department.  It was an amazing submission.  I presume the priority for the Committee on the Future of Healthcare will be the investment needed in the community side of health care, and how quickly we can get that out there.  My colleagues can correct me if I am wrong.</p> <p>  I found it immoral to hear news reports on RTE or Today FM or Newstalk of the trolley watch figures during the emergency followed by advertisements from private hospitals for patients to come to their accident and emergency departments.  What is Dr. O'Conor's opinion of this?  Personally, given my political philosophy I believe in public services but for a period there is capacity in these private accident and emergency departments.  I know they cannot do everything but they can deal with normal knocks and bits and pieces.  They should be seconded during crises such as the recent one because their capacity is not being used to the full.</p> <p>  There has to be a statistical analysis or a heat map of why in some locations some general practitioners, GPs, have a higher rate of referral than others, even in the same town.  Why are the ambulance personnel in the mid-west telling me they cannot work because of the volume of referrals from some GPs while others make very few referrals yet their case loads are more or less the same?  What are we going to do about it?  All these things are intertwined.  </p> <p>  I accept that we need to change the way consultants and clinicians are paid.  We also need to change their work practices.</p><p>The idea that we work five days per week and are closed for eight days over Christmas is insane.  There must be a seven-day roster.  We must have clinicians, consultants and so forth coming in, discharging people and doing their job seven days a week.  That must be part of the contract.  In addition, we must ensure GPs have a contract that deals with unsocial hours in a realistic way, so we do not have a situation such as the one in the Chairman's county where Shannondoc went from 58 hours down to eight when it went from 12 doctors down to ten, which is scandalous.</p><p> Part of an issue here, aside from staffing and beds, is that the IT infrastructure is crazy.  I have been through the emergency department in Limerick a number of times.  What is happening there is crazy.  It is not the fault of anybody there but it is crazy.  It takes up so much time.</p><p> On the minor injury units and the pathways through which patients are put into emergency theatres, I am not convinced it is working as well as it should.  People are ending up in accident and emergency departments when they should be in the minor injury unit.  That area must be re-examined.  When one arrives in Ennis or Nenagh hospitals there is a massive sign in front which says, effectively, that one must go to Limerick if there is basically anything wrong.  The management of that pathway is not working to the maximum and more people are ending up in accident and emergency departments.  I keep referring to Limerick hospital because it is the model one hospital in my area.  That should change.</p><p> On the issue of opening transitional beds, and I accept there are issues across the board in terms of staffing, beds and so forth, there is capacity to open transitional beds in many areas of the country without too much funding.  There is a former hospital in Cashel on which X amount has been spent, which I will be reviewing in the Committee of Public Accounts.  It does not have a single patient, which is incredible.  If that cannot be used for transitional care, when the hospital a few minutes down the road has one of the worst emergency department crises in Ireland, I do not know what can.</p><p> I have a final few comments or questions.  I am very much taken by the issue of modular building.  I support it.  It appears to be taking a long time from procurement.  I do not know what it will be but, personally, I believe it will be extensions in all but name albeit perhaps modular in nature.  Obviously, it will not be full build.  From a capital point of view, I am not convinced that this happening as quickly as we need it.  I take on board the views on nursing homes.  People should have end-of-life facilities in those homes because obviously that will take away pressure.  It is all about diverting pressure away from accident and emergency departments through multiple decisions.</p><p> My final comment is on transport.  I am deeply frustrated with the way in which ambulance personnel are left waiting.  To see the queue of ambulances left outside University Hospital Limerick over the Christmas period was frightening.  There is also the knock-on impact of what happens if there is an emergency in the locality.  That process must be dealt with in a more efficient way.  Second, and this refers to what I said earlier, I realise funding was provided in respect of other transport facilities to bring critical patients.  Most of them do not operate outside normal working hours.  They need to be expanded and, in particular, they need to be used to bring patients to a step-down facility after being in a model one hospital and for GP referrals for non-critical patients.  A situation where ambulances are being used for all of this is causing even greater problems and risks when it comes to accident and emergency departments.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.464" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Doran" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#T00300"><p>I will try to be brief.  There were a number of questions and some repetition.  There are a number of reasons that the figures have improved in Dublin, as in not improved but stood still, as opposed to the country, where they have got really bad.  The infrastructure in Dublin in terms of access to continuing care beds and so forth is better than in other parts of the country.  There are improved process issues as well.  There are a number of advanced nurse practitioners, ANPs, in a number of the Dublin hospitals, which also speeds patient flow.  The group I spoke of that recommended the 107 staff for admitted patients also recommended that we should have 150 ANPs.  We currently have 78 across the country.  There is no funding for that.  It is proven that ANPs greatly help in terms of minor injuries, patient flow and so forth.  St. James's Hospital has six ANPs and has the lowest number of trolleys.  It has high patient satisfaction rates.  Advanced nurse practitioners work, but again there is no rush or stated intention to deliver them on the ground to meet and deal with the patients, which is all that matters in this situation.  I do not wish to suggest that Dublin is good.  It is just that the situation outside of Dublin has gone south so badly so quickly that it is truly alarming.</p> <p>  I must be very blunt.  We reap the harvest of fundamentally flawed decisions taken within the last decade.  Reconfiguration of acute hospital services was an unmitigated disaster.  I will go toe to toe with anybody about that.  When one talks about reconfiguration the two areas that come to mind are the north east and the mid-west.  In the north east in 2007, appalling as it was, there were 2,800 people on trolleys.  In the Lourdes hospital last year there were 5,600, and it was 7,000 in the year before that.  That is when Navan, Louth and Monaghan were taken out.  I am not saying they are perfect but one must give the alternatives that are there.  Deputy Kelly spoke about minor injuries units and so forth.  They must work on a 24-7 basis and be properly staffed.  If those units and services are closed down and then only one door is provided, should anybody be surprised that the one door gets overcrowded?</p> <p>  If one wishes to see the total and utter madness of policy decisions taken ten years ago, look at the mid-west.  In 2007, Limerick had 1,367 people on trolleys.  Last year, it had 8,090.  That is not the fault of the clinicians on the front line or the nursing staff.  It is the fault of whoever made the decision to shut down services in Nenagh and Ennis without building up Limerick.  On top of that, HIQA decided that the accident and emergency department in Limerick is unfit for purpose.  Did that not dawn on somebody before they made the decision to put everybody into Limerick?  It is the same in Galway.  It is unfit for purpose.  I accept that alternatives are being built, but it is building alternatives ten years after the fact.  That is why one wonders at policy decisions.  I am including political policy decisions as well.  They have to be owned by people when we reap the harvest in terms of what has been done in various areas outside of Dublin.</p> <p>  There was a question about the impact of private hospitals.  I have to concur.  We do not measure so we do not know.  However, at 5 p.m. or 6 p.m. anybody who needs care is transferred back to the nearest public hospital, because the staff are going home.  No harm to them, but that is the position.  I understand the rationale for pointing to their capacity but it would be an expensive alternative to be forced on the public health system.</p><p>Everybody must remember we have the fundamental problem that we have a two-tier health system which offers perverse incentives to certain key players in the system as to how they work and offers speedier access to care for those who can afford to pay for it.  In fairness to emergency departments, they do not do that.  In emergency departments, everybody is treated absolutely the same.  They are triaged and the system responds.  Our emergency department service is world class at consultant, nurse and support staff level, when one gets in there.  They will not lose anybody who could be saved.  However, they are just overrun.  They are not inpatient wards.  That is what is compromising care, particularly the care of admitted patients.</p><p> A question was asked about what was good or bad about the winter initiative.  One always has to try to be balanced.  This year's winter initiative was primarily aimed at transitional care, reducing delayed discharges and improving home help supports and home care packages.  To a very significant extent, it achieved those targets and it did well with dedicated funding in those areas.  As somebody said, the original provision was 55 acute beds with 17 opened.  They then had the meltdown on the first Tuesday in the year.  It was a crash course, and they said they had to do it better again.  They came up with 63 beds.  Some of it was regurgitating the 55 beds that had not opened in the first instance.  They opened 25 beds in Galway.  The only way they opened them was by cancelling the leave of the nursing staff.  They cannot keep doing that.  It is a Band-Aid over the problem.  I remain unconvinced they will open those additional acute beds.  There were aspects of the winter initiative that worked, and if they had not been there, the 612 people on trolleys would have been 800, in terms of delayed discharges and blocking up beds.  I am using the wrong phrase, but the members know what I am saying.</p><p> Can we foresee the flu epidemic?  We can never deal with anything like that, given that we have 95% to 100% occupancy in our acute hospitals week in, week out.  We cannot deal with any extreme demand.  The only way we deal with it is by cancelling elective procedures.  That is all we do.  We cancel planned operations.  As Dr. O'Conor said, the bed managers have the job of ringing people once, twice or, on occasion, three times.  On behalf of ICTU, I make the following point.  Can anyone explain the policy that we admit every year that we cannot do elective work, and so we give money, through the NTPF, to private hospitals to do the operations the public system does not have the capacity to do, but we never tackle the capacity issue?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.467" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Doran" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#U00300"><p>Correct.  And it will get longer and longer as people's expectations and demand rises for interventionist care, preventative procedures and so on.  This is right, fair and reasonable.  However, I am not convinced it does the taxpayer any good to use that arm to spend &euro;20 million.<br/><br/>We could not cope with a massive disaster.  However, I never underestimate the ability of health service staff, whom I admire and represent, to move mountains in an exceptional situation.  The chances are that mountains would be moved.  However, they are moving mountains every day, not on exceptional days, and that is the problem.<br/><br/>Issues were raised about the correct care at the correct time, choice issue, acute beds and the nine to five issue.  At the risk of irking people, acute hospitals still primarily function at an optimum level Monday to Friday, nine to five.  It has not changed.  The emergency department task force is good at measuring everything.  The latest dashboard figure we saw was 12% discharge at weekends.  That was the same 18 months ago as it was in November.  In the emergency department task force there is a commitment to empower and enable delegated discharge in accordance with national agreements and cross-team discharge, having regard for the consultants' ongoing responsibility for their patients.  There is another commitment to ensure an appropriate level of senior clinical decision-making in emergency departments.  There is a requirement to ensure there is a senior decision-making presence in emergency departments during peak hours with consultant availability on an 8 a.m. to 8 p.m. basis, subject to resource.  That is the get out of jail clause.  We lack the human capital to do it in many areas and the managerial capacity to do it on some occasions.<br/><br/>It is very difficult.  We need to change everyone's <i>modus operandi</i>.  We need consultants and senior registrars in emergency departments over a longer span of hours to make the key decisions.  If, because of other pressures, consultant surgeons are unable to use theatre time, which is not good, could they be better utilised in the emergency departments, given that they have the experience?  Somebody asked what we could do in the short term.  These are the kind of things we could do in the short term.  We could make use of the senior clinical decision-makers and ask them to attend on a rostered basis out of hours in order that they can make key decisions, get and interpret the diagnostics, map out the patient's journey and discharge where they can.  <font color="#2F2F2F">Non-consultant hospital doctors, NCHDs,</font>will practise defensively.  We all know that.  It was that way when I was a nurse.  I am sure it is still that way in practice, and I would do the same myself.  If I get it wrong and send someone away, there will be a follow-on.  Therefore, they hold patients and get the registrars to examine the patients.  Therefore we need to spread the clinical decision-makers.<br/><br/>I gave a wrong figure for public health nurses, PHNs.  We are two fewer at the end of last year than we were in the previous year.  This is not due to retirements but because we just do not have them.  Any qualified PHN has a permanent post upon qualification.  We do not have enough to meet retirements and we have none for locum cover.  PHNs spend three or four months of each year covering annual leave in two areas.  Patients are prioritised and, after a while, a person becomes so unwell, they end up in the emergency department.  Everything we do is connected to everything else.<br/><br/>I agree with Dr. O'Conor on patient need and who decides.  When it comes to acute interventions and decision-making, the clinicians, correctly, reign supreme and the system responds.  Patient need is relegated.  Directors of nursing who seek additional agency nurses to look after patients to the level required by the patient are frequently having their requests turned down due to resource implications.  They are told to make do.  The reduced number of nurses has to cover the acutely ill patients.  To Deputy Bernard Durkan, I make the point that international research well proves that a ratio of one nurse to eight or more patients does harm and results in poor patient outcomes.  Nurses are frequently left in acutely ill patient environments responsible for 12 to 16 patients.  This compromises care.<br/><br/>I am not being, so to speak, industrial relations about this.  It is too big an issue.  It is not just about industrial relations.  We have staffing agreements based on international research about what is required, and every day we have hospitals which admit they cannot reach them.  We have emergency departments working four or five nurses short.  I am not even getting into the admitted patients and the additional staff required for them.<br/><br/>Somebody asked me to identify three actions that could be taken.  The first is staffing.  If we cannot build the beds, we can incentivise the staff in order that patients who are there get better care.  We need more nurses and senior clinical decision-makers in the system.  It is a labour market out there.  These professionals have choices and they are not choosing to work in Ireland, especially in our public health service.  Providing additional beds is the second action.  The third is to provide home help and home care services over seven days.  The idea that they stop on a Friday and do not restart until the Monday, or the Tuesday on a bank holiday, is barmy.  A person's deterioration may not be spotted.  They need the supports every morning.  Just half an hour in the morning and half an hour in the evening can keep a person at home and give them the spur or the rung on the ladder they need.  It is taken away for two or three days every week, and the Government says it provides community-based support services.  I am not getting into the bigger issue of more bed capacity, which we all know we need.  Those are the three immediate things we need.</p><p>Dr. O'Conor spoke about the first Tuesday of each year and each week.  It is predictable.  We asked for a roster for senior clinical decision makers to be <i>in situ</i>in the community and in acute settings through the Christmas and new year period, but, as a staff rep, I am still waiting to see it.  It is not just the acute system, but also the community system that has to stay awake and operate on a seven-over-seven basis.</p></speech>

The Tuesday spike is a factor of the lack of discharges at weekends that should have happened had people come in to make those decisions, the recommencement of clinics on Mondays that might lead to referrals and the recommencement of elective work in some houses totally detached in some cases from recognition of the fact that emergency departments have been under pressure all weekend.  The spike is predictable.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Conor answered the question on warehousing.  If we can build modular units to house the admitted patients, we can build wards to look after them properly.  To be blunt, that is not done because it is cheaper to leave patients in the emergency department where the same number of nursing staff must do two jobs, namely, their normal emergency department jobs and looking after these admitted patients, trying to prepare them, awaiting their transfers upstairs, etc.</p> <p>  Warehousing has a clinical risk.  Patients are taken out of sight and sent down dark corridors.  Limerick's emergency department is an appalling disgrace.  It is a walk-in wardrobe that is the major trauma unit for the mid-western health region.  Its staff at all levels are heroes and its patients are victims.  That has to be said long and loud.  Leaving patients in sight is safer than the alternative, but it is not right or good.</p></speech>

While I am sorry to interrupt Mr. Doran, could he devote some time to the questions of accountability and transparency?  Are there deficiencies in how we view the decisions that are made and see whether they are being made responsibly and are clinically or managerially correct?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.481" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Doran" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#V01400"><p>I will make two points first, but I promise that I will answer then.  I wish to address elderly care in nursing and community homes.  We are in a race to the bottom in terms of the quality of care given to our elderly.  The cost of care is the only fixation that governs under the fair deal scheme and in public nursing homes.  We are constantly told that the cost of care is cheaper in private nursing homes than it is in public hospitals and that we must drive the weekly cost per patient in the latter down to the level of the former.  That is fundamentally wrong and unfair and is a race to the bottom.  It forgets the increased complexity of the public hospital patient and so on.  It also negates the likelihood that we will develop services in the nursing home environment.  Dr. O'Conor spoke about this.  We must keep residents in nursing homes or continuing care facilities where we can manage their acute episodic development, be that via intravenous, IV, antibiotics, managing transfusions and fluid balances, phlebotomies, blood tests, etc.  Patients do not need to go as often as they do, but that requires a different skill mix in the nursing home arena.  It is a richer skill mix, to use an old-fashioned word, and it costs money.  That has an impact on the fair deal scheme, funding and so on.  Everything is connected to everything else.  If we want to make the nursing home sector do more, it will need more staff of a qualified level, which will have a cost.  The same applies in the public sector, but we need to do it.</p> <p>  Regarding accountability and transparency, the only people who are accountable in the public health service are those on the front line who have a register that allows them to continue to work.  Consultant, registrar, NCHD and nursing staff have paid the price - patients have paid the greatest price - of flawed decision making by management and the political system with no accountability whatsoever.  Accountability rests fully with those who are out there trying to do a job.  If they make an error, they are subject to a complaint or whatever.  That is the price that they pay, but the general management structure - I do not deny for one second that it works hard and has difficult choices to make - is not around when the situation goes wrong.  The consultant, registrar and nurse are, yet all evidence and research shows that they are not empowered to make resource-related decisions.  This follows through to clinical-related decisions because we still have a system in which senior management at group and hospital levels oversee what is happening but to whom little accountability attaches.  When something goes wrong, the consultant, registrar or nurse is before the regulator, which is happening with increasing incidence.</p></speech>

Patients who are admitted to emergency departments when no beds are available are sick and need those beds.  They need medical care.  Those wards, units or corridors must be staffed appropriately.  Otherwise, patients will die.  The number of complaints that we received regarding emergency departments increased last year.  In the previous year, there were very few complaints.  The number of GP complaints is increasing because people feel that they are not getting the service that they should - for example, they are being sent to emergency departments instead of being seen.  We ask that everyone work together somehow or other.</p> <p>  Regarding emergencies and disasters, I was in London during the bombings.  Front-line staff pulled out all the stops and people were cared for.  That is what front-line staff do, which needs to be acknowledged.</p></speech>

We welcome the opportunity to appear before the committee and engage with members.</p> <p>  Our urgent and emergency care service operates across the health and social care system.  It comprises a wide range of services, including the National Ambulance Service, emergency departments, injury units, GP out-of-hours services, primary care, acute mental health services and community intervention teams, to name but a few of the emergency and urgent care services that make up this system.  Throughout 2016, our urgent and emergency care system saw a substantial rise in activity, including 310,000 emergency ambulance calls, representing a 4% increase over the previous year, 1.155 million emergency department attendances, representing a rise of 4.9% over 2015, and 286,000 emergency department admissions, representing a 5.3% increase over 2015.</p> <p>  I will now set out some of the key causes of the current pressures on our urgent and emergency care system and the actions being taken by the HSE in light of these pressures.  During the first week of 2017, an unacceptable level of overcrowding was evident in emergency departments.  Emergency department overcrowding and long patient waiting times for emergency care are of critical concern within the health service in terms of providing patients with timely access to necessary care.</p> <p>  In December 2016 and January 2017, there were a number of factors that led to increased pressure on the numbers of patients delayed for admission.  These include increased demand for emergency care, a 6% increase in attendances in December 2016 over 2015, a 7.2% increase in admissions in December 2016 over 2015, a 7% increase in respect of GP out-of-hours services in December 2016 over 2015, and an 18% increase in ambulance calls in December 2016 over December 2015.</p> <p>  With regard to bed capacity, as of 24 January 2017 there have been 150 acute beds and 190 community beds closed within our public health system due to essential refurbishment, infection prevention and control, and staffing deficits.  There has been an increase in influenza and respiratory-related illness.  This commenced in mid-December, earlier than last year, with influenza virus strain H3N2.  This primarily affects those aged 65 and older.  In the period in question, we recorded the highest ever number of respiratory admissions in our hospitals.</p><p>It is well recognised that the causes and effects of emergency department overcrowding are multifaceted, complex and health service-wide.  The causes span a range of complex issues across the health service, including: increased demand for acute hospital care; underdevelopment of alternative avenues of access to health services in primary and social care; limited acute bed capacity; and challenges in meeting the increasing demands of our ageing population for social care services to facilitate timely discharge of patients from acute hospital settings.  As a result, the response to emergency department overcrowding cannot be limited to focusing on emergency department's alone but must be health system-wide.  Improving processes and achieving efficiencies in hospitals in order to alleviate emergency department overcrowding continues to be a priority.  Additionally, to address the causes and challenges of emergency department overcrowding and sustain the solution a more strategic approach is needed, from both policy and operational perspectives, in the medium and longer term.</p><p> Our population is ageing and it is expected that the number of people aged over 65 years will increase by nearly 110,000 in the next five years.  The number aged 65 years and over increased by 30.2% between 2006 and 2015.  This trend will continue, with projections from the Central Statistics Office showing a 37% increase in the 65 years and over age group between 2015 and 2026.  This is great news and is due in no small way to significant improvements in treatment and care provided by the health services.</p><p> A large proportion of this age group is living with two or more chronic conditions which make many of our older citizens more vulnerable and frail.  Emergency departments have seen evidence of this over the holiday period with people aged over 75 years constituting 14% of total emergency department attendances for December 2016.  In turn, December 2016 saw a corresponding 12% increase in the number of people aged over 75 years being admitted to hospital through our emergency department's when compared to December 2015. </p><p> The aim of the winter initiative plan 2016-17 is to provide a focus on specific measures required to help minimise the surge in activity experienced at this time of year across hospital and community services.  One of the key objectives is to reduce the numbers of people waiting to be discharged from hospitals and require specific supports and pathways to do so.  Targeted reduction of delayed discharges freed up the equivalent of an additional 200 beds for the acute system.  This was achieved through increased provision of fair deal and home care capacity.</p><p> The plan contains a number of key measures in terms of hospital avoidance, timely access and discharge.  It is being implemented through a specific and detailed planning process required in all hospitals and community health care organisations.  The detailed actions in the plan are set out in appendix 1.  Most of these actions are already implemented, bringing tangible benefits to the system and patients.  Under the plan, &euro;40 million was invested to alleviate winter pressures.</p><p> While considerable planning was undertaken through the winter initiative, the system's ability to expand to meet spikes in demand is limited by a number of factors that vary from hospital to hospital.  These include: not having enough beds in the system to deal with a surge; difficulties in recruiting nursing staff, which, in turn, pose a challenge in opening some of our surge capacity beds; and a shortage of certain services in some parts of the community such as diagnostics or access to home care.  The early onset of influenza, coupled with a significant rise in respiratory illnesses during the holiday period, put further pressure on an already stretched system, particularly in the context of people aged over 75 years.</p><p> In light of ongoing pressures on emergency departments, on 5 January 2017, the Health Service Executive announced a series of additional measures as part of the existing winter initiative plan.  These measures focused on augmenting the supports for primary and community care, targeting a small growth in acute capacity and further strengthening existing actions, such as our information campaigns on influenza vaccines.  These additional actions are also set out in appendix 1.</p><p> The HSE has a steering group in place, comprising all the key operational divisions, which reviews performance of the winter initiative to ensure an integrated approach across our hospitals and community services.  The HSE's special delivery unit oversees progress across all our services on a daily basis.  This is in addition to the normal line management of our hospitals and community health care organisations delivered through the HSE's accountability framework.  In addition, an oversight group has been put in place by the Department of Health to oversee progress with the winter initiative plan and agree any revised actions as challenges arise.</p><p> A dedicated focus will be needed to progress the development of the acute model of care; structured demand and capacity planning; effective information systems enabling analysis of emergency care demand and utilisation and facilitating appropriate performance oversight; staffing capacity; bed capacity; and continued process improvement in hospitals.  The recently announced acute bed review will be one important piece of the long-term solution.  In addition, to address the causes of emergency department overcrowding in the longer term, the enhancement of primary and social care services, the development of integrated patient centred care for the management of chronic conditions, investment in hospital infrastructure and models for the delivery of acute services all need to form part of a strategic health policy initiative.</p><p> Within a more responsive health system, many more people could and should be treated within the community, for example, through an enhanced primary care service.  Additional investment in the community would mean that many scans and tests could be done without people having to attend acute hospitals, more home supports could allow people to move out of hospital sooner and community intervention teams could treat people in their own homes rather than in a hospital environment.  However, this would involve a decisive shift away from the most expensive form of treating and caring for people, namely, the acute hospital system.</p><p> The scenes of overcrowding we witnessed at the start of January were distressing for both patients and staff, and for this we apologise.  However, unless we shift our model of health care from its current hospital-centric focus and towards the community, with the associated investment required, we will continue to be challenged in delivering the service we would wish for our patients.  The appendices set out the specific actions in the winter plan and feature a number of graphs on trends.  In particular, the final page features a graph depicting the trend delayed discharges.  The substantial reduction in delayed discharges shown has been one of the successes of the plan.  This has had a significant beneficial effect in the east of the country where the number of delayed discharges tends to be high.  It is less so elsewhere where access to home care on an accelerated basis is more important.  My colleagues and I will endeavour to answer any questions members may have.</p></speech>

On accident and emergency department overcrowding and hospital overcrowding in general, Nursing Homes Ireland today issued a statement in which it indicated it had understood since July 2016 that the Health Service Executive would engage with the organisation on planning for the winter initiative.  This understanding was based on the view that demand for hospital care would increase significantly, leading to significant efforts to discharge patients from hospital at an early stage.  The statement notes, however, that no such engagement took place.  I ask Mr. Woods to explain the reason for this.</p> <p>  I understand there were 742 vacant nursing home beds nationally at the end of December 2016.  In the first two weeks of January 2017, hospitals experienced severe overcrowding.  Despite this, the level of engagement with Nursing Homes Ireland has been extremely poor.  Why did the HSE not engage with Nursing Homes Ireland before the end of November to plan for a problem that everyone knew was coming down the tracks?</p> <p>  At any one time, between 500 and 600 people are occupying hospital beds as a result of delayed discharges.  These are patients who are ready to go home or move to nursing home care.  People who transfer from a hospital to a nursing home do not need to stay in nursing home care for 12 months or two years because we also have step-down facilities.  However, these facilities do not seem to have been developed as part of the HSE model and there appears to be considerable reluctance to develop them.  Surely, plans could be made every year long before winter arrives to use step-down facilities in a much more imaginative way than is currently the case.  It does not make sense to have 742 vacant beds in nursing homes when our hospitals are clogged up.  It should also be noted that a hospital stay costs between &euro;6,000 and &euro;7,000 per week, whereas the weekly cost of a private nursing home bed is less than &euro;1,200.  I do not understand the reason this matter was not addressed before the problem arose.</p> <p>  On the recruitment of nurses, I will cite one case that highlights a problem with flexibility in the recruitment process.  I am aware of a woman with a young family who wished to return to nursing and made clear in her interview that she would be available to work on certain days and unavailable on other days due to family commitments because she has young children.</p><p>She was told: "We can't take you on, but the best thing you can do is go and apply to an agency and we'll have to take you on in accordance with the hours you're able to work then under the agency."  That does not make sense.  I am talking about someone who wanted to work in the HSE.  I accept she was not able to work from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m. or 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. five days a week, but she was available to come on board in the HSE.  However, she was advised to become employed by an agency, which would enable her to get the flexible hours she wanted.  That is a huge cost to the HSE.  There are serious questions at managerial level on not working to try to facilitate people in order to get them into the system and to ensure we have continuity of care of care for patients and all that.</p><p> I need clarification from the HSE on those two points.</p></speech>

I apologise for keeping them waiting.  I have some questions on emergency departments in general.  Is there a communication system between emergency departments and GPs and community services to pass on recommendations relating to people leaving emergency departments?</p> <p>  Is the European directive requiring that junior doctors work no more than 48 hours a week and no more than 24 hours together being adhered to?  The practice of employing GPs in emergency departments is a new concept to me.  How is that going?  Could it be expanded?  As far as I know there are no actual contracts with the GPs at the moment.  Would having a contract available enhance that service?</p></speech>

I welcome our guests.  This has been a long day on this subject and other subjects.</p> <p>  On the ongoing administration of health services, we have two bodies, the HSE and the Department of Health, and to my mind the twain shall never meet.  In my opinion it does not work that way and it will remain my opinion.  I believe it should be regionalised similar to but not the same as the previous health boards.  I think it would be more effective, accountable and representative in terms of having all constituent bodies represented on a board somewhere in a region directly relating to the region for which it dispensed the services.  At another meeting we have already discussed the realignment of the hospitals in line with something like that.</p> <p>  To what extent has the HSE looked at the requirements in the health services in terms of elective surgery, acute bed accommodation and accident and emergency department accommodation?  If the HSE has quantified it, how has it quantified it?  What is the HSE's proposed resolution to what is clearly a problem?  I asked this question previously.  I did not get the answer but I think it came by accident.  Presumably we need more beds and more staff at accident and emergency departments to clear the problems that arise every year at an acute time.  In the event of building up the services to the extent that this can be dealt with without major controversies and overcrowding with consequent dangers to patients, staff and everybody else, how does the HSE then deploy the service that is capable of meeting that surge the rest of the time?  I think I know the answer, but I will not say it until I hear it again.</p> <p>  We have spoken about hiring and retaining staff, which seems to be a huge difficulty - more so than anything else.  We have had comparisons with various jurisdictions over recent years, including with the one across the water next door, which also seems to be having serious problems at its accident and emergency departments, despite having been seen as the Rolls Royce of services up to some time ago.  We also know about the Dutch, French and Canadian health services, all of which have been much vaunted and are still not perfect because they seem to have the same problems.</p> <p>  I did not mention this previously but is appalling to have someone awaiting elective surgery, such as a hip operation for example, where they are suffering acute pain over a long period.  They may have to wait for two years.  I have dealt with many people, as I am sure has the Chairman, who have waited for two years and more in severe pain, which is no help to them whatsoever.  There have been many discussions, meetings and protests over emergencies and various things that have gone wrong in recent years, some significant and some that should not have gone wrong.  Have we learned from all those things?  Can we put in place within a reasonable time a resolution to them without having to wait four or five years of suffering the same anxiety as we have at the moment?</p></speech>

I know that officials from our social care division meet representatives of the NHI.  In the eastern part of the country we are running a bed bureau where we receive lists on an ongoing basis of beds that are available.  Through that bed bureau we constantly look to connect hospitals and community services with potential nursing home or indeed transitional care spaces for patients.  I would need to look at the statement and discuss it with my colleagues on the social care side.  It would surprise me that there would not be such dialogue.  If the NHI is saying that-----</p></speech>

I did not mention it to the Minister.  My understanding was that engagement was to take place, but that it has not taken place.  At a time of overcrowding in the hospitals, there are 742 vacant beds.</p></speech>

I would need to get a comment from my social care colleagues on the specific point, but I hear the point the Senator is making.</p> <p>  Regarding the 500 to 600 people who are clinically fit for discharge, one of the successes of the winter plan has been that the number has dropped to the mid-400s.  We would still like to see that come down further, but that is as low as it has been for some years.  The Senator made a point about transition care availability.  Under the winter initiative we have specifically sought to accelerate access to transition care to facilitate quicker movement from hospitals to care settings which may result in people moving to nursing home environments or home with support depending on the particular individual's needs.  We have invested in additional spaces, but the Senator is right to highlight that for the future, access to that kind of space and indeed rehabilitation space will be very important.</p> <p>  The point the Senator made about recruitment of nurses and flexibility is absolutely right.  The hospital system has approximately 8,000 nurses who work shorter hours.  We need to support flexibility or else, as he rightly has said, we end up paying a premium for agency staff.  It is always better for us to have staff who are on our own books, permanent and working in the facilities on an ongoing basis.  To the extent that this is happening even in individual cases, it would concern me.  It is certainly something I would like to follow up on.  We have specific targets to reduce agency nursing where we can and employ nurses directly.  We have a project team, co-operatively including the INMO, working on trying to achieve a target of 1,000 nurses in this current year in that way.</p><p> Deputy Murphy O'Mahony asked if there is communication between GPs and hospitals.  There are discharge letters.  That would be very much a part of the norm in terms of patients being discharged.  Clearly, there can be communication inward to the hospital from GPs, in terms of outpatient referrals or specific comments in a letter.  Half of all those who come to an emergency department have letters from their GP stating something about their particular conditions.</p><p> On the European Working Time Directive, EWTD, and compliance for junior doctors, we monitor and report on this monthly.  Indeed, we occasionally report to Brussels in terms of our requirements under the directive.  Our compliance has greatly improved and is 98% regarding the 24-hour requirement while 81% is the last figure I saw regarding the 48-hour requirement.  We are looking to increase that, but the figure has come from well below that level.  There are challenges in some specialties.  There are small numbers of doctors in our national specialties and we are still pursuing that aspect.</p><p> It can happen on occasion that GPs work in emergency departments.  Where it happens, the reports I have received are that it works well.  Contractual issues in that context have not arisen.  It could be part of a wider dialogue with GPs in terms of a GP contract for the future but it has not been presented to me as an obstacle at any point.  Not all GPs favour working in emergency departments but where they do, as it is reported, it works well.</p><p> In response to Deputy Durkan's point, the structural comments are really a matter for policy.  I heard the Deputy articulate them at the Committee on the Future of Healthcare also and they are noted.  On the question of whether we have studied capacity-----</p></speech>

Accident and emergency is an urgent issue now, and could be tomorrow again.  The purpose of the question was to try to elicit what might be done as a matter of urgency to deal with the problems that existed last year and the year before and will exist next year unless something is done about them this year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.505" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#Z00300"><p>To answer the second part of Deputy Durkan's question, on the notion of studying capacity and providing capacity to meet service demand for the future, which I was just coming to, in my experience structures will not resolve the service and process issues.  We have looked at capacity, however, and we see clearly that there is demand in our emergency departments and, as the Deputy mentioned, regarding our inpatient and day-case waiting lists which is in excess of our capacity to supply.  If we look at the demographics over a period of perhaps the next 30 years and look at our current model, without changing the model of care the total requirement for bed days within our hospital environment will double.  Clearly, the response to that - some of the committee's earlier discussions are relevant to this aspect - lies in identifying what kind of solutions are necessary, for example, investment in community-provided services, in primary care and in social care.  Older person services, particularly in the community, will be key to addressing that growth in demand.</p> <p>  In terms of the here and now, the winter initiative has been focused and of the &euro;40 million provided, &euro;34 million has gone to providing services in the community.  That recognises that we need to provide space in our hospitals for work to be done.  We recognise the need to grow that space, but we also see that access to community services, both primary care and social care, is a vital component in that regard.</p> <p>  Deputy Durkan asked a specific question about surge capacity and how we handle it.  As the committee will be aware, hospitals are running at 100% in any event at present.  An earlier contributor pointed out that most of the major hospital are in that position.  I said that 85% would be a more desirable norm in terms of hospitals internationally, and allowing for proper scheduling of work.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.507" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#Z00500"><p>From our point of view, there are two dimensions.  The first is about capacity and ensuring that we are planning and making available sufficient capacity.  In the current winter plan, we are growing capacity in the community and there is a small growth in the hospital environment capacity.  This year, we were initially putting in 55 beds, but it has increased to 98 beds on the hospital side.  Last year, the number was 300.  I understand the underlying demographic would require us to put in 300 to 400 beds on an annual basis.  There is a challenge in that regard for us.</p> <p>  On the capacity required in the community, the fair deal scheme is running well at present in the sense that it is able to provide space, as required, to hospitals.  It is doing that within its current funding limit and it is working well for us right now.  The home care community intervention team capacity that has gone in as part of the winter initiative, some of which was there already, is also vital because it enables people to stay at home or return home and be treated there.  Some of the committee's earlier conversations about the work of community intervention teams and the outpatient anti-biotic programme are relevant in that regard.</p> <p>  On the idea of a surge in capacity, the critical point is that hospitals are full all the time.  At this time of the year, they are more full with work related to admissions from emergency departments.  The price of that is that there is less capacity to do elective work and the staffing requirements relating to running the hospital are reasonably consistent.</p> <p>  There is a need to grow staff numbers, as Deputy Durkan referenced.  We see that in terms both of the wider demographic but also in providing additional targeted capacity right now.  In the acute system, the service plan this year provides for approximately 100 more nursing staff.  Our staff numbers have been rising.  If one looks back, between 2008 and now, there was a clear reduction through austerity and the number has been rising again over the past two to three years.  This year, overall nursing numbers are up by over 200 and doctor numbers are also up, but we recognise that is coming from a low base.  The impact of austerity on the global recruitment and maintenance of staff in the health system is still being washed through.  If one looks at the demographic over that period, clearly we have a lot to do.  We take the point about staff.</p> <p>  The hiring and retaining of staff is a significant issue.  The rate varies to some extent across the country but the capacity to hire and retain staff in what is an internationally competitive market for medical and nursing skills is a challenge for us.  We have to adopt as best we can strategies that are both friendly to staff work requirements and which invest in facilities that give rise to good working conditions.  Clearly, the stresses and pressures of operating in emergency departments as they are at present are a significant challenge for staff.</p> <p>  On elective surgery and waiting times for elective surgery, we put in resources last year to address wait times beyond 18 months.  We fully accept that is only the tail and that there is an underlying growth in demand.  Hospitals in the past year have grown their service provision by approximately 33,000 cases.  What is happening within the hospital environment is that throughput is growing but the demand is growing quicker, and we have to address that through providing extra capacity and also looking in some instances at the model through which care is delivered.  There are opportunities within hospitals.  For example, since 2009 the surgical programme is effectively using less bed space and is doing more work more efficiently with more patients being seen.   That kind of opportunity exists within the hospital system.  I agree with Deputy Durkan that our elective targets are not where we would want them to be.  I fully accept there is a capacity requirement around delivering those targets.  There is a requirement for both staff and beds.</p></speech>

The public and many members here and elsewhere are anxious to ascertain how long it will take.  We hear every year that we are getting a step further but all we are doing is chasing after the wagon.  Is it possible to identify precisely what is needed at least to hold the problem without all of these emergencies, patients on trolleys all over the place, and patients on long waiting lists?  What can the HSE do in one year?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.509" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#Z00700"><p>On the timing of delivery, the key requirements for the HSE, apart from funding approval to act within the resources provided by the Oireachtas, is recruitment.  For us, the timescale around recruitment is between six months and one year, realistically, depending on the type of staff.  Consultant staff can take up to a year to recruit and that is the sort of timescale we work to actioning additional services provided through consultants.  We can recruit other staff grades more quickly.  A challenge we face is that if we run a competition to recruit any grade, be it a nurse, paramedic or other staff, half the applications will come from within our organisation.</p><p>Therefore, we often have to go through two processes to get staff.  There are issues associated with staffing.</p><p> The current physical hospital infrastructure is close to capacity.  We have examined what we could do additionally.  The beds we are opening this year are in spaces we can readily make available by doing relatively minor capital works.  The timing for capital works is more significant.  One of the reasons we emphasise community services for this time period is that, while they are required, we can contract and put them in place more quickly or employ staff to put them in place more quickly.</p><p> The capacity study at a wider level that is to be undertaken by the Department of Health, into which we will certainly have an input, will identify both the current and future requirements for bed capacity in the system.  The Deputy's question was on the volume of service we need to stay with the demographic and catch up with the current demand for service, which will remain as we are pushed by the demographic.  I expect that will be considered output of the capacity study itself.  We have considered that in terms of our own view of the capacity we have and what we need.</p><p> Timescales to implement significant new hospital infrastructural projects are typically between three and five years.  If one is considering structures such as ward blocks or substantial hospital expansion, those timescales typically apply.  We have examined other options that may be available to us in order to move more quickly but, typically for a substantial hospital build, it takes three to five years to go through design, planning, construction, completion and the handover.</p></speech>

That cannot be addressed in the immediate term.  The bed capacity review will undoubtedly outline that there is a shortage of beds.  The number of beds needed may be debatable but there is certainly a shortage in the system.  Given that, the only option left is to try to make the system we have more efficient.  That is what we are trying to do.  There are many components to trying to make the system more efficient.  To put it simply, the hospital system cannot cope with the number of people coming in.  Are there strategies we can devise that reduce the number of people who require acute hospital care, be it through increased resources or bolstering staff in the community to look after patients?  There is capacity in that regard to reduce demand.  We have to balance that with the demographics.  The population is getting older and people have multiple chronic morbidities.  Certainly, they should be looked after within the community.  There needs to be an examination of how we can prevent people ending up in casualty departments.  How can we stop that?</p> <p>  The other aspect is the question of how we can get people who have completed their acute care back out into the community.  Senator Colm Burke has mentioned that the nursing homes association has identified it has capacity to take people out of hospitals once they have completed their acute care.  That is another aspect of efficiency.</p> <p>  The third aspect of efficiency concerns the fact that, within the hospital system itself, there are inefficiencies in regard to patient flow and the way in which patients are managed within hospitals.  I refer also to access to diagnostics, staffing and the recruitment necessary if people are to be looked after in hospital.  All these aspects of care can be managed within the constraints of our bed capacity.  The delegation is saying that we will not have a substantial increase in capacity for three to five years so all the other factors need to be addressed to make the system more efficient.</p> <p>  With regard to recruitment and retention of staff, how can we make our system more attractive?  Obviously, it is not attractive.  That is why people are not taking up the posts and why our nurses and doctors are emigrating.  The system is so inefficient that there is no job satisfaction and a very high stress level.  Bearing in mind the efficiencies I have outlined, is there capacity to improve the service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.512" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Liam Woods" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#AA00300"><p>I take the Chairman's point about capacity.  The points made about the opportunities to improve efficiency and flow within hospitals are well made.  There has been a lot of progress in that area.  That is reflected in the underlying data on the volumes of care being provided in the hospital space but there is no doubt that there is more to do.  Work specifically focusing on that is under way at some sites.</p> <p>  Recruitment and retention are clearly key to expanding the service.  The Chairman is correct to state our response capacities involve our doing everything we can within the capacity we have.  We must grow it where we can but we must also invest in primary and social care.  Work in this regard commenced last year.  The integrated care programmes, particularly relating to certain chronic conditions, and the programme for the care of the frail elderly are designed to provide models of care that will support citizens outside the hospital environment, at home, in a primary care environment.  That work is commencing.  It is very important work because this is an area of significant current demand and one that will be subject to growth in demand.  The Chairman is right to conclude that the hospital system could not deal with all that demand in volume terms.  It would be inappropriate for it to fully consider doing that.  The Chairman's points are well made.</p> <p>  From my experience of driving the country and visiting sites, I know there are many areas of care and hospitals where excellent service is being provided, and staff are very motivated in this regard.  I fully agree that they are sometimes delivering care in conditions that are far less than ideal for delivering care.  Sometimes they are delivering care in very modern facilities.  The story varies as one goes around the country.</p> <p>  The capacity to recruit and retain staff is key for us.  The investment we need in primary social care and in expanding hospital care where we can in the coming 12 months and the 12 months thereafter will be very much dependent on the response to providing an environment that is attractive to work in, has adequate remuneration and is competitive internationally.  There is no question about that.  Those are the kinds of drivers we need to examine.</p> <p>  Creating a vision that sets out a journey for the future health system is necessary.  The report the Oireachtas will produce will be an important component.  Achieving a coherent, singular view on the direction of travel and providing that for staff around the country is important at a higher level in the here and now.   We are in competition internationally for staff who are actually difficult to get and we will have to continue to advertise and seek to provide flexibility in the manner referred to by Senator Burke if we are to attract them.</p></speech>

I have read his presentation, however.</p> <p>  I wish to raise just a few issues.  We are primarily inviting witnesses here to discuss the issue of overcrowding in our emergency departments.  This is basically what Mr. Woods referred to in his presentation.  He mentioned the winter initiative and all that flows from that.</p> <p>  The Minister for Health, Deputy Leo Varadkar, convened a task force in December 2014 and outlined that its objectives were to establish a communication platform, to inform, drive and support the HSE acute hospital division&rsquo;s implementation plan, to identify collaborative working arrangements, to anticipate potential problems or issues and to ensure appropriate structures, processes and controls. </p> <p>  I said to the witnesses in the earlier session that, as an Opposition Deputy, I could have drafted the press release on overcrowding on the first Tuesday of 2017 as far back as October.  That is the reality of the matter.  Every week, on Tuesday mornings, we will have the highest number of people on trolleys in our emergency departments.  That is also a given.  These are the known knows.  In that context, accepting that there are considerable capacity issues across the hospital system affecting acute beds, care unit beds, step-down facilities and transitional beds, how much closer are we to making our hospitals work over a greater number of hours?</p><p>Reference is made to senior clinical decision makers being available between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.  That is the case in emergency departments but not in other areas.  How far have we gone towards providing access to senior clinical decision makers and diagnostics on an eight-to-eight basis, or seven days per week?  What are the obstacles to that?  Is IR issues one of them?  Are there contractual issues or capacity problems in recruiting additional staff to oversee expanded diagnostics and extended hours?</p><p> Emergency medicine consultants have been before us today and other people have appeared before the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, chaired by Deputy R&oacute;is&iacute;n Shortall.  It seems that we have made very little progress in the area of elderly people presenting in our emergency departments across the country.  I refer particularly to the transfer of elderly patients from nursing homes or community settings to emergency departments, primarily for intravenous antibiotics, catheters and things that could and should be done in the community setting.  Given the major challenge facing us in terms of demographics and our life expectancy and ageing profile, our geriatric services and supports to the communities are not what they should be.  Should we not deal with this issue with some urgency?  If we do not we will end up, year after year, with the same problems with overcrowding and the almost inhumane treatment of transferring people in ambulances from their home care setting, such as a nursing home or a high-dependency home care package, to an acute hospital system which is anything but ideal?  Capacity in the shape of geriatric services, consultant geriatricians, nurse specialists and public health nurses does not seem to be expanding by much.  Are we making progress in that area?</p><p> We have 80 emergency medical consultants and 29 who provide acute and emergency cover at hospitals.  What are the obstacles to recruiting emergency medical consultants?  The recommendations are that the number should be at least doubled.  Is it a matter of the remuneration packages or that we have not been recruiting?  Are the staff just not there?  Why can we not expand the service, knowing that it would address the issues?  </p><p> In a presentation to the Committee on the Future of Healthcare, Mr. O'Brien said that if we stay as we are in terms of capacity, within a short number of years there will be no capacity in the public health system to deal with elective care, such as surgery and both inpatient and outpatient treatments.  We would effectively be an acute public health system dealing with elective surgeries when they become acute.  That will have profound implications for our ability to deal with patients in a timely manner.  How much of this is at play in the pressures in our acute hospitals and emergency departments on a daily basis?  On Monday morning people come in for elective surgeries but they take up the space required for those admitted through the emergency department.  Is there any way to look at a seven-day week, or putting on elective surgeries over the weekend to deal with the weekly overcrowding crisis we see on Mondays and Tuesdays?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.515" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#BB00200"><p>I apologise for missing the first bit of the meeting.  I had a matter to attend to but I read the submission.  Representatives from ICTU were before us earlier and they referred to a report commissioned and published in August 2016 which recommended that 107 nurses be employed to nurse patients already admitted and on trolleys.  They advised us that, as of last Friday, there was no provision in the HSE service plan for the employment of these nurses.  Can the witnesses comment on that?  The provision of advanced nurse practitioners has reached 78 but surely we could do an awful lot better.  As Mr. Liam Doran said, St. James's Hospital has six advanced nurse practitioners and consistently has the lowest level of trolleys across the country, albeit the figure is not zero.  We can very easily make the link between the availability of ANPs and the reduction in trolleys, which we all agree needs to be tackled, so can we not do something quickly in this regard?</p> <p>  My head spins with the figures relating to the winter initiative, not because I do not understand them but because sometimes it seems the same bed is counted twice.  How many additional hospital beds are currently open, staffed and operational?  How many transitional care beds are there as of today?  Where are the 300 additional acute beds referred to in the submission?  Are they open?  Are they on top of the 55 that were quoted?  Are they brand new?  </p> <p>  There was an emphasis in the submission on the need to transition to primary care and everybody says this.  A fantastic, brand new, beautiful, shiny primary care centre is about to open in Balbriggan.  Unfortunately, according to a answer given by the HSE to a parliamentary question, no new staff are going into it.  There are no new staff for the north county but the north county is already stretched to capacity.  I do not want to dwell on a local issue but this illustrates that there is a lot of talk but not much to back it up.  While everybody may say we need to go down the road of primary care, nobody does anything about it.  Maybe the witnesses can talk about the siloed nature of the health service and how the acute sector will not give up its budget to fund primary care.  Maybe it cannot do this but I would appreciate it if the witnesses would comment on the point.</p> <p>  The representatives from ICTU said that when the ratio of nurses to patients is worse than 1:8, care can become compromised.  Would the witnesses agree with this figure?  Everybody is a little bit tired of the HSE scrapping with the INMO about figures so I would hope the HSE would agree on this one.  Can the witnesses comment on what ICTU said afterwards, namely, that most emergency departments are routinely short-staffed by four or five nurses or more, leaving a ratio of one to 16, which would clearly not be acceptable.</p> <p>  Dr. O'Conor from the Irish Association for Emergency Medicine was asked how we were fixed to cope with a disaster.  Staff will probably say they cope with disasters every day of the week but I am talking about an actual disaster.</p><p>While there is a critical incident protocol, I am reading between the lines.  To be fair, the people who were in did not go as far as I would.  I say we are not set up at all to cope with a disaster involving a massive influx.  We already rely very heavily on the goodwill of the people who work in our emergency departments, from the man or woman delivering food to nurses and consultants.  Sometimes, goodwill is all that gets us through a serious critical incident.  In the estimation of Mr. Woods, how well set up are we for a critical incident?  In a previous life I sat on the group that looked at critical incident management and I put it to him that we are not very well set up at all.  If there were a critical incident, how would we be fixed given that we have 612 people waiting on trolleys?  We have now reached that stage.  It rarely drops below 500.  Would we be lucky if the critical incident happened in one area rather than another?</p></speech>

I have one or two questions to direct to Mr. Woods.  Specifically, this is about University Hospital Limerick's accident and emergency department and, more particularly, proceeding to build a 96-bed acute unit on the grounds of the hospital.  In 2009, reconfiguration took place.  There is context around the need to provide these beds.  The report was predicated on 138 co-location beds being built on the University Hospital Limerick site but the co-location project never proceeded.  At the same time, Ennis, Nenagh and St. John's closed their full-time accident and emergency departments and 50 beds left those hospitals at that time.  We have a bed capacity crisis with significant numbers on trolleys.  It is a continual problem.  If this 96-bed acute unit were built, it would take a lot of the pressure off when coupled with the new state-of-the-art accident and emergency department going ahead this year and opening by May.</p> <p>  I thank Mr. Woods for giving the go-ahead.  I have had discussions with him on the matter over recent weeks and he gave the go-ahead yesterday to allow the design phase for the 96-bed acute unit to proceed.  That has been communicated to estates at University Hospital Limerick and to myself as of yesterday.  I would like to see this project in Limerick progressed under the capital review.  It is included in the HSE's own capital plan.  Mr. Woods might just give me the process as he sees it.  For me, it is about not losing any more time.  That is why I have campaigned so hard to get lift-off, as it were, on the 96-bed acute unit.  What I want to know now is when shovels will be on site to start to build the unit.  It will be four storeys over the existing dialysis unit which is alongside the new accident and emergency department with approximately 24 beds per floor.  Where does Mr. Woods see the process from design to build?  What do we need to deal with to ensure it gets built and what is the timeframe?</p></speech>

He made an observation on senior decision-makers and asked where we are with having them available between 8 p.m. and 8 a.m.  An 8 p.m. to 8 a.m. service for diagnostics is substantively in place.  It came into place as part of the negotiations on the Lansdowne Road agreement.  In terms of senior clinical decision-makers, there are a couple of issues.  The Deputy asked what the driving factors were.  The availability and total number of senior decision-makers are challenges for us, as I am sure the Deputy is aware, when one reviews the OECD data.  That varies by site.  I was in Cork University Hospital not so far back and I saw the senior decision-makers come down at about 10.30 p.m. from theatre to support the emergency department.  We have a strong commitment from our clinical groupings and directors within hospital groups and on hospital sites.  They are constantly working to ensure that clinical decision-making is available to provide for effective flow.  Clearly, that is our significant concern.  We have challenges in that which are primarily about capacity.  Some facilities may have one to two emergency department physicians and that does not provide for round-the-clock service.  I have not personally experienced anything in contractual terms around that.  The Deputy referenced contract.  The main challenge we face is that there are many and competing demands on the delivery of services with a fixed number of clinicians on site.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely right to say the support of older persons in the community is key.  It is the kind of work that has gone on in Gurranabraher, St. Mary's and in the St. Francis unit reaching into communities to support more people at home and expanding the already in place outpatient antibiotic treatment process to ensure people from nursing homes do not need to come into an acute environment, which is critical.  We do some of that but could do more.  I ask Dr. Henry to make one or two comments on that as a geriatrician himself.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.519" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Colm Henry" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#CC00400"><p>It is a very apt comment about older people.  Previous speakers have alluded not just to demographic change but to the fact that in the past ten years people are surviving to a greater extent from interventions on heart disease, stroke and cancer than we could have imagined even a short time ago in medical terms.  This winter we saw that the rate at which those over 75 were presenting was up December on December by 13%, which is much more than could be explained by demographics.  It is a reflection of people surviving with chronic disease.  By the time they come to an emergency department, the chances are they will have to be admitted.  Our focus cannot just be on building hospital capacity to deal with older people who need hospital care but on shifting care into the community.</p> <p>  There are a number of initiatives and Dr. O'Conor alluded to this in terms of Connolly Hospital and the Mater where geriatricians appointed both to the hospitals and the community succeeded in reducing the number of patients referred from nursing homes to emergency departments at a time when the nursing home population expanded in the catchment.  We are expanding this to seven other sites nationally.  It means dehospitalising the care of older people where one can and an earlier alert system for those who are sick in order that they can be seen in another environment such as a day hospital.  It also means interventions which can be targeted long before people get so sick that they have to come to an emergency department.  As I said, by the time an old person with a chronic disease comes to an emergency department, it is likely he or she will need to be admitted regardless of whether a senior decision-maker is there.</p></speech>

There were six additional approvals in 2015 and we are still recruiting four, such is the timescale to attract senior clinicians.  We acknowledge fully that we need more emergency department consultants.  The constraints on that are related to recruitment and, when we look forward, it is probably about the capacity programme and targeted investment in specific sites to grow capacity there.  Does Ms Fitzgerald want to add anything?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.521" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Angela Fitzgerald" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#CC00600"><p>It is fair to say we do not have enough emergency department physicians.  The point was made around 24-7 cover.  We have 12 sites with fewer than two whole-time equivalent staff members and, as such, their capacity to provide out-of-hours cover is very compromised.  In 2015, we put in five additional consultants.  It was a very small number.  We had hoped to do more of that this year but we are not in a position to do it.  Alongside that, we have been trying to build capability around the acute medical assessment units in order that they can support emergency physicians.  By any objective comparison, we do not have the numbers to provide 24-7 cover across the current number of emergency departments we have.  Dr. Henry is involved in looking at the trauma review which will allow us to think about emergency networks.  I am sure Dr. Emily O'Conor spoke a bit about that.</p><p> The way forward in organising and configuring services is probably hub centres supported by emergency centres providing some but not all of the services.  In the short term the impact of austerity has hit us most significantly in consultant numbers.  Mr. Woods mentioned the OECD's Health at a Glance report.  We do quite well in comparisons on nursing numbers.  Liam Doran would not be very happy with me for saying that.  We do very badly in the comparisons on consultant numbers.  There is work to be done.  The establishment of the groups allows for more logical thinking on how to prioritise emergency physicians and this is the work we must do in 2017.</p><p> I will answer Deputy O'Reilly's question on nursing.  There were several strands to her question but as part of the emergency department agreement we had with the INMO, there was recognition that at the time there were 144 vacant posts.  We have a commitment and funding to put these in place.  At our most recent review with the INMO, it emerged that between 80% and 90% of the posts were in place.  As the Deputy quite rightly stated, the challenge is attracting people into an unattractive environment.  There is a bit of chicken-and-egg situation.  If we get the staff in, we will make it more attractive.  The second piece is with regard to the norms we use.</p></speech>

One is the normal nursing requirements for somebody being treated in an emergency department, and the vacancy factor is 144.  Deputy O'Reilly is quite right that over and above this a review was done by the Department.  This stated if we accept in the short term that we have boarded patients, which are patients who are not yet able to get to a bed but who need to be nursed, the number is 107.  I did the calculation and I know this is the number.  It is based on an agreed methodology in the review, looking back at the average number of trolleys.  As was said at a meeting last week, the challenge for us is we were not given the resources to put this in place.  With regard to accepting the number, 107 has been accepted as the agreed number.  It is our number.  The agreed number for the normal running of the emergency department is 144 vacant posts.  These have been supported.</p> <p>  Other measures under the emergency department agreement have been taken on senior decision-making in nursing.  As committee members know, 26 patient flow emergency department nurses were agreed at assistant director of nursing level and they are being recruited.  Grade 1 clinical nurse managers were agreed for every emergency department and grade 2 clinical nurse managers were agreed for a specific number of departments.  All of these are either recruited or in process.  The total number between these initiatives is approximately 216 posts.  There is no disagreement between us and the INMO on the requirement to have adequate nursing.  We have agreed a process on the 144.  A specific measure on boarded patients identified through the agreement was recognised as requiring additional funding.  At this time we do not have the resources to put this in place.</p></speech>

As a result, the HSE, the clinicians, their representatives and all of the people in charge of recognising where there is a need have identified the need for 107 nurses to deal with what we all do not want, but which we now must accept as a fact - I would say because of Government policy but others would probably have other ideas - but it is what it is.  Ms Fitzgerald is saying that the resources for these 107 nurses have not been provided.</p></speech>

Am I barking up the wrong tree?  Is there somewhere else from where the money should be coming?  All of these issues are interlinked, which is exactly what I was driving at when I said I get confused about the figures.  If all of the people in charge of this have agreed that 107 nurses are needed for the boarded patients, or whatever phrase we want to use, the poor unfortunates on trolleys is what most people call them, but there is no funding for this.  I presume this should come from the Department of Health.</p></speech>

Certainly in the interim the challenge is the patients are typically nursed and this creates displacement elsewhere.  It is important the committee understands nursing is provided to manage the patients but it means staffing elsewhere in the hospital is challenged.  Something else we are trying to do in the very short term is to reduce this.  The basis for this is not being able to place patients up the house.  We have already made progress, working with the INMO through weekly engagement, on ensuring that we make improvements on this on a day to day basis.  The HSE would not want to see boarded patients accepted on an ongoing basis and that there is a plan to fail.  We and the INMO recognise that staff found should be placed up the house if the situation improves.  This is the situation at present.</p> <p>  The Deputy specifically asked about the beds.  Initially, 55 acute beds were announced, with 18 step-down beds in Mercy University Hospital.  Due to staffing challenges, some of the named sites for the 55 beds were not able to proceed in time for winter.  We redirected the resource.  As of today 28 beds are open in Galway and there are ten in Beaumont, with an additional five beds outside of the 55, 18 beds in Mercy-----</p></speech>

Regrettably, due to the ongoing challenges of attracting in Naas and Waterford because of bed closures funding was redirected and in simple terms it was given to open beds in Galway.  The latter has now opened 28 beds instead of the beds that were to open in Naas and Waterford.  The beds in Beaumont included in the original 55 have been opened.  The 18 beds in Mercy University Hospital, which were not in the 55 because they are step-down beds, have also been opened.  Seven of the original 55 beds have been opened in Mullingar and 15 beds have opened in the Mater hospital.  Originally our intention was to do a collaboration with the Mater Private Hospital.  We had to accept that in the short term the Mater Private Hospital could not meet the needs required on a continuous basis and funding was redirected to provide for 15 beds in the Mater hospital.  This gives a total of 78 beds.  The intention is to open 12 beds in Tullamore in February.  They will open between mid February and the end of that month.  I would be happy to give the Deputy a written report on this if she wishes.</p></speech>

The Tuesday figure referred to and the pattern of admissions of electives and urgent electives does, of course, have an effect on trolleys, and hospitals are constantly balancing demands from emergency departments and demands for elective work.  With regard to weekend work, on occasion and during the course of last year we funded specific activity over weekends where it was feasible to do so.  We have the capacity in clinical and nursing terms to do so.  Primarily this was done through the waiting list initiative.  The constraints on this are the availability of people and restrictions on total supply.  We can give the Deputy the list of the 300 beds from 2015 to 2016.  They all opened, but we can give a list of their current status if it is helpful.</p> <p>  A question was asked about Balbriggan primary care centre.  I will ask Mr. McCallion to address primary care centres generally - Balbriggan is a case in point - along with the questions on emergency planning observations.</p></speech>

We have 15 community intervention teams in the country.  Four came through the winter initiative and they are still in the formation stage.  These are the teams that typically go into nursing homes.  The Deputy's question is fair.  There is still further scope for this.  Some of the teams work very well and some are trying to expand the geographical areas they cover for patients.  There is also work to be done on general practice with regard to medical oversight.</p><p>There is further scope there.  There is one very good example, which has published research, in the Mater where, as referred to by Dr. Colm Henry, the geriatrician has gone out to provide some of that clinical oversight and worked with the community intervention team to try to keep a larger number of people in what is their home - a nursing home - versus their having to be brought into hospital.  Where it has worked it has been successful and there is definitely further scope in the area.</p></speech>

Some of it will be down to historical reasons in terms of capacity to recruit and so on, but we can give the breakdown to the committee.</p> <p>  In terms of the points made by the Chairman on primary care and what we can do in the intervening years, in general terms there is significant further scope.  We all accept that to build hospital beds and other capacity in the community will take time.  I have mentioned the community intervention teams and there are good examples of this but there are other areas where we have further work to do to enhance primary care.  One example is what is happening in Mallow where consultants come out from Cork University Hospital.  Diagnostic facilities are available there as well.</p> <p>  On specific resourcing of certain centres, be they in Balbriggan or elsewhere, initially the primary care centres are developed around the existing resources but we are trying to identify where we can put in new resources.  For example, this year under the chronic disease programme people will be going in to work with primary care teams on diabetes.  To get full geographical coverage will take time but there has been investment in recent years in diabetic nurse specialists to go out to work with practices.</p> <p>  The GP contract is also key.  Some diagnostic facilities have been rolled out in primary care and one of our additional measures in January was to try to extend that roll-out for a time but that is still very much at the formative stage.</p> <p>  Therefore, there is definitely more scope in terms of the point about the specific centre.  On the broader point the Chairman made about what primary care can contribute given the length of time it will take and the challenge we will inevitably face over the next number of winters, there is a need for significant investment in the resource to make those function in a much more powerful way in trying to avoid presentation to emergency departments.</p></speech>

I appreciate I am being a little parochial but Mr. McCallion stated that the centre in Balbriggan would be developed around existing resources.  Mr. McCallion knows already that the existing resources are not adequate to meet demand, so to say it is being developed around existing resources effectively means that we will have general practitioners moving into beautiful buildings, with the ground floor probably leased out to pharmacists, coffee shop proprietors and the devil knows what, but there will be no actual additional services.  It does not sound to me like there is any plan to shift over to primary care.  There is a plan to talk a lot about shifting over to primary care but there is no plan to actually do it.  That is where we find not just mine, but a collective frustration.  We all know there is a need to move to primary care but, with respect, the HSE is in the driving seat.  However, it either does not have a map or the will to move on it.  I do not know what it is happening but there seems to be a blockage.  There is no need to state repeatedly at the committee meetings and elsewhere that there is a need to move to primary care.  We agree.  The question is how it will happen and what is being done.  Mr. McCallion stated that it will be developed within existing resources but we have established that existing resources are not sufficient.  As Deputy Kelleher alluded to earlier, we might as well write the press release now for the first Tuesday in January 2018 because nothing is going to change.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.546" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Damien McCallion" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2017012500002#EE00900"><p>To deal with the point about existing resources, I was referring to moving from old buildings to new buildings which in itself is not what brings the resources.  Clinical programmes are being run nationally that are setting out alternatives in terms of how primary care can develop, so there is a roadmap but it will require resourcing.  To give some examples, community intervention teams are one part of it.  Other areas include the development of injury units and trying to promote and encourage people to utilise those rather than emergency departments.  In terms of general practice and primary care, this is also about chronic disease management.  That is one of the national programmes, which is looking at putting resources in around chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, COPD, diabetes and so on.  For example, for the first time there is now a full register of those with diabetes.  We are trying to develop and sustain it so that services can be planned around it.</p> <p>  There is a fairly clear roadmap.  Some of it is developing and some of it is still in the early stages, but there are resources following it.  In terms of the sort of things we are talking about today, the pressures the system is under, the growth in the population and the points Dr. Colm Henry referred to earlier, the level of investment will have to be enhanced significantly to make those centres work better.  A key issue will be the GP contract.  GPs are one of the key resources in primary care.  It is clear that all of those things will have to come together.</p> <p>  To clarify, a number of projects are running.  As I stated, we have four more community intervention teams so they now total 15.  In terms of chronic disease management, resources are being deployed around diabetes and in other chronic diseases as well.  Another area that is being examined and which has been mentioned a couple of times is an integrated care pathway, that is, we are examining how the system works for patients both going into hospital and coming out of hospital, and the process side.  There are clinical programmes set up around all of those and they are also starting to identify the resources that are required.  Some of them take time to come to fruition in the sense of providing the evidence that they function.</p> <p>  The other one I will mention is the frail elderly programme which is working in six areas in the country at the moment.  One of those is in Sligo.  It is in the hospital and is examining how frail and elderly patients are managed within the system when they require admission.  The programme would cite that as being one of the key factors in their ability to manage the trolleys down to a lower level this year given all the things we spoke about earlier.  Some of those take time to come through but they are looking at all aspects, both resources and process in-hospital and out-of-hospital. </p></speech>

If hospital centred care is to be transferred to community centred care, it will most likely be a GP-led primary care service.  There is significant potential for the management of chronic illness in primary care if the potential is released, but we have a huge manpower problem in general practice.  Some 33% of the GP population is aged more than 55 years of age.  There will be a huge manpower gap, if care and services are transferred to primary care, because the GPs are not on the ground.  However, there is huge potential for taking pressure from the hospital system.  The added potential is to integrate primary care with secondary care because there is a major gap between primary and secondary care.  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony spoke about communication.  That there is little communication between primary care and secondary care in terms of discussing patients and developing services is a significant problem.  All that has to be taken into account when talking about changing the service and taking pressure from our hospital services.</p></speech>

Deputy Louise O'Reilly raised one other point that I have not addressed, which relates to critical incident management and emergency management.  One of my areas of responsibility is emergency management.  She was probably referring to two levels: one is the day-to-day basis in the hospital and the management systems around risk that are in place.  There are systems, escalation protocols and so on to manage that daily in terms of making decisions when hospitals come under pressure.</p> <p>  On the wider perspective, there is an emergency management framework.  The HSE works in the same way as the Garda and those in other inter-agency areas.  We are constantly running tests in that regard.  We just had a discussion at our own leadership team yesterday in terms of running people through it.  There is constantly simulation.  We were taken through one yesterday in relation to a major road traffic accident in the north west that was simulated live on the road.  All of the emergency services were involved that would have an impact on the hospital.  The process and framework is constantly tested.  Being trained for these events is one thing but to test it and simulate it is another.  There is strong evidence that unless we are doing that regularly we will not address it.  Therefore, on major emergencies, there is a well-established framework.  We have strengthened the resources in that area to work with the hospitals and our community partners as well in terms of community health organisations to do that.</p></speech>

One of them was whether the acute hospital sector would surrender budgets.  I am the director of acute hospital services in the HSE and from my perspective, as part of the answer to the question, we will face a challenge in needing a resource to transition to a primary care-driven service.  The notion of a safe transition from one model to another and resourcing it arises and I am sure it will be flagged by the Oireachtas through the work of the committee.  Having said that, where work is being transferred and staff are moving too, of course, it is possible.  However, I would be very alert to the pressures on the acute system to do work that truly needs to be done in the acute environment.  There is upward pressure in high intensity areas of service for that resource.  The answer is a little mixed.  It is hard for me as director of acute hospital services to consider that, of course, but if it is working as part of an overall plan for transition funding, it will be part of our journey but only part of it.</p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly asked whether we agreed with the one in eight figure for the nurse-to-patient ratio.  The study conducted by the Department of nurse numbers nationally used generically a ration of one in eight and we would not argue with it.  There are areas of care where the ratio may be more intensive, but, broadly, we would not argue with that figure.</p></speech>

The ICU building, the dialysis service investment and the new emergency department will I hope come onstream later this year.  There is also the education block at the back of the site.  They have all been significant developments, although there is an issue with the basic ward stock, on which I have corresponded with the hospital.  I can assure Senator Kieran O'Donnell that we will issue from our estates department approval to commence the design phase.  The Senator referred to the steps beyond that phase.  There is a procurement process and there will be a design phase followed by planning, as I am sure he is aware.  I could correspond with him or ask the estates department to set out the steps involved in the process.  We are also involved in a mid-term capital review process.  If I understand the question the Senator asked, it was about the availability of funding when the design phase was complete, when the building work would start and there would be JCBs on site.  The natural flow of the project will probably take a year or a little more, from now until there is a design and subsequently a move towards planning.  Our position, in terms of the global capital base of the HSE, will be known to us at that stage, pending completion of the mid-term review which will take place in the coming months.</p></speech>

I wish to be very clear because we are short of time and possibly patience at this stage, although not in my case.  There are 78 advanced nurse practitioners, but there should be 150.  This time next year, if we are all lucky enough to be back, how many more ANPs will there be, taking into account the fact that some of them must be coming up to retirement age?  I am thinking of one in particular whom I know and who, if she has not gone already, is probably due to leave fairly soon.  How close to the 150 target will we be?</p></speech>

We agreed with our partners that the figure would be 148, close to the 150 to which the Deputy referred.  Our objective is to grow to that number as quickly as we can.  We have approximately 80.</p></speech>

By the time the report was announced we had eight posts in planning and they were approved.  There is no specific provision.  There is also a lead-in time because, as the Deputy is aware, they have to be at clinical nurse specialist, CNS, level.  A total of 107 were in a resource bucket, but the bucket is empty  Our objective is to engage in the planning.  The difference between a clinical nurse specialist and an advanced nurse practitioner is small, but to get people into training, we will start the process this year.</p></speech>

That is critical.  I have corresponded with the Minister, Deputy Simon Harris, and spoken to the CEO of the HSE, Mr. Tony O&rsquo;Brien.  I have also spoken at length to Mr. Woods about the 96 bed acute unit, which is also critical.  It is good news that the design phase is under way and that we have lost no more time.  Mr. Woods expects the mid-term national capital plan review to take place in the next couple of months.  The health section of the capital plan is extremely important.  For example, in the education sector, if no new schools were built in recent years, there will be a problem due to the increase in the size of the population.  There are few, if any, new emergency departments, while there has been no increased bed capacity in acute services.  I, therefore, call on the Government to ensure the project will go ahead.  I also urge the HSE to ensure it is part of its priorities.  Will Mr. Woods comment briefly on the matter?  The Minister has given a commitment that if the emergency department in University Hospital Limerick is ready, it will be opened in May.  I have spoken to the CEO of the hospital and been told that staff are being recruited.</p> <p>  The HSE must prioritise the 96 bed acute unit in order that when the mid-term national capital plan review takes place, the project will go ahead.  I am concerned that the headline projects in Dublin such as the national children's hospital and the national maternity hospital, both of which are very welcome, will take priority.  It is extremely important that major projects outside Dublin go ahead.  I refer to hospitals in which there is a lack of capacity, including University Hospital Limerick.  It is vital that the 96 bed acute unit is built.  </p> <p>  Will Mr. Woods deal with the opening of the emergency department in May and assure us that the 96 bed acute unit is a priority for the HSE?  It is very good news that the design work is under way and that we have not lost more time, but I wish to hear that the HSE is committed to funding the project which will cost &euro;25 million.  If funding comes through following the mid-term review of the national capital development plan which I very much hope will be the case, how long will it be before JCBs are on site and the 96 bed acute unit is fully operational?</p></speech>

Can a response be sent to the committee because Nursing Homes Ireland stated in its statement issued today that the emergency department task force had never engaged with it?  The position needs to be clarified in writing because the issue is important and it is in the public domain.</p> <p>  I accept that it is not within Mr. Woods's area, but I ask for a written response to be sent to the committee on another issue also.  In the Cork north River Lee area there were 68 public health or community nurses.  I am not clear on the distinction between the two.  At any one time last year ten were out on sick leave or maternity leave and there were no replacements for them.  That seems to be what is happening in the sector.  If a nurse in a hospital was out on leave, someone would be brought in to replace him or her.  I do not expect to receive a response today, but I ask for a written reply to be given to the committee.  In the future, if someone is out on sick leave or some other form of leave for an extended period, sufficient backup support should be provided.</p></speech>

We understand that capacity at the hospital is very stretched, to put it mildly, and the acute medical programme has assessed that, so rest assured there is value, need and prioritisation-----</p></speech>

From an internal HSE perspective, I would see it as a priority.  In respect of the point the Senator makes about things being shovel ready, we can show him technically what will happen there and we will do so.  The mid-term review is tied into the overall Government process.  The Senator's observations around the number of schoolchildren, teachers, desks and schools are well made.  The capacity study under way in the Department and work we will do to support that will look at articulating the requirement around the moving demographic in terms of the scale and, in particular, the ageing element of that and what it means to the balance-----</p></speech>

This is a more straightforward answer.  The original date was March and was then moved to May.  Recruitment of staff is under way.  Mr. Woods has visited the accident and emergency department in University Hospital Limerick and knows how dire it is.  It is too small and claustrophobic.  The reconfiguration took place in 2009.  The cart was put before the horse.  The new accident and emergency department should have been built at that time and the new bed capacity should have been provided, but neither was done.  I am passionate about this because I have been on the ground all that time.  A commitment was given by everyone that this new accident and emergency department would be opened in May.  I am told by the management of University Hospital Limerick that it is recruiting.  If the staff are in place and it is ready to be opened in May, will the HSE support that?</p></speech>

To clear up a slight misunderstanding regarding what he initially said, I had thought the suggestion was that the social care division had not been in dialogue, which surprised me.  I take the comment about the task force and we will correspond with the Senator on it.  In respect of the points made about sick leave and maternity leave, there is capacity to replace those on sick leave or maternity leave because the budget is in place for those staff.

I welcome the T&aacute;naiste and Minister for Justice and Equality, Deputy Frances Fitzgerald, and her officials.  The purpose of this meeting is to have a pre-legislative discussion on the scheme of the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2016, the Minister's Bill, in tandem with the Judicial Appointments Commission Bill 2016, a Private Members' Bill, which has been tabled by Deputy Jim O'Callaghan.  The format of the meeting is that I will invite the Minister, Deputy Fitzgerald, to brief the committee on the scheme of her Bill and then I will call Deputy Jim O'Callaghan brief the committee on his Bill.  I will then open it up to a general discussion and questions and answers.  Deputy O'Callaghan, as a member of the committee, will, in the same way as any other member, be in a position to ask the Minister specific questions relevant to her Bill, and as she is an <i>ex officio</i>member of the committee when <i>in situ</i>, she will be afforded exactly the same facilitation if there are any questions she wishes to pose to Deputy O'Callaghan.  We will approach our business equitably.  I call Deputy Fitzgerald to make her opening statement.</p></speech>

The Private Members' Bill in the name of Deputy O'Callaghan, which also proposes reforms in the area of judicial appointments, is also being considered today.  The Government approved these measures as a scheme last month and the scheme is before the committee today for scrutiny.  Work on the technical drafting of the Bill has been under way and it is my intention, following today's discussion and the feedback from the committee, to finalise the preparation of the Bill quickly with a view to publication shortly.</p> <p>  I will approach this in the following way.  We have two measures before the committee, one is a scheme and one is a Bill.  The first point I would like to make is that it is striking how much these Bills complement each other.  We are both committed to significantly enhancing the judicial selection model with a strengthened new body with clear objectives, full powers, appropriate resources and a clear mandate to recommend the most meritorious candidate for judicial office to Government.  It is appropriate that we consider these matters now, 20 years after the creation of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, JAAB.  The board has served us well but it is our duty to continually look to the future and to attempt to improve processes where we can.  It is clear that both pieces of legislation are committed to this.  Where there are points of discussion about elements of the design, obviously we will have that discussion, and I will highlight some of these points in my presentation.  In order to be helpful to the committee, I will address issues relevant both to the Bill before it and to the scheme, and Deputy O'Callaghan will do the same.</p> <p>  The scheme sets up a new commission.  It is an ambitious vision, putting the new body on a dual purpose footing, to select candidates and recommend persons for appointment, but also to invest time, expertise and resources in redeveloping the requirements and procedures as a modern, professional and independent selection framework, fit for purpose now and into the future.  The Private Members' Bill also establishes a new commission.  It does not go into that much detail on the support measures.  The Government scheme brings all appointments into the new arrangements so that, from now on, judges seeking judicial promotion, or to serve in a higher court, will go through the commission.  This is significant and is in line with views from all quarters that this should be the case.  That is not the situation at present.  Sitting judges do not inform of their interest through the JAAB at this point.  Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill also brings these appointments within the ambit of the new arrangements.</p><p> I would say that we each have a very different view as to how the very senior president and chief justice posts should be approached.  We can discuss the respective merits of the different approaches.  My preference is the Government approach which, in summary, involves a special committee under head 32 to consider expressions of interest working in tandem with the commission.  I will make some comments about the role of the Minister later and I am suggesting a change in that.  Head 28 brings down from the present minimum seven rule to just three names that the commission will now recommend to the Government for appointment.  There will be two additional names to correspond with each additional vacancy.  This is another major reform and again it is one that is being advocated by many different people.  Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill also goes for three but there is a further qualification, that this requires the three names to be in order of merit and an additional one name only for another vacancy.</p><p> I want to put forward a very important constitutional point and I think that most people are agreed on this.  The role of the Government, in the principle of it but maybe not the detail, under the Constitution in this matter requires a level of discretion.  All of the legal advice says that.  I would say that is not consistent with a statutory body providing only three names in order of choice.  Similarly, even without an order, having only six names be recommended for four vacancies is inadequate for a real choice.  As I say, there is a very important point, which is the Government exercising its constitutional prerogative.  That may be unconstitutional if one is not giving that level of choice of candidates, by fine-tuning it down to that degree.</p><p> Again delivering on the Government programme, the scheme provides for a lay majority of one on the commission and a lay chair.  I understand that there has never actually been a vote on the job, and that names have been selected by agreement in the past.  I imagine that may well continue when we are talking about establishing the kind of professional body that we are considering here today.  The vision here is to strengthen very considerably the present 20 year old model of lay involvement.  Now there are just three lay people and eight judicial and legal persons making decisions, so it is a ratio of 3:8 at present.  I would say that getting exactly the right input of lay expertise is difficult, but we can return to that.  I think there is discussion to be had about what kind of lay experience is wanted, how the lay people are selected, and precisely what that brings to the table.  I would say it brings a lot to the table and it is in line with being citizen-friendly and consumer-friendly, which is an important point.</p><p> I think it is enough for me to say at this point that it is essential that there is a critical mass of non-judicial, non-legal voices on the commission, covering a range of expertise and experience.  That is to complement what I would say is the indispensable expertise and input of the Judiciary and the legal members as regards professional and technical suitability for appointment.  Different countries have different ways of accessing that technical, legal and judicial experience, and bringing it into the process of selection.  Scotland has a particular model where there is almost something like a gatekeeper role in terms of judicial experience being assessed in the first instance.  We are not suggesting that but I make the point.</p><p> The Private Members' Bill, Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill, keeps the majority judicial and legal formula.  I think that the scale of reform required here and the new professional selection organisation that we are creating moves us beyond that.  The scheme also provides for a lay chair.  I want to make the point to the committee that there seems to be no difficulty with this in England, Wales and Scotland, where the procedures have been fully reformed in recent times.  It is a Government programme commitment.  The Chief Justice is a member, of course.  I believe that the overall balance here is right.  We can return to this too.</p><p> Another perspective on this is that we will have a body with five judicial and legal members, five lay members, and an independent lay chair.  We have allowed in our scheme for the representation of the Bar Council of Ireland and the solicitors' group, arguing that they bring a different perspective to the table than judicial members.  The scheme that we are suggesting has five judicial and legal members, five lay members, and an independent lay chair.</p><p> One other similarity is the need to expressly recognise the key requirement, which is merit.  We do that in different ways and we can discuss that.  A big advantage of this scheme to support the Government's objective is a commitment to properly resource the commission.  An office under the commission and a director would make all the difference to what is planned.  This is about a professional body being established that can do this work, can look at international best practice and can develop.  It is not just a body that we set up which experiences no development and movement.  We want to give it the resources to develop best practice models to keep attuned with what is happening internationally.</p><p> Other matters addressed by the Government Bill include new accountability requirements, including accountability of the commission to an Oireachtas committee, and an annual statement by the Minister to the House about appointments made in the previous year.  Academic lawyers become eligible for appointment as a judge in prescribed circumstances.  The scheme makes service on the District Court bench calculable for the practice requirements for appointment as a High Court judge.  That is an important and warranted advance, as is increasing to 70 the retirement age of District Court judges so that all judges will have the same retirement age.  There are differences at present.  It will be important to carefully monitor the implementation of reforms.</p><p> Head 10 requires the committee, within 20 months of the measures coming into force, to report to the commission on the implementation and effectiveness of the functions and procedures assigned to it.  I would like to look at this again, and in line with the fact that it is just a scheme that I am bringing, and not a full Bill, I am recommending a couple of further changes that I would like to do in the drafting of the Bill.  I am suggesting that the committee may agree to the need to include a review clause that would require the Minister, five years after the commencement of the Act, to review its operation and, within one year of that, to prepare an analysis and report on the matter to lay this before the House.  This would allow all sides to revisit the reforms and see precisely how it is working.  I am determined, and have been as Minister for Justice and Equality, to ensure that all judicial appointments are made on merit.</p><p> Before I turn to other matters, I would mention to the committee that I intend to include in the legislation a prohibition on canvassing, which would make it unlawful for any person, candidate, applicant or otherwise, to seek to interfere with or compromise in any way the selection procedures.  This issue has been mentioned by the Judiciary as well and subject to Government approval, a relevant provision should form part of the reforms.  We see this, for example, when the new police authority is appointing people to promotions within the ranks of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  There will now be a specific clause saying that it is an offence to canvas for a promotion.  It will be a disqualifying offence.  That has to be drafted.</p><p> I would like very briefly to look back at the changes to the judicial system, and to make a number of points about them.  Looking back briefly, the first major change that was made to this was in 1995, and it was quite ground-breaking then.  It is important for us to cast our minds back to that and remember that up to that point in 1995, selection and appointment of judges were entirely the preserve of the Government of the day.  There were no intermediate steps, there was no separate authority involved in the process, and no information was provided about appointments.  While at this remove looking back at measures that were introduced 20 years ago in the Courts and Court Officers Act 1995 we might say they were minimal, at the time it totally changed the way Government approached the whole question of judicial appointments.  Other jurisdictions have moved on since, and international instruments provide more guidance on best standards.</p><p> However, I would make the point, and I have looked at all of the international approaches to this, that there is still huge variation.  In New Zealand, for example, which is the highest ranked country in terms of judicial independence, the Attorney General selects all of the people to present to the Government of New Zealand for judicial appointments, and yet it is still ranked at the top internationally.  However, there is a growing consensus about what constitutes best practice, which we want to capture.  I am not suggesting that we have had anything other than an excellent Judiciary.  It served us well before 1995 and I believe we have had an excellent Judiciary since then too.  It is important for public confidence that there is an independent and professionally operated and overseen system for selection of judges, based on transparent criteria, upstream of the relevant decision of Government.</p><p>As such, we must move on and continue to protect the independence of the Judiciary and guarantee to the greatest extent we can that the quality of our judicial system is maintained in today's conditions and the ever-changing environment around accountability, governance and administrative efficiency.</p><p> When it comes to reform of the system, the important point is that the establishment or amendment of a judicial selection system through legislation is a matter for the Oireachtas alone.  As long as what is proposed is constitutional and not retrospective, there can be no authority other than the Oireachtas as to what the new legislative arrangements may be.  It is the prerogative of Government or, as we see today, any Member of the House to bring forward proposals to the Oireachtas for enactment.  Judicial selection is not part of the judicial function.  The judicial function is to apply the law, interpret the Constitution and defend it.  The reason the Judiciary is involved in judicial selection is because the Oireachtas assigned it that role in legislation.  In my view, no one could argue against the Judiciary having a major input into the judicial selection process because of the key skills, knowledge and experience of the judges.  Nothing has changed constitutionally.  In theory, the Oireachtas could repeal the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and not replace it with anything.  Of course, that is not a viable option but it illustrates the respective roles of the arms of State in the process and the choices we have in that matter.</p><p> In terms of the views of the Judiciary, I want to make a few points and I need to say the following.  The Irish Judiciary is now and always has been one of the great successes of the Irish State.  Its enduring independence has provided a constitutional structure that has enabled the State to withstand enormous political and economic threats to its existence and stability.  The Irish Judiciary is consistently among the top ten most independent judiciaries globally.  It is worth noting that point.  The judicial appointments review committee, or JARC, is a committee of senior judges headed by the Supreme Court's Mr. Justice O'Donnell and it has submitted views on the scheme.  The JARC also submitted very extensive views and analysis in 2014.  The Chief Justice has also submitted views.  The Judiciary has indicated that is does not agree with aspects of the scheme, suggests that prior study or research has not been conducted and argues that elements of the scheme are inconsistent with and contrary to international guidance and best practice.  The most serious criticisms are directed at the new commission, in particular its composition and lay chair, as proposed.</p><p> I want it to be clear that the scheme reflects much of what the judicial committee proposed in consultations, if not precisely in the manner proposed.  For instance, we propose that the scheme covers all posts, including promotion of judges, that only three names will be recommended to Government, that merit is included as critical guidance to selection, that there is a properly resourced system, and that the selection process is independent and professionalised.  The Judiciary has mentioned international benchmarks, but international standards for protecting judicial independence recognise that there is a range of models to choose from and that democratic involvement through government is a legitimate form of judicial selection.  Even in our three immediate neighbouring jurisdictions, there are different arrangements in play in relation to lay participation, lay chairing and other areas.</p><p> There has been consultation which has helped to inform these proposed changes.  In 2014, we received 27 submissions from a range of different people and bodies, including both of the professional bodies and the Judiciary.  Guiding principles under heading five provide an important reference for these reforming measures, the systematic development of processes and requirements for which the commission will have responsibility, and the approach of the Executive to the appointments process.  These principles underpin the reforming provisions of the scheme.  It is actually the processes the new body will use that are critical.  While the composition is very important, how the commission does its work and the processes it develops to do its work, which I have outlined to some degree, will prove the effectiveness of this body.</p><p> At the heart of these reforms, we are putting in place a new commission to replace the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board which had, or at least exercised, a somewhat restricted remit under the 1995 Act over the intervening period of 20 years.  The need for transparency and accountability and the complexity and extent of the environment within which the judicial system now operates demand something new.  They demand not only that the new commission will have a much more exacting and hands-on role in the selection of judges, but also that extensive new work is carried out with an ongoing remit to update the requirements for selection and the manner of selection to take account of the very many considerations which are prescribed in the scheme.  The framing statute is not the place to specify the attributes of candidates to a definitive degree.  The procedures committee provided for under heading ten will do that under the auspices of the commission with the support of expert analysis and research.  It is a major advance to have in place on a permanent basis a commission part of whose remit will be to develop fully professionalised selection processes.  The principle is selection based on merit but the layout of the detailed components of merit will be left to the commission.</p><p> As such, the commission will have a developmental remit but, of course, its routine function will be to recommend three persons for a judicial vacancy.  This is a major advance in terms of the value being brought to the procedure by the commission from the 20 year old requirement to provide a minimum of seven names.  Indeed, three names - let me recognise that this where the Private Members' Bill and the Government measure intersect - is the lowest number advised as constitutionally and legally permissible as committed to in the programme for Government.   I have taken extensive advice on this aspect.  There are important differences linked to this provision between the measures.  I am satisfied that three names without an order of merit and an additional two, to give, for example, a total of five recommendations when there are two vacancies, or seven where there are three vacancies, and so on, is the correct balance given the constitutional role of the Government.</p><p> The question of ranking names was considered by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and, in its annual report in 2002, discounted as placing, by the judges themselves which is an interesting point, too great a restriction on the constitutional prerogative of Government to select judges.  As such, I have concerns about the constitutionality of ranking and clearly we differ on that point.  The scheme also contrasts with the 1995 provisions by bringing promotion of judges from one court to another into the framework of the commission.  This, in itself, is a major change but it was invariably mentioned in the public consultations and it adds enormously to the transparency and equity of the whole appointments process.</p><p> I go back to make further points on the composition of the commission.  The board, or, as it will now be, commission, itself is changing.  I acknowledge that the Government's view on this is not universally accepted.  The Private Members' Bill increases lay membership of the board and although I am not convinced of the merits of the nominating-body mechanism for procuring that expertise, it is nevertheless a fair recognition that the existing position regarding lay input is inadequate.  It is inadequate not only in terms of the numbers, but also in terms of the range of expertise and experience being covered.  In effect, the lay input has been reduced since the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board was expanded to include the President of the new Court of Appeal just over two years ago.  As such, even the rather minor role of lay persons as envisaged in 1995 has been diluted not by design, but because there is a new court.</p><p> As the position in other jurisdictions varies greatly, it is important not to generalise.  However, expert lay persons, including in some cases lay chairpersons, bring to the process expertise such as that of senior civil service and public services managers, human resources and recruitment specialists, education and training experts, senior commercial executives, and equality and diversity experts.  In fact, some of the most respected academic research I have been looking at contains interesting observations on the importance of lay input into selection.  That is not to undermine the importance of judicial input, but to recognise that, in respect of what we expect from our courts and the range of decisions they have to make, a wide variety of experience is essential in terms of determining who is best placed to be a member of the Judiciary.  A modern appointments process should be driven by a commission that can draw on these specialist qualities.</p><p>The commission should have at the centre of its decision making the experience lay persons have of the system of justice from the perspective of consumers of court processes, be it in family law, criminal law or any other aspect of the law.  In this context I have in mind interest groups involved in law matters, penal matters, victim concerns and community law interests acting in a representative capacity locally and otherwise.<br/><br/>What we are trying to achieve in the cohort of lay people on the commission is a mix and balance of relevant skills, knowledge, expertise and experience across a range of areas which will enhance the judicial selection process by widening the perspectives brought to bear on it.  The purpose of the enhanced lay participation is to complement the key expertise of the Judiciary and of the legal members and not to seek in any way to minimise the role of serving judges.  There is less still any suggestion intended that there is any distrust in the manner in which our senior Judiciary has conducted the recommendation process over many years and I have already outlined the value of the Judiciary in the development and functioning of the State.<br/><br/>Reducing the number of judicial members in order to contain the board or the commission at a reasonable number, which I suggest is certainly no more than the current number, while wishing to broaden the expertise of the commission in the way I have mentioned, simply implies that the judicial member complement must be less than it is at present.  There are five presidents in the courts.  If the board is to have judicial representation as well as allow the members of the Bar Council and the Law Society, the Attorney General and lay members to have a voice, this is inevitable.  However, the scheme provides that two of the most senior judges will be members of the commission while another court president will participate <i>ex officio. </i>I believe that this constitutes substantial and senior input on the part of the Judiciary and therefore the construction of the commission is not inconsistent with certain guidelines including the recommendation of the Committee of Ministers of the Council of Europe.  I note that the European Network of Councils for the Judiciary stated clearly in its Dublin declaration, which is often quoted, that &quot;[t]he judiciary must not necessarily have an absolute majority membership on such a selection and appointment body&quot;.<br/><br/>Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s Bill opts for a list of nominating bodies to provide lay persons.  I consider there to be difficulties with such an approach because there are potentially dozens of bodies.  This is a point for discussion between us.  One could contemplate consulting to nominate a lay person, but in my scheme I have suggested taking a somewhat more generic approach that the Public Appointments Commission can reference in its recruitment of commission members.  It is not easy to get this completely right and I am open to discussion on the best way to select lay members.  I have opted for a particular model that outlines the type of criteria and skills we would like to see in lay members and suggested the Public Appointments Service recruit them.  This will be an extremely important body.  It is important that people are put through a rigorous procedure before being nominated to it as opposed to perhaps a more straightforward nomination from organisations.<br/><br/>In the scheme, I have indicated an approach that provides for a dual list of skills for the selection of lay members.  I have received criticism that this may not be the best way to go and am open to examining it with a view to its simplification.  It may be too complex the way I have outlined it.  We have received feedback from some selection bodies to the effect that it may be too complicated a way to do it.  However, I think everyone accepts that we need to define a reasonably wide set of expertise and experience that we want among the lay candidates and some means of ensuring that the five lay people who are delivered onto the commission have amongst them the widest possible representation of skills across the areas we consider important.  <br/><br/>Lay chairing of selection commissions in other jurisdictions is not uncommon.  The corresponding commissions in England and Wales and in Scotland have a lay chairperson.  Again I accept that not everyone will agree with this measure.  The Private Member's Bill retains the <i>status quo</i>with the commission to be chaired by the Chief Justice.  That is an option, but I suggest that the chairperson be the most highly qualified lay person meeting the special criteria set down and selected after a rigorous process conducted by the Public Appointments Service.  I also believe that it is better that the Legislature would have a role here too.  It has been suggested that this is politicising the process.  I do not believe it is.  After all, the D&aacute;il is where there is democratic accountability.  It is appropriate that a proposed appointee satisfies the Oireachtas before confirmation and that the approval of the appointments by resolutions of the Houses will double-lock the ministerial appointment provision.  I consider this a part of democratic accountability and do not believe it in any way crosses the boundaries in respect of the independence of the Judiciary.  This is arguably more open than the current system.  However, it is no reflection on the special qualities and insight of a Chief Justice and the commission will continue to benefit from that unique expertise and insight. <br/><br/>Head 32 provides for a new committee that will only deal with the posts of Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal and President of the High Court.  The commission is involved in the referral of names to this committee, but it is the committee that will recommend names to the Government.  I am suggesting this separate treatment of the highest level appointments.  I consider it is warranted.  However, in the drafting of the measure, I wish to signal now that some reconfiguration of the composition of this committee is under consideration.  Having examined the matter, I believe the Minister should not have a recommending role and should not, as a member of the Executive, be on the committee.<br/><br/>I am sure Deputies will want to discuss how the committee would be ideally configured during the passage of the Bill.  Other than the three senior posts, I would envisage a vacancy in the post of either President of the Circuit Court or President of the District Court being filled under the standard procedure.  I prefer this more qualified approach to the one proposed in Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan&rsquo;s Bill which envisages arrangements for the filling of all five leading judicial roles that would appear to be confined only to judges of the particular courts.<br/><br/>I do not think that the Private Members' Bill makes sufficient provision to support the work of the new commission although I am sure we can discuss this further.  I am talking about having a dedicated resource unit under the direction of an accountable director who would have staff and am suggesting a sum of &euro;500,000 for this purpose.  I consider this to be an important statement of intent to underline the work I anticipate the commission will undertake.<br/><br/>The Deputy has provided for the involvement of the commission in the process of nominations of judges for the main EU courts and the European Court of Human Rights.  This can be discussed.  I consider the current arrangements to have worked well.  We have some excellent representatives in the courts.  It is important to remember that, when it comes to European court nominations, what is done here in Ireland is just one tier.  There is a further tier of examination of every nominee to a European court.<br/><br/>Where the drafting work on the Bill, which has been ongoing, has revealed a need to clarify, reconfigure and adapt somewhat some of the provisions in the general scheme, this is normal and is done in consultation with my officials.  Let me state, however, that none of the core elements which I have already covered this morning have been varied in principle in the Bill as drafted from the Heads that we are considering now.  Elements such as the exact format of the new selection procedures and competency frameworks, transitional measures, which will have to be discussed, to allow the commission to immediately get to work and the extent of legislative repeals or restatement that may be required are undergoing some reshaping in the draft and the definitive position will be available when the Bill is published.<br/><br/>I would also like to link the reforms we are discussing today, which I believe are necessary and far-reaching, with a related suite of reforms set out in the Judicial Council Bill which will promote excellence in the exercise of judicial functions and high standards of judicial conduct and related matters.  I have stated it already but will repeat that these reforms are absolutely fundamental.</p><p>We have seen how judiciaries in other countries, dictatorships, have been compromised.  As I said, we have a system that I believe we can be proud of but which everybody agrees, including all of those who made submissions, needs to be further reformed.  Reform is fundamental to the working of a democratic state.  We are all aware of the many challenges that we face in our democracy and internationally.  This is about ensuring that we have a system that is fit for purpose and suitable for the needs and challenges of a demanding 21st century environment. </p><p> I thank the committee for the opportunity to outline the approach in some detail, which I hope will be of assistance to it in compiling its report on the scheme and the Bill.  I thank Deputy O'Callaghan for bringing forward his Private Members' Bill which I know was the subject of extensive research, expertise and hard work.  I am interested in hearing the committee's views on this important topic, where we need to move to and how we can bring forward the necessary reforms.  As I stated, there are a number of areas on which there is agreement but there are others in respect of which there are substantive differences and we need to tease these out.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.611" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1296" speakername="Jim O'Callaghan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017012500002#E00300"><p>I want to address the committee on four areas.  My opening statement will not be as lengthy as that made by the T&aacute;naiste but I do want to give the committee an overview of the four areas I would like to speak to it about, following which I will be happy to take questions.</p><p>First, I will speak about how the system currently operates; second, why the system needs to be changed; third, my Bill; and, fourth, the Government's scheme of its Bill.  Before I commence my remarks on the four issues to be discussed, I would like to put on record my disappointment that the committee does not have the Government Bill before it.  If we are to engage in full pre-legislative scrutiny of the Bill, it would be much more helpful if we had a copy of the Bill as drafted as opposed to the scheme of the Bill.  I remind members that my Bill has passed Second Stage in the D&aacute;il.  As such, I do not propose to spend an inordinate amount of time repeating here what I said in the D&aacute;il.</p><p>How we, as an Oireachtas, determine how judges should be selected is an extremely important matter.  Under the Constitution, the Government nominates judges and they are then appointed by the President.  However, we should not lose sight of the fact that under our Constitution justice is administered by judges.  Justice is of major importance to the public.  We hear that every day.  As politicians we hear it too.  We often hear people say that they were deprived of justice, that they want access to justice or that they believe they have not been treated fairly by the State.  We need to bear in mind all the time that judges play a central and fundamental role in determining and delivering justice for Irish citizens.  The position of a judge is no ordinary  job; it is vitally important and we need to do our best to ensure that the best people are appointed to the position.</p><p>In regard to how the system currently operates, I am conscious that as a lawyer I will have a greater knowledge than other committee members of how the system operates.  At present, when a vacancy arises in a court, the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board places an advertisement in a newspaper or online inviting applications for appointment as a judge to the District Court, Circuit Court, High Court, Court of Appeal or Supreme Court.  The board will then receive a series of applications from lawyers because only lawyers can apply to be judges.  The job of the board is to process those applications.  In many instances, particularly in respect of the District Court, hundreds of applications will have to be processed.  The job of the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is to determine who is suitable for the position.  It is not the function of the board to try to identify the best candidate.  It is a filtering process in the determination of suitable candidates.  The Judicial Appointments Advisory Board is required under legislation to provide the Government with the names of seven individuals which it believes are suitable for appointment to a particular vacancy.  Sometimes more than seven names are provided.  Obviously, if there are multiple vacancies there will be many names put forward by the board to the Government.  </p><p>When the Government receives the list of names, it then makes its decision as to who should be selected.  Under the Constitution, and the T&aacute;naiste's proposed scheme and my Bill, the Government can choose whoever it wants.  It does not have to select a name from those provided by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  I believe it is appropriate that the recommending body should carry greater authority and that it should filter down its nominees such that the Government is aware of who it believes are the best persons for the position.  If the Government chooses to appoint a person not recommended by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, it must state in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>that, for example, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in has been appointed as a judge of the Supreme Court but his name was not put forward to it by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board.  That is the only downside if that arises.  Usually if, say, Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in was nominated and appointed, it will state in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>that he came through the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board system.  The Government then nominates an individual and he or she is appointed by the President.  </p><p>The second issue is why the system needs to be changed, in other words, what is the weakness in the system.  The weakness in the system is that when a large list of names is presented to Cabinet most of them, in fairness to them, do not know how to go about choosing one person from a list of 24 for a District Court position.  There is no reason that politicians should be aware of who is the most suitable or best candidate.  People who are interested in reading State papers will know that over Christmas and the New Year the State papers from 30 years ago which were published included a record of Alan Dukes, when Minister for justice, stating that he did not know who was the best candidate or who should be selected to be a judge.  He said that he felt it was a matter primarily for the Attorney General.  In fairness to members of Cabinet, most of them do not know who are the most suitable candidates.  It is unfair to put that pressure on the Government.  If RTE was appointing a new director general, it would follow the process of setting out the selection criteria and a selection body would then identify an individual who would be recommended to Cabinet.  The Cabinet could disagree with it but, in general, it would accept that recommendation.</p><p>It is true - it is important we live in the real world - that people who have political connections are at an advantage if their names are on the list which goes to Cabinet.  It is often said that canvassing should be prohibited.  I have never been in Cabinet but I suspect much canvassing goes on for the purposes of appointment of people to the Bench.  I suspect there are people who have been appointed because of political connections.  Many people who are appointed because of political connections turn out to be excellent judges.  I have no objection to that.  We should not have a system whereby because a person is involved in politics, he or she should be excluded from subsequent nomination to judicial office.  What we do not know, and I am sure this happens, is if there are good people who applied to be judges and because they did know anybody in Cabinet or any Deputy, were overlooked and never got the opportunity of being promoted to the position of judge.  For all of these reasons, the system needs to be changed.</p><p>We need a recommending body that can identify who it believes will be the best person for the position of judge.  We should have a recommending body that ranks individuals in terms of their suitability for the job.  Under the Constitution, which is appropriate, the Government has the final say.  Regardless of what system is in place or how it operates, the Government can disregard the list of candidates provided by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board and appoint a candidate of its choosing.  That is the scheme that currently operates under the Constitution.</p><p>However, it needs to be changed and broadened to ensure that it is fairer and the best people - there may be people whom we do not know and who do not have connections - have an opportunity to be considered and appointed.</p><p> That brings me to my legislation, which was debated in the D&aacute;il on Second Stage.  I will not bore the committee by taking it through the Bill section by section, but I will make a number of points on it.  My Bill establishes a judicial appointments commission to recommend to the Government the names of individuals who it believes would be the most suitable, based on merit, to be judges.  For each position, it will recommend three people.  The T&aacute;naiste's scheme has the same provision.  Under my scheme, however, the three will be ranked as Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  In no way does that offend the constitutional prerogative that rests with the Cabinet.  Under neither scheme must the Cabinet opt for anyone on the list.  However, there is a benefit in the Cabinet being told by a body that has expertise that it believes that these are the three best people in a certain order.</p><p> Another way that my scheme is relevant concerns the membership of the commission.  Like everything in Ireland, memberships of commissions seem to get a great deal of political interest and media comment for some reason.  What is the best body of people who would be qualified to recommend those - if we are to be frank about this, it is only lawyers who can be judges - barristers and solicitors whom they believe would make the best judges?  The people who know are judges themselves and others who have experience.  Under my scheme, there are 12 members on the commission.  These include the Chief Justice, who is President of the Supreme Court, and the presidents of the Court of Appeal, the High Court, the Circuit Court and the District Court.  They would be "judicial members".</p><p> Interestingly, the T&aacute;naiste has adopted hook, line and sinker the language put into her mind by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Ross, which is all about lay people and non-lay people.  It is offensive to judges that non-lay people, under the Government's scheme, are described as being judges and lawyers.  Judges are not practising lawyers.  They were lawyers formerly.  It is wrong and misleading of the Minister, Deputy Ross, to give the impression that judges and lawyers should be regarded as belonging to the same group.  We should get away from that impression.  We are discussing judges, so we should refer to judicial members and non-judicial members.</p><p> Under my scheme of 12 members, there will be five judicial members and seven non-judicial members.  As to those seven, there will be representatives from the Bar Council, the Law Society, the Citizens Information Board, which has direct contact with the citizens of this country and knows their needs, an t&Uacute;daras um Ard-Oideachas, the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission, the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission and the Free Legal Advice Centres, a body that provides exceptional advice to people in Ireland who are of limited means.  This is the membership of my commission.  I picked it not because I am a lawyer and want to have my mates on it or it is a cabal, as the Minister would present it.  I picked it because these members are persons who have the best interests of the Irish people at heart when it comes to identifying individuals who would make good judges.  It is farcical of the Government to suggest that judges, such as presidents of the courts, will want to select for recommendation people who are their friends.  Let there be no doubt about it - that is the current in this provision.  It is not even an undercurrent.  It is a wave that is being presented by the Government to the effect that these people cannot be trusted because they will just want to pick all of their mates for positions.</p><p> I view these individuals as I would a school principal.  If the Chairman was a principal and was asked to select a new teacher, he would want to ensure that the teacher was fair and a hard worker.  Similarly, the same would apply to the presidents of the courts while on this recommending body.  They will want to ensure that the people who are chosen are effective and useful.</p><p> I will examine the question of the other nominating bodies in more detail when we compare that suggestion to the system that the T&aacute;naiste has proposed.  Under her system, the Public Appointments Service would select the six lay members on the Government's proposed 11-member commission.  That will give rise to difficulty, but I will reserve comment until I reach the T&aacute;naiste's Bill.</p><p> A further issue of some conflict concerns the chairmanship of the commission.  In many respects, this is not a major issue.  Under the Government's scheme, the Chief Justice will be a member.  I will give the T&aacute;naiste time to answer my next question.  Can she name any committee on which the Taoiseach sits of which he is not chairman?  She can revert to me in due course.  I suspect that she will not be able to identify one because any individual putting together a committee that included the Taoiseach would know that putting him on it without having him chair it would be disrespectful, not to Deputy Enda Kenny, but to the office of Taoiseach.  Similarly, requiring the Chief Justice to be on a committee in respect of judicial appointments when she is not the chairperson is disrespectful to the office of Chief Justice.  I regret to say it, but this is consistent with the Government's attitude of disrespect towards the Judiciary.  There is no policy reason for the Chief Justice not to chair this body.  Undoubtedly, the T&aacute;naiste will tell me that it is a commitment in the programme for Government, which means that this was agreed with the Minister, Deputy Ross.  We all know that Fine Gael agreed to this at a time when it would have agreed to draining the Shannon to get into power.</p><p> I will address a further important part of my Bill that differs from the T&aacute;naiste's.  In mine, I set out specific criteria if people are to be appointed as judges.  It is important that the public be apprised of what qualities one needs to be appointed.  This provision is not found in the T&aacute;naiste's scheme, but it can be in my section 15.  It is important that we set out in our legislation matters that may seem obvious.  One needs integrity, independence of mind, moral courage, a high level of intellectual skill, sound temperament, common sense, impartiality, objectivity, fairness, equanimity and composure.  I have set these out.  The greatest judge in the world will not have all of them, but they are what we should aspire to seeing in those whom we appoint to the Judiciary.  It is useful for the public to know what is required.</p><p> An undertaking is given in both Bills to engage in training.  However, the T&aacute;naiste's scheme has no mandatory requirement for there to be interviews.  Under my scheme, persons who are to be recommended must be interviewed by members of the commission.</p><p> The main substantive difference between the two proposals is that nothing really changes under the Government's.  The new recommending body will nominate three people, whose names will go to the Cabinet.  The Cabinet will then operate in the same way that it does now.  It must consider the three names.  If it does not like them, it can say that the person it selects was not recommended by the commission.  Under my scheme, there is a greater hurdle for the Government to overcome.  The Government gets the names of Nos. 1, 2 and 3.  If it does not select or recommend for appointment any one of those three, it must give a reasoned decision for that.</p><p>That is worthwhile and it brings greater transparency to this whole process.  One area where I agree, and where I have changed my mind since the Second Stage of my Bill, is on the Minister's proposal that District Court judges should be eligible for appointment to the High Court.  Having looked at it, that is fair.  If one is a lawyer of 20 years standing, one can be made a District Court judge, but if one becomes a District Court judge after one's 20 years of standing one becomes ineligible for appointment to the High Court.  It would be unfair for that situation to apply.  Under my scheme, we will increase the number of years that people have to have been practising before they become judges.  They should have 15 years in practice before they can be appointed to the superior courts.  That is the proposal I have in respect of the scheme.  I do not think it is perfect.  It is a proposal I have put forward and I am happy to accept changes to it.  I welcome the fact Deputy Daly was the only person who proposed amendments to the Bill when we came so close to our committee hearing many months ago.  When we get to it in the future, I will consider any other amendments.<br/><br/>That brings me on to the final part of my submission, and I am sorry for taking up the time of the committee but I will finish after this.  It is in respect of the scheme put forward by the Government.  I will make some points on it, and I have made some of them already.  In head 2 there is a categorisation of laypersons, which merges people who hold judicial office and people who were or are practising lawyers.  It is inappropriate to merge them together.  It is simply playing to agenda of the Minister, Deputy Ross.  Why is it that under the Government's scheme former judges are precluded from being on this recommending body?  If one is trying to identify somebody who would have a good idea of what it takes to be a judge, one would have thought a former judge would be suitable to fulfil that role.  Under the Minister's scheme it is not permitted.<br/><br/>I want to jump forward to head 7 of the scheme, which is the membership of the judicial appointments commission.  Another difference between the Minister's scheme and my scheme is that I want to have the recommending body completely separated from the political process, so that there would not be people who were part of the political process on the recommending body.  For that reason I thought it was inappropriate to have the Attorney General on the recommending body.  Under the Government scheme the Attorney General is on the recommending body.  Names will come into the judicial appointments commission, the Attorney General will be part of that commission when the names are being considered and those three names will then be put forward to Cabinet where the Attorney General will also sit.  That does not achieve the objective of separating the political process from the initial recommending process.  The political process is ultimately going to decide who is appointed.  The recommending process should be protected.  There is replication and infiltration between the two bodies if the Attorney General is on both.<br/><br/>Under the Minister's scheme there are to be 11 persons on the commission.  Only two of them are to be judges.  It is wholly inappropriate that only two out of 11 are judges.  The Chief Justice is on it, as one of the ordinary members of the commission, and then there is either the President of the Court of Appeal or the President of the High Court.  It may be the case that the President of the Court of Appeal and the President of the High Court preside over courts which deal with more serious issues,  but most judges are appointed to the District Court.  The District Court is the court that has the most direct involvement with members of the public and the Circuit Court is just above that.  It is farcical that a body such as this would not have the President of the District Court and the President of the Circuit Court on it.  These are the men and women who run the courts and who have most interaction with the public.  They know what a good judge is.  All they want is a judge who is going to work hard and be fair.  To deliberately exclude them from this displays a complete lack of awareness of the requirements of a new system.<br/><br/>Under the Minister's scheme, there is the Chief Justice and one other judge, either the President of the Court of Appeal or the President of the High Court, will be on the commission and they will have to fight it out among themselves as to which one of them gets on it.  The Government does not even have the strength to just pick one of them, it leaves it to the judges to decide.<br/><br/>Then we have five lay members, and this is where I have a concern.  It is easy to be criticised as a lawyer for giving out about lay members.  I have no objection to lay members fulfilling the important roles that they do - for instance, in a disciplinary body.  If the legal profession is being regulated and someone is being disciplined it is appropriate and essential that the body that is disciplining that lawyer should have a majority of lay members.  This is because there is a fear that if there were only non-lay members or lawyers that they would be too favourable to the lawyer involved.  That is a perfect occasion when lay members are required.  No explanation has been provided for the lay members here.<br/><br/>Let me just tell the committee exactly what my concern is.  The type of lay people who will apply for a position on this judicial appointments commission will be, to a large extent, people who have their own political agenda.  We will have people who are pro-life and pro-choice applying, because they will want to ensure that judges who are appointed represent their political agenda.  We will have representatives of people who want to be very strong on crime and lock people up and people who want to be very soft on prisoners and open the gates.  We are just giving an opportunity to individuals who have their own political agendas to bring them forward.  <br/><br/>A better way to approach it is to do as I have done and have a body comprising organisations such as Free Legal Advice Centres, FLAC, and the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, two highly respected bodies, and a couple of others, which will identify suitable individuals for recommendation.  Another Minister criticised those bodies but that is the mechanism that is used on the Legal Services Regulatory Authority which the Minister steered very effectively through the D&aacute;il.  If it is good enough for the Legal Services Regulatory Authority why is it not good enough for this?<br/><br/>On these lay members and selection, if we were choosing a cardiologist for St. Vincent's Hospital, I would hate to think that someone like me would be on the panel suggesting who that cardiologist should be.  I have not a clue what is required.  Similarly, if there was a vacancy for the editor of <i>The Irish Times</i>, there would be a need for people on the selection body who are experts in journalism.  On the cardiology interview panel someone who is an expert in cardiology is needed.  These lay people sound great and it fulfils the agenda of the Minister, Deputy Ross, that we are going to have a majority of lay members, but I do not know who they are going to be.  There should be non-judges on it and they should be selected by bodies such as the Irish Human Rights and Equality Commission, FLAC and the Competition and Consumer Protection Commission.  We do not know what we will get or who will get on it when we open this to the Public Appointments Service.<br/><br/>I raise one other issue of concern.  My concern developed yesterday when I read the scheme again and it has increased this morning.  The Minister said that this new commission will have funding in the region of &euro;500,000 a year.  This was supposed to be the Government that would cut quangos.  The last thing we want is to create this new entity, the judicial appointments commission office, which will have a glossy annual report and its own PR firm.  We do not need that.  We need individuals who are committed to public service who are going to sit on it and make their recommendations.  I do not know how many judges are appointed each year but I suspect it is no more than 20.  What is the point in giving &euro;500,000 to a body that is asked to recommend three individuals for each vacancy on the Bench?  It seems that we are once again are creating mini-empires.  What really worried me is that head 8(3) allows the commission to engage consultants and advisers.  <br/><br/>That is replicated in head 19 which discusses the director of the office of the judicial appointments commission and the staff of the commission.  This has been done to date by the Judicial Appointments Advisory Board, which only meets when there are vacancies.  What is this body going to do when there are no judicial vacancies?  We should be wary about setting up another quango.  <br/><br/>Head 22 is very limited in what it sets out.  It simply says in order to be appointed one must be suitable on grounds of character and temperament.  We know what that means in an Irish context.  Provided one is not barking mad one fits within the categorisation.</p><p>I welcome the fact that under head 23, persons who are qualified for appointment to the superior courts will be former judges from the EU and former judges of the European Court of Human Rights.  It is important that this is provided for in the legislation.  This area needed to be looked at.  There was always a precedent and convention that judges who served in those courts would be reappointed on their return.  The previous Government did away with that convention.  <br/><br/>It is interesting to note that head 35 allows the commission to recommend a member of the commission.  That is interesting.  It is permissible provided all members are available for recommendation.  Head 36 is the crux of the Bill.  This very expensive process will be set up and at the end of it, the only sanction on the Government is that if it does not select one of the recommended people, the notice must be published in <i>Iris Oifigi&uacute;il</i>.  That is the sum total of it.  In fairness to the T&aacute;naiste, I do not think she does not agree with it.  I think it has been presented to her by the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport.  It was agreed in the programme for Government and it is being pushed forward because it is in the programme for Government.  I do not think the T&aacute;naiste believes in it and that it will damage the appointment and selection of judges in this country.  We would be better off leaving it as it is.  This is all I have to say.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.616" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1280" speakername="Jonathan O'Brien" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017012500002#H00300"><p>I will be brief.  When Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill was going through Second Stage, we supported it because we believed there needed to be changes to how judges are appointed.  Having said that, we did raise some issues about the Bill during our contribution.  We said that we wanted to see it go to through to Committee Stage where we could address some of those issues.  When we discussed Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill, we did not have the general scheme of the Government's Bill.  We now have that and must take it into consideration as well.  We would be very favourable towards many things within the general scheme - more favourable towards them than towards what is contained in Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  We supported his Bill but we did not have the general scheme then.</p> <p>  Funding was one of the issues touched upon by Deputy O'Callaghan.  It is my understanding that funding will be used in a number of ways.  One of the areas the Government has looked at is that the commission would appoint a committee which would be responsible for codes of practice.  It talks about looking at international best practice, drawing up criteria and those codes of practice and being able to get information and research.  Obviously, there is a cost associated with that.  I cannot put a figure on it but I certainly would not be opposed to some funding going towards research and looking at other jurisdictions to see what best practice is in terms of selecting judges is.  </p> <p>  Another area touched upon by the Government is looking at how we can diversify the people selected as judges.  Page nine of the general scheme talks about how other jurisdictions have developed comprehensive merit criteria to address such issues as ability, communications, work ethic, decision-making capacity and integrity.  It goes on to talk about awareness of the diversity of communities and how the commission will be tasked with developing appropriate codes of practice in respect of this matter.  This is an important element.  It recognises that we are a diverse society that is becoming multicultural.  The selection of judges needs to reflect that so I completely agree with that in terms of guiding principles.  </p> <p>  On the question of whether it should be a lay or non-lay majority or as Deputy O'Callaghan would describe it, a judicial or non-judicial majority, one of the reasons we are having this debate is because there is a perception out there that judges are selected not on merit but because of who they know.  I know Deputy O'Callaghan referenced that in his contribution.  It may be a very unfair perception but it exists and is a reality that we need to deal with.  I do not think Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill would address that perception because what he is proposing is that we would have a judicial majority and would not necessarily have a lay chairperson.  We can go into the ins and outs and rights and wrongs of it but when it comes down to perception, it is important that we would have a lay majority and a lay chairperson for that purpose.  Deputy O'Callaghan spoke about people wanting to see justice being delivered and how it must be seen to be done.  The current situation whereby a judge is appointed is completely unfair.  That judge could be appointed for all the right reasons but if they have political connections, from the moment they are appointed, there is almost a shadow cast on them.  People question whether they were appointed because that they have these political connections.  It is unfair on the individual and unfair on the system so we agree with what the Minister proposes.  </p> <p>  In terms of the selection of the lay personnel on it, we would certainly lean towards the criteria laid out by Deputy O'Callaghan.  I do not see any disadvantage in having nominating bodies which could recommend people for that position.  However, there is a lot of merit in what the Minister is saying, namely, that the Public Appointments Service would select them.  I do not know whether a happy medium between both of them exists.  Could we have a situation whereby bodies could recommend people but, ultimately, it would be the Public Appointments Service that would actually select them?  If we can find that happy medium, we could have the best of both proposals.  </p> <p>  The issue I really want to focus on is the constitutional requirement relating to the Government.  I am not a constitutional lawyer - far from it - but I have spoken to some constitutional lawyers.  There seems to be a difference of opinion on this.  It is my understanding that the only requirement is that the Government would nominate somebody to the post of president and the president either then signs off on that or not.  The T&aacute;naiste might be able to clarify an issue I have relating to the constitutional requirement that it would remain within the power of the Cabinet to make that nomination.  The commission puts forward three names.</p><p>I do not agree with ranking them.  That would be the wrong way to go.  I have no issue with the recommendations coming forward.  They are all coming forward based on merit and on candidates' expertise, experience, integrity and the other criteria that will be laid out.  In terms of satisfying the constitutional requirement, not having them ranked would be more desirable.  It is my understanding that once the three names are put forward to the Government, that satisfies the constitutional requirement and the Government can then select one person for nomination.  <br/><br/>The debate must focus on one of the difficulties I have with both the Bill and the general scheme.  As I understand it, although I am not 100% sure with regard to Deputy Jim O'Callaghan's Bill, both provide that the Government does not have to select any of the candidates who have been proposed, which defeats the whole purpose of the commission.  The commission is being established to determine suitability <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the criteria laid out and to recommend people for selection as judges.  The constitutional requirement is actually met when the commission puts forward the names of suitable candidates and there should be an obligation on the Government to select one of the recommended individuals.  I do not know how that goes against the constitutional requirement because it is my understanding that the Constitution holds that the Government has the right to select someone for nomination.  Once the names go forward, the Government should be obliged to select one.  I ask for clarification on that point.<br/><br/>If we had to vote tomorrow for the general scheme from the Government or the Bill, we would probably come down on the side of the general scheme.  The provisions of the general scheme make the process more open and transparent and would address some of the concerns around judicial appointments.  Sinn F&eacute;in fully agrees that the commission should have a lay majority and chairperson.  We also fully support the appointment of such lay persons by the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  As I said, we are not opposed to the funding idea either.  There is merit in both the general scheme and the Bill but if we are to address the commonly held perception that judges are not selected on merit and if we want to put in place a new system for selecting judges, then we would be more favourably disposed to what is being proposed by the Government in the general scheme.</p></speech>

Deputy Clare Daly is next, followed by Deputy Alan Farrell.  On returning to both the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy Jim O'Callaghan, there will obviously be the temptation, on the part of the T&aacute;naiste, to focus on Deputy O'Callaghan's presentation and <i>vice versa</i>.  In that context, could we take the questions from the three Deputies together and then open up into a more substantive response from both the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy O'Callaghan?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>I ask the T&aacute;naiste and Deputy O'Callaghan to note the critical points already made by Deputy O'Brien and those to be made by Deputy Clare Daly and Deputy Alan Farrell and then to respond to them collectively, as well as to each other, as they deem appropriate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.619" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1259" speakername="Clare Daly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017012500002#J00300"><p>We are all very new to this process.  It is a different scenario for everyone here.</p> <p>  I do not want to repeat points that have already been made but we had tabled a number of amendments to Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  Indeed, we had amended our own amendments before we got to the committee and events developed.  In advance of today's meeting, we prepared a detailed critique of the Minister's heads of Bill but it is possibly too detailed in the context of where we are at now.  Therefore, I will give my initial reaction to some of the broader points raised.  I will probably forget lots but perhaps we will be able to go into more detail later.</p> <p>  First, on the membership of the commission, specifically the lay chairperson and lay majority, this is something that we wanted at the time of the publication of Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill.  We are happy to see that included in the Government's general scheme.  It is important to say that this is not about "one in the eye" of the Judiciary or the legal profession.  It is about a particular view of the Judiciary.  People with a legal background, very understandably, see appointment to the Bench as a career progression and as something that should be controlled by experts.  However, for ordinary people, the appointment of judges is a social matter.  They see judges as people who work for society, not for the legal profession, and therefore it makes sense for judges to be appointed by members of the society they serve and for them to be allied to the needs of society.  It is a difference of view and balance is achieved by equal representation on the appointments commission.  The best way forward is to give both sides their due, so to speak.  While it is unusual to have an even mix of lay people and legal experts on an appointments commission, it is interesting to note that when Scotland reviewed its procedures before introducing primary legislation, one of the points made was that a particular strength of the system was its even mix.  </p> <p>  One of the problems I have is the inclusion of the Attorney General on the commission.  I do not see any point in that at all.  The Attorney General is a political appointee and at least in the early life of the commission, two of the judicial members will have been appointed under a political patronage system.  While I am not in any way casting aspersions on their integrity or their fitness for office, nonetheless they came into their positions in that way.  I do not see the purpose of including the Attorney General on the commission.  I do not see what insights or skills he or she might add and perhaps an additional member of the Judiciary would be a better option.</p> <p>  There are points to be made about the legal members being nominated by the Bar Council and the Law Society.  We would certainly have questions about that.  Obviously, it is no secret that issues have arisen regarding senior members of the Law Society.  There have been many cases of litigation and High Court proceedings in this regard.  Similarly, questions about procedures at the Bar Council have been raised with regard, for example, to its nominee to the Legal Services Regulatory Authority.  The Bill provides that judges should be appointed on merit.  We absolutely agree that the idea of merit should extend to the appointment of lay members of the commission but why would it not also extend to the appointment of the legal members?  The latter should not be appointed just because they are in with the "in crowd" at the Law Society or the Bar Council or because it is their chance or turn.  I do not like that.  We would prefer to see a system involving an open, public competition, with some minimum qualification requirements, like years in practice or some such.  That could possibly be run by the Public Appointments Service, PAS, as per the lay members.  Alternatively, as has been suggested by others, the Bar Council's nominee could be elected by the entire membership of the council, as in the recent selection process for the practising barrister panel of King's Inn.  A similar process could be engaged in by the Law Society.  </p> <p>  We are of the view that the legislation should stipulate that the lay membership should exclude anybody who has practised as a solicitor or barrister, either over a period of time, for example, two to five years or forever.  That is something worth considering.  The expertise of lay people and that being quantified in some way is necessary.  I note that in the Minister's heads of Bill, we have a list A and list B of expertise criteria.  Our reading of it is that list A is fine but list B is very restrictive and would limit the types of people who would be able to come forward.  We believe it is important for a wide range of professions or disciplines to be allowed to be considered for the commission.  Under list B as it stands, the only people who could qualify would be senior civil servants, solicitors and barristers.</p><p>We definitely need to expand that category.  The explanatory memorandum provided notes about the types of lay expertise but we are keen to add to the A list people who have a background, for example, in sentencing, penal reform, perhaps addiction and working in the area of drugs.  Such experience would be important.</p><p> Deputy O&rsquo;Callaghan made some good points about how the lay people might bring their political views to the table, for example, pro-life, anti-abortion, pro-choice or whatever else.  That is equally the case with anybody in society.  A legal person could similarly want to be involved in the commission for precisely the same reasons.  We must test the expertise of all.  We are talking about merit and that must apply to all members of the commission.</p><p> We proposed an amendment to Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill about the making of appointments to the commission in terms of meeting the gender balance.  That is a difficult issue because in the initial stages in particular one must recognise that currently there are huge gender imbalances in the legal and judicial profession and forcing a 50:50 split now would not give the best expertise because of this.  We must strike a balance between trying to achieve a gender balance, which will probably only come in time rather than insisting on it as an absolute.  How we formulate that will be important.</p><p> Reference has been made about the diversity clause, which we believe should apply to the legal and judicial members as well.  I do not wish to spend a huge amount of time on the issue but in terms of head 10, for example, the code of practice function, we think it is very novel.  We had not suggested it and Deputy O'Callaghan had not either.  The basic idea is that the commission would create a code of practice based on its own research and the code of practice would be used, among other things, to draw up a list of selection criteria to which the commission would have regard in the appointment of judges.  There are some very good ideas in the Bill but we have concerns about it at the moment in terms of how it is phrased in the heads, for example, why a subcommittee of the commission is necessary to carry out the code of practice function rather than everybody on the commission doing it.  It is worth pointing out as well that it would not be possible to constitute a committee of seven members in proportion to the membership of the commission as given the way the numbers break down it is not mathematically possible for one to have people so one would not get the balance based on the proposed approach.</p><p> While giving the commission an important role in monitoring and implementing international best practice on the appointment of judges to inform the selection process is no bad thing there could be a certain long-fingering involved.  I tend to agree more with Deputy O'Callaghan in terms of the points on head 22, his section 15.  By contrast, we would be leaning more in favour of his section 15 rather than the Minister's head 22, which is about the list of requirements in relation to the appointment of judges.  The Minister's list is extremely thin and Deputy O'Callaghan's has much greater weight and is far better in that regard.  We would tend to err in that direction, without repeating any points.</p><p> On head 32, Deputy O'Callaghan's section 23 on senior appointments is better as well.  It is more sensible than the Minister's suggestion, which relates to the appointment of the Chief Justice, President of the Court of Appeal and the President of the High Court.  Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill empowers the commission to make a recommendation to Government for such senior appointments based on merit, a similar principle to all other judicial appointments.</p><p> As Deputy O'Brien said, we need to hear more about the constitutional issues.  I agree with Deputy O'Callaghan about ranking.  The candidates should be ranked.  It will be up to the Government to pick one but given that the commission will be appointed to give its view on who the best person is for the job then the candidates should be ranked.  The power is vested in the Government because we are told it is required constitutionally and that the Government cannot be constrained in the manner in which is suggested throughout.  I question some of what has been said and I would like to hear more in that regard.</p><p> We have a number of detailed points on the various heads but they are probably too detailed for the present discussion.  They probably touch off the broad points to which we would refer in this regard.  We are open in our approach.  I agree with what Deputy O'Brien said about whether there should be nominating groups for lay people or a role for the Public Appointments Service or if we should have some middle ground in that regard.  It would be important to get agreement but we are very happy with the overall balance and having a lay chair.  We think that things could be progressed.</p><p> The Minister referred to the judicial council Bill and that element of the work.  It is at least as important if not more important for us to address those issues.  There was some talk that the Bill would be fast-tracked and done in tandem with this Bill.  That is necessary.  Part of the project is to engender confidence in the judicial process.  Not only have serious issues been highlighted about judicial indiscretion or the irrationality of judges in relation to cases involving me or others but it is almost a daily occurrence that members of the public find things difficult, in particular at District Court level, and do not have a mechanism to call into question poor practice by the Judiciary.  It is about justice being seen to be done.  Only last week Deputy Wallace and I met a serving member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na who told us that in a family law case a judge had intervened with his partner's family and discussed the case with a family friend outside the norms of the court and gave the person a protection order against the individual.  It was a complete perversion of the course of justice that a judge would informally deal with a family law case in such a way and give an order.  That judge is still serving.  There are many such issues and there is an urgent requirement to address them.</p></speech>

I will be very brief.  I just wish to cover a couple of concerns I have, some of which I share with colleagues across all parties and they also touch on some of the observations made by the Minister.</p> <p>  I have a fundamental problem with the idea of a lay majority for a multitude of reasons.  On the concept of a level of probity being present within the commission and-or the motivation for the Bills in the first instance, notwithstanding Deputy O'Callaghan's closing remark in questioning the need for either, I have a slight difficulty with the idea of a lay majority on the commission on the basis of qualifying criteria because, to oppose the view expressed by Deputy Daly, in my view the criteria in lists A and B are not restrictive enough.  Anybody can be appointed to such a commission but he or she must have a basis for being appointed.  One cannot randomly pluck a citizen from the street no more than one would from within the legal profession itself.  One would not choose somebody who is unsuited to such a position, one would do one's best to find somebody who is reasonable but qualified.</p><p>I suspect that in certain cases, especially in regard to list B, the qualifying criteria need to be bolstered rather than reduced, as Deputy Daly suggested.</p><p> I also support the idea of promotion through the commission.  I would leave it to constitutional experts to determine the ranking but, as somebody who served as an interviewer on a number of panels over a number of years I can say that panels always rank candidates.  What is the point of doing an interview with a view to making a recommendation to employ somebody without ranking them?  If the Department took the view that security checking or clearance for an individual outside the remit of the commission or any other person would make it difficult, I would accept that point but that point has not been made.  In the case of both Bills a happy medium should be found.  </p><p> I do not wish to make light of Deputy O'Brien's remark on perception versus reality but every time I hear perception being referenced as a basis on which to make fundamental change I recall comedian Dara &Oacute; Briain talking about the perception of crime in relation to statistics which prove the opposite.  I have a difficulty with lay persons determining that there was an undue influence in the political process in the appointment of the Judiciary.  I welcome the prohibition of canvassing, which is well overdue.  It is bizarre that canvassing can still take place either by candidates themselves, which I cannot prove but I am sure has happened over the decades, or others.  I would certainly welcome that change.</p><p> We have spent a large amount of time going over the requirement for the Government Bill and it has caused a large amount of distraction in the operation of Government.  There has been a perception that it has interfered with the workings of Cabinet, which is quite distressing and disappointing.  I am disappointed that this Bill came to us in the manner in which it did and that is no disrespect to Deputy O'Callaghan, who may well have come to the D&aacute;il recently with his intention to put it forward.  If he had not, I might have perceived it to be a reaction to the position Deputy Ross took prior to entering Government.</p><p> Certain changes can be made to the judicial appointments process to make it more robust, transparent and immune to influence by putting in qualifiers.  I do not have a difficulty with the commission being created but I do have a difficulty with the lay majority, for reasons I have outlined.  I also have a difficulty with the qualifying criteria.  If it is feasible, I would like the committee to be presented with a viewpoint on the constitutional elements that have been questioned, in particular with regard to the ranking mentioned in the opening statement of the Minister.  If the Department cannot give its viewpoint on these, perhaps the committee can go off and seek a view itself.  It does not necessarily sit well with normal procedures for vetting and the interview process.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.624" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1214" speakername="Frances Fitzgerald" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/JUJ2017012500002#L00300"><p>I thank all Deputies for their contributions and some interesting relevant points have been made.  I begin by absolutely rejecting the characterisation by Deputy O'Callaghan of the approach I have taken as being disrespectful of the Judiciary.  Nothing could be further from the truth.  I have huge respect for the Judiciary in this country and if he had listened to my opening remarks this would have been very clear.  It is important we discuss all the issues and look in a balanced way at the pros and cons of the different approaches which I and the committee have taken.  Using words like "farcical", "offensive" and "disrespectful" really are not appropriate.  What we are discussing today is part of an international debate about the role of judiciary in society, not the question of its independence but how judicial selection should take place.  A huge amount of work has been done and there has been huge change around the world, including in common law countries, on this issue.  As I spent some time explaining in my presentation, I have tried to illustrate the challenges and complexities of this as well as the democratic demands.  These are legitimate areas for discussion and are in no way disrespectful.  It is very important that we do it here in committee and it is essential we get the views of members in moving toward an independent, accountable and diverse Judiciary.  There are different ways of doing it and I do not believe there is a right and a wrong way.  There are choices to be made and the committee is examining the range of those choices today.</p> <p>  The constitutional issue has been raised by a number of members and is central.  I have very clear advice on this, both in respect of merit and whether the Government can be confined to the lists that are presented to it.  Neither I as Minister for Justice nor the previous Minister in the previous Government ever went outside the lists that have been presented to us by JAAB.  Whether or not the Government should be allowed to go outside and whether it is a constitutional question are also something on which I have got advice.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Brien raised a series of questions about the Constitution and this is very important.  As Deputy Farrell said, the committee may well want to get its own advice in this matter.  The Constitution has been central to the approach I have taken, which I will explain.  Government retains, at all times, the executive discretion under Article 35 of the Constitution which supersedes any fetter imposed in legislation and could not be limited by legislation which otherwise could be contrary to Article 35.  It would also breach the separation of powers in the Oireachtas in enacting such fettering legislation on the Government's executive function and the function of the President under Articles 35 and 13 of the Constitution.  Provided that the executive function of the Government to advise the President of an appointment is respected and there is a choice for the Government in nominating persons as judges to the President, that is the situation.  It is open to the Government to decide to follow the order of merit in nominating the first candidate out of the names put forward but it could also nominate any other names.</p><p>In order to fulfil the constitutional requirement, the Government must have discretion.  By convention and practice, the Government usually follows the recommendation of the commission.  However, it could not be expressly required to do so in legislation, as that would be to limit or fetter the constitutionally recognised executive function of the Government to nominate judges for appointment under Article 35.  The point here is to avoid placing a limitation on the Government's executive obligations.  I have clear advice on the discretion that the Government must maintain.  Even if there were no order of merit, limiting the Government to those people on the list would equally be unacceptable constitutionally.  By the convention and practice of this Government and the previous one, the Cabinet has never gone outside the JAAB procedure and list.  I imagine we will continue discussing this issue, but I wanted to be clear on the advice that has framed my approach.<br/><br/>The role of the Judiciary and whether there should be a lay or judicial majority are central questions to the discussion on Deputy O'Callaghan's Bill and the Government's approach.  I will cite a number of attitudes and approaches to the matter that may inform the debate.  Deputy Daly raised important questions about the role of the lay person versus or in conjunction with that of the Judiciary.  In an article, Professor Alan Paterson quoted Sir Tom Legg, who said: &quot;Who our judges are, and how they are selected, is a public matter and fully justifies public interest and debate.&quot;  This is a basic point.  Professor Paterson wrote:</p><blockquote>As such, any desire to ensure that judicial appointments are 'wholly independent of external influence' is flawed: there is an important constitutional need to link in some way the (increased) power of the judiciary to those on whose behalf it is held.</blockquote><p>That is a good way of describing what is central to the debate.  Professor Paterson also wrote: &quot;The democratic legitimacy of a branch of government is also directly linked to the extent to which it represents the society it serves.&quot;  These are approaches to having lay people on the board, even as a majority.<br/><br/>There is an interesting point about diversity, fairness and the various ways in which these have been viewed down the years and it is important to put the proposed approach in context.  Historically and for a variety of reasons, it was men who were primarily selected to be members of the Judiciary.  We now have a greater gender balance than ever before, so that diversity is being reflected, even if the height reached in some courts is just 30% female.  Baroness Brenda Hale, a Supreme Court Justice in the UK, stated:</p><blockquote>A woman litigant should be able to go into court and see more than one person who shares at least some of her experience.  I should not stick out like a bad tooth, as I do at present.</blockquote><p>Interestingly, she was the only female member of the UK's Supreme Court at the time.<br/><br/>On the questions of diversity and who is suitable, we have historically discussed merit and how it is defined.  Merit is often in the eye of the beholder.  This is a good reason to consider involving lay people.  At one time in the UK, merit included coming from the same party as the Lord Chancellor.  At a later point, it was deemed to be a good thing to have had previous political experience before appointment as a judge in the House of Lords.  More recently, it has been and, in large part, still is &quot;regarded as coterminus with having been a junior and a QC at the bar for 30 years&quot;.  This is not meant to show any disrespect, only to make the point about our assumptions concerning qualifications and merit.  We are at a point when this is worthy of discussion.<br/><br/>It is not insulting to the Judiciary to have a discussion about a lay majority.  It is not intended as any sort of disrespect.  In terms of democratic accountability in terms of the board's composition, these are the types of point that we need to open our minds to as opposed to resisting change and saying that the situation should stay the same and there should be a judicial majority.<br/><br/>My understanding is that there has rarely been a vote on this question.  I imagine that this will be about putting the processes in place.  Deputy Daly made a point about the committee and the work that we are suggesting a sub-committee should do.  It is a matter of practicality that this matter move in that direction.<br/><br/>There are many points to address and I will try to go through them all.  I am open to discussion about the various issues.<br/><br/>On the selection of lay people, Deputy O'Callaghan was insulting towards the Public Appointments Service, PAS.  There is no indication from other jurisdictions where lay people have moved into the system that they are carrying particular agendas.  Why should it be different in this country?  If we lay out the criteria for the types of lay people who should be on the board, we can trust the PAS to select people of the highest calibre, if that is the route we take instead of using nominating bodies.  We trust it to undertake other important jobs, so I do not see why it cannot be trusted to do this.<br/><br/>The Deputy made a point about the level of resources that we have suggested the body should have.  The Bar Council made the very same point in its submission yesterday and questioned whether resources were needed.  If one wants to establish a professional body, give it the kind of work that is necessary and allow it to develop the expertise relevant to the important issue of judicial selection, one should support it in doing so.  The Dublin declaration made this point.  In their analysis of the current operation of the appointments board, the JAAB and the Judicial Appointments Review Committee, JARC, have stated that they do not have enough resources to do the type of job that they believe they should do.  I make these points in support of our approach.  This needs to be a professional body with professional standards that employs a chief executive to oversee it.  The structure is relatively modest.  We are not talking about glossy reports, only limited access to consultant expertise so that it can be a fully professionalised selection process, as we have outlined in the Bill.<br/><br/>A number of points have been made about the role of the Attorney General.  The Attorney General is in a unique position to understand the qualities required for a judicial appointment and would be familiar with the experience of practising lawyers.  The Attorney General is in a different position, being slightly outside the system, but is a legal expert and has extensive day-to-day knowledge of the abilities of practising lawyers, in particular barristers.  The Attorney General is the Government's legal adviser, not a member of it.  I would support the Attorney General being kept on the commission.  It is a suitable approach to take.<br/><br/>Deputies Farrell and Daly raised questions about the A and B lists and qualities.  Some people like the more detailed approach taken by Deputy O'Callaghan to the qualities that people need to be judges.  That is a matter for discussion and we can devise an approach that is satisfactory for the committee.</p><p>We have some work to do and we certainly will address the matter.  </p><p> Deputy Daly made a point about the Bar Council and Law Society applying merit to legal members.  It could be discussed with both organisations how they would propose to apply a merit criteria to the people they nominate.  I am quite sure that they would do that anyway but it is something we can look at in the final drafting.  Again, they bring a different and important perspective and I was keen that should be reflected in the composition of the board.  The Deputy's idea is useful.  We can consider the transparency of that aspect of the membership of the commission.  </p><p> In terms of political engagement, I would make the point that in a professional selection process it is irrelevant whether a person is politically motivated.  It will not help them.  I think that we all agree that political involvement, membership or experience in politics should not exclude people.  I do not think we want to arrive at a situation where people who have been involved democratically in politics are excluded.  Clearly, everybody should go through a professional selection process. </p><p> The point has been made that the experts in this area, those who are already sitting judges, are the people who should appoint their successors and their colleagues.  It has also been pointed out that they should have the majority in doing so because they know the practice first hand as they do the work.  I will make a number of points on the approach we are taking.  I refer to the argument made about cardiologists appointing cardiologists and whether the Taoiseach chairs a committee or somebody does so when he or she is not there.  First, judges will be there and their expertise will be fundamental and critical to the decision.  I have made this point absolutely clear.  The lay people will provide a range of additional voices, expertise and experience.  Being a judge is about having a knowledge of the law but it is also about other issues.  The whole point about what qualities we need in a judge is that these will be elaborated by the commission in its selection processes based on merit.  That is what happens in other countries.  </p><p> In terms of quite what the role of the chief justice should be, an argument has been made elsewhere in other jurisdictions.  Let us make the point that chief justices in neighbouring countries have no difficulty with being part of a commission and not being the chair.  One can make the argument, but I am not quite sure which words to use, to ensure having a chief justice in that position gives greater opportunity for him or her to make an input and still play a very critical role while not chairing.  One can make the assumption that the lay members will respect the judicial experience members of the Judiciary bring to the table.</p><p> In terms of lay involvement, from a democratic accountability point of view we want to see more of a critical mass of lay people involved.  I respect the fact that Deputy O'Callaghan has called for more lay people on the board.  The points of discussion are on who should act as chair and whether there should be a majority.</p><p> I do not wish to criticise the nominating bodies listed by Deputy O'Callaghan.  One must decide which of the many bodies should be regarded as having relevant interests.  We have already heard from a number of members of the committee that there is a wide range of bodies that one could consider to be nominating bodies.  Having examined the matter, I felt that the approach that I have outlined through the Public Appointments Service, where we could identify the skills that were needed in a very clear way, was a better approach.  I note that there has been disagreement on the committee on this aspect.</p><p> I acknowledge Deputy O'Callaghan's acceptance of the importance of the approach that I have taken in terms of making service on the District Court bench as qualifying Judges directly for promotion to the High Court.  I agree with him that the measure is overdue.  That concludes the main points I wanted to make.   </p></speech>

In dealing with the T&aacute;naiste's comments, I will not repeat points that I made earlier.</p> <p>  I will respond to the three points made by Deputy Jonathan O'Brien.  His first point was about having diversity in the T&aacute;naiste's general scheme of the Bill.  Section 15(4)(a) of my Bill states that the Commission must take into account "promoting gender and cultural diversity within the judiciary.".  I included the provision because it is a very important progression that needs to be made. </p> <p>  Second, Deputy O'Brien claimed there was a judicial majority on my commission.  That is incorrect.  Only five of the 12 people would be judges in my commission.</p> <p>  Third, the Deputy mentioned a constitutional issue.  I agree with the T&aacute;naiste in respect of this matter.  I do not think it is feasible to restrict the decision-making process of the Government to the names that are provided by the recommending body.  Constitutionally, the Government must be given the ability to appoint whoever it wants.</p> <p>  Deputy Clare Daly made a number of good points.  The first point she mentioned, and this is what I tried to emphasise at the outset, was that Judges work in the best interests of society.  In my legislation I have sought to improve the process for nominating Judges to improve society, not to improve the lives of Judges, and not to make it easier for lawyers, lay people or whatever.  The important thing, and everyone here is motivated by this, is to ensure that the public interest is best served so that the public get the most suitably qualified and best candidates to fulfil the role of Judiciary under the Constitution.  </p> <p>  One has a recommending body and one has the final body at Cabinet.  The Deputy is correct in terms of what she said about the presence of the Attorney General on both bodies leading to confusion and the office holding too much influence on the recommending body. </p> <p>  The Deputy also mentioned the issue about a lay majority, as did others.  We need to get away from using the term "lay people".  It suits the agenda of some people to present the view that lay people are good and anyone opposed to having lay people is trying to promote their own cosy or cushy cartel.  What we want on the commission are people who are suitable and well qualified to identify who will be the best candidates.  I do not mind what they are called.  Using the terminology of "lay person" does not serve any great policy purpose.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned that a gender balance is needed.  My Bill includes the provision at section 15(4).  </p> <p>  The Deputy welcomed the fact that there was a requirement on the committee, set up under the T&aacute;naiste's scheme, for it to set out a list, code of excellence or a code of what will make a good judge in terms of the appointment procedure.  Section 6(4) of my Bill refers to an obligation on the commission to publish "selection competencies" within a short period after the commission has been constituted. </p> <p>  Deputy Farrell made a number of points on a lay majority.  I shall repeat the point that I made previously about the matter.  He questioned my interest in the matter but not in a derogatory manner.  He wondered whether Fianna F&aacute;il only made the proposal now to stymie the Government's proposal.  That is not correct because we tabled legislation during the life of the previous D&aacute;il.  Like other members, I am interested in the area.  </p> <p>  I will not reply to each of the T&aacute;naiste's comments as if this debate was a table tennis match.  Instead, I will make a number of points.  I did not accuse her, personally, of being disrespectful to the Judiciary.  I did accuse the Government of being disrespectful to the Judiciary.  It is instructive to note that over an hour ago I asked her to identify one committee on which the Taoiseach served but which he did not chair.</p><p>I have not heard an answer to that because I do not think there is one.  There are reasons for that.  It is because of the respect that people have, and should have, for the office of the Taoiseach.  </p><p> Much ground has been covered and it has been a very useful engagement.  I am not proprietorial or emotionally committed to my legislation.  We need to get the best scheme available.  I would be concerned however, that what is really motivating the Government side of the debate is not in fact the desire to get the best scheme in place, but a desire on the part of Government to abide by a rather foolish commitment it made in the programme for Government.</p></speech>

I share the same goal as him, but to arrive at the best system I have looked at what is happening internationally and I have laid these on the table.  There is a legitimate approach in the scheme that is before us.  There are some key questions that need ongoing consideration but one cannot simply assume that a lay chair or lay majority suggests disrespect from the Government in regard to the Judiciary.  I have put this is an international context where all of these changes are being considered.</p></speech>

We will now consider the issue of sports in Ireland.  This is the second hearing on this issue, which we have included in our work programme for 2017.  Today we will continue to examine a number of areas, including how governance is supported and promoted within the national governing bodies, the significance of annual reporting and ensuring compliance with State funding requirements, how financial compliance is managed through audit procedures and how the greatest efficiency and suitability can be achieved through the sports capital programme.  We will also continue the discussion on gender quotas on State-sponsored sports boards and seek the views of Sport Ireland and the Federation of Irish Sport.</p><p>Sport Ireland provides support for national governing bodies in areas such as governance, planning and compliance, while the Federation of Irish Sport supports these bodies working collectively for the betterment of sport in Ireland, and so make up a vital component of our analysis of sport in Ireland.  In this regard, I am delighted to welcome to the meeting today Mr. John Treacy, chief executive, Mr. Paul McDermott, director of high-performance and NGPs, and Dr. Una May, director of participation and ethics, from Sport Ireland, and Mr. James Galvin, chief executive officer, and Ms Sarah Keane, board member of the Federation of Irish Sport.  I thank them for attending.  </p><p>Before we commence, in accordance with procedure, I am required to read the following.  By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind witnesses that the opening statements which have been circulated to members should be no more than five minutes duration.  I invite Mr. Treacy to make his opening statement.</p></speech>

Sport Ireland was established in 2015 as the single statutory agency responsible for the development of sport in Ireland.  We place a high premium on good governance and encourage high standards in governance from all funded bodies.  We believe in empowering sporting organisations to take responsibility for their governance and meet the challenges they face.  Sport Ireland assists all funded bodies to achieve excellence in their work through a number of interventions in the area of governance.  This is broken down into a series of meaningful pieces of work, ensuring growth and stability moving forward.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland was the first statutory body to adopt the community and voluntary code as best practice in 2013.  In 2016, the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O&rsquo;Donovan, identified corporate governance as a key priority for Sport Ireland funded bodies.  To this end, the Minister of State addressed the national governing bodies for sport and highlighted that the adoption of the community and voluntary code would become a condition of funding.  That would make it mandatory for all Sport Ireland funded bodies to start the process of adopting the code during 2017, on a comply-and-explain basis to be completed by 2021.</p> <p>  In anticipation of moving our funded bodies towards compliance under the code, Sport Ireland has already incorporated a number of questions in our annual grant application process.  This provides us with a clear picture on where we are on our journey to comply with the code.  So far, seven national organisations have fully adopted the code and 26 funded bodies are working on the journey to compliance.  </p> <p>  Governance across the board is of paramount importance to Sport Ireland, which is why we have put in place a range of monitors and supports to ensure that funded bodies are adequately responding to the issues they face.  In addition to the grant application form, we get mid-year reviews from governing bodies which detail operational plans, compliance documentation such as financial statements, anti-doping codes and codes of ethics.  We also carry out an audit function each year, whereby a comprehensive programme of auditing funded bodies is undertaken.  Reports are submitted directly to the Sport Ireland audit committee.  The committee reviews and tracks progress.  Part of those audit reports refers to implementation and plans, and we in Sport Ireland work with governing bodies to ensure we have full compliance in terms of what the audit reports state.  We have dealt with many national governing bodies in that respect.</p> <p>  There were a number of disputes in recent times within sport and Sport Ireland.  All national governing bodies are expected to include a form of dispute resolution in their constitutions, which has taken time but has been done.  Through the Sport Ireland website, funded bodies have access to a dedicated section covering governance, which includes information on good governance, governance principles and the governance code, along with a number of detailed publications and toolkits, including the better board, stronger sport toolkit which was developed with funding from the European Commission.  It is now available for use and Sport Ireland played a key role in the development of this resource.</p> <p>  Throughout 2017, we in Sport Ireland will work in partnership with the Institute of Public Administration and will host a number of flagship governance events for funded bodies, directed at board members, chairs and chief executives.  We also have an organisational development and change unit that offers a series of services to governing bodies, volunteers and administrators in the area of advisory services, such as HR, governance skills, knowledge training, project management etc., which is available and has been well received by governing bodies.</p> <p>  Sport Ireland supports the core concept of gender representation on boards as it is consistent with our strategic and operational practice, promoting inclusion at every level of sport.  Addressing gender imbalance on boards is primarily an equality measure.  It would create benefits in terms of advancing the governance culture of boards by widening their representation, expanding expertise and generating a cascading effect through the other representative and governing committees within sport.</p> <p>  A great deal of work is directed at ensuring gender balance and much progress has been made in this regard, but we acknowledge that the introduction of mandatory quotas presents challenges.  There are many high-profile female athletes, administrators and officials in Irish sport and the participation gap, we are very happy to say, has been closing.  However, there remains an issue of gender balance in sports administration and more progress is required.</p> <p>  Should gender quotas be introduced for sports bodies, the primary issue of the process involved will need to be addressed, that is, the independence of sporting bodies.  Individual M&amp;As and constitutions may not provide for a speedy implementation of any proposal.  While it would be preferable that the introduction of gender balance happens soon, it needs to be acknowledged that this process will take time.  We have seen evidence of this in terms of dispute resolution, where amendments to constitutions and M&amp;As were required.   </p> <p>  Current funding from Sport Ireland to national governing bodies and local sports partnerships has decreased by 19% since 2007.  There is a challenge to restore funding, as all Sport Ireland funded bodies, including governing bodies and local sports partnerships, need support.</p><p>As everyone knows, sport plays a very significant role in raising the level of physical activity within the population and makes a major contribution to the health of the nation.  The national network of local sports partnerships is vital to the ongoing achievement of our goals in increasing participation in sport and physical activity.  The continued success of Irish athletes on the world stage represents the most successful sustained period in the history of high performance sport in Ireland.  This success is built on the foundation of Sport Ireland's high performance strategy and the work of the institute.  If we are to realise our full potential in achieving an active population, experience sustained success at an international level and build on these foundations, there is a need for progressive funding for Sport Ireland and to deliver on the functions of the Sport Ireland Act.  We believe strong Government investment in sport is merited, given the economic, social, cultural and health benefits it brings to the country.</p><p> With regard to the sports capital programme, the National Sports Campus has developed to become the epicentre for sport in Ireland.  We have a national aquatic centre, the institute's high performance centre, the headquarters of Irish Sport, a horse arena, a national cross-country track which was opened this year and the headquarters of Special Olympics Ireland.  I am delighted to say the Taoiseach will be opening our national indoor arena tomorrow morning.  The centrepiece will obviously be the indoor athletics centre and the gymnastics centre.  There will also be a national indoor training area that will cater for up to 20 sports and more.  Work is under way on Cricket Ireland's training facility and additional office accommodation.</p><p> The next priority for the board of Sport Ireland is the funding and progression of phase 2 of the national indoor arena.  This will see the construction of covered synthetic pitches, primarily for soccer, Gaelic games and rugby but which will be capable of accommodating all field sports, together with ancillary changing and strength and conditioning facilities.  Planning permission has been granted for the development of the national velodrome and badminton centre which, following departmental sanction, has been brought to tender stage.  </p><p> Sport Ireland welcomes the recent announcement of the next round of the sports capital programme.  It is our contention that future funding for local and regional sports facilities should be guided by the need to best support increased participation in sport and support for elite athletes.  We believe multi-sport facilities should also be prioritised, recognising that adults transition between sports throughout the course of their lives.  It is the view of Sport Ireland that consideration needs to take into account the activities towards which adults are increasingly gravitating, including running, cycling, outdoor adventure pursuits and recreational walking, among others.  In this regard, apart from investment in traditional sports infrastructure, the way in which the wider natural and built environments are designed needs to be addressed in order that taking part in sport and physical activity is an easy choice.  From a high performance perspective, Sport Ireland is of the view that investment in high performance equipment should be catered for in future rounds of the sports capital programme.  In 2014 two sports that received a capital injection were sailing and rowing and participants in both went on to win medals in Rio de Janeiro.  It was a critical intervention that had a direct impact on our high performance programme.</p><p> The biggest challenge facing sport is the threat posed by doping.  Earlier this month Sport Ireland hosted the leaders of 19 national anti-doping agencies at a special summit in Farmleigh, at which issues in the global fight against doping were discussed.  The Minister of State at the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, addressed the conference.  Following the meeting, the group issued a strong statement that highlighted how the world's anti-doping system could be reformed and how non-compliance should be met with the strongest possible action.  It is vital that all of the recommendations proposed by the group be implemented to protect the integrity of sport and protect clean athletes.  We have all read about the McLaren reports in recent times.  A system of anti-doping is only as strong as the weakest country.  We all need to make sure we get our systems up and running.</p><p> There are three key areas concerning strategy.  We have touched on corporate governance.  What we need are strong, dynamic sports organisations to drive sport in Ireland.  This will obviously be a key strategy.  As a new agency we are developing our own strategy and will need to resource the sector in supporting the national governing bodies.</p><p> On participation, the narrowing of existing gradients is a challenge.  The investments in the national physical activity plan, measured through the Dormant Accounts Fund, are to be commended.  Should these interventions be found to be successful following robust evaluation, Sport Ireland recommends that every effort be made to have them scaled up and rolled out nationwide using more mainstream Exchequer funding sources, with possible private investment.</p><p> On the high performance front, funding for 2017 has remained static.  Ireland experienced unprecedented success in London, winning six medals, but this success was not replicated in 2016.  We had many fine performances across the board but won only two medals.  We need to ensure we increase our investment in high performance sport.  We are looking to countries such as New Zealand and Denmark which are investing far more that we are in the high performance system.  One gets a direct result from investment in high performance sport.  We need to ensure we keep pace with the rest of the world.</p><p> Our Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games review has been completed and is with the Department.  We look forward to announcing the recommendations and discussing them with the committee in due course.  I thank it for its time and certainly would welcome questions members might wish to ask.</p></speech>

We fully appreciate the broad and challenging nature of the committee's remit, with the ongoing pressures of constituency work.  It is crucial, however, that Irish Sport work in partnership with the wider political and policy communities in shaping future policy.  This platform is a key part of that process and I am thankful for the opportunity.  The Federation of Irish Sport is the representative body for Ireland's national governing bodies, local sports partnerships and other voluntary sports organisations.  Its membership comprises over 100 sports organisations.  It is a not-for-profit organisation which champions the value of sport.</p> <p>  I shall address the topics in sequence.  We compliment the Ministers responsible for sport on raising these vital issues and giving them a forum.  I will begin with governance.  While the governance of Irish sport has been topical in recent times, a huge amount of work is being undertaken in the background to implement best practice.  We have seen difficulties emerge in other sectors in recent years and the reputational damage that has been done as a consequence.  It is in all of our interests to get this right.  Many smaller national governing bodies, however, expend significant time and energy in implementing the code of governance, with limited resources.  It is an extra cost that some organisations have difficulty in absorbing.  These are not opt-outs or excuses but facts.  Many national governing bodies are under-resourced, resulting in senior and volunteer staff working across multiple roles.  The austerity years have added to these difficulties and the funding levels of Irish sport, despite modest increases in the past two budgets, are still significantly off peak current funding levels in 2007.  Increased funding is not the only part of the solution, but it is an important one that needs to be acknowledged.</p> <p>  We fully recognise that with funding, particularly State funding, comes responsibility.  Our members know this and welcome it.  Transparency and accountability are key to stakeholder confidence.  Applying the governance code effectively will require the parallel establishment of a monitoring and evaluation system that will document processes, train members and evaluate their performances.  In addition, the federation recommends the setting up of an internal audit function in Sport Ireland to assist national governing bodies in improving compliance.  Such measures will need to be resourced appropriately.  </p> <p>  It is important to acknowledge the positive role of Sport Ireland's organisation development unit in building capabilities.  The unit is valued highly by national governing bodies and local sports partnerships.  It is important to recognise the practicalities of implementation within Irish sport and elsewhere.  For governing bodies established as companies limited by guarantee, almost all of the changes would require a change to the articles of the company which, in turn, would require 75% of the members present and voting at the meeting to approve the changes.  In some cases, boards are made up of individuals from specific committees; therefore, the matter is not uncomplicated.  For some, it will mean changing fundamentally how the organisation has operated for its entire existence.  Therefore, it will require time and, in many cases, a supportive approach to the governing bodies to bring about this type of change.  We believe all sports should be asked to embrace these general principles but that discussion should take place with the relevant bodies individually on implementation and timescales.</p> <p>  There are many ways to address this issue, one being adopting a tiered approach, based on funding support or other measures, which has been adopted in the United Kingdom, or a comply or explain approach, for example, or both.</p><p>Irrespective of the approach, we believe strongly in getting Irish sport to embrace not just the concept of good governance but the real practical changes to effect it.</p><p> The Federation of Irish Sport welcomes the recent discussions with the Minister and Minister of State on the subject of gender quotas on boards.  We fully agree with the spirit of the policy, and will continue to proactively engage with all stakeholders and the wider commentariat in that regard.  However, its implementation may pose particular challenges for some of our members.  For example, consideration and understanding should be afforded to single-gender-dominated sport bodies.  It is clear, however, that where male and females participate in the same or a similar sport and they are under the one governing body, diversity on boards is more prevalent.  Therefore, this is something that should be encouraged, as has happened whereby various sporting organisations of specific genders are partnering up to deliver for the sport as a whole.</p><p> There are inherent risks in appointing people to positions based on their gender rather than appropriate experience, competence and qualification for the role.  Aggressive implementation could lead to resentment, and run contrary to the intentions of the policy.  Parallel to discussions on quotas, we need to have a much wider debate about the traditional barriers to women's representation on boards.</p><p> Clearly this issue is not confined to sporting bodies.  It is reflected in the private and public sectors and at the highest level in the Civil Service.  It is also reflected in directors' remuneration and overall disparities in levels of pay.  There are findings, insights and solutions to be shared from other sectors, and we want to be part of that wider conversation.  Given the collective nature of directors' responsibility, there may be a detrimental impact on recruiting competent people if they believe that quotas are promoting candidates beyond their ability.  The evidence that this changes over the medium term needs to be examined as part of these discussions.</p><p> Similar to our comments on governance, we believe that Irish sporting organisations should be required to embrace the principle and agree an implementation plan as appropriate to show a real intention to address the issues.  Our view in this case is that a tiered approach should be considered as sporting organisations differ vastly in terms of their operations and their capacity.  Furthermore, where change is embraced and committed to from the sport, it is likely to become part of the culture of the sport rather than a tick-the-box exercise.</p><p> Irish sport realises that the Government continues to have to make difficult decisions on funding.  Sport has already taken huge hits and any further curtailment in the investment will greatly damage sport and its potential.  Investment is essential to the future well-being of Irish sport as such funding initially provides the programmes that lead to driving participation and unearthing new talents.  Those talents are then nurtured by the funding to create the high-performance sportsmen and sportswomen who do our country proud.</p><p> While new facilities are extremely worthwhile, they bring additional operational outlays which must, at least for a period of time, be funded.  This must be taken into account when comparing and considering Government investment in sport.  We contend that it is investment as opposed to grants to the statutory agency, the governing bodies, local sports partnerships and others involved to deliver a service to people in Ireland through their day-to-day work of developing, promoting and delivering sporting opportunities and structured competitions, events and the entire relevant infrastructure to support those involved.</p><p> Irish Sport has come a long way since dedicated Government investment and funding commenced in 1997.  Sport extends across virtually every activity in constituencies, villages and towns throughout the country.  Sport is a driver and partner of policy formation offering different perspectives, new thinking and innovative solutions.  Traditionally Irish sport is a sector that does a lot with relatively little.  However, society has changed and so has the way in which sport operates.  What was acceptable in many cases previously is not acceptable now and the role of the governing bodies and others is vital to the infrastructure of Irish sport and ensuring that sport does not just happen, but happens in a safe and sustainable environment.</p><p> We now have the opportunity to embark on a wider conversation about how sport is funded, its role in shaping public policy, and corresponding Government strategies and interventions.  We need a government with the vision to recognise and embrace this opportunity by encouraging and facilitating this debate.  Government funding is an integral part of the development of our sportsmen and sportswomen, young and old.  Without Government funding it would not be possible to provide the very successful grassroots and developmental programmes organised and administered by national governing bodies and local sports partnerships in every county of Ireland ensuring that our sportsmen and sportswomen get the opportunity to realise their potential. </p><p> I will now outline the key building blocks to ensure Ireland's sporting future.  We wish to see the implementation of a national sport strategy that maximises the power and positivity of sport across Government to enhance the lives and health of all Ireland's citizens.  The strategy should be both aspirational and transformative with ring-fenced funding, dedicated political oversight and review mechanisms. </p><p> We wish to see the restoration of funding levels for sport to 2008 levels next year.  We wish to see them increased by 20% by 2020 through costed programmes and initiatives to deliver targeted outcomes in terms of increased participation and retention levels as well as high-performance sport.  We also ask that a system of multiannual funding be introduced.  Multiannual funding would facilitate the development of more strategic and longer-term planning for sports bodies, and would provide them with more certainty about their funding than currently exists.  It would also allow Sport Ireland to make funding decisions on the basis of these longer-term plans.</p><p> We need to provide the next generation with the best opportunities.  We need to commit to the delivery of at least two hours' mandatory sport and physical activity each week, as recommended by the Department of Health and the WHO, while trying to formalise links between schools and community sports clubs.  All of this will impact on the quality of service and capacity of NGBs and LSPs to recruit members, and develop and deliver sports programmes across the country.</p><p> The programme for Government refers to the "significant social and health benefits that participation in sport delivers".  As we have outlined, that is only part of the picture.  Sport interacts with policy in public health promotion, social integration, cultural identity, education, job creation and building relationships with the "new Irish" communities and yet we are significantly under-utilised and under-resourced as a driver and shaper of policy change.  We have much more to offer and are willing to play that role.</p><p> Sport in this country is part of our culture and who we are.  However, we must work to ensure it is inclusive and sustainable throughout the lifecycle.  There is plenty in what we have outlined and what will have been received through submissions from the governing bodies, local sports partnerships and others on the national sports policy to put concrete solutions in place to address the challenges we face and to help sporting organisations deliver on their potential to bring sport to all of the people.</p></speech>

In Mr. Treacy's opening submission, he stated that to date only seven funded bodies had met all the community and voluntary code of governance guidelines and that 26 funded bodies are working towards the code.  Why have so many not complied with the code?  He also stated that Sport Ireland had put in place a range of monitors and supports to ensure that funded bodies are adequately responding to Government issues.  I ask him to elaborate more on this and perhaps give the committee some examples of the monitoring and supports put in place.</p> <p>  Mr. Treacy stated that the audit committee carried out an annual review of selected organisations.  What percentage of organisations are subject to this review on an annual basis?  Regarding gender balance on boards, what is the percentage of females on various boards?</p> <p>  Mr. Treacy said that the biggest challenge facing sports was the threat of doping.  I ask him to elaborate.  What action does Sport Ireland intend to take to keep sport in Ireland clean?</p> <p>  Was Mr. Treacy happy with Ireland's performance at the 2016 Rio Olympic Games?  The 2012 games in London were excellent.  What was the difference between the 2012 and 2016 Olympic Games?  What plans has Sport Ireland put in place for the 2020 Olympic Games?  Mr. Treacy spoke about investment in high-performance sport.  He mentioned two countries, Denmark and New Zealand, which did very well in the 2016 Olympic Games.  Why did they do so well compared with how we did?</p><p> I would also like to address a few questions to Mr. Galvin from the Federation of Irish Sport.</p></speech>

Up to now we were getting them to comply with it voluntarily.  We work very closely with them.  There were a number of interventions at conferences during the course of the year.  When we talk about monitoring, we sit down with the governing bodies which engage in a self-assessment exercise on the code, to which the progressive governing bodies will sign up and with which they will comply, but it is a slow process.  As Mr. Galvin said, many of them are very small organisations and under-resourced.  They are probably a long way down the road, but as of now they comply with the code on a voluntary basis.  That is the reason the Minister intervened to send the message that we needed to move more quickly.</p> <p>  The issue of governance was highlighted last summer and a lot of the governing bodies have moved on substantially.  There are now professional staff in place and good progress has been made compared to the position we were in ten years ago in terms of how we monitored governing bodies.  I talked about the audit function of Sport Ireland.  We have limited resources, but Deloitte Ireland carries out an internal audit and, in turn, audits the governing bodies.  It might audit up to five in a year and will look at corporate governance and their financial position.  It comes back to Sport Ireland with its recommendations and we, in turn, sit down with the governing body concerned and go through the recommendations made.  If there are significant issues, we work through them on an ongoing basis.  We work hand-in-hand with the governing bodies to assist them in overcoming the issues with which they are dealing.  We probably have a great deal more leverage if Sport Ireland is providing more than 50% of the funding of a governing body.  Where we are providing less than 50%, we audit the funding given to ensure it is being spent for the purposes for which it was given.  When it comes to corporate governance, our powers are limited.  Therefore, if we are providing more than 50% of its funding, we have a great deal more leverage.</p> <p>  I ask my colleague, Dr. May, to comment on the issue of gender balance.  I will then comment on the issue of doping.</p></speech>

We have been reviewing our own staff in Sport Ireland in which there is a very high percentage of females.  We are happy, therefore, that there is a very good gender balance within the structure of Sport Ireland which can lead by example.  There has been a decrease in the gender gap between males and females in participation in sport and we have been investing significantly in programmes for women in the past few years.  We have invested nearly &euro;1 million across the national governing bodies and the local sports partnerships to increase the participation of women in sport.  This will lead to the development of and improvement in the skills and expertise of females which will then give them the capacity to be better representatives on boards such that it will not be about having a gender quota but about skills and expertise.</p></speech>

The submissions are being sent in this week and we hope to be in a position to provide the Minister with data by the end of next week.</p> <p>  We are in a global fight when it comes to doping.  I think Irish citizens are very good.  Dr. May has led the anti-doping initiative since the inception of the Irish Sports Council.  We have to ensure our voice is heard internationally and need to ensure every country is doing what we are doing.  If the system is weak in a particular country, the entire system will be let down.  That is why representatives of the 19 national anti-doping agencies met in Farmleigh to keep the issue high on the agenda and ensure it will not slip off the agenda of the International Olympic Council.  The Word Anti-Doping Agency, WADA, needs to be strengthened to ensure it can sanction countries.  Its powers of compliance and investigation also need to be enhanced.  </p> <p>  Our programme for high performance athletes was hugely successful in 2012 and in 2016 we had more athletes in the top 20 than ever before.  However, we did not achieve the same number of medals as in 2012, as our boxing programme did not deliver the same number of medals as in 2012.  As that issue has been the subject of a great deal of debate in recent times, I do not have to add to it.  We are already planning for the Olympic Games to be held in 2020 and will be making announcements on funding shortly.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. McDermott to comment further.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.651" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul McDermott" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#F00600"><p>There are a number of points that are worth making about the performance of Irish athletes in Rio de Janeiro.  We had a target of winning three medals and won two.  Those who watched the games know where we missed our target.  Unfortunately, a lot of things went wrong for our boxers, some of whom felt they had been judged wrongly.  However, we have a lot of work to do to get the boxing programme back to where it was.  We had 14 athletes who achieved a place in the top eight and more athletes in the top 16 and top 20 than ever before.  We were generally happy with the performance.  Any Olympic medal is hard won and converting a top eight place into a medal position is very difficult.  Obviously, the performance in London was exceptionally good.  It is also noteworthy that our athletes who competed in the Paralympic Games did exceptionally well both in London and Rio de Janeiro.  We have a number of programmes which are delivering performances at the highest level.  Our athletes are winning medals between games and year to year.  The systems are stronger.  We have to put up our hand and say we did not hit the target in Rio de Janeiro where we won two medals, but we did have a number of top eight, as well as top 16 and top 20, finishes.</p> <p>  The review of the Rio de Janeiro games has essentially been completed.  The sports bodies are acting on the recommendations and the funding proposals and plans for this year are well advanced.  We are working towards the Tokyo games and the high performance sports are already looking at the young athletes.  We have had meetings in the past few weeks with all of the high performance directors who are already identifying the athletes who will be in Tokyo and how we can support them during the next four years.</p> <p>  We were asked about the performance of the athletes from New Zealand and Denmark.  We looked at the systems in place in these countries to learn from them.  We are trying to build a system for Irish athletes and Irish sports and generally trying to do it from our base in Abbotstown.  We think we have made significant progress, but we have looked at other countries that have succeeded to try to learn lessons.  There are two points to be made.  We must understand how the best high performance programmes work and we are learning all the time.  New Zealand and Denmark have about 20 years on us in their formal structures, but they also have much greater levels of funding available.  Notwithstanding this, one does not win every day in high performance sports as everything does not go one's way every day, but we have made major progress.  As we have learned the lesson that we can compete internationally, we have demonstrated our ability to win in a number of sports.  We were very proud of our boxers at the Olympic and Paralympic Games.  Our athletes have delivered good performances in athletics, equestrian and many other sports.  We accept, however, that in Rio de Janeiro it was a mixed bag.  We will push on and prepare for the Tokyo games at which hope we will enjoy success.</p></speech>

There is no criticism of anyone for his or her efforts.  It was a very disappointing start that one of our athletes was sent home for doping.  This country is known throughout the world for being very clean and professional and no stone should be left unturned to ensure we maintain our current good reputation.  We are a small country and we have big expectations.  We are here to help.  This country is a sporting country and if more investment is needed or the organisations are not happy with the level of investment then they should say that.  It is very important that we get everything right for the 2020 Olympic Games.  What happened with the boxing 12 months before the previous Olympics did not help our preparation.  It left a sour note.  I agree that as far as boxing was concerned a few decisions went wrong but when one gets a knock one shakes oneself off and gets up again.</p> <p>  Athletics is a big thing in this country and as a small nation we want to see it doing very well.  If Mr. Treacy thinks the investment provided by the Government is not enough he should not be afraid to say that.  I wish him the best of luck tomorrow with the opening of the new area in the national sports campus.  No stone should be left unturned for the 2020 Olympic Games.</p></speech>

Three governance codes are applicable to organisations of different sizes.  Some boards must have operational and strategic functions because they do not have any staff.  The second one is for organisations with fewer than ten members of staff and the third one is for organisations with more than ten staff.  That in itself is a challenge.  There are more than 50 principles in the governance codes so when our organisation reported to the Sports Council on how we were doing it took us 16 pages to go through where we were on each one.  It covers risk management, financial policy, term limits, relationships between the board, relationships with the CEO and other operational staff, independent directors and how one runs one's meetings.  It is a huge piece of work in that regard and that is why it is taking time for people to get through it.  Everybody needs to be on the journey but it will take some time for most people to get through it.</p> <p>  As a governing body that was involved from the start and one of the first ones to do it, it has taken us several years to do it.  A big point is that if one is a company limited by guarantee, which at this stage almost all governing bodies are, one needs 75% of one's membership to embrace those principles as well and that can take a lot of education, persuasion and time.  That is the only way one will change the culture.  Otherwise, it is just a box-ticking exercise.  That is what everybody needs to fight for it not to be if we want to really effect change and ensure that governance works at the highest levels in Irish sport.</p></speech>

I have been in Abbotstown on a number of occasions and it is a fantastic development.</p> <p>  Time is limited so I will go straight to the governance issues.  How closely do Sport Ireland and the Federation of Irish Sport monitor the day-to-day activities of governing bodies and how are they held to account?  Boxing has been mentioned.  From the perspective of the public looking on, there seemed to be a total breakdown in discipline following the departure of Billy Walsh.  There is a definitive difference between coaching and managing.  Zaur Antia is the top coach in the world but Billy Walsh's management role was totally missed.  I refer, for example, to the specifics of Paddy Barnes's weight issue and the fact that he could not perform due to his need to meet the weight.  Michael O'Reilly did not train with the squad.  Apart from the doping issue, why was he allowed to travel to the Olympics when he did not train with the squad?  As regards the doping investigation, following his failed dope test, one could not make up the story in the sense that the draw was made in Rio when the news broke in Ireland.  What is the sequence of events when a dope test is failed?  Who knows or who should know?  Why did the media have the information?  It was unfair on the coaches who had to meet the media when they did not know he had failed the dope test.</p> <p>  As regards the management of the boxing team, there is a manager from the governing body but is there any management by the high performance unit?  Who performed the management in the lead-up to the Olympics?  One has the governing body, the high performance unit and the Olympic Council of Ireland.  What is happening between those three bodies is that to a certain extent the athletes are falling through the cracks.  I have raised the issue previously.  One does one's four year preparation and one changes the management team when one gets to the Olympics.  That has not worked and needs to be examined.  Heads need to be knocked together to get it right.  I do not have to go back to the Gary Keegan incident when he could not even get into the stadium.</p></speech>

I just want to get answers.  I apologise for naming anyone.  It is important that we get such matters right.  For instance, in relation to the Irish Amateur Boxing Association, IABA, I understand Abbotstown was ready for it but it did not move from the camp at the National Stadium.  Why was that the case?</p> <p>  I know there are issues relating to the restriction on funding for the Olympic Council of Ireland, OCI.  I understand it has received funding of &euro;1.7 million in the past four years.  It received &euro;520,000 in 2015 and &euro;303,000 of that was for salaries and expenses.  It emerged after the Olympics that the Olympic Council of Ireland had cash reserves of between &euro;1 million and &euro;2 million.  Did it need the funding from the Government or the Sports Council or in terms of value for money should the money have been directed somewhere else?  Is the funding of the Olympic Council of Ireland being reviewed at the moment?  What is the situation in that regard?</p></speech>

That was something that was missing.  Discipline was another factor.  Discipline fell apart.  Let us put it this way; a vacuum emerged in terms of aspects of the management of the team.

It happened leading into the 2016 Olympic Games in Rio de Janeiro.  All the boxers are out training in their clubs leading into the national championships.  After the national championships, they all come together and we will have them on the national sports campus.  I will refer the issue of the doping case to Dr. May.</p></speech>

One of those steps is for us not to leave any stone unturned.  That means that we cannot stop testing in plenty of time before the Olympic Games to make sure that we do not get a positive in the last period of time.  We will continue testing right up until the time that an athlete steps on board a plane.  That would lead to the potential for a late announcement of a positive doping infraction.  We have a very rigorous process in place and it is a very highly litigious society that we live in and anti-doping is at the pinnacle of that in sport.  Therefore, we will not cut corners and sometimes if we have to make a decision as to whether an announcement is made before or after a weigh-in or before or after a draw, ultimately our process is about ensuring that the procedure is followed to the letter of the law and that we have a solid basis for a case which will go on long beyond the day of the draw.</p></speech>

It is important to acknowledge that many of the structures or key enablers for Ireland to deliver in high performance are now coming to fruition.  These include the Sport Ireland Institute, Coaching Ireland, the National Indoor Arena, the National Aquatic Centre, and the high performance unit within Sport Ireland.  We now have a greater number of high performance directors within national governing bodies, and a greater number of international events are being hosted in Ireland.  Structures and key enablers are now coming very much on stream.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised New Zealand and while I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan's ambitious statement about us emulating the performances of New Zealand at the Olympic Games and in high performance sport, for illustrative purposes perhaps it is useful to point out some of the figures around investment in high performance sport.  Between now and Tokyo, New Zealand will invest approximately &euro;42 million in high performance sport per year.  In the period between the London Olympic Games and the Rio de Janeiro Olympic Games, we invested in the region of &euro;42 million or &euro;43 million.  Mr. McDermott might be able to clarify some of those figures, but it is approximately a quarter of the level of investment.  I am prepared to concede that the New Zealand model is at a much more mature and advanced stage in terms of its life cycle for high performance sport, but that is the kind of level of investment that is needed to emulate those sorts of outputs.</p></speech>

Two points were raised, one of which was about the management.  We have worked hard over the years with the Olympic Council of Ireland to ensure that when athletes from whatever sport go to the Olympic Games, they are surrounded by the same personnel, the same team manager and their coaches if possible, notwithstanding issues around accreditations and so on where there may be smaller numbers.  Generally, athletes should be able to replicate their standard high performance environments at the Olympic Games.  We do our best to achieve that and the members are right to highlighted it as a performance issue.</p> <p>  We have funded the Olympic Council of Ireland, OCI, for a number of years.  People have to remember that there was a time when the Olympic Council of Ireland did not have reserves and did not have money.  In order for us to help the Olympic Council of Ireland to contribute to the high performance system, it needed to professionalise, and that is the root of why we continue to pay a contribution towards the salaries of the staff of the Olympic Council of Ireland.</p> <p>  We also fund the programmes that the Olympic Council of Ireland run for Olympic Games.  For example, it operated the pre-games camps in London and in Rio de Janeiro and we funded a good part of them.  That is why it gets additional money in an Olympic year, because it has additional costs related to bringing support personnel to training camps.  We support administration and programmes.  We have had an operational agreement in place for about eight years, but that will all be reviewed and taken into account as we plan all of those things at the beginning of the cycle leading up to the Tokyo Olympic Games.  We will engage with the OCI in due course and discuss funding and operations.</p></speech>

I commend Mr. Galvin and Mr. Treacy and their other colleagues here today on their interesting deliberations.  As one can see, it all boils down to money again.</p><p>The Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport has already put down the gauntlet that come 2020 he wants the issues with governance and gender quotas to be resolved.  I asked the question of those here today and they have addressed it in some small way.  Complications will arise.  Where comprehension of the gender balance issue is concerned, there are organisations which are female dominated and <i>vice versa</i>, as in organisations which are male dominated.  The question that arises is whether this can be introduced in time to resolve the gender balance issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.686" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#H01600"><p>When we talk about governance, as Ms Keane highlighted, we are talking about many different principles.  When governing bodies are looking at the various pieces, what the Minister for Transport, Tourism and Sport is basically saying is that the organisations must comply or explain.  If one is talking about leadership of an organisation, questions to ask include whether it has a strategic plan in place and if the board members know what are their responsibilities.  They are corporate governance pieces that need to be there as essentials.  Control mechanisms must be in place and transparency, and the leadership must behave with integrity.  The vast majority of governing bodies can advance all those types of pieces in terms of the principles of the code.  If they cannot advance them, they can explain why they cannot do so.  I think all the governing bodies can get to that point by 2020.  We need to be resourced to ensure that we have the human resources to advise those governing bodies in terms of compliance with the code and to give guidance to them.  It is an important piece and if they cannot comply, they can explain why that is the case.</p> <p>  It is the same with the gender quotas.  If it is an all-male sport, the issues involved in getting gender quotas on boards are far more difficult to overcome.  Many governing bodies are moving in this direction anyway by ensuring that women are represented on boards.  Some governing bodies have women as presidents, which is a very good thing.  That has been happening for the past number of years.  It is a matter of making sure that we give it the time, which is really the issue, and that we move in that direction.</p> <p>  The Minister, Deputy Shane Ross, and the Minister of State, Deputy Patrick O'Donovan, have raised this issue and it is being debated.  It is high on everyone's agenda, and it gives everyone time to think about it and act upon it.  Keeping the issue on the agenda and raising it is very good because we all need to ensure that we have good corporate governance.  Having females on boards is definitely adding to the quality of board representation.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.687" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Keane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#H01700"><p>To add to that, I have been on boards where there has been a conversation around term limits, for example.  It seems to make sense to everybody when we look at it.</p><p>However, when it means people can be told they cannot be on the board next year they see it differently because it suddenly becomes real and affects them personally.  Sport is part of our identity in this country, so it is more than a job for people.  Whether one is a paid professional or a volunteer in Irish sport, it is a part of who one is and there is a passion involved in it.</p><p> To see where we struggle in Irish sport, one can take the example of a fire.  Either the fire is dying out because people are just saying "Pathetic", or the fire is going out of control because people are too fervent about it and not practical in terms of what it is really about.  That is the real challenge.  Often it is the people who have to put themselves out who are voting it in, or not.  To use a terrible clich&eacute;, it is the turkeys voting for Christmas who are involved in changing the governance.  From a resourcing perspective, therefore, the training seminars currently being done by Sport Ireland are important.  A lot of this is individual support to governing bodies, so how does the chief executive work with the board?  How does the chairperson talk to the board about it?  How can one educate, persuade and explain to the membership why it is good?  If one goes tells members' governing bodies they need independent directors on the board they will sense that somebody who is not part of their sport is going to take over and make all the decisions.  They may ask what they know about it as they are not from the sport.  Those are the challenges one is facing.  They can be overcome for sure, but it requires a real effort and also resourcing to help people to do it.</p><p> It is the same around the female side of things.  In many cases what is happening in business by trying to get more women involved in decision-making and leadership positions, is happening with mentoring support.  They are given individual mentoring support and when they go for a job they do so on their own merit.  Whether they are male or female they go for it on merit, but they are given support to put themselves forward and prepare for it.  That requires time, effort and resourcing.  The idea of just putting a female athlete on the board goes against everything that is right about boards in terms of competencies and skill-sets.  We go against good governance if we put people into positions without having the right skill-sets.  That is our fundamental principle.</p><p> Diversity includes young and old, as well as different cultural backgrounds, although the focus on gender is highlighted.  Only last week, a report on women in sport was published, and we are failing around the world on this issue.  It is good that it is on the table for consideration at this meeting.</p></speech>

It is in the policy from the Department that Sport Ireland is implementing on a regular basis.  That is why the comply and explain piece, which happens around the world, is important.  It is not a case of someone saying, "I'm on the journey but the journey takes 20 years and nothing ever really happens".  It has to be more definitive in terms of targets.  If there are 50 principles in the code and one is doing ten, is it ten per year?  If so, one would have done 50 in five years.  Or is one doing two per year?  In that case, it would take 25 years to do it.  That is why the detail of Sport Ireland's role is important.</p></speech>

We came home with some very good results.  I remember watching television one evening and seeing an Irishman in the diving finals.  It was a great achievement.  I am also a big supporter of the cyclists.  We did not come home with our weight in gold, but I will come back to the earlier question.  In his closing remarks, Mr. Galvin made a good point concerning sports policy, public health promotion, social integration, cultural identity, education, job creation and building relationships with the new Irish.</p> <p>  I want to ask about gambling, which has become interlinked with sport.  Young people have told me that it is getting out of hand, especially with the use of mobile phones.  One can sit down on a Saturday afternoon in the company of a few hundred people who may not know one is on the phone gambling big time.  It is a concern that young people, including teenagers, are getting caught up in gambling.  What can we do about it because they do go hand in hand?  A bet is a bet, be it on horse racing, athletics or matches.  Where do we stand as regards addressing the issue of gambling?  What regulations do sporting bodies have to give us in order to make a start?  Sometimes one can see that it is even arising among players.</p></speech>

NGBs and all the stakeholders involved need to take responsibility for informing participants in their particular disciplines about the negative impact of the ills of gambling.  The central point should be educational front and centre in order to get the appropriate messages out to people who suffer from the ills of gambling.  Rather than simply focusing on sport, including the national governing bodies and LSBs, it is a much wider societal issue.  It requires a more wholesome approach rather than simply putting it in the sports centre basket to resolve that issue on its own.</p></speech>

Our IRFU colleagues are currently trying to get the rugby world cup here, but could we try to get other events, including athletics, in future?  We all focus on the European football championships but we do not hear anything about having the world boxing championships or the European athletics championships.  Are we working on those areas at all?</p></speech>

I have already outlined some of the structural advances that have taken place.  Last December, the first event that took place in the National Indoor Arena was an international badminton competition which I attended.  It attracted considerable attendances from overseas.  That was a most positive start for the National Indoor Arena.  We also have an international standard cross-country track on the National Sports Campus, which will attract further events to Ireland in the coming years.  We work closely with Event Ireland with whom we are partnered.  They provide services to national governing bodies who have the goal of attracting international events to Ireland.  While some of these happen below the radar, there is an increasing demand for international events taking place here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.695" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Treacy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#J00800"><p>To add to that answer, we fund governing bodies of sport.  As part of that funding programme, if they have an event during the course of the year they will apply to us for funding.  Many of those organisations are small, so we might provide 50% of funding, which may be only &euro;5,000 or &euro;10,000.</p> <p>  As Mr. Galvin said, the new National Indoor Arena opens up a whole world of indoor sports that we can host.  As regards the cross-country track at the National Sports Campus, Athletics Ireland is going to bid for the European championships in 2020.  In addition, Sport Ireland is funding the Irish Open golf tournament, which is strategically a very important event for the country.  Golf is an important sport.  We also walk hand in hand with F&aacute;ilte Ireland to bring events to Ireland.  We have an ongoing dialogue with them, so there are things we can do together.  If F&aacute;ilte Ireland is coming in with major money for an event, we leave them at it, but we tend to look after funding smaller sports.</p></speech>

For example, one must have a certain amount of bed-nights for certain sized governing bodies and events.  Some of the international federations require host fees to be paid by the national federation.</p><p>In this context, there have been discussions with the Department around the specific criteria for support for events.</p></speech>

The Special Olympics was a fantastic event and we have hosted the Ryder Cup.  We have put in a very strong bid for the 2023 Rugby World Cup and this year we are holding the Women's World Cup.  The facilities, and our capacity to attract these events and to put them on, are there.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.699" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1431" speakername="P&aacute;draig &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#K00300"><p>I want to focus on the big picture but I will dive down a little bit to tie it all together.  I see incredible passion in every one of the witnesses and that is very powerful.  It is not surprising in the sports industry because that is part and parcel of what they do.  I also perceive a certain degree of frustration at not being able to achieve the levels they want to achieve and which they believe Irish athletes can achieve.  The two areas I will deal with are high performance and overall engagement participation rates.  Both are joined at the hip because when a county wins an all-Ireland, Connacht wins the PRO12 or when people like John Treacy achieve what they achieve it lifts a nation, a region or a county like nothing else in our society.  It brings positiveness in a way that is unique.</p> <p>  Funding levels have been cut since 2008.  Sport Ireland has invested &euro;34 million in high performance since London 2012 and invests &euro;8.5 million per year but that is 20% of what New Zealand invests.  We have finite resources and that will always be the case because we are a small country of 4.5 million people.  It is not about throwing money at this, rather what is most important is how we spend that money.  The questions asked by Senator O'Mahony were about value for money.  Do we have joined-up thinking?  Are there internal conflicts which cause issues that restrict us in achieving what we want to achieve?  New Zealand has a similar population to us but spends &euro;42.8 million per year while we spend &euro;8.5 million.  Britain sent 366 athletes to Rio and we sent 77.  In Rio we ended up in 62nd place but in London we were 41st.  Denmark has 5.7 million people and got 15 medals in Rio while we got two and New Zealand got 19 with a similar population to ours.</p> <p>  There are disjoints in a couple of areas.  One is in finances and the other is 20 years ahead, as Ms Keane mentioned earlier.  All we can do is try to bridge the gap.  It is important to drill down to see what we are doing.  What is the execution plan to help us to achieve that?  Do the witnesses have information on overall engagement and participation rates?  These are critically important and my sense is that more and more old fellows like myself are togging out and doing jogging or rowing, which I started about two years ago and in which there has been huge growth.  Hamish Adams and others in Rowing Ireland are doing phenomenal work in that space and there are now 5,000 people in recreational rowing, with 3,000 in competition.  Part of it is because of what the O'Donovan brothers achieved but it has been swelling up for a long period of time.</p> <p>  A study by Sheffield University last April made some key findings.  It found that, from an overall health point of view, participation in sports and exercise at moderate intensity in adults reduces the risk of breast cancer in active women by 20%.  That is incredible.  The value to be gained in bringing overall well-being and health to the nation, as well as a general feel-good factor, is very much underestimated.  The study also found that for every &pound;1 invested in sport by the Government in 2013 and 2014, some &pound;3.15 in social impact was generated.  It is difficult to measure the social return on investment but these guys have done so and the return is powerful.  I support the witnesses 100% but I have been to three Olympic Games as a mentor to athletes and I am concerned about some of the internal issues there are, as well as some of the frustrations the athletes feel.  The funding they get is so much lower than other people on the track, in the pool or against whom they have to box.  They are very dependent on family for finance and on corporates and business.  Both of those step up to the plate in that regard but it is necessary because there is a gap in Government support.</p></speech>

We have tried to keep the high performance systems going but is about leadership in that space.  As Deputy O'Mahony said, it is about having high performance people to direct the programme and ensure we get value for money.  We are very tight with the sports governing bodies and they have detailed performance plans, on which Mr. McDermott will comment.  We know where the spend goes and that there is no wastage and we get as much out of the system as we can.  Many of the countries Senator &Oacute; C&eacute;idigh named have been in the high performance business for much longer than we have but the institute has certainly kicked on.</p> <p>  On the question of whether everything was joined up, it is a lot better than it ever was.  I was before this committee in 2009 with the OCI and things were not as joined up at that time.  We get value for money in high performance but we need to kick it on further with more investment.  Rio was expensive and some of the sports are carrying a deficit from it.  Sailing is one such sport and there are one or two others because it was so expensive.  Governing bodies for other sports are emerging such as hockey, which now has two teams which are very close to qualification.  Sending a team to Rio is very expensive but a team adds a whole new dimension to the Olympic experience for all the other athletes and this is hugely important.  We got a fantastic return in terms of places in the top 20.  We did not get the medals, though, because of the boxing programme.  We had anticipated three medals but we got some really bad judging decisions.</p></speech>

For example, we continued to support hockey when it was not so successful but it was a huge breakthrough for them and the Irish system that we had a team in Rio and it performed exceptionally well.  The women's team were the width of a post away from qualifying and had a exceptional result last week, with a brilliant win leaving them top of world league 2 and in line to qualify for world league 3.</p><p>They will have a great run at Tokyo.  They are squads of 16 people.  They are based on wider squads of 24 and 28.  That is about 56 athletes in one sport, which does not have a huge resource.  </p><p> As we go up, and as these systems get better, swimming, athletics and cycling, which was referenced earlier, have more athletes.  These sports all have very strong and improving performance systems.  What they are doing, as they should, is producing more and more athletes.  There is a greater resource as one goes up the chain.  We do have oversight on the money and we do try to make sure that the money is well spent.  There have been an awful lot of medals, not only at the Olympics and the Paralympics, but in between.  We averaged 60 medals per year on supported programmes in the last number of years.  Before these programmes were in place the number was about 20 a year. </p></speech>

National federations in other countries appear to focus on particular sports for high performance.  For example in the UK, the national wheelchair rugby team was ranked sixth in the world.  Just before Christmas the total funding was dropped.  They are getting zero.  I know there is a balance there.  I would like to get Mr. McDermott's view on where he sees the balance from an Irish perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.704" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul McDermott" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#L00300"><p>We will have to have increasing focus on those programmes which will deliver medals.  It is a competitive process.  When people come in for funding it is competitive.  If a sport is not delivering we have to look at their funding and if a sport is growing we have to try to resource it.  It is very tough to make those strategic decisions and to effectively reduce or close programmes or disappoint athletes.  It is easier to do it if there is an increasing resource.  It is very difficult to do it with a static resource, and to take from one programme to give to another.  That is a very difficult choice for us to make, but if we have to make those choices we are not afraid to.</p> <p>  We are starting the Tokyo cycle.  We have investment principles agreed with the board of Sport Ireland.  We are going to talk to all the sports and all the stakeholders. If the resource is at that level, in order to get the biggest return on that investment we will have to be more focused.  We accept that.  This point has been made a number of times, and we accept it.  We work constantly, daily, with the sports, with Paralympics Ireland, with the institute and with the service providers to make sure that the athlete is at the centre of the system and that everyone is working together for that athlete, that coach or that team.  In order to generate best performance one has to make sure that everybody is dealing with the one plan.  We have made significant strides.  The fact that a lot of athletes are based at the institute in Abbotstown and the National Aquatics Centre has helped enormously because it gives visibility.  We have additional plans to strengthen that system and to put more people from our side on the ground.  We have the institute's service providers on the ground.  The Senator is right to raise the point, because it is a performance issue, but we are working on it and we have pushed very considerably in recent years to get it right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.705" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Una May" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#L00400"><p>The Senator is right and the Sheffield research supports many of the findings on what participation in sport and physical activity can deliver for society on the whole.  The delivery of the national physical activity plan last year was a very big step in that direction.  It is a joint plan between the Department of Health and our own Department.  This demonstrates the degree to which its value is shown and recognised.</p> <p>  Some 4% to 5% of the population participate regularly in sport.  The number has been increasing.  We are looking at the type of participation and what activities people are doing.  We are supporting activities that are seeing an increase.  We are seeing drop-off rates from young people as they transition into different phases in their lives and how they participate more in individual sports.  The like of swimming, running and cycling are all very popular.  We have been investing in those sports.  </p> <p>  The other big concern we have is around the social gradient.  The finance we have received through the Dormant Accounts Fund has allowed us to target many programmes directly at people who are disadvantaged, be that socially, economically or physically, through disability for example.  We have invested a lot of money to look at new models.  </p> <p> Mr. Treacy alluded to the significant monitoring and evaluation that we carry out on any programme we fund and any new initiative we introduce.  We are looking to see what the outcomes of those programmes are, not just the outputs and not just how many people participate, but whether we are having the impact we want to have.  Then we can evaluate whether these are programmes which can be rolled out at a bigger level.  We have had some phenomenal success in some initiatives, for example in running we have the fit for life and the park run initiatives.  </p> <p>  We have worked closely with other bodies.  We work closely with and are increasing our engagement with the likes of Ireland Active on the increasing popularity, particularly for women, of personal excercise, that is, gyms and exercise classes and those kinds of activities.  We are also doing a lot of work with the national governing bodies.  Again with the help of the Dormant Accounts Fund, we are helping to build the capacity of national governing bodies, who would have traditionally been established to deliver sport for their members.  We are trying to get them to recognise that they have the capacity and the power to deliver a greater social good for Ireland, not just for their own members and to help them to build their capacity and increase participation.  This is a big ask for them in some cases because that is a shift from their focus, which is providing sport for their current members.  What we are trying to do is see significant increases in membership.</p></speech>

If we look at 2016, more than 14,000 secondary school students participated in Rowing Ireland's get going, get rowing programme.  The 2016 GAA c&uacute;l camps attracted 127,000 participants.  Swim Ireland passed the 10,000 mark in the number of participants in their swim for a mile.  The statistics show there are huge numbers benefiting from physical activity and organised sport.</p> <p>  There is one area that needs to be addressed as a priority.  That is PE in the national school curriculum.  UCD research indicates that only 20% of children get the minimum amount of physical activity in national school.  If we want to develop a society where children have the fundamental motor skills and physical literacy skills required to develop throughout their lives, to complement them both physically and psychologically, we need to address it at the earliest opportunity.  That is among our four and five year old children, rather than later on in life when this has become a fundamental issue for people.  If anything is to come out of this forum it should be the need to address and tackle issues physically and emotionally, coming back to Deputy O'Keefe's comment around gambling.  We need to do so at the earliest opportunity in our education system.  I am not foisting all of this on our teachers.  It requires a holistic approach from coaches and from development officers in national governing bodies, but also within the education system.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.707" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Sarah Keane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#L00600"><p>Can I just add to some of the comments?  In terms of high performance and the idea that when there is no more money we should halve sports, that is a valid discussion to have.  However, we are very young as a high performance sporting system.  If we do that now, we may be making the decision too soon in terms of the potential for sports.  We need to be very careful about doing that at this point.  The tiering is starting to happen informally.  It is a competitive process and I am part of it so I understand that.  It may be that it becomes more formal over time but it needs to be done as part of a planned process, ultimately as part of our vision for Irish high performance sport.</p> <p>  I will give an example of the challenges because some members have asked to get into the detail.  Our sport of swimming had a national performance director, because that is the model we were all following in the last cycle, but we could not afford to have a national head coach.  We had a person trying to do both roles.  We made advances in our sport for sure.  We had our best results in 20 years in the 2016 games, but we will not reach the medals unless we split those roles and unless we have that relevant support.  We are doing that now, but in order to do it with no extra money we are going to have to cut the amount of exposure and the number of camps we can give our athletes.  We have decided we have to.  They are the decisions we are being faced with when there is no extra funding.  We are making decisions with what we have and we are accountable for what we have, but is that really the best way forward in terms of achieving at the highest levels of world sport?  It is not.  </p> <p>  The other point I would make is that we have indigenous sport here and we have international Olympic sport.  We are almost putting them against each other, because we are announcing pots of funding here and there.  If that is additional funding, fine.  If it is not additional funding, it comes from somewhere else.  Then we are almost pitting people against each other as opposed to all supporting each other as part of one nation.  That is very important.  There is a sense of that within Irish sport, that there is more and more happening, and more and more promises being made.  Even if one takes the campus, great things are happening there but unless the funding increases it comes out of another pot within Irish sport. </p></speech>

It relates to indirectly or inadvertently supporting the silo mentality of "I have to look after my sport".</p></speech>

I do not want to go over old ground because the witnesses have answered most of the questions succinctly.  We all know the extraordinary power of sport and how it heals wounds and brings people together in the best and worst of times.  We have an extraordinary ability in Ireland to celebrate success.  I think of the Taoiseach of the time going out to hug Stephen Roche on the <i>Avenue des Champs-&Eacute;lys&eacute;es</i>and the Jack Charlton homecomings despite coming third or fourth so we love success and I think we need more success.  I was chairman of the British Irish Parliamentary Assembly and Chairman of the Oireachtas Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  We see how under the Good Friday Agreement, people in Northern Ireland can choose Irish or British citizenship.  It is an international Agreement agreed by the British and Irish Governments and a multi-party agreement in Northern Ireland.  There is a lot of parity of esteem under the Good Friday Agreement.  It is not just a one-way street but should be a two-way street.  I mention this because I think we should look at the Irish team participating in the Commonwealth Games.  There are already moves under way so that an Irish hockey team and possibly a rugby sevens can participate in the next Commonwealth Games.</p><p>We should look at making many of our facilities such as the Sport Ireland campus available for the 2021 Commonwealth Youth Games in Northern Ireland.  Sport Ireland has a national rowing centre at Lough Rynn.  These are things we need.  Is Sport Ireland looking at these aspects?  I remember the huge divisions when the Republic of Ireland went to play in Northern Ireland in 1993.  What happened in France involving Northern Ireland supporters and Republic of Ireland supporters last year was incredible.  This is something we need to build on.  It may not come from the political side because sometimes politicians are behind the curve but I see it on the ground and I think we need to look at this.  People walk around with Manchester United, Celtic and Liverpool jerseys.  We now need to look at participation in the Commonwealth Games.  I understand that various organisations will resist it but what is the view from a sporting and logistics perspective?  It probably need sextra funding.  What is the view in terms of the good it could do from an all-Ireland perspective because Gaelic games, cricket, hockey, rowing, rugby, basketball, golf and many other sports operate on an all-Ireland basis?  What are the witnesses' views on this observation?</p></speech>

It is definitely beyond my pay grade.  We work hand in hand with our colleagues in Sport Northern Ireland and have always had a great relationship with them.  The Good Friday Agreement has been very good for sport, certainly for Ireland.  We have free movement of athletes.  Ireland has definitely benefitted from the Good Friday Agreement with many people born in Northern Ireland competing for Ireland, which is fine.  They have a choice.  They can compete for Great Britain if they so choose.  It has given people their rights so it has been good.</p> <p>  We will work closely with Sport Northern Ireland as it prepares its team for the Commonwealth Games and we will fund many of the athletes who will compete in those games and we are happy to do so.  It is very important to say that.  We are all involved in sport and all have the same objectives and goals.  Our high performance committee met yesterday and a representative from Sport Northern Ireland attended and shared information in terms of who they were funding going forward.  We certainly welcome anything the National Sports Campus can in terms of hosting events.  We will be proactive in making sure we are bringing events into Ireland.</p></speech>

For example, there is a UK Sport schools event in five sports, including swimming.  Originally, only athletes from Northern Ireland were invited to participate but swimming now sends an all-Ireland team.  This event is funded by the UK Government.  Smaller events are happening that are supporting the all-island side of things.  Quite a number of the programmes within the organisations are all-island so from that perspective, a team that goes to the Commonwealth Games is prepared by the all-island personnel - the national performance director of the team - so it is fully supported.  There are athletes and coaches who want to represent Northern Ireland.  They feel that sometimes it is their only opportunity to represent Northern Ireland.  They are still very proud to represent Ireland on other stages.  This factor needs to be considered.  Most of the athletes with whom we work are, as Mr. Treacy noted, supported by all-island personnel and systems.</p></speech>

I was surprised when he stated that the implementation of the code of governance is an extra cost which some organisations are having difficulty absorbing.  I put it to him that proper governance is critical to the correct running of the any organisation and can never be seen as a cost that an organisation should have difficulty absorbing.  Is Mr. Galvin satisfied that there are no issues relating to codes of governance in the organisations the Federation of Irish Sport represents.</p> <p>  I welcome his comments on gender quotas.  Does Mr. Galvin have figures for the current gender balance on the boards of organisations represented by the Federation of Irish Sport?  On a positive note, I wholeheartedly agree with his suggestion that at least two hours should be devoted to providing sport or physical activity in schools.  Is the Federation of Irish Sport engaging with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills on this matter?  We mentioned the amount of money that is being spent to combat obesity in this country.  An opportunity is there at the moment.

The national physical activity plan is a cross-departmental plan that was launched by the Government last year.  Dr. May and I are members of the implementation working group.  The plan is a key pillar in addressing some of the issues raised, specifically obesity and getting as many people as possible active.  However, activity is only one part.  There is also a need for an educational awareness programme on overeating and such matters.  Sport is not the answer to all of the social ills across the State, although it certainly has an important role to play.  We will play that role, with the national governing bodies and local sports partnerships, to increase the level of physical activity and create as many programmes as possible to encourage people to participate.</p></speech>

Some of the organisations are extremely small and might have one professional staff member or none at all.  Therefore, their ability is curtailed in implementation of the governance code and they may need external advice.  As a result, a cost accrues.  That is one of the challenges being faced.</p></speech>

One can look at those tables and see who is doing well and who is not, in terms of developed nations with high <i>per capita</i>GDP.  The issue in any of these things, including medal tables, is that when one looks further down the table and one is talking about two to six medals, one performance or one athlete winning a couple of medals can really throw the table off.  If it is looked at over time, we have to accept that <i>per capita </i>GDP is a very strong indicator of performance.</p></speech>

Is the Olympics still the pinnacle?  Is it still what it always was and what it was meant to be?</p></speech>

For athletics it is every four years and it is the pinnacle of our sport.  We recently saw golf becoming an Olympic sport, and despite the fact that we had a lot of golfers deciding not to perform, it was really a magnificent tournament in Rio.  It was a great success, and it became a really important event.  Justin Rose got great satisfaction in winning it.  Soccer is generally played at under 23 level, and the World Cup is the premier event.</p></speech>

Looking at over 35s and over 50s, for men and for women, and also disability team sports, is enough being done or can more be done?  I know it is easy to say that more should be done, but it seems that it is almost culturally accepted that once someone gets to his or her mid-30s, he or she stops playing team sports.  I think that is a pity because we are conditioned to participate in team sports from a very young age, yet when it comes to the mid-30s, people have no other avenue to do that.  Is that something that is being worked on within your organisation?</p></speech>

I think it is reasonable to say that at some point we need to articulate a vision for physical activity in sport.  Countries such as New Zealand and Finland speak about being the most physically active nations in the world.  In terms of the national physical activity plan, I think we need to start working towards that sort of a vision.  In terms of transitions into and out of sport, the reasons are myriad and complex.  It would appear from the research that the pinch point, or that point at which most people drop out of sport, is the point at which they leave secondary school education, for a variety of reasons.  Then there are issues around girls and young women staying in sport, again for a variety of reasons.  There is some research now which is showing that older people are becoming more physically active through a variety of sports, and the two sports that have been identified as being the most consistent in terms of participation throughout an individual's life cycle are swimming and cycling.  In order to increase and maintain participation in sports, we need to look in an innovative way at how sports deliver their programmes.  The traditional approach to particular sports does not have to be maintained.  Perhaps the sports could be modified to make them more attractive.</p></speech>

The research shows that what people are interested in past a certain age is individual sports.  That may be because of family commitments, or the difficulty of trying to get a group of people together.  They can do individual sports early in the morning or late at night.  The research is not showing barriers around team sports, but rather that the preference is around individual sports after a certain stage.</p></speech>

It has moved from that to a mandatory adoption of the code.  It is going in that direction.  As Ms Keane says, there are a lot of pieces to it.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.820" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Hernan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#Q00300"><p>I thank the Chairman and members for invitation which gives us the opportunity to update them on the serious financial difficulties that Bus &Eacute;ireann is facing at this time.</p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is committed to being the key provider of public transport services outside Dublin in close partnership with our stakeholders.  We are the biggest provider of regional and rural transport in the country, connecting many rural and urban centres, and in doing so are supporting the Government's objective of fostering balanced regional economic development.</p> <p>  I only recently joined Bus &Eacute;ireann and I have been surprised by the complexity and the scale of the logistical operation that is delivered to the public each day.  Last year, my 2,600 colleagues directly employed and 7,000 indirectly engaged with us carried an average of 110,000 passengers per day on a fleet of over 600 buses across 60,000 locations.  In addition 114,000 schoolchildren are brought to and from school each day on a fleet of 4,500 buses.</p> <p>  I am proud to say Bus &Eacute;ireann has been providing this pivotal role for the 30 years since it was founded in 1987.  Our anniversary is on 7 February, which is not far away.  In 2016, we increased our passenger volumes by almost 6%, equating to an additional 2 million passenger journeys, which was the strongest growth of all public transport companies.  However, this passenger growth did not deliver an improved financial performance, but actually higher losses.  As a consequence of this, I wrote last week to our staff formally advising them that the company's finances are now in a critical state and that the company will be insolvent in a short period of time unless drastic and decisive action is taken.  To do nothing would mean all of the company, not just Expressway, will go out of business and as a consequence all jobs will be lost.  This is not scaremongering; this is the stark reality of what this organisation now faces.</p> <p>  As acting CEO, I want to assure the committee, our customers and staff that my immediate priority is to lead the company out of this financial crisis.  Over the past ten days, I have outlined measures that are required to make our company more cost effective and efficient which, I believe, will deal successfully with the immediate risk of insolvency while also ensuring the long-term future competitiveness and sustainability of the company.  I am confident that this can be achieved with the support of my staff, their representatives and key stakeholders to implement the measures announced last week.</p> <p>  A number of factors have contributed to our crisis and I would like to address those here.  Losses in the order of &euro;8 million to &euro;9 million for 2016 will mean our total reserves are now depleted to approximately &euro;7 million, which is less than one year's reserves at the current run rate of losses.  Costs are increasing at a faster rate than revenue growth, driven by both payroll and non-payroll categories.</p> <p>  The competitive landscape is also changing.  Customers expect more for a reasonable price, more routes are being put out to public tender and additional licences are being issued on existing routes.</p><p>As an organisation, we must accept that there will be more competition.  Competition is good for the consumer and is good for us too.  Competition ensures that businesses remain agile, customer focused and also cost focused.</p><p> In the context of the above, I have already commenced a root and branch review of all operational structures and every cost driver.  Savings need to be achieved, to reduce our existing cost levels but also to compensate for cost inflation including projected increases in insurance claims, higher fuel costs and upward pressure on pay.  My management team will be working hard during the next few weeks to finalise the most efficient structures and staffing numbers required to provide our services.  Improved staff rostering and better utilisation of our fleet will provide the foundation for delivering a more efficient business that is capable of competing for all new tenders and contracts, and enable us to aggressively defend our position on existing commercial routes.</p><p> Expressway will continue to be an integral part of our business.  The losses in Expressway, however, cannot be reviewed in isolation to the rest of the company.  All of Bus &Eacute;ireann&rsquo;s businesses are tightly interlinked and as a consequence the solution to Expressway's financial difficulties can only be achieved as part of an overall company-wide solution.  As a commercial entity, Expressway is restricted from receiving state aid.  It has been made clear that Government cannot provide funding for these services; to do so would be in breach of EU laws on state aid.</p><p> An increase in free travel subventions has also been suggested as the way to fix Expressway.  I strongly disagree.  The challenges faced by Expressway can only permanently be fixed by addressing the cost inefficiencies and inefficient operational structures that exist within the company as a whole.  Free travel did not cause our problems and an increase in revenues for such services will not fix all our problems.  I note our former CEO had written to the Department of Social Protection before Christmas on this matter and I will follow this up in due course.</p><p> I wish to make it clear that my management team and I are not bluntly targeting our staff to fix the financial problems that exist within our organisation.  As stated earlier, all structures and all cost drivers, including existing management structures, are being challenged and reviewed.</p><p> My undertaking to staff is that Bus &Eacute;ireann will safeguard basic pay and seek to protect the maximum number of viable jobs.  However, I also want to make it clear that significant opportunities for improved efficiency and cost competitiveness exist and are within our own control.  We are focussed on delivering a long-term solution, not a short-term fix.</p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann is committed to providing a safe and sustainable public transport service to all communities outside Dublin in partnership with its stakeholders, and to this end we must now ensure the following.  First, we need to engage urgently with our staff and unions to agree that measures must be taken in the best interests of a secure future.  I have already presented a detailed offer which must be implemented.  I am disappointed that unions declined our invitation to meet yesterday.  I take this opportunity to ask the unions and all staff representatives to as a matter of urgency come to meet us and engage in meaningful dialogue.</p><p> Second, we must work within the level of funding that is made available for public transport and we must deliver more services which are enhanced and progressive, deploying more new fleet and higher customer standards.  The committee should note that in the last 12 months over 200 services were either introduced or improved and further services will be rolled out this year, an example of which is an extension of the Athlone town service from Sunday next.  We must continue to provide a value-for-money service, not only for our customers but also for the State and the taxpayer.</p><p> In terms of our future, Bus &Eacute;ireann must play a central role in Irish public transport.  Our network is a vital asset which we must protect and it is our intention to continue to provide connectivity currently served on our commercial and PSO routes.  We must continually address the viability of all routes and where changes are required for commercial reasons on some Expressway routes we will only do so after full consultation with the NTA, which retains the responsibility for connectivity.  I assure the public that we will do everything that can be done, in conjunction with the NTA, to ensure no passenger is discommoded by any decision made.</p><p> Bus &Eacute;ireann must provide a value-for-money service for both the customer and the taxpayer.  We must be able to compete on service and cost and we must achieve this through improved efficiencies.  It is an opportune time to be involved in public transport.  We are becoming an increasingly commuter-driven society, and congestion is a growing and frustrating daily experience for many.  The need for a credible alternative to the private-car commuter provides an opportunity for Bus &Eacute;ireann to enhance its position as the key party at the heart of public transport.  With an efficient and competitive business model, I believe Bus &Eacute;ireann can thrive and exceed on the expectations of our customers and staff in the future.</p></speech>

I now call on Mr. Seamus Boland, chief executive office of Irish Rural Link, to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.823" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Boland" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#R00300"><p>With the Chairman's permission, I will provide a brief introduction, Ms Lennon will speak about what rural transport means and I will finish with recommendations.</p> <p>  Irish Rural Link, as the committee will be aware, is a national voluntary organisation with over 1,200 community groups which are active members.  These are people who are actively engaged in providing a range of services and development in rural areas right across the country.  We also have a link with our Northern Ireland counterparts.</p> <p>  In terms of transport, since the beginning of the State, rural transport has been a major issue for those living in rural areas.  The establishment of Bus &Eacute;ireann saw the development of a rural transport service and was able to connect people to other areas.  However, it continues to not reach everyone.</p> <p>  Transport remains top of every person's list of grievances when it comes to rural communities.  Irish Rural Link was one of the co-ordinators with The Wheel in the digital switch-over programme.  During that programme we discovered some 93,000 households that do not have access to public transport - we believe the figure is higher but that was merely a factual discovery because we are involved in that programme.  Overall, there were 120,000 people living in rural areas who had no access to public transport.  Many of those households have the free transport pass but, unfortunately, it is not usable.  The fact they cannot use the free transport pass is a major loss to those families.</p> <p>  Lack of public transport impacts both socially and economically on people's lives.  For people who are unable to drive because they cannot afford a car, because of health reasons or because they are elderly, etc., this means almost imprisonment in their own homes for large parts of the year.  In terms of social transfer, Bus &Eacute;ireann receives funding from the Department of Social Protection for the free travel pass.  However, as I stated, people all around the country are still not able to use that pass.</p> <p>  For many years, there have been warnings that Bus &Eacute;ireann and Irish Rail services would be reduced in rural areas.  While not necessarily caused by Bus &Eacute;ireann or Irish Rail, such warnings always issue.  Irish Rural Link is tired of the continuous use of the threat to rural services every time a dispute or a controversy arises in public transport.  We believe it is an obligation of the State to provide public transport.  Services, not only bus services but post office and other services, are always used as the bargaining tool, the threat, the meat in the sandwich.  Irish Rural Link would call on the various parties involved to stop threatening rural communities with this kind of loss of service because this causes fear and worry among ordinary people who use the service on a daily or weekly basis.</p><p> We believe the community rural transport programme has been the Cinderella of transport in the last few years and has lost out heavily in terms of cutbacks and losses in revenue, but the importance of that programme cannot be underestimated.  I ask Ms Lennon to go through why this is so important to so many people.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.825" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Louise Lennon" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#S00200"><p>I will reiterate what Mr. Boland was saying about the role that rural transport plays in combatting isolation for a lot of people.  It is a lifeline for many people that do use it.  Many people think that rural transport is for bringing older people into their local town or village to collect their pension on a Friday, but many other people use it as well.  Younger people use it and in some cases, as one person said, they would not be able to get back into training and employment were if not for the bus.  That goes a long way for keeping younger people in rural areas as well.</p> <p>  The funding for the rural transport programme has increased in the last two years and it is &euro;14 million for 2017, but it is still below what it was intended to be for 2016, at &euro;18 million.  It is carrying approximately 1.5 million passengers a year, so the service is vital for people.  Also, some of the local links have contracts with the Health Service Executive, rehabilitation services and other services.  They are linking into them, and people are dependent on the service to bring them to their hospital appointments.  The importance and value that is placed on it cannot be measured monetarily, because people rely on it so much.  It needs to play a greater role in the overall transport system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.826" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Boland" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#S00300"><p>Before I go into our recommendations, I want to read what a 77 year old woman in east Clare had to say:</p><blockquote>This is my only way of getting anywhere.  I use it every Saturday, without fail, to get my shopping and often on a Friday to get to my doctor.  Without it, I just have to stay at home.  It would take my entire pension to pay for a taxi.  It would be very lonesome without it.</blockquote> <p>In that short statement one can see why it is so important to the average, ordinary person.  It may or may not be profitable for the services, but it is essential under our national remit to provide public service transport.  In terms of recommendations, Irish Rural Link has been involved in advocating rural transport for nearly 25 years of its existence and we have continually asked for the following transport recommendations to be looked at.<br/><br/>We believe that there is a need for an overall transport review to look at making transport services fit for purpose.  Therefore, within that review we want Bus &Eacute;ireann, Irish Rail and the whole private sector to be looked at.  We also, as part of this review, want an examination of the public service obligation.  It may be fit for purpose, it may not be, but we need to review whether it is.  The effectiveness of free transport passes needs to be examined too, with particular reference to the fact that many people living in rural areas are unable to use it because there is no public transport available.<br/><br/>There needs to be a new national transport survey on accessibility of rural transport, to update the information on the level of unmet transport needs in rural areas.  As mentioned during the digital switch-over that we talked about, we believe that there is a minimum of 93,000 people affected by that unmet need.  We believe that it is probably higher.  We want to improve the integration of transport services between local rural transport and the national transport services, including Bus &Eacute;ireann and other services, including health related and school transport services, to ensure full access to public transport and a seamless integration between services.</p></speech>

He said in his opening statement that the company will be insolvent in a short period of time.  Can he elaborate on this and inform the committee what time-frame he is looking at?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.831" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Hernan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#S00800"><p>Based on the projected outcome for the year end of 2016, we will end up with reserves coming into 2017 of &euro;7 million.  Given that we lost between &euro;8 million and &euro;9 million last year, we will be insolvent before the end of this calendar year if that run-rate continues.  That is why I am saying there is such urgency to implement what I regard as a survival plan.</p> <p>  I would also like to highlight, and it is a matter of urgency, that it is not just about potential insolvency by the end of the year.  The other point that the committee needs to appreciate is that our board has fiduciary obligations to sign off on last year's annual accounts around the end of March.  To allow it to sign off and to sign off for Bus &Eacute;ireann as a going concern we need to present a plan that demonstrably highlights that we can turn to profitability in the very near future.  If we cannot, then our board will not be able to sign off the accounts and the compnay as a going concern, and that creates a huge difficulty for the organisation.</p></speech>

What were the losses in the previous years and why was the loss so high in 2016?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.833" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ray Hernan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#S01000"><p>There are a number of factors.  Last year we lost approximately &euro;6 million.  That was originally the projected outcome for this year as well.</p> <p>  One of the key areas of increase in the current year is the level of insurance claims that the company has had to deal with.  Not only have we had increased insurance claims but we have also had increased payouts on those claims as well.  That is something I have already identified as an area that we need to focus on.  We cannot afford to see that escalating for future years, if we get through this year.</p> <p>  There are other costs as well that are increasing at a faster rate than the revenue growth, and unfortunately one of them is bus hire.  This brings me back to the question if we have the most efficient operational structures in place in the organisation to minimise the bus hire costs that we are incurring, and also to minimise the level of overtime that we are also incurring across out staff network.</p> <p>  The solution to this is two-pronged.  We must optimise the utilisation of two key resources.  We need to optimise use of our bus fleet so that we have the maximum amount of buses at peak times, to meet peak demand.  At the moment, we are not meeting that target.  The second is that we must optimise the rostering schedules that we have for our drivers.  That is not being done in the most efficient way to maximise the usage and utilisation of those key people within our organisation.</p></speech>

Every organisation takes an ongoing root and branch approach to trying to deliver more efficiencies.  In the context of our immediate financial crisis, that review will be completed by the end of March.  However, we are not waiting until the end of March to start implementing measures to try to stem the losses.  We announced measures to our staff at the beginning of last week.  We also communicated to the trade unions a number of other measures we need to implement urgently.  I appreciate, however, that these require negotiation with staff representatives.  The announcement we made last Monday week was a list of 11 measures that were part of previous collective agreements and which, for whatever reason, were implemented only in certain areas and not across the whole Bus &Eacute;ireann organisation.  I have basically authorised that these measures be implemented with immediate effect.</p> <p>   We have implemented many other measures, for example, utilising technology to make our buses more fuel efficient.  We have also outlined in greater detail other initiatives that will deliver immediate cost savings. </p></speech>

Bus &Eacute;ireann is not fit for purpose to meet the demands, requirements and expectations of our customers at this point.  It is for this reason that our root and branch review is examining structures and is not confined to trying to find savings.  We are examining our operational structures to ensure we can effectively deliver the service we provide, while also achieving value for money.</p></speech>

The 11 immediate actions advised to staff in the letter all bluntly target Bus &Eacute;ireann staff.  I ask Mr. Herman to explain the reasons these immediate actions directly target staff.</p></speech>

We have already implemented 70 work streams across the organisation to try to achieve efficiencies.  This covers, for example, improving maintenance scheduling for our bus fleet to ensure buses are available at peak times in the mornings and evenings.  Currently, we do all our maintenance during the day.  It is of no use having our buses being maintained in garages and depots during the day when they should be on the roads delivering passengers.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, staff costs account for approximately 40% of our total cost base and this cannot be ignored.  We do not have the most efficient structures and we do not obtain best value for money from our staff structures.  However, we have also identified many other areas which will deliver savings.  It is not only about delivering savings to turn around the current financial crisis but also about placing the company in a much more competitive position for the future in terms of new tenders.  We have already received our first tender for a public service obligation, PSO, route this year, namely, for the Waterford city service.  I want Bus &Eacute;ireann to be able to compete successfully to win that contract.  We will probably be up against national and international competition. </p></speech>

What this means in terms of staff numbers, I cannot say at this point but I will say that we do not have, as part of an initial plan we presented to the trade unions, any intention to provide a voluntary severance package as part of that plan.  Such a package is not in the plan.  If voluntary redundancies are required after the completion of the review, I have outlined what these severance terms would be.  However, this matter is not on the agenda at the moment.</p></speech>

Has the company identified routes that it considers to be unviable?  If not, when will it be in a position to do so?</p></speech>

As a commercial operation, Expressway must stand on its own two feet.  We have identified a number of routes that are causing serious concern in terms of their commercial viability.  However, we are looking at all options to try to minimise the number of routes that may be potentially withdrawn or reduced in terms of frequency, etc.  We have commenced a detailed engagement with the National Transport Authority to ensure that where any service is withdrawn, a credible alterative will be put in place to ensure connectivity is maintained across the whole route network.  I cannot give details of the routes in question because I have not yet finalised the commercial review of the Expressway routes.</p></speech>

We are obligated under the licence from the National Transport Authority to provide a public service to rural communities, which basically means all communities outside Dublin.  We are committed to continuing to deliver this service and to improving it.  I believe Bus &Eacute;ireann can provide more services, rather than reduce services, which Mr. Boland stated is the issue in rural areas.  We can increase services, even with the existing subvention, if we deliver a more efficient structure in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  That will be good for customers and taxpayers because we will provide more services for the same amount of money.</p></speech>

He made a number of excellent proposals which deserve more consideration.  I ask him to elaborate on his view that a new rural transport survey is needed?  Will he also comment on his statement that the NTA and Departments of Health, Social Protection, and Education and Skills have an opportunity to examine the possibility of integrating their transport services to ensure full access to public transport is achievable?  I also ask him to elaborate on his proposal to establish local and county based transport forums.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.849" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Boland" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#RR01600"><p>On the local and county based forums, the level of anger and disengagement about not being consulted at local level is such that people feel extremely disconnected in all sorts of ways when transport issues arise.  The benefit of having a forum on which local communities would be represented is that when services in an area are threatened, the community would have a say in terms of how it could contribute to the solution.</p> <p>  I graciously accept Bus &Eacute;ireann's declaration that there could be more services.  When services have been threatened in the past, including those provided by Bus &Eacute;ireann, one of the major problems has been that the first people hear about it is when their closure is suddenly announced in the media.  This means they have no possibility of engaging with the provider.  The committee should note that the rural charter, which is part of the rural programme announced this week, specifically seeks to have public services and those provided by banks and other private entities engage properly with the community before announcing closures.  This would at least give people an adequate opportunity to contribute towards finding a solution.  What was the second issue?</p></speech>

All of those are stakeholders and contribute to the reality of transport.  For example, the NTA plays a major role in organising.  I know from previous experience that it will have to examine the services to be withdrawn, as it did in Wexford and elsewhere.  It has a fundamental role in regulating transport and ensuring that there is public transport.  Other relevant agencies include the HSE and the Department of Social Protection.  In effect, the latter provides significant subsidisation of transport.  We need a more transparent view of where that money is going, how it is being spent and how it benefits.  It was mentioned that many people do not use these services.</p> <p>  I am sorry, but I missed the Deputy's first question.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. Hernan and Mr. Boland and agree with the latter on a review of the travel pass.</p> <p>  My main focus will be on Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Mr. Hernan stated that the board had a fiduciary duty to act between now and the middle of March, but it also has a legal duty to the welfare of its staff.  Let us not forget that.  Surely the board had a duty in 2015.  Bus &Eacute;ireann had surpluses of &euro;400,000 in 2013 and &euro;7.2 million in 2014.  That was a major jump, but it then made a loss of &euro;5.6 million in 2015.  Surely that was the time for the board to read up on its fiduciary duty and it should not have waited until Bus &Eacute;ireann was, in Mr. Hernan's view, within months of insolvency to start proposing actions on which it claims there is no time for discussion.</p></speech>

They also highlighted that significant cost pressures were coming on board.  Between 2014 and 2015, the significant change that occurred within our cost base was the reinstatement of the pay reductions that were implemented in previous years in order to support the organisation during difficult times.  Amounting to many millions of euro, this resulted in the deterioration from making a profit in 2014 to making a loss in 2015.  It was the main change in our financial circumstances.</p></speech>

It was a temporary solution to get us over a hurdle.  Significantly, competition in the marketplace also changed, which impacted on our commercial routes to some extent.  We had to deal with new competition on routes, which slowed our revenue growth.  Some of the steam was taken out of the revenue line, which placed more pressure on the cost line.  The temporary fix addressed some of that, but we are now back in an environment in which many of those costs that had once been in our favour no longer are.  I am referring to fuel, the level of insurance premiums in the marketplace - members will know what has happened in that regard - and competition.  These three major factors combined to create more pressure and dilute profitability in the past 12 months.</p></speech>

We made it aware of challenges that we may face on our commercial routes and what support we might need from it to provide an alternative mechanism under the public service obligation in order to offset the possible loss of connectivity on the Expressway routes and ensure that, as Mr. Boland said, our rural communities are not discommoded and left without services in future.</p><p>Mr. Kent made reference to the increase in competition.  The Government claims that only eight licences have been issued in recent years and that competition, in the Minister's view, is not really an issue.  How many extra routes or extra services do those eight licences open up and how many are in direct competition with Expressway?</p></speech>

Some might say there is only a slight difference but one difference is that while there were a number of new licences issued there were also amendments to existing licences issued.  When amendments were issued on existing licences some of the operators would have increased their service.  For example, an operator might have been going to a place 15 times a day and would have increased its service to 30 times a day.  That obviously pulls out of it.  While this is good for passengers at both ends, and while they have a wider variety of choice, it means there are a lot more buses going up and down corridors where we are trying to fill capacity.  Our issue is that while we are continuing to deliver our level of service there is obviously some diminishment of the capacity and the cost recovery on those routes.  That is part of the issue.  To a certain extent it is not necessarily about the number of licences but Bus &Eacute;ireann has to recognise that over one quarter of its routes have been directly impacted.  When 25% of our commercial routes have been affected it does have an impact.</p></speech>

We have to play within the rules of the game.  The NTA are acting within the legislation.  If an operator applies for a licence it can get the licence if it is prepared to take on the commercial risk.  We have to accept that this is something that is more inevitable as we go forward and that the prospect of competition could actually increase.  As to whether we are on a level playing field, if we want to seek to expand our services we have the same ability and freedoms to apply for changes if it is within our ability to deliver those changes cost effectively.</p> <p>  With regard to the playing field we are stuck in, the operation of Bus &Eacute;ireann and the commercial part of the services is part of the wider infrastructure within Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Bus &Eacute;ireann has a number of issues that are not within the remit of private operators.  The number of depots and garages we occupy and the number of stations we operate from all add overhead to our commercial business, which would not be within the realm of the private operator.  They all add costs that must be recovered.  Our issue is that we try to recover some of those costs where we can on our fare box and to a large extent we are not the cheapest operator in the market and we do not pretend to be.  We offer good value where we can and we are trying to be competitive on our fares.  At the same time we have a cost base that at the moment is simply too high relative to some of those commercial operators and we have to put ourselves back in the frame in order to compete better with them.

The objective is to maximise the amount of non-payroll savings that we can achieve so that we minimise the impact on our staff and their take-home pay.  The issue that we need to address within our payroll, however, is not the basic pay.  I do not have an issue with the basic pay levels that exist within our organisation.  The challenge, and what causes the higher cost from a payroll perspective for us, are the premia payments that we pay.  That is overtime rates, shift allowances, rota allowances and lunch expenses.  There is a significant amount of these.  We need to engage with the unions to bring us back more in line with what I believe exists in the rest of the marketplace.</p></speech>

I am doing everything in my power to make sure we get this company into a much better operational and structural efficiency perspective.  This would allow me to minimise the potential voluntary redundancies that may arise at some point in the future.  The more I can pull out of all other non-payroll costs the more flexibility it gives me to engage with the staff representatives and the staff themselves.  I want jobs to remain.  I must emphasise that I believe Bus &Eacute;ireann is a premium employer and I am committed to making sure that basic pay is not impacted as a result of this plan. I am committed to maximising the number of viable jobs that remain in this organisation.  That is my ultimate goal in all of this</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.885" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1333" speakername="Imelda Munster" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#V01100"><p>I thank Mr. Ray Hernan and Mr. Seamus Boland for their presentations.  My main focus is on Bus &Eacute;ireann but having listened to Mr. Boland, in his words and his presentation, he has actually got the definition of what a public transport network should be about.  It is about public transport service provision and not profit.  That was my first observation.</p> <p>  I first want to address the ultimatum that was given to workers last week.  In the first instance I found it inflammatory, provocative and very demeaning to workers who did not create this crisis.  According to its correspondence with workers management is seeking to reduce the average pay by upwards of 30%, reduce Sunday premium hours from 100% to 20%, cut out overtime pay which would be gone completely, cut extra pay for shift work and change all drivers current contracts.  It is also seeking to introduce the casualisation of workers by bringing in part-time and casual workers who would be on the minimum wage.  The company also seeks the introduction of outside contractors to be brought in whenever and wherever and entirely at the discretion of the company.  This would leave Bus &Eacute;ireann drivers sitting at home while the company enters into contracts with private operators, casual drivers and part-time drivers all on minimum wage.</p> <p>  The witness said that he sees Bus &Eacute;ireann as a premium employer.  That statement is a farce in light of the correspondence he sent to staff last week.  For a semi-State company to be instigating and implementing a race to the bottom for workers, as outlined in these proposals, is shocking.  The 2% that management had proposed in its correspondence is insulting.  It would be considered an allowance and would not be taken into consideration for the pension.  It is also stated that it would be paid when the cashflow is there.  Staff might never get it.  Those worker have not received a pay rise since 2009.</p> <p>  When is the management going to take responsibility for this financial crisis? Everybody knows that the workers did not create the crisis.  The first factor that contributed to the crisis was the over-saturation of routes but that has been flagged up continually and ignored.  The NTA's licence application, and the criteria or the objectives of it, says that it will take account of demand or potential demand and the services already being provided by the existing bus passenger service.</p><p>The company's actions of recent years have therefore directly contradicted its own objectives.  They have contributed directly to the financial loss in the company.  On the Dublin&ndash;Cork route, seat capacity has grown by 120%.  The seat capacity on the Dublin&ndash;Limerick route has grown by 111%, and that on the Dublin&ndash;Waterford and other routes has also grown.  Between 2011 and 2015-16, the company issued five more licences.  That amounted to 104 services.  How in God's name did the company not think that introducing licence after licence would not have any financial effect on the Expressway service?  A child could see that.  One has to ask whether it was deliberate.</p><p> Let us examine the other aspect of the cause of the financial crisis rather than sticking it on the workers.  In this regard, let us consider the free-travel pass.  The Department of Social Protection contributes 41% of the average fare.  That has contributed to loss-making within the company.</p><p> According to Bus &Eacute;ireann's annual accounts, the company pumped &euro;41 million of its own Expressway funds into the PSO business because of the lack of State funding.  It was said there were losses of &euro;5 million last year and &euro;6 million this year.  The delegates are completely confused about the amount for last year and possibly for this year.  Had the revenue from the Expressway service not been pumping up Bus &Eacute;ireann services because of the lack of State funding, we might not be in the predicament we are in.  The PSO funding has been slashed from &euro;49 million in 2009 to &euro;33 million.  Sticking it all to the workers just does not cut it; management needs to take responsibility itself.</p><p> The press release that was issued some days ago is nothing other than scaremongering.  The delegates have said otherwise.  The company has been repeatedly called upon to engage with all stakeholders.  The Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and the Government have consistently called on the company to engage with all stakeholders.</p><p> In its press release some days ago, Bus &Eacute;ireann stated 2,600 jobs may be at risk.  In saying this, it referred to the entire staff of Bus &Eacute;ireann.  We were told three weeks ago in the Chamber of Leinster House, and through press releases, that the losses incurred for 2016 amounted to &euro;6 million.  Within the space of three weeks, however, that figure has been bumped up to &euro;9 million.  One has to ask whether the facts were wrong three weeks ago when the figure of &euro;6 million was issued.  Why is there such a discrepancy?  The difference of &euro;3 million is approximately 30% of &euro;9 million.  Who got that wrong?  Who is responsible?  Does management not know what the loss was?</p></speech>

Will its allowances be cut, as with the workers?  Since this affects the public purse, what is the salary of the CEO by comparison with the average salary of a bus driver of 20 years?  Somebody asked about the details of the recent severance packages.  Since public money is involved, information should be put into the public domain.  Will the delegates put it into the public domain?</p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann recently hired HR consultants.  What did this cost?  What were the terms of reference of the consultants' contracts?  What is the general expenditure on HR consultants right across the entire CIE group?</p></speech>

That seems a bit strange seeing that they have identified what needs to be done with the workers.  It raises the question as to whether management is keeping the information hidden until it is too late to do anything.</p> <p>  I want answers to all my questions but my main question concerns the fact that we have called repeatedly for all stakeholders to be involved.  Does management agree to set aside the inflammatory preconditions it put to workers and sent to unions last week to allow space for third-party intervention?  If the delegates are genuine and serious, as they say they are, they will realise it is not unreasonable to allow a space to be created for engagement.  Will they commit today on the public record to allowing for third-party intervention and for engagement to begin without preconditions?  If they do not, this will head down only one road, and they know where that road is.  If they do not give a commitment today to engage without preconditions, one can only ask whether this was the plan all along.  If they are sincere and genuine, they should commit on the public record today, given what they know lies ahead.  Perhaps their stance is deliberate but they should prove to me it is not by giving on the public record an absolute commitment to engage in such a way as to allow for third-party intervention without the derogatory, demeaning and provocative preconditions.</p></speech>

I will start by picking up on his comment that his plan that is being formulated does not specifically target staff.  I will come back to an issue that has already been raised because it deserves to be re-raised.  I have had a chance to reflect on it for a number of minutes.  Can Mr. Hernan tell us, approximately if not exactly, the percentage of the cuts or, as he would probably put it, the cost savings he intends to achieve overall that will come from workers' wages and the payroll?</p></speech>

However, as I said on record here earlier, one will appreciate that staff costs represent 40% of our total cost base.  Other costs, non-payroll costs, total 60%.  I am absolutely committed to maximising the recovery or reduction in costs by focusing on the non-payroll aspect.  I want to maximise that so I do minimise the amount of change that is required in terms of staff savings.  I need to emphasise, however, that this is not about trying to go after the staff whom I must later ask to implement the service with a smile.  I am not targeting them in that regard.  The Deputy must appreciate that we are in a precarious financial position.  The marketplace has changed and we have got to prepare ourselves for an open marketplace, which is required under the legislation.</p></speech>

I put it to him that the percentage he is looking for from staff and payroll is far greater than 40%.  In fact, it represents the overwhelming bulk of the changes.</p></speech>

John is a friend of mine and a neighbour.  He has been a Bus &Eacute;ireann driver for many years and has given many years of quality service to the company.  He drives on Sundays and gets double time.</p><p>Under the proposal, he would get basic time plus 20%.  He would lose &euro;96 per week.  He works overtime.  The proposed overtime cuts would result in him losing a further &euro;30 per week.  He drives into the county and is entitled to a meal allowance.  Under the proposals, he would lose a further &euro;10 in that regard.  That is a total of &euro;136 per week.  In the course of a year, this would amount to somewhere between &euro;6,500 and &euro;7,000 and that is after having no increase in basic pay for eight years.  Mr. Hernan might reflect on that and realise that guarantees about safeguarding pay and not targeting staff sound a bit hollow in the context of a &euro;6,500 a year pay cut.  There is talk about competition,.  In effect, however, this is a race to the bottom.</p><p> Mr. Hernan spoke about responsible unions.  Is there a union in Ireland which takes its responsibilities to its members seriously and which would consider accepting cutbacks that are far in excess of any wage reduction proposals put forward by the troika when it was in charge of running the country?  In fact, that is a recipe not just for provoking a reaction from Bus &Eacute;ireann staff but from all public transport staff and, perhaps, all other workers, particularly as a horrendous precedent would be set if Mr. Hernan's proposals are carried through.</p><p> In contrast, we have secrecy in terms of the severance package for the former CEO, Martin Nolan, and the former HR boss, Joe Kenny.

First and foremost, I take my responsibilities as CEO of this organisation extremely seriously.  My priority is to make sure that if any redundancies are to be made, they will be kept to a minimum.  None of us can avoid the situation that exists in this organisation, which is a serious financial predicament.  It is my obligation as CEO to make sure we come up with a credible plan that safeguards the future of Bus &Eacute;ireann not only for this year but long into the future.  I do take my responsibilities extremely seriously.  Severance packages that have been entered into are confidential.  I do not know what they are.  That is the case, as I understand it.  Unfortunately, I am not able to say what was within the agreements.<br/><br/>We engage, as required, with a number of consultants.  We do not have a new head of HR.  We have an acting head of HR.  What we enter into with consultants is on an <i>ad hoc</i>basis or as required.  Any consultancy agreements that we enter into follow normal procurement procedures.  I accept that in some in instances we also get derogations based on exceptional circumstances that are already clearly outlined under State rules.</p></speech>

The Government is trying to distance itself from the issue when, in reality, it has a huge influence on events.  I wish to establish the level of contact Mr. Hernan has had with the Minister, Deputy Ross, since he assumed the position of acting CEO.  I include in that e-mails, telephone calls, conversations and face-to-face meetings.  Could he give us some indication of the level of contact between them?</p> <p>  I have two other questions and I will then conclude.  I suggest that the cuts Mr. Hernan is making are costing Bus &Eacute;ireann money.  I will give a quick example.</p></speech>

On Monday, the 103 from Beresford Place to Rathoath via Ashbourne at 6. 10 p.m., 7. 22 p.m., 8.28 p.m. and 11.32 p.m.  and the Belfast service from Bus&aacute;ras at 11 p.m. were all cancelled.  Most of these services were cancelled in both directions.  Yesterday, the 6 p.m. service to Kells from Bus&aacute;ras, the 4.30 p.m. service to Navan from Dublin and the 5 p.m. service were cancelled.  The PSO will be reduced for services not operated and Bus &Eacute;ireann will be fined for lost kilometres.  I submit that the cuts Mr. Hernan is making in overtime and the other cuts will cost the organisation money.  Could he comment on that?</p> <p>  My final question is if Mr. Hernan could clarify the amount of State funding Bus &Eacute;ireann received last year.  I know it was &euro;49.4 million in 2009.  What was the figure for 2016?  Was it higher or lower than that?</p></speech>

Since I have taken over this position, which is roughly nine days ago, I met the Minister, Deputy Ross, once.  I outlined the seriousness of the situation to him.  I did not get into any details of what we are doing but he understands the predicament.  My chairman has continually kept the Department up to speed on the situation, again, without getting into detail.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-01-25a.935" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1324" speakername="Frank O'Rourke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/TTJ2017012500002#X02800"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  At this point, everything of critical importance has been touched on but it is worth highlighting again the point my colleague, Deputy Calleary, made.  It is extremely difficult to see how a company could get to this point and then all of a sudden press the crisis button, as has happened in recent days and weeks.  I have worked in companies at senior management level for years.  I have engaged with unions and various stakeholders to ensure companies pull through difficult situations in bad times, as we have seen in recent years.  It beggars belief to see how the warning signals were there for a number of years but no proper action was taken until now.  All of a sudden there is a huge crisis and it is either one extreme or the other.</p><p>It is difficult to comprehend.  I am speaking from experience rather than looking in from the outside.</p><p> Other speakers mentioned having a facilitator.  If we are serious about bringing everyone on board to get a positive outcome that protects the staff and the public transport user, we must have facilitators to assist the stakeholders.  We must engage with the staff.  I have done that myself and my experience is that it works well, but the unions, which represent the staff, cannot be ignored.  If we are serious about achieving a positive outcome, given today's information, we must examine all options to bring about that positive outcome and nothing should be excluded.  There is no question about it: if Bus &Eacute;ireann provides an efficient and effective public transport system that connects all areas, both nationally and locally, for instance in my area of Kildare North, it will attract more public transport users.  This has been proven.  In the past 12 months, I have worked with all stakeholders and we have got improved services on the 115 route from Kilcock and the 120 route from Clane servicing UCD.  This has proven successful.  </p><p> I have one further question.  I met representatives of the NTA and we are working towards having improved and additional services on those routes.  Additional services in the morning and evening, which have proved hugely successful, have already been delivered.  Will those additional services go ahead because the 120 Clane to UCD route is at crisis point at the moment?  People are left behind every morning.  Will the additional services be funded and put in place or is everything on hold because of the crisis and the panic button that has been pressed over recent weeks?</p></speech>

Mr. Hernan stated that he does not want to cause unnecessary concern, but he issued a press release recently stating that 2,600 jobs could be at risk.  What about those bus workers and their families who have mortgages to pay?  Mr. Hernan did not seem to be too worried about causing them stress or concern.  To put it mildly, it is unsatisfactory that he is not prepared.  The purpose of bringing in people if they are not prepared to answer questions was questioned earlier.  If he cannot identify the routes that he knows he fully intends to cut-----</p></speech>

He knows what lies ahead by bulldozing ahead.  In the interests of protecting and preserving the workers and the public transport network and services, will he agree to having third party intervention and to engage with the unions and the workers without any preconditions?

We all see the dilemma Mr. Hernan is in, and he seems to have been thrown in at the deep end.  It is ironic that this week the Taoiseach launched a programme for the rejuvenation of our town and villages and spoke about the importance of services being kept in place and here we have the threat of a reduction of services, and more importantly redundancies, in Bus &Eacute;ireann.  Has Bus &Eacute;ireann approached the Government to seek a top-up in funding?  I will base my questions on the document that management gave to staff on 18 January.  It states the Government cannot and will not provide support.  Has the Government been asked to provide support to the organisation?

The cuts have been covered, but I am at a loss because one part of the document states what is in the retirement pension and another part of the document states the pension issue must be addressed by the overall CIE group.  I want clarification on this point.</p> <p>  Mention has been made of sorting out the workers' jobs but has management investigated its own operations at the top, with regard to the fleet itself and the operation of the fleet?  We all appreciate fair competition and private operators being in the game, but are they able to operate on a level playing pitch with regard to buses?  Bus &Eacute;ireann buses must be up to standard with regard to wheelchair access whereas some private operators do not have these facilities.</p> <p>  Bus &Eacute;ireann is spending money on buying new school buses when the buses they have replaced could have lasted for another ten years.  Some of the buses are in use by private operators providing school services.  We are here today because of the loss of routes and the potential reduction in services.  I will give an example of what is proposed in Cork, and other members have mentioned their counties.</p></speech>

We carry 114,000 students to and from school every day.  This service is not under threat, but we do have people who are part of our organisation and approximately 10% of the total number of buses used are driven by our drivers.  I cannot say what those drivers may do, but I have been in close contact with the Department of Education and Skills to assure it we are doing everything in our control to ensure there is no disruption.  It is my understanding that at no point in the past did any engagement or industrial action that may have arisen from a dispute in Bus &Eacute;ireann impact on school services.</p></speech>

However, it is a very important point that, as I said at the beginning with regard to the Expressway service, the solution can only be achieved through savings throughout a significant proportion of our cost base in the organisation, because we share so many services, including school services, PSO routes and the Expressway service.  If we achieve savings, we do so not only for the Expressway service but also for PSO routes and school services.  My view is we will maintain services but we will provide more value for money for the taxpayer.</p></speech>

The Expressway service is a commercial organisation.  EU state aid rules are very clear that it cannot receive any subvention of any type to protect its operation.  With regard to the other two, we have a subvention from the NTA to cover all of our PSO routes and the school services are covered by the Department of Education and Skills.  We cannot get any more income or any type of subvention, state aid or otherwise, for the Expressway service.  However, it is on file with the Department of Social Protection that our previous CEO was concerned about the level of support for free travel.  This is on file in the Department.  As I stated in my opening statement, we will follow up to see whether we can get an increase.  It will not fix the overall underlying problem that exists in Bus &Eacute;ireann.</p></speech>

Every transport operator is being affected by insurance premium increases and claim increases.  They cannot just go back to their customers and stop the service or increase prices.  Surely Bus &Eacute;ireann has a mechanism to overcome this so that given time it will roll over and come back to normality.  Why is insurance a big issue?</p></speech>

We have a situation where our current policy is to self-insure.  This is something I am looking at with regard to whether there are alternative models to protect the organisation from claims that reduce the amount of risk to the company with regard to these claims.</p></speech>

It is a stated fact that buses are getting bigger.  We are engaging in more driver training to ensure incidents do not happen but we do have slips and falls.

If Mr. Hernan does not have time to answer today perhaps he will furnish us with the information.  I can furnish him with a synopsis of comments made by employees of the company on the "Liveline" programme broadcast on 19 January, which raised serious concerns about the implementation of the programme and possible abuse of it.  Perhaps Mr. Hernan will comment on this.  Does he believe this is costing the company money?</p> <p>  Does Irish Rural Link believe people in rural areas where there is no public transport should have an optional monetary payment in lieu of a free travel pass?</p><p>Would it be a positive step?</p></speech>

It is approximately double the national average.  As part of a review we must ask how we can better manage the situation.  It has a direct impact on our cost base and availability to provide the service we are obliged to provide.</p></speech>

Could he categorically find out and correspond with the committee?  It is in the public interest that people would know about those severance packages and the full details of salaries for all executives.  When comparing the salaries of Bus &Eacute;ireann workers with the market, executives and management should also be compared with the market.  Could Mr. Hernan give the committee an analysis of them?  Regarding the fuel and the in-cab telematic system, what is it and why is it being implemented immediately?  Has it been implemented, and if not, why not?</p></speech>

The shareholders were two banks, one of which is no longer with us.  The essential piece of my plan was, "you are getting no more money".  That was the way we had to reorganise.  We achieved a turnaround in that organisation of which I am extremely proud.  We brought our staff with us and modernised an organisation that needed to be changed.  It was successfully sold to a third party.  That was private industry.  I am not talking about privatisation at all.  I am just saying we turned it around, and we did it with the support and engagement of the management and staff as a team.</p></speech>
