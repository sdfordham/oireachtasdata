Apologies have been received from Deputy Marc MacSharry.</p><p>Are the minutes of the meeting of 18 January agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising?  One issue arises regarding the periodic report we published this week, namely, our recommendation that the implications of the review to reopen Garda stations be considered in the context of the 2018 Estimates process.  I propose that we write to the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality forwarding a copy of the report and drawing its attention to the recommendation for its consideration as part of the Estimates process for the Department of Justice and Equality.  I expect the Estimates will be discussed at the joint committee next month.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  While we do not generally submit our reports to other committees, the report included a specific recommendation relevant to the joint committee.  The report has also been circulated to all the relevant bodies and parent Departments.</p><p>There are three categories of correspondence.  The first is briefing documents and opening statements.  Nos. 1030 and 1039 are a briefing and opening statement, respectively, from Mr John O'Sullivan, chief executive and commissioner of the Valuation Office for today&rsquo;s meeting.   Is it agreed that we note and publish them?  Agreed.</p><p> The second category is correspondence from Accounting Officers or Ministers or both and follow-up to committee meetings and other items for publishing.  No. 986, which was held over from last week, is from the Health Service Executive.  It provides a substantial amount of information related to the HSE-commissioned Deloitte report on the cost of care incurred by the service provider in the Grace case.  Is it agreed to note the correspondence?  Agreed.  Do we need to forward it to the commission?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.8" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B00200"><p>It should certainly be forwarded to the commission.</p></speech>

I do not propose that we open new ground on the Grace case given that the commission is up and running.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Members are, however, free to discuss the correspondence, although the committee will not do so formally.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.10" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B00400"><p>Is the commission examining other cases?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.13" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B00700"><p>I propose that we send the documentation to the commission in case it is not aware of some of the information provided.  As I stated, once the correspondence has been noted, members are free to follow up on any issues that may arise in a manner that they believe to be appropriate.  The committee will hand over the issue to the commission as I do not believe we should start addressing new issues related to the Grace case.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.14" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B00800"><p>One of our concerns related to how the report was processed, the relationship between the Health Service Executive and Deloitte and whether the report was influenced by engagements between the HSE and Deloitte or was genuinely independent.  According to the correspondence, a request was made to tone down certain aspects of the report.  The purpose of commissioning an independent report is to ensure there is an equality of power between the persons who may blow the whistle and the relevant organisation.  This is demonstrated in some of the correspondence.  If we are to have confidence that independent reports into the HSE or any other organisation are genuinely independent, this will be an issue.  Some of the correspondence certainly reinforces that view in mind.  This is an issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.15" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B00900"><p>I propose that, in addition to sending the correspondence, we send a transcript of this part of our meeting in order that the Deputy's views are conveyed directly to the commission.  We will send the transcript when it is received in the coming days.  We have stated several times that none of the members accepts that this was an independent report.  It was a report commissioned and paid for by the Health Service Executive, which also set its terms of reference.  The HSE simply outsourced a project to Deloitte.  No one on this committee would suggest it was independent.  It was carried out on behalf of the HSE, rather than being independent of the HSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.16" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B01000"><p>My concern is whether the report fully reflects the position.  While I will not discuss in detail individual items of correspondence, one of them indicates there are two similar cases in litigation.  As we discussed last week, the HSE is moving towards an open disclosure approach.  I do not know if this issue falls into that category.  It is frustrating that money that could be spent on services is being spent on legal fees when matters are brought through a legal process.  I do not know whether value for money will be delivered in this case but the correspondence identifies two similar cases.  If that is correct, I would be concerned that someone who is a ward of court will be in exactly the same position as Grace until such time as court approval is secured for the services he or she may have.  This may well delay some of the services the individual in question needs.  Some of this may fall within the remit of the commission.  However, if there is litigation involved, it may also be a matter that the committee must examine from a value for money perspective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B01100"><p>As a result of last week's meeting, at which we discussed the State Claims Agency and the cost of legal fees, we are in the process of writing to the HSE to seek a progress report on the implications of its open disclosure procedure and how the procedure is working out.  When we receive correspondence on the matter from the HSE, we will have a basis on which to follow through on the points made by Deputy Catherine Murphy.  We have sought information on this policy from the HSE as a result of last week's meeting.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B01200"><p>The reference for the correspondence in question is PAC 32R 986.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B01300"><p>The Chairman's proposal to send the correspondence and transcript to the commission is correct because I do not believe the committee can do more on this issue.  Which part of the transcript will be sent to the commission?  Deputy Catherine Murphy raised an issue regarding an independent report and the Chairman responded with words to the effect that none of us believes it was independent.  Mr. Tony O'Brien, the director general of the HSE, informed the committee that it was an independent report.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.20" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B01400"><p>We disagreed with him.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.21" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B01500"><p>This is important because Mr. O'Brien, as the person in charge of the Health Service Executive, told the committee that it was an independent report, he had taken a hands-off approach to the report and he had no dealings in respect of it.  It has since transpired, however, that his organisation had a large number of dealings on the report.  I understand there are 409 pages showing emails and contacts.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Murphy also raised the issue of an imbalance of power.  If the transcript of our discussion on the Grace case is to be submitted to the commission, it must be noted that this matter came before the committee as a result of the persistence of the whistleblowers who have suffered.  They had to find a value for money angle to bring this case before this committee and its predecessor, which did great work under the former Chairman.  While the Health Service Executive repeatedly contacted Deloitte, the service provider is not allowed to do likewise.  A serious question mark arises regarding the independence of the Deloitte report and any other report commissioned or produced in this manner.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#B01600"><p>The transcript of our comments will be communicated or forwarded to the commission with the documentation we have received.  It will then be up to the commission if it wishes to take the matter further.</p> <p>  No. 1,000, dated 28 December 2017, is from Mr. Neil McDermott of the Higher Education Authority and contains information on expenditure on consultants and legal firms by third level institutions.</p><p>We have also received correspondence, dated 23 January last, from Mr. McDermott confirming that the HEA has no objections to the committee publishing the previous items.  This was before us last week - the level of payments and engagements to the various consultants - and committee members were surprised at how much was involved.  We had been asked by the HEA not to publish it.  We did not accept the rationale for that.  It has now come back stating that it has no objections to the committee publishing and we will note and publish this.  Deputy Cullinane indicated he wants to speak on it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#C00200"><p>I want to relate this to the previous topic.  The Chairman finished by stating that none of us in this committee would accept that the Deloitte report into the HEA was truly independent and other members have spoken about the process.  That process is used repeatedly, not only by the HEA but by other organisations.  At what point do we stop, reflect and look at what level of independence there is when these type of issues arise?  I am not persuaded, for all sorts of different reasons which we do not have the time to go into today, that many of the reports which have come before us were truly independent.</p> <p>  On this issue of the information we received, it would be useful for us to look into the education sphere, particularly the third level sphere, at the amount spent on auditing, consultancy fees, legal fees, reporting, independent reports or otherwise, and then conduct a mapping exercise in terms of which organisations and companies provide the service because we have seen audit companies conducting so-called independent reports into organisations from which they have already received funding to audit.  The function of such companies, as auditors, is to make sure that everything is okay.  If they were the auditors, how can they go in and be truly independent and try to find mistakes?  It is rife with all sorts of conflicts of interest.</p> <p>  Surely the HEA has a role in the significant amount of money that is spent on legal, consultancy and reporting.  There is a massive issue here in terms of governance.  I do not know how much the HEA costs the State but I would imagine it is a great deal and it has a large staff.</p> <p>  I want the committee to come back to this.  I would imagine that more of these roles could be fulfilled in-house.  Is it too quick to outsource much of this at a cost to the State?  That, in my view, is clearly under our remit because it relates to value for money.  It relates to whether or not we have good governance procedures within the third level sector and the HEA and whether the HEA is doing its job.</p> <p>  I propose that we look at that.  Some of this information is relevant and maybe I will write to the clerk to the committee and look for a more detailed breakdown.  There is the auditing, which is the internal audit, and the statutory auditing, which needs to be done by the HEA, and then by the constituent colleges.  The total expenditure by all the third level institutions, the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills on auditing, consultancy and legal is significant.</p> <p>  It would be a good piece of work for us.  There may be lessons to be learnt and recommendations to be made in terms of how we improve, save money, and get better governance and more independent reporting out of it.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#C00300"><p>We are agreed on that.  We will certainly return to this topic, in particular, as part of our review of the education sector.  Deputy Cullinane will send in a note suggesting how we might go about it.  I understand Deputy Kelly has requested additional information on the same topic as well.  If both Deputies send in their views, we will discuss it again.  It is an issue that will certainly raise its head.  I was shocked at the scale of the fees that are being paid right across the board.  That information is now being published.  The next item is No. 1047 from Deputy Kelly in connection with the topic to which I referred.  That is noted.</p><p>Correspondence Nos. 1008 and 1024, held over from the previous meeting, is from the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Paschal Donohoe, providing minutes of the Committee of Public Accounts report on the examination of financial statements in the third level education sector and on the report on the examination of matters relating to financial procedures at the Garda Training College.  The essence of what happened here is that we issued two reports in July last, one on the third level education sector in which there were approximately 40 recommendations and the function of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform is to reply to this committee on its agreement or otherwise with the 40 recommendations in our report.  That is now back before us for consideration as to whether or not we accept what follow through needs to happen.  Similarly, there were approximately ten recommendations in our report on Templemore.  We have a separate item back from the same Minister on that issue.</p><p>I will start with the report on the financial statements.  There is a lot of information in it.  This issue is not yet closed.  Our first report and the reports of the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the timeliness of reporting and many issues.  We have essentially started the ball rolling and the matter is by no means concluded.  I suggest we conduct a brief run through these.  It is the job of the Committee of Public Accounts to see what the Department has said.</p><p>Document No. 1008 is in the name of Mr. Robert Watts, forwarded by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, in response to our report on the third level education sector.  The first topic is a very serious one.  As Chairman, I am taken aback by the response of the Department.  It is wholly unacceptable.  It accepts most of the recommendations but we have to test what it will do about them.  It is an extensive document, all of which we will not read in public, but I want to highlight the following issue.  The first recommendation in our report was:</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends that the Higher Education Authority puts a system in place to monitor and quantify research and administration resources by both the Irish and EU taxpayer which are consumed by institutions in developing commercial Intellectual Property projects.  This is necessary in order to eliminate the current lack of financial information and facilitate an assessment with regard to value for money.</blockquote> <p>We started with Waterford.  The president of Waterford Institute of Technology came in here and stated that this was about the spin-off companies from intellectual property.  He stated its value and that it was great value for the taxpayer, and the amount the taxpayer received from disposing of its relatively significant shareholding when the spin-off company was set up down to the small percent that is left today.  He stated we got great value for money and he was able to tell us how much was achieved by the taxpayer.  I asked what was the cost to the taxpayer of setting up this company and the research and he did not know, so he was bluffing us at best.  I have to say that we took him up on it, asking how he could make a statement that the taxpayer got value for money when he had no concept of the cost that the taxpayer had invested in a State asset.  This is essentially about selling State assets and only knowing the price one achieved with no idea of the cost, that is, what the taxpayer invested.</p><p>It is the only recommendation of the 41 the Minister has not accepted.  I am shocked at this reply.  He states that it is a complex area.  I will read one or two paragraphs only.  The Committee of Public Accounts cannot possibly accept this reply.  That is all I am saying.  The Minister states: &quot;It is...difficult to quantify the exact amount of exchequer funding in research and administration that is allocated within the [higher education institutions] HEIs on commercialising Intellectual Property projects, given the multiplicity of funding streams and national and international collaborative research options available.&quot;  That is exactly what we said - we need to know this.  He then went on to say that the HEA provides funding, Science Foundation Ireland provides funding, Enterprise Ireland provides funding, the Horizon 2000 programme from the EU provides funding in some of these cases, Teagasc provides funding in some cases and the Health and Research Board provides funding in other cases.  Clearly, that is what we want.  We want to know the total funding that goes into these companies from the taxpayer.</p><p>In the Minister's final comment on our request that this information be assembled, he states:</p><blockquote>This complex research funding environment, added to the overlap between teaching and research activities within institutions, means that it is not feasible to ascertain the specific attribution of all the relevant activities and costs that contributed in some way to the commercialisation of a particular piece of research.  However, the steps outlined above will ensure there is greater awareness of the scale of activity and provide for greater monitoring of developments of the sector on a system wide basis.</blockquote> <p>The Minister is saying it is not feasible for the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform to have a system in place to establish the amount that goes into these companies before they are sold off.</p><p>I will throw this open for comment, but first I will make two points.  The Revenue Commissioners have been before the committee and a figure of &euro;600 million is given as the tax credit allowed against corporation tax.  All of the people who apply for that tax credit are able to account, to the penny and the euro and subject to audit, in order to claim this allowance.  If the taxpayer wants to claim research tax credits he or she has to prove it and have it verified.  If the taxpayer, however, is putting money into research and development it is too complex to even add it up.  This is utterly unacceptable.  This approach is one hundred years out of date.</p><p> My second point is that the committee will write to the Department to seek any information on any spin-off projects that are currently being considered for 2018.  The committee has no option but to ask that any further spin-off of State assets is held off until we know how much the taxpayer has invested in those companies before we sell them off.  I am not against the principle of it but we cannot sell State assets on the blind without knowing the value of what we are selling.  It is inconceivable that the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform could send such a letter to the Committee of Public Accounts.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#D00200"><p>The committee knows that I have been raising this issue for some time.  I also brought the Waterford Institute of Technology issue to the attention of the Committee of Public Accounts and we had a very robust exchange with the president of WIT.  I researched the matter when I was looking at the WIT situation and while there is a national policy to govern intellectual property it is actually quite loose.  It struck me that there was an attitude from the Higher Education Authority, HEA, and the Department that the committee did not understand the world of intellectual property and how it works, that we should be hands-off, that it was all very complex - which it may be - and that somehow we were against commercialising intellectual property by simply asking questions about whether the taxpayer was getting value for money.  I was disappointed with that response initially but because we were diligent and we pursued and pressed the matter there are now two reports pending.  We should try to get those reports in to the committee as soon as possible.  This will underpin our approach because the reports have analysed the issue.  One is a global look by the HEA at how intellectual property is governed and managed.  While there is a national policy every institute of technology and university has its own policy and there are clear differences.  We saw this when some of the heads of institutes and universities came to the committee and they had different views on how it all works.  The policies for each institute are different and vary according to the institute; some are better at managing conflicts of interest, some are better at getting a higher stake for the State and so on.  This is obvious.  That is the global report.  There is also the report into WIT, which funnily enough the HEA legal department has been looking at since before Christmas.  I am not sure why there is a delay.  The report has been with the HEA for nearly two months.  We need this report published and we need it before the committee, as well as the global report.</p> <p>  I do not accept the Minister's response because I believe it is feasible to give us the spend, as accurately as they possibly can.  Obviously, it is a complex matter because there are many stakeholders: Enterprise Ireland, Science Foundation Ireland, the HEA and European funding.  There is an awful lot of funding and because there are a lot of funding streams, let us call a spade a spade, we know there are individuals within colleges, institutes of technology and universities - including very senior people who are paid by the taxpayer - who personally benefit from this.  I am not saying it is wrong, but because there is a lot of money attached to intellectual property for institutes and for individuals, along with a huge amount of State investment, I am suspicious and concerned about why we are getting the response we have got from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  The Department of Education and Skills and the HEA were also pushing us back a bit on the matter.  We need to look at it.  The source will be the two reports, which the committee needs to look at.  I am not letting the issue go.  I say this only because I am interested in getting value for money for taxpayers.  I have no difficulty with commercialising intellectual property.  It is of huge benefit to the State and it has been of huge benefit to the south-east with regards to the WIT research.  There are massive benefits but it has to be a level playing field, it has to be fair and the taxpayer has to be protected.  We have to be able to do our job to analyse whether there is value for money.</p></speech>

The education sector requires significant investment.  This is a potential source of investment.  These universities and institutes of technology are a research and development tool but there is a cost to that research and development, in the same way there is a cost to companies when they do their own research and development.  By not counting that cost it means we have absolutely no way of knowing if we are getting value for money or not.</p> <p>  There is also the potential for reputational damage in the future to companies that are spin-out companies if this matter keeps coming back.  It is, therefore, right on a number of levels that we continue on to get to a process and a system where we can actually count what the investment is so we can measure whether it offers value for money.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.29" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#D00400"><p>I support what has been said.  We have also raised this matter as it has come up repeatedly and as we have seen spin-off companies.  In our ignorance we have learned.  We tried to ask questions on the commercialisation of intellectual property.  Deputy Cullinane has said that he has nothing against that.  Personally, at this point I would like an absolute explanation for the ordinary person as to what we are talking about before I express an opinion on whether it is good, bad or indifferent.  What is the commercialisation of intellectual property?  What is there back from that process for the public institution that is funded with public funds?  What is the process and who is pushing it?  What is the return from that process?  We are still in an era where asking questions about institutions is frowned upon.</p> <p>  Lately the Kerry babies tribunal's findings have been in the spotlight.  This is relevant to this matter because it was never discussed in the D&aacute;il.  The report into that case was never discussed in the D&aacute;il in the 1980s.  We are now in the 21st century and have moved to a point where we actually discuss things but it is considered taboo to talk about this matter of intellectual property.  There is an attitude of "we know best" and "they are anti commercialisation of intellectual property", with no questions allowed.  Nothing has changed since the Kerry babies tribunal, just the subject.  The subject in this case is the commercialisation of intellectual property and spin-off companies, about which we should not ask questions.  We had the seven magnificent men in to the committee from the seven institutions all with varying opinions but with the same theme of "we know best".  There is absolutely no openness and accountability around what percentage the university was getting back and so on.</p> <p>  I thank the Chairman for sticking with this.  We might have slightly different opinions on it but the issue for the Committee of Public Accounts is value for money.  Based on what has come before the committee I cannot say that we are getting value for money.  I cannot stand over it without coming back and looking at the situation.  It is public property and public universities that are funded with public money.  The president of NUI Galway retired lately and his parting shot was twofold.  One was on gender and the second was that he thought third-level fees should be doubled.  He was one of seven people who were reluctant to answer questions on what money was being made from intellectual property.  This is a source of return for the university so more people can participate in third-level education and so we do not need to charge fees.  It is hugely significant but the first issue is to break the taboo around what the process is and ask what is there for the ordinary people, the citizens and residents of the State.</p></speech>

It is a little bit surprising to hear it said that it would be difficult to understand the State's investment in particular lines of research because all of the accounting is done on a project basis.</p><p>There might be issues around the attribution of overheads or the like, but it should be possible to take a good stab at determining the level of State investment in any individual line of research that gives rise directly to a spin-out.  Maybe a distinction is being made between having a project on the one hand and, on the other, applying other processes and bringing other individuals in to market it to investors and so on.  However, that should not be beyond the bounds of possibility of designing systems.  As mentioned, any commercial research that is undertaken by companies will have accounting that allows them to know what the costs and benefits are.  I would be reluctant to see the State sector saying that it cannot do that from an accounting point of view.  It has to be possible.</p></speech>

Obviously, we will take this matter up.  We will probably revert straight to the Department.  We want the list of all of the spin-out companies.  When its Accounting Officer is before us, this will likely be a specific item for discussion.  It was mentioned that two reports are in train.  We want them to be submitted to the committee as quickly as possible.  There may be nothing wrong and the State could be getting good value, but it is also possible that the State is losing a fortune.  That is my concern.

That information might be difficult to get in the short term, but not too difficult.  Once the report is published, I recommend that we start by inviting the Accounting Officer of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, the HEA and the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills as soon as possible.

That was just the first, but main, recommendation that we needed to discuss because it was the only one that was not accepted.  We will write back to the Department saying that we reject the notion that &quot;it is not feasible to ascertain the specific attribution of all of the relevant activities and costs&quot;.  It is not beyond the ability of the public service to do that.  We will ask it to reconsider.  We will also put it on notice that we want a copy of the reports that are in the final preparation stage and that its Accounting Officer, the HEA and the Department of Education and Skills will be appearing before us to discuss the matter shortly.</p><p>Deputy Cullinane has already referred to the next recommendation.  Before recommendation No. 28 on page 3, the minute states that the HEA and Knowledge Transfer Ireland, KTI, are producing a report that was due to be completed in December.  I presume that this is the report that is still uncompleted.  We need it urgently.</p><p>The Department of Education and Skills accepts our recommendation No. 28.  The HEA was to write to third level institutions in the fourth quarter of 2017 to remind them of their legislative obligations under SIPO.  We want to see a copy of that letter and verify that it was sent.</p><p>Regarding recommendation No. 29, the minute refers to the report that was to have been ready in December.  Once again, we want to see a copy of it as quickly as possible.</p><p>On recommendation No. 34, the minute states that there must be compliance with national procurement guidelines.  An issue that is relevant to the Comptroller and Auditor General arose at our previous meeting.  We asked for measures to ensure that procurement was in line with the national guidelines.  The minute reads:</p><blockquote>All HEIs [higher education institutions] under the remit of the HEA are required to comply with national procurement guidelines.  As part of the HEIs [sic] annual governance reporting to the HEA, HEIs must [certify] any non-compliance in respect of procurement and explain the actions taken to achieve compliance.  In his annual certification of institutions' financial statements, the C&amp;amp;AG also draws attention to any instances of non-compliance.</blockquote> <p>Mr. McCarthy has told the committee that he sometimes only analyses compliance with procurement guidelines on a sample basis.</p></speech>

More framework agreements with the Office of Government Procurement, OGP, are also coming on stream.

Some of the other recommendations touch on non-compliance and the Department has responded and outlined what it proposes to do, including a financial penalty.  What the Deputy and Mr. McCarthy have been discussing will be discussed shortly.</p> <p>  Recommendation No. 35 related to Dundalk Institute of Technology's overseas contract, which has been put out to public tender.  Recommendation No. 42 has been accepted.  It concerns producing the accounts for annual audits more quickly.  Substantial progress has been made on that.  We are all singing from the same hymn sheet.  The next recommendation deals with what we were discussing.</p><p>Recommendation No. 43 was referred to a few times in the report from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, DPER.  Our recommendation states:</p><blockquote>It is the view of the Committee that penalties in relation to funding should be implemented by the Higher Education Authority where institutions fail to present accounts within 6 months of the financial year end.</blockquote><p>The Department accepts this.  The minute goes on to state on page 6:</p><blockquote>The Minister is further informed by that Department that a proposal is being considered, as part of a review of the grant funding model [- this concerns the education sector team -] to impose a financial penalty for serious breaches of [corporate] governance compliance, including failure to provide timely and accurate submission of [accounts]; unsanctioned payments to staff; false financial, statistical or governance reporting; and wilful breaches of the relevant codes of governance.</blockquote><p>I think procurement will come into that.  The Department is stating it is now looking at having some financial penalty in place where there are breaches of governance by any of the funded organisations.  That rolls into the question Deputy Cullinane raised.  This has worked in the HSE, as we were told at a previous meeting when Tony O'Brien was before the committee.  The section 38 and section 39 organisations were told that unless and until they have their financial accounts in on time, there will be a withdrawal or withholding of funding.  This has brought a remarkable improvement in these organisations turning around their financial statements and in their accountability, and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform now thinks the same can happen here.  The Department seems to be following the recommendation, so that is that point covered.  We will watch that because the Department is only in the process of following the recommendation.  Generally, the Department accepts all of what we are saying and it is moving to implement it.<br/><br/>I want to highlight another recommendation, unless members want to discuss any others.  I am moving on to recommendation No. 73 on the bottom of page 9 and the top of page 10.  It concerns approval of &quot;a value for money based business case in respect of proposals for significant outlays&quot; by third level institutions such as UCC.  We were speaking about the purchase of the Irish Management Institute.  I just want an information note on this.  The first paragraph proper of page 10 states - some people will find this interesting and some will find it boring:</p><blockquote>With respect to Universities more generally, historically they were classified as privately controlled non-profit institutions in the National Accounts.  In 2012 the CSO reclassified the universities as market producers meaning they were classified to the non-financial corporations sector rather than the non-profit sector.  Currently the universities are classified outside Government on the basis that they are (a) privately controlled and (b) market producers.  Therefore, the requirement to ensure accountability in respect of the use of public funds must be balanced with the autonomy of [the higher education institution] to make decisions on expenditure.</blockquote><p>We want a note from the CSO spelling out what that is all about because I think there is talk about universities going-----</p></speech>

The reason for that is that if 50% of their funding comes from the private sector, probably through private funding from outside the State sector, they are in the private business of providing services in the private sector.  The big universities in England, for example, would receive much more in private income than in State income.  Perhaps ours was a European approach to universities.  The CSO is now looking at this again as most of the institutions in Ireland - the universities and the third level institutions - are substantially funded by the State.  That is why the CSO is looking at this reclassification.  I am just throwing in as a by-the-way the comment that the approved housing bodies are in the same category.  The CSO's note will be useful to have.</p></speech>

We had a discussion with some of them on these foundations, and whatever about those being foundations, here we are talking about the actual universities and institutes themselves.  It is interesting that the paragraph from which I quoted comes at a time when, probably for the first time, we as a committee are putting a real, sharp spotlight on the third level sector.  There were many issues that came out of that which, I imagine, rattled some within the sector.  We could see that even when some of the Accounting Officers came before us.  They were uncomfortable with some of the questions that were raised.  Let us be clear that the spotlight we put on the third level sector led to a number of reports by the HEA and the Department that would not have been carried out otherwise.  I do not like the line I quoted.  It is very clever in how it is framed, but any time I see the word "balance" in the context of accountability, especially as a member of the Committee of Public Accounts, I become deeply suspicious.</p></speech>

He said it had been looked at several times, that it had not happened to date and that, from memory - I could be wrong - there was not an expectation that it would happen.  If it does, it obviously brings into sharp focus the very first item about income, assets and liabilities.

We want a copy of the circular referred to in the response to recommendation No. 95.</p><p>The response to recommendation No. 101 states:</p><blockquote>The codes of governance for the higher education sector are in the process of being updated to take account of the provisions of the Code of Practice for the Governance of State Bodies, 2016 and should be finalised by the end of 2017.</blockquote> <p>We want a copy of that.  When we are told something is going to happen, we want to check that it actually does.</p><p>Finally, I refer to the response to recommendation No. 128, which refers to a &quot;reporting template for the 2016/17 academic year that recently issued to the higher education sector&quot;.  We just want a copy of that because when they say they agree with us, that is fine, but we want to check that.</p><p>I know we have another minute to discuss Templemore but I think we can move through it very quickly.  I have had a quick look at it.  This is document No. 1024.  This will be a quick run through, I think.  Recommendation No. 37 has been accepted.  I think we will ask for just a general update on the recommendations in the interim report.  The Department states that the the committee overseeing the matter has met 18 times since January 2017 and that the vast majority of the recommendations have been implemented.  Recommendation No. 38 was accepted.  Regarding recommendation No. 39, there are one or two points to which I want to draw members' attention.  I am on page 4.  Our recommendation states:</p><blockquote>The Committee recommends absolute clarity on a reporting framework to bring significant issues to the attention of relevant parties such as the Comptroller and Auditor General (C&amp;amp;AG), the Policing Authority and the Minister for Justice and Equality.  The matter of what constitutes a &quot;significant issue&quot; [should] be communicated clearly.</blockquote><p>Obviously there was an issue in Templemore that was not communicated to the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of one of the audits and we felt it was significant.  There was another issue where some people may or may not have felt the Garda Commissioner should have informed the Minister about a particular matter regarding Templemore.  The last paragraph states that a communication protocol between the Department of Justice and Equality and An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na is also being developed as part of the revised governance framework, and the timeframe for completion was the end of 2017.  We wish to see that document.  They appear to be responding on the issue of when the Garda Commissioner is to raise a red flag with the Comptroller and Auditor General or the Minister, as the case may be, and they say the timeframe for completing that protocol was the end of last year.  We want to see a copy of it and when we get it people will be free to examine it.<br/><br/>In recommendation No. 41 on page 7, we talked about the independence of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na internal audit service and they accept that.  They say in the last paragraph on page 7 that the Minister was informed that in December 2016 An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na contracted external consultants to conduct a review of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na internal audit section against international professional practice frameworks to identify the opportunities to enhance the internal audit process and to provide recommendations to improve efficiencies and effectiveness.  This review was completed in March 2017.  I do not think that was brought to our attention during the course of our discussion on Templemore.  In any event we want a copy of that report.  That goes without saying.  That addresses one of our specific recommendations.<br/><br/>Much of the next page is about procurement training for the Garda.  We are told that is happening.  Regarding returns of information to the Standards in Public Office Commission, SIPO, they say only one has not been verified or returned because the particular person is on extended sick leave.  Everybody else at work has completed all the documentation and confirmed with SIPO.<br/><br/>Those are my observations on that.  I hope I have covered the ground for the committee.  There are only one or two points to be followed up in that regard.  That was the longest part of the correspondence.<br/><br/>Correspondence No. 1034 is from Mr. Derek Moran, Secretary General of the Department of Finance, providing up-to-date information following our meeting on 14 December last regarding promissory notes and NAMA's loans value.  Mr. Moran also includes, on a confidential basis, a copy of the letter engaging KPMG as special liquidator and an update on the situation relating to related costs.  Can we note and agree to publish the material, except for the letter of engagement as requested by the Department?  Members are free to raise any matter in that at a later date.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  We are not publishing that letter, as requested.<br/><br/>Correspondence No. 1040 is from Mr. John McKeon, Secretary General of the Department of Employment Affairs and Social Protection, providing a follow up<b></b>to our meeting with the Department in December.  A number of items are included in the documentation.  We note that.  Members can read and study it and if there is information of interest to any member please use it in any way you see fit.<br/><br/>In category C correspondence, No. 1010C is carried over from last week.  This is from Senator Rose Conway-Walsh and it is a copy of a report compiled by Deputies Denise Mitchell and John Brady entitled &quot;Job Path Exposed&quot;.  It is a Sinn F&eacute;in policy document.  The Senator asks the committee to examine the matter considering the ongoing spending in the area.  However, given that our remit is to look back, it may be more appropriate for the sectoral committee.  There is a review of JobPath.  There are two companies involved.  We are seeking information on the commercial sensitivity issue but the policy of how that is working is a matter for the sectoral committee.  However, we are still following the commercial aspects of the topic we spoke about in respect of the two private providers for the JobPath programme.  Is that okay?</p></speech>

Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Perhaps it was sent to that committee anyway.  If it was not, we will forward it to the committee.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1027 is from Professor Richard Thorn providing an update on the Kildare and Wicklow Education and Training Board investigation.  He expects to complete his report by the end of the month.  We note that.  He has agreed to appear before the committee after that.  He said we can discuss other items with him as well, such as Limerick and so forth.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1031 is from Deputy Mary Lou Macdonald asking that the University of Limerick internal review be put on the work programme.  We will include that for consideration on our work programme.  We will note that.</p> <p>  Correspondence No. 1032 is from the National Anglers Representative Association and the Trout Anglers Federation of Ireland regarding how angling funding applications are allocated and the oversight of fisheries development projects.  This seems to be a policy matter but we can seek a response from Inland Fisheries Ireland and the Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment.  Rather than just referring it to the other committee, we will write directly to the two organisations and we will issue the response when we get it.</p></speech>

I read through it and it appears that one of the concerns being brought to our attention is that money is being spent by the CEO of IFI without the approval of the board.

Correspondence No. 1043 is from an individual who has made a disclosure under the Protected Disclosures Act to the Minister for Education and Skills.  The person is employed in the Institute of Technology in Tallaght.  The person believes they have been bullied and victimised and have raised issues in regard to the Protected Disclosures Act itself.  This is one of over 30 pieces of correspondence from the same individual since January.  I have asked the clerk not to circulate this documentation.  As the disclosure has been made to the Minister, I believe that process needs to be completed.  Furthermore, the committee does not involve itself in individual cases relating to a person's employment.  I propose that we write to the individual accordingly and I seek agreement on the committee not to circulate the items.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p></speech>

There are a number of other items from the individual with the clerk.  This is before the courts and it is not a matter for this committee.  I propose that we note the item and I seek agreement of the committee not to circulate the item.  We were only sent a copy.  We are on a list of people getting copies of the documentation.  It is not a matter for us.  It is before the court.  We can agree not to circulate that documentation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p><p>The next item is No. 1045, correspondence dated 23 January from Mr. Marty Whelan of the Health Information and Quality Authority, HIQA, suggesting a correction to our periodic report which was published on Tuesday.  We can deal with this.  It is coming up on screen.  Members will see the paragraph HIQA wishes to change.  The correspondence states that from an initial quick read of our report, it was noticed that there was an error of fact on page 25 of the report in paragraph D19, where the report states &quot;and also contracted a private public relations firm.&quot;  HIQA states this is incorrect and that it has not engaged a private public relations firm.  It would appreciate if this could be corrected a soon as possible.</p><p>Our report refers to a private public relations firm.  We will go back to the transcript of the committee meeting with HIQA.  I will read the transcript now.  It is in front of members.  Deputy Marc MacSharry stated that a total of &euro;12,560 was spent on media monitoring and asked if that was done by a public relations firm or if it was internal.  Mr. Phelim Quinn from HIQA stated:</p><blockquote>[It] is a procured service that feeds information to us.  Even in terms of business intelligence for the organisation, we find that information contained within the media can direct us in some instances to areas where there may be risks within the...</blockquote> <p>Deputy MacSharry asked if it was a private sector public relations firm which gives HIQA a booklet, or whatever it is, every week.  Mr. Quinn stated that it was a daily feed.  Deputy MacSharry asked if it was a clippings type of service that was external.  Mr. Quinn replied, &quot;Yes&quot;.  Deputy MacSharry then asked what public relations company it was.  The HIQA spokesperson said it was a company called Kantar.</p><p>We put on the record that it was a public relations company.  HIQA gave us the name of the company.  Our report is based on the wording as given in public evidence.  It is a minor point as to whether it is a media monitoring company or a public relations company.</p></speech>

That is the end of that correspondence.  We thank HIQA for being so specific in its correspondence with us.</p> <p>  The next item is statements of accounts received since the last meeting.  Six accounts are coming up on screen now.  The first one is the Leopardstown Park Hospital board, which has a clear audited opinion; and the National Gallery of Ireland, a qualified audited opinion as the National Gallery does not recognise heritage assets in the financial statement.  It is a bit like what we mentioned before, that we do not put the roadway infrastructure on our national balance sheet.  We put any borrowings.  However, proper accounting should say that it should value its heritage assets and include it as an asset on the State balance sheet.  It is not done.  We note that.</p> <p>  Does Mr. McCarthy want to comment?  That has to be highlighted.</p></speech>

There is a significant challenge there.  Many of the heritage assets, the paintings, that are in the National Gallery are many years in State ownership.  Valuing the back catalogue is difficult.  Specifically, around 2011, there was a change in accounting policy that any acquisitions should be either recorded on the balance sheet at cost or valuation, if they were donations.  There have been significant donations to the National Gallery.</p></speech>

The main thing is that it is in a secure place.  That is all I will say about it.</p> <p>  The next item is the Economic and Social Research Institute, which has a clear audited opinion; &Uacute;dar&aacute;s na Gaeltachta, which has a clear audited opinion; and the credit institution eligible liabilities guarantee scheme account.  It had a turnover of &euro;47.2 million and a clear audited opinion, except attention is drawn to note six in the account which is the additional receipt of &euro;14 million from a credit institution following the identification by it of net underpayment in respect of previous years.  Why did the credit institution eligible liabilities guarantee scheme not spot that underpayment?</p></speech>

Over the years, the institution concerned had been remitting fees and the Department was accepting the certification of those.  It is Bank of Ireland.  When it was leaving the scheme, it did a look back exercise, with the assistance of its auditors.  A number of discrepancies were found.  However, the net amount was an additional &euro;14 million owed to the State and the bank paid that.</p></speech>

The Valuation Office is responsible for the valuation of property to allow local authorities to levy commercial rates.  The office also provides <i>ad hoc</i>property valuation services to Departments and State agencies.  The 2016 appropriation account for Vote 16 - Valuation Office recorded gross expenditure of &euro;9.1 million.  This comprised expenditure of &euro;8.6 million on the provision of valuation services and approximately &euro;500,000 on the Valuation Tribunal, which provides an appeal mechanism in cases where a property owner or a local authority is not satisfied with a valuation decision.  Pay costs accounted for &euro;6.5 million or a little over 70% of voted expenditure.  In addition, &euro;342,000 was paid in fees and expenses to Valuation Tribunal members.  Other expenditure included &euro;639,000 spent on national revaluation projects and a little in excess of &euro;200,000 spent on legal fees and expenses.  A little under &euro;1.5 million was spent on non-pay administration costs.<br/><br/>Appropriations-in-aid amounted to a little more than &euro;1.1 million.  That consists mainly of &euro;700,000 in valuation revision fee income and almost &euro;300,000 on pension related deductions from staff salaries.  Net voted expenditure in the year was 16% less than provided for in the Estimate, resulting in the surrender of the surplus of &euro;1.5 million to the Exchequer at the year end.<br/><br/>Local authorities charge commercial rates by applying a locally determined rate to property valuations decided by the Valuation Office.  Property valuations should reflect current market conditions for a defined area and, therefore, result in a fair distribution of the rates burden throughout that area.  Periodic revaluations are required to ensure that the rates burden continues to be fairly distributed among the relevant businesses as market conditions evolve.<br/><br/>A cyclical programme of revaluations of all commercial properties was provided for in the Valuation Act 2001.  However, progress in carrying out the revaluation programme has been slow.  The first revaluation of properties under the 2001 Act commenced towards the end of 2005 in the South Dublin County Council area.  When my report was being completed in September 2017, revaluations had been completed for only 15 local authority areas, accounting for 43% of all commercial and industrial properties in the State.  The remaining 57% of commercial and industrial properties, in 16 local authority areas, were being charged rates based on valuations that reflected market conditions in 1988, almost 30 years previously.</p><p>The 2001 Act requires that, following the initial revaluation of property in a local authority area, further revaluations must be carried out at intervals of between five and ten years.  Arising from this, a second revaluation of the South Dublin County Council area was completed in September 2017, before initial revaluations in many other areas.  A second revaluation of Fingal County Council commenced in October 2017. </p><p> Up to 2015, the average time taken by the Valuation Office to complete the revaluation for a rating authority was almost 30 months.  Following enabling legislation in 2015, new approaches to revaluation have been piloted to try to accelerate the programme.  For example, the revaluations for Carlow and Kilkenny were carried out by private valuers on behalf of the Valuation Office and were completed in 12 months.  A pilot project using an approach of self-assessment by rate payers is under way in Laois and is expected to be completed in ten months.  The office has also shortened the time it takes to carry out revaluation projects using its own staff. </p><p> The core aim of the revaluation programme is to ensure that rates liabilities are distributed equitably based on current market conditions.  A revaluation does not increase the amount to be collected by the relevant local authority.  Instead, the required income is redistributed across ratepayers. </p><p> Overall, for the completed revaluations, the number of ratepayers who experienced reductions in rates payable has exceeded those who have experienced increases.  Nevertheless, the changes in rates payable for an individual property can be substantial.  In one case in Limerick, the annual rates bill increased from &euro;16,000 to &euro;490,000.  For another property, the rates payable reduced by &euro;558,000 to &euro;2.4 million. </p><p> Apart from the direct cost of the revaluations that were contracted out, the costs of carrying out the revaluations are not known.  The chapter recommends that the Valuation Office puts systems in place so that accurate costings of the various approaches are available.</p><p> As I mentioned previously, there is provision in the system for an appeal to the Valuation Tribunal of the valuation attributed to a property.  There have been delays in the processing of appeals by the tribunal.  The chapter recommends that the appeals process should be reviewed.  A number of initiatives are under way to speed up appeals processing, about which the Accounting Officer will be able to update the Committee. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.167" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#L00200"><p>The committee will be aware that conducting a national revaluation programme - the first of its kind in over 160 years - has been a priority for Government since the enactment of the Valuation Act 2001.  I can report that the programme has gained considerable momentum since June 2015, following the introduction of new legislation, and advancing the programme is a central element of the Valuation Office&rsquo;s current strategic plan covering the period 2017 to 2019.<br/><br/>As indicated in the briefing material and the map forwarded to the committee last week, the current position is that the first revaluation of 15 local authorities is now complete and revaluation of an additional eight counties is currently under way.  The final phase of the programme, involving six counties covering eight local authority areas, is scheduled to commence in 2019 and conclude in 2021. <br/><br/>The members of the committee will be aware that the purpose of revaluation is to improve transparency in the local authority rating system and to distribute the commercial rates burden more equitably between ratepayers.  The value of property changes over time but not at the same level across categories, business sectors or locations.  Hence, revaluation is a central feature of the rating system in similar jurisdictions as a revaluation programme is the only comprehensive way to address such movements.  Following revaluation, some ratepayers obtain a reduction in rates while, inevitably, others experience an increase.  However, based on the revaluations conducted to date, and as the Comptroller and Auditor General has outlined, the number of businesses receiving a reduction considerably exceeds the numbers experiencing an increase in their rates liability.  I have provided further details in this regard on page seven of the briefing material. <br/><br/>The outcome of a revaluation in a particular local authority area depends on the market conditions in play in that area on or around the revaluation date.  The particular mix of urban and rural properties and differences in the range of property types in the main business categories and sectors - retail, industrial, offices, hospitality, etc. - also has a major bearing. <br/><br/>Estimating the value of a property for rates purposes is an entirely evidence-based exercise.  The primary sources of such evidence are information relating to lease transactions provided by the Revenue Commissioners and the Property Services Regulatory Authority and, of course, information obtained directly from ratepayers.  For certain categories of property, trading information or construction costs may be used to assist in assessing the rental value of that property.  During a revaluation, the Valuation Office conducts its analysis in accordance with best international practice as set out in published practice guidance notes and in line with well-established valuation principles and case law arising from the Valuation Tribunal and the higher courts. <br/><br/>When a revaluation is being conducted, we are very keen to ensure that the work we do is well understood and extensive supports are provided to ratepayers and other stakeholders.  Thus, for example, detailed information packs are provided directly to ratepayers at key stages in the process.  We engage with local media to increase the understanding of the work we are doing.  We organise walk-in clinics for ratepayers at various locations within the local authority area.  We hold frequent briefings of trade bodies and representative groups before, during and immediately after a revaluation.  We organise briefings of elected members of local authorities at key stages in the process.We provide online access to an extensive set of guidance notes and other instructional material and we operate e-mail and telephone helplines throughout a revaluation.  We also operate a joint forum with the Society of Chartered Surveyors Ireland, SCSI, which represents many of the professional advisers to ratepayers.<br/><br/><b></b>As committee members will be aware, chapter 11 of the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s report on the national revaluation programme sets out two recommendations.  It said that, &quot;The office should review its approach to the recording of costs associated with the revaluation programme to ensure that accurate costings of the different elements of and approaches to revaluation are available&rdquo;.  It also said that, &ldquo;A review of the appeals process with the Appeals Tribunal should be conducted in order to identify and address the causes of not dealing with appeals in a timely manner&rdquo;.  As Accounting Officer, I have accepted both recommendations and can confirm that substantial progress has been made in implementing measures required to address these recommendations.  I have provided specific details in relation to these measures in the briefing material, on pages three to five.<br/><br/>In respect of the 2016 appropriation accounts for Vote 16, I can confirm that the Valuation Office has received a clean audit report from the Comptroller and Auditor General with no significant issues arising. <br/><br/>The enactment of the Valuation (Amendment) Act 2015 has represented a sea change in enabling the office to carry out the national revaluation programme.  The Act introduced several new provisions with the objective of accelerating the programme.  In particular, I draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to elements of self-assessment by ratepayers, known as occupier assisted valuation.  As the Comptroller and Auditor General indicated, piloting of this new process has recently commenced in Laois.  Another new provision is the enabling of revaluation by external contractors to augment our internal resources.  This approach has been used on a pilot basis to conduct the revaluation of Carlow and Kilkenny, which were completed in September 2017, an independent review of which will be undertaken shortly.  The Act also sets out the streamlining of the appeals process.  It provides for the wider application and use of statistical information, as has been the case in other countries for some time.  It also contains new provisions in relation to improving the operations of the Valuation Tribunal, the independent body which determines appeals made against valuations from the Valuation Office.<br/><br/>The new Act also addressed a number of operational issues highlighted during the implementation of the 2001 Act.  Supported by the changes brought about by the 2015 Act, acceleration of the national revaluation programme has involved a multi-faceted approach from the staff and management of the Valuation Office.  As our current strategic plan demonstrates, we have concentrated on using a wider range of data sources to inform and validate our valuations, continual improvements in how we organise and carry out our work and developing innovative approaches to valuation, underpinned by the new legislation and new technology.<br/><br/>As a matter of information, the members of the committee will be aware that the Government is bringing about the merger of the Valuation Office, the Property Registration Authority and Ordnance Survey Ireland.  The new organisation arising from the merger, known as Tailte &Eacute;ireann, will have responsibility for several functions, including the State property registration system, the State mapping and surveying infrastructure, the State property valuation service and the development and maintenance of State geospatial information.</p><p>This merger requires primary legislation to establish the new entity, and publication of the Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill, which is being drafted, will represent the next major milestone.  The committee is aware that the Government recently decided that the functions of the merging organisations should be transferred to operate under the aegis of the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government as and from 1 January 2018.</p><p> The Valuation Office is very cognisant that commercial rates are a significant outlay for businesses.  We exercise a range of legislative functions set out in the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015 in an independent manner, and our overriding concern is to ensure that the valuations arrived at for rates purposes are correct, equitable and uniform.  This is backed up by the presence of an extensive appeal process and the application of a wide body of internationally developed professional practice, procedures and case law.</p><p> The national revaluation programme has gained considerable momentum since June 2015 and the Valuation Office intends to maintain this momentum to the conclusion of the programme.</p></speech>

The amount of &euro;1.5 billion is taken in commercial rates from the business operators and owners of this country each year.  We are not dealing with small money in respect of the impact and the significance of the work of the Valuation Office.  Very important debates are happening in the House in respect of health, education, housing, homelessness and abortion, and they are all dominating the national press.  I am sure the witnesses are acutely aware that outside of the bubble of this place and at grassroots level, when the witnesses rock into towns and villages throughout Ireland, a very big issue that dominates the local press and, more pertinently, local council meetings is the revaluation process.  The issue is the burden of commercial rates on businesses which make up the main spine of employment in this country and which, in many cases, have been crippled by increases in commercial rates.  This is not just by virtue of the revaluation process but by increases by councils which, because they are underfunded by central government, increase the tax on the businesses that employ people and keep them in a job and keep this country ticking over.  I have made this point previously to Mr. Lemass.  It might not be the sexy story that grabs the headlines in here, but trust me when I say a huge swathe of people are interested in the witnesses' appearance here this morning, and even more so by the figures surrounding the revaluation process they are here to discuss, no more so than in my county of Meath, where I know the Valuation Office is heading to next.</p> <p>  If we start with the figures, since the establishment of the Valuation Office there has been a spend of &euro;41 million.  In recent years, the average spend has been &euro;8 million to &euro;9 million per annum.  In his conclusions, the Comptroller and Auditor General made the point there has been painfully slow progress on the programme, and in the 15 years since the Valuation Act provided for a programme, only 43% of rateable properties have been revalued.  We see an exception in terms of the speed because the average time taken by the office to complete revaluation prior to 2015 was 13 months, and I know Mr. O'Sullivan spoke about the enabling legislation which allowed it to speed things up.  This has reduced since 2015.  Interestingly, Mr. O'Sullivan referred to the pilot project in Carlow and Kilkenny, which was completed in 12 months and involved more than 5,000 properties, at a cost of &euro;2.5 million for the contract and another &euro;250,000 in contract costs.  Again, this is not small money.</p> <p>  Why was the process so slow?  I know what the Valuation Office has noted in terms of how it has speeded things up, but how, over the course of more than a decade, was the process so slow given what was at stake?  There is now a requirement for all public bodies to be able to identify the costs associated with carrying out their work, and the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned this interesting point.  Obviously we can see the costs associated with the project in Carlow and Kilkenny, but we cannot find a comparable figure because the office does not have the costs.  There is a requirement for all public bodies to have systems, practices and procedures in place to maximise the value of public money being spent, but in the absence of these costings we cannot make this adjudication.  How can we compare value for money when we do not know how much it costs in the first place?</p></speech>

With regard to the pace of the revaluation programme, we have to go back to 2001 when the new Act was brought into force.  That Act codified legislation from the mid-19th century and re-enacted a number of provisions.  It specifically provided for revaluation for the first time.  There were a number of difficulties in operating the statutory steps in the legislation and there is no doubt about this.  The purpose of the 2015 Act was to pick up on these issues and streamline the processes.  A major change made was to streamline the appeals process.  Since 2015, the appeals process has a representations step, whereby our interaction with the ratepayer is front-loaded and we try to get it right before we ever publish the valuations.</p></speech>

Why was the process so slow?  Leaving aside the appeals, why was the process so slow in terms of the office having only accomplished 43% in the lead up to 2015?</p></speech>

When the legislation was enacted, it took a number of years to get it off the ground.  The report of the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to some industrial relations issues at the time, which went back to 2005.  The organisation had also lost experienced staff.  There was a learning process with running the first revaluations because the office had not done it previously.  The opportunity was taken in 2015 when designing the new Act to deal with all of the operational issues we had encountered so we could speed up the process.</p></speech>

We see the private firm to which the Carlow Kilkenny project was outsourced took 12 months.  Is this correct?</p></speech>

In fairness, I should indicate the entire project took two years.  There was six months in-house preparation in terms of specifying the requirements.  The procurement process also took six months.  From beginning to end it was two years, but it was certainly one year from the time the contract was put in place.</p> <p>  We cannot get away from the fact that a number of the statutory steps set out have timelines associated with them in the legislation.  Obviously, due process for ratepayers is a fundamental part of this.  Therefore, the briefing material I have provided includes a diagram in appendix 2, which is in annex 11A of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  A number of individual steps must be followed sequentially, with a time element associated with each of them.  This is in line generally with the revaluation timelines in other jurisdictions.  It takes that amount of time.  Obviously, we are trying to shorten the steps all the time and accelerate the programme.</p> <p>  As I mentioned in my opening remarks, the 2015 Act has been a game changer as far as we are concerned.  It has given us the wherewithal to accelerate the programme and deploy innovative and new means of accelerating it.  We have an end date in mind, which is to finish the programme by 2021.  The programme will be repeated on a cyclical basis every five to ten years so we never get into the situation again where we have long periods of time between revaluations.</p></speech>

We have certainly costs for the revaluation.  The difficulty averted to, and we agree with this, in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report is that we are able to record costs based on an apportionment.  The majority of the costs are to do with staff-related costs and some elements of technology as well.  We can accurately assess what those are but not to the extent that we can based on, for example, time and effort.  This is because our valuers would not simply be working on one project at one point in time.  They would be working on revision work or repeal work, etc.  We have identified that and we agree entirely that we should be able to do that.  The method of doing that would be to implement it through information technology.  We have a recommendation, in a recent strategy that was conducted for us, to actually go and acquire a system that would have that inherent workflow and case management type of technology associated with it.  We do not have that currently in situ and that is something that we would very much like to have.  We agree entirely with the recommendation.</p></speech>

He put it mildly because he is a gentleman but I would say they are getting hammered.  One can see the example that he gave in respect of Limerick where an annual rates bill increased from &euro;16,000 to &euro;490,000.  Exactly this time last year, counties across the midlands were hit hard by the process.  I met groups in here this time last year who made representations.  I remember meeting business owners in Longford last year during my party's think-in in that town.  I recall meeting one man who explained how he was hit by a fourfold increase in rates.  He was publicly named and there is no problem with me doing so now.  It was publican Andy Byrne who was hit by a fourfold increase.  Where is the fairness in the system?  There is a big difference, as outlined, between Dawson Street in Dublin and Main Street in Longford town.</p> <p>  Given the Comptroller and Auditor General's conclusion, I have a question.  He outlined the process that the Valuation Office takes in the build up to the revaluation process and how it engages in x, y and z.  What help do businesses receive when faced with a massive spike in their rates bill?  Such hikes can put a guy out of business fairly sharpish.  Mr. Andy Byrne said that had he been aware of the potential increase in rates it would have influenced the negotiation of the five-year lease for his particular premises.  He also said that although the rate rise will not put him out of business it will limit his ability to hire staff.  Of course, if we are in the game of job creation, the imposition of that spike has massive ramifications that people should be cognisant of.  The Commissioner of the Valuation Office mentioned, when he concluded his statement, that his office is cognisant.  I have highlighted the reality for people.  How are businesses helped to face the massive hikes generated as result of the work of the Valuation Office?  I ask the Commissioner to touch on the appeals process that he was going to talk about as well.    </p></speech>

Beyond, in terms of the policy measures associated or coming downstream from that, the Valuation Office would have no role whatsoever in that.  We are a creature of statute.  We are a statutory body.  What we are allowed do, and what our role is, are circumscribed by the Valuation Acts 2001 to 2015.</p> <p>  On the second question which I think has to do with appeals, generally speaking, after a revaluation, roughly 4% of cases end up being appealed to the Valuation Tribunal.  I have some stats, which I think I have provided to the members of the committee.  It varies from county to county.  Of that 4%, roughly 70% to 80% of those cases do not actually go to a hearing.  They are agreed, withdrawn or something else has happened.  </p></speech>

Roughly, it probably would be the order of 1% or 2% would typically go to a hearing before the tribunal.</p> <p>  On the outcome of appeals before the tribunal, it very much depends case-by-case, the size of the cases and the volume of the cases.  The statistics I can give you, which would be from the two most recent revaluations that would have been before the tribunal, for Limerick and Waterford.  The statistics associated with that are that at this stage a loss to the valuations for Limerick and Waterford would be as follows.  For Limerick, looking at two-thirds of the outcomes, 0.3 of 1% would have been the reduction in the overall value of the Limerick City and County Council valuation list, as a result of the two-thirds of the appeals that were made.  There were 68 appeals made.  I am looking at stats here that show me the outcome of the first 45 of those.  Waterford was quite similar.  Seventy four cases appealed with three quarters of those being dealt with and 0.44 of 1% was the overall impact. </p> <p>  On the points made by the Deputy, we very much appreciate the impact that revaluation and rates have on local businesses.  We meet ratepayers every day.  We have met representative bodies as recently as yesterday morning when we had a meeting with one of the representative bodies.</p> <p>  The real problem here is that this is long overdue and we are seeing the more severe impact as a result of that.  When we do second and subsequent revaluations we do not expect to see the same outcome as such at all.  We would expect really that a lot of the difficulties here are being faced the first time around because, as the Deputy says, it has been 30 years since some of these have been looked at. </p></speech>

The Commissioner has said that the Valuation Office is a creature of the Acts.  I am going back to a moral obligation as well.  As I have said, it frustrates me that everyone says their limitation is "X" and we go no further.  It is a fact that the work of the Valuation Office can have such a massive impact on the viability of a shop, pub or business.  Let us remember that these guys depend on people to come in off the street to spend their money and put money in the till in order for the owners to make a living.  Every single year I understood that pressure when I tried to strike a budget at county council level.  If nobody goes into a premises and there is no money in their till but the rates bill still arrives the business owner must pay the bill.  Given that fact, and given the fact that the Commissioner has said that he is very aware, having met people, about the impact of a revaluation, I must repeat my question.  Does the Commissioner feel that there is an onus on him to consider the situation?  Is there an onus on him to say to Mr. Lemass, the Minister of State, Deputy John Paul Phelan, and the Minister for Housing, Planning and Local Government, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, that revaluation has a very significant impact on businesses as a result of the work of the Valuation Office?</p><p>The work will now speed up as the office is progressing quickly in that regard.  Will the question be asked as to whether there are alternative ways of doing business?  This might be looking at the turnover of a premises rather than the 19th century model of taking into account the valuation of a business, as has been mentioned.  Is that something that could be conveyed to the Department and the Minister?  Will the witnesses alert people in the Department and at ministerial level of the hardship felt by people whom they contact?  That is the difference between the witnesses and others as they meet the people.  Are they conveying that hardship in real terms rather than just statistics to the people that could possibly change the system?  The witnesses have said the limitations end at a certain point.</p></speech>

The system we use for valuation is based on estimating the rental value of a property on or around the valuation date.  That rental value is based on hypothesis and the legislation in place.  The same system is in place throughout the common law world.  Other methods would be policy decisions for Ministers and I do not have any role in them.  The role of the Valuation Office is to give effect to the legislation as we find it.  In association with that, we try to address many of the matters on the ground through information and walk-in clinics.  There are different stages in the process but on at least three occasions during the life cycle of a revaluation, we operate walk-in clinics and workshops.  The ratepayers can come in off the street and we can explain the process to them.  Our role is very much associated with explaining the revaluation process, the information we need and what we do with it, as well as options open to people.  Our website is very well equipped with information in that regard.  We give every help we can and we understand exactly that it can be a difficult process for many people.  It is at that stage where our statutory duty ends.  We analyse the figures coming from particular sectors and the geography of different rating authority areas.  We do not have a role in rates beyond the valuation of property.</p></speech>

I know the witnesses will return in March and I look forward to that.  This matter is very important.  The Association of Irish Local Government, AILG, was before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Housing, Planning and Local Government last November.  The witnesses may have been there as well.  One of the key tenets of its presentation that day was the matter of commercial rates and the over-dependence of local government on this as an income strand.  It indicated that over a period, especially over the past number of decades, local government has become massively overly dependent on those rates.  Commercial rates accounted for 37% of overall local authority income in 2016.  As I stated, that comes in at &euro;1.5 billion.</p> <p>  There was a period during the crash when councils were trying to freeze rates to give people a chance when they were going out of business.  Last year, for the first time, all the main cities - with the possible exception of Dublin - started to increase rates, and in some cases the increase was substantial.  Some increased the rate by approximately 5%.  As a result of the butchery of town councils, we now have an ongoing equalisation process.  Towns that traditionally had a lower rate than the county are now being forced to put up their rates to match the county rate.  Those people are getting hit twice.</p> <p>  Is there an acceptance by the Department that the revaluation process is having an exceptional impact on small and medium sized businesses, which still form the bedrock of employment in this country outside this city?  Is the matter of commercial rates going to be addressed separately outside this revaluation process?</p></speech>

It is an important part of the funding make-up for local authorities.  It is difficult the first time it happens but it is very important this revaluation process happens and reoccurs on a regular basis thereafter.  I was before the joint Oireachtas committee before Christmas to make a presentation on new legislation for commercial rates.  The joint Oireachtas committee has decided not to undertake pre-legislative scrutiny but the proposals we are envisaging, which are currently being drafted into a Bill, would increase the power of a local authority to collect rates.  We are very mindful of the fact that 84% of those liable for rates pay them but 16% do not.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.204" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Paul Lemass" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#O00600"><p>Yes.  In some local authorities the figure is as low as 60% for those who pay rates, with 40% not doing so.  It is a very significant concern for us and we want a system that is equitable and fair.  Therefore, we want to empower local authorities and ensure they can collect rates from all liable ratepayers.  That will be part of the revised legislation being drafted now and we hope to have it before the Houses of the Oireachtas in the first half of this year.  It is on the list of priorities agreed with the Clerk of the D&aacute;il.</p> <p>  We can also consider the impact of a revaluation.  As the legislation currently stands, rates are payable in two moieties, typically one in January and one in July, when the bills go out.  If a person has a rates bill, half of it must be paid upfront in January and half must be paid in July.  That would be the expectation.  The provisions in the new legislation will be that it would be spread out over the course of the year, making it much more manageable for businesses to spread the payments throughout the year.  I also suggest that most local authorities of which I have experience would have chief executives and finance departments that are very willing to engage with ratepayers who have difficulty.  In many cases, they would engage and agree schedules of payment to help or accommodate people who have experienced increases or who are having trading difficulties.  That happened a lot during the downturn.</p> <p>  There are a couple of other points to be emphasised.  When a revaluation occurs, the Minister generally signs a rates limitation order.  The objective is not to increase the take in rates and it is about the distribution of the rates burden within the county.  In the revaluations that took effect for 2018, rates limitation orders were issued to those local authorities.  That means they are limited in any increase to the consumer price index and an increase for "buoyancy", which typically relates to new or extended properties.  The individual valuation of one property relative to another might change but the overall take is not expected to change as a result of a valuation.  The more frequent revaluation process will ensure that the spikes mentioned by the Deputy will be a thing of the past.</p> <p>  Before Christmas I also referred to section 66 of the 2001 Act.  I am aware that some businesses require support and rates are not the only lever available to a local authority to provide for small to medium enterprises.  Section 66 of the 2001 Act is available and being used by a number of local authorities to provide enterprise supports to small and medium businesses.  I highlight the fact that the Department has written to local authorities in its most recent circular, asking them to exercise rates restraint.  To be fair, although there were increases last year, in most cases there were no increases since 2008.  Last year and in some cases the previous year saw a slight increase but we have to go back to 2008 for increases before that in many cases.</p> <p>  With respect to the overall funding model for local government, the Deputy is aware that the Minister for Finance, Deputy Donohoe, has announced a review of the local property tax.  The Department will participate in the review to ensure it addresses, as much as possible, the matter of local government funding.  With a collection rate of 84%, we are keen to take it up to a level comparable with the Revenue Commissioners, which has a rate of 96% or 97%.  That would bring a significant increase to the amount of revenue coming to local authorities and help them in that regard.</p> <p>  We are aware that harmonisation is a challenge.</p><p>However, it has been set out in the legislation that this can take place over a period of ten years.  It is matter at local level to choose how slow or fast to undertake that process.  Some local authorities have completed it while others are taking a more steady-as-it-goes approach, taking it over multiple years.  However, that is a matter of individual local authorities.</p></speech>

Meath County Council did that a number of years ago as a pilot project before the Minister even considered it.  We did that and included a business incentive discount.  Mr. Lemass said the spikes will reduce but half the country still has to be covered.  If someone in Meath is hit with a fourfold increase as the recovery is starting to pick up, that could hit him or her for six.  It does not matter how often that person goes into Jackie Maguire or Fiona Lawless in Meath County Council.  If the spike is of such significance, it does not matter what schedule of payments is put in place.  This goes back again to my central theme of underfunding.</p> <p>  We can argue here all morning, but Mr. Lemass referred to rate restraint.  That happened because there was no option given the economy had tanked.  I was a member of the county council since 1999 and in the ten years prior to that, the pressure because of the massive development that was happening meant that when the local authority looked at its income, there was a hole in the budget every year and the people who picked up the tab every year were the ratepayers.  This relates to the central deficiency in the funding of local authorities.  There are two issues at play - the underfunding and the impact of the work of the Valuation Office - with nobody taking responsibility for the bill that ratepayers are subject to.</p> <p>  It is extremely worrying that in a reply to a question on underfunding, Mr. Lemass referred to the review of LPT by the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform.  I hope nobody thinks that is what will be used to plug holes and generate additional income.  Mr. Cody from the Revenue Commissioners has been before the committee.  Mr. Lemass referred to the exceptional uptake but there is not much more scope in this regard.  I hope the Department is not looking at nailing homeowners to give more that they do not have.</p></speech>

He said that generally when the office goes to a county under the revaluation process, there is no increase in the overall rates bill for that rating authority.  I interpret that to mean there will be winners and losers.  However, in a county where the population, business activity and number of businesses have been in decline for a long number of years, the reduced number of businesses will have to pay the same total that was always paid by the county even though there is less activity and a lower population.  Does Mr. Lemass get my point?</p></speech>

The rates limitation order applies to the rate from the previous year and, therefore, it only goes back one year.  It looks to the previous year and it provides that the rates for the following year will not be greater than that other than accounting for consumer price index increases.  As I understand it, that is the provision at the moment.  I will verify the precise operation of this but my understanding is that this just looks back to the previous year.</p></speech>

The differences in how the rates bill will look is part of the outreach programme.  It looks very different in how it is formulated following revaluation.

We have a report here.  Deputy Cassells has already spoken about the money involved and this is important on every level, although it is difficult for us to read it when we are not experts.  It is important to businesses paying the rents, to staff in the Valuation Office who have a statutory duty to act in a just way.  I am paraphrasing the law here.  There is an onerous responsibility on staff to produce certificates over which they can stand.  The Valuation Office is less than halfway through the project.  Some 180,000 premises have to be assessed and the Valuation Office has done 78,000.  Is that right?</p></speech>

The chapter refers to restoring a credible service.  On page 11 of the accounts for the Valuation Office, there is an explanation,  under "Administration - pay", which states "A recruitment campaign for ten additional valuer staff was held early in 2016 but only four staff were ultimately appointed from that competition."  The Valuation Office was looking for ten but only got four.  There is clearly a big gap in the staff here.  I will make a comment and then listen to Mr. O'Sullivan's answer.  I read this with horror.  I look at the number of premises that have to be assessed and see that only four additional staff when ten were sought to be recruited.  The relevant chapter also states, "A further campaign is planned in early 2017."  Will Mr. O'Sullivan give me an update on that?  The chapter further states "There was provision in the estimate to pay &euro;0.2 million for a restructuring of staffing levels to restore a credible structure."  Will Mr. O'Sullivan deal with that?  It is further stated, in a way that does not make sense to me, that "Due to protracted discussions with staff interests, no progress was made on this issue until late 2016.  Both of these issues resulted in a significant variance from planned expenditure."  Will Mr. O'Sullivan elaborate on that?</p></speech>

Many people had left the organisation on foot of the various retirement programmes, etc.  We had to replenish our capacity.  As a result, we had an engagement with staff associations and unions which took longer than we had anticipated and this meant that the money earmarked for some changes in structure was not expended in that year.  That was sorted by the end of the year and, throughout 2017, we ran a further recruitment programme.  As a result of that, we have taken on additional staff.  Ms Smyth will give us the details.</p></speech>

The Valuation Office has onerous duties.  There is the revaluation programme, which is the chapter's subject.  The office is constantly doing revisions if requested by the occupier, owner or local authority, so that is an ongoing programme.  Separately, new or amalgamated buildings require a rating.  Is that right?  A building could be demolished and a new business could go up on the site.  Would the new business require a rating?</p></speech>

In terms of the Government related work, in other words, the market valuations, which comprise the non-statutory function, again all those properties are inspected.  When we conduct a revaluation in a particular rating authority area, we usually inspect approximately 25% of those properties.  We are looking at rental information, rental transactions, verifying the details around those transactions and verifying the property to which those letting agreements relate.  We do not inspect 100% of properties at revaluation because we already have a database that confirms the data we hold on those properties, so what we are trying to do is establish what we would call the valuation norms in a particular area by reference to a number of transactions.  Generally speaking, to do that we inspect about 20% of properties-----</p></speech>

It strikes me that Richard Griffith did a fantastic job in being able to value every house, every piece of farmland and every business in 12 years between 1848 and 1860.  I might be slightly wrong on that.  What a remarkable job to do setting out on a horse, and here we are using valuations from 1988.  It seems extraordinary, and that was an original valuation rather than a revaluation.  I never quite understood that.  I realise the area is more complex now in terms of types of businesses and so on, but we have the advantage of satellite mapping and IT systems that will multiply the value of an individual property.  I accept that the job cannot be done without the people but it is extraordinary that in the 21st century it is taking longer to do than somebody who set out in the 19th century with such rudimentary assets.</p> <p>  I want to focus on my constituency of Kildare and use some of the experience of that because it is a fairly recent revaluation.  I support what was set out in the previous legislation in that the revaluations are more regular.  It is right that that does not fall off track because it stops and that we will not have the shocks when there is a big gap in the valuation timeline.  From observation, however, I would have questions about some of the methodology.  How does that change?</p><p>In the case of a retail premises, the front is valued at something, the middle is given another value and the back is valued at something else again.  If it is a very big premises, the owner can get a greater value for that piece at the back that is given a lower valuation.  Are the officials considering things like undermining main streets by virtue of the fact that there is a bigger portion of that more expensive piece to the front?  It makes it difficult to absorb it.  It was very difficult not to draw that conclusion when examining how the revaluation happened.  There were big variations.  For example, the equine sector was very heavily hit in places like Kildare, which was not the case in the past.  Do the officials consider those in terms of the changes they will make when it comes to the revaluation?</p></speech>

The Deputy made reference to particular sectors.  We engaged very closely and specifically with them.  One of the stages that is very important is called "representations".  That is when we get feedback from the ratepayer after we give them our initial proposed valuation.  We put a lot of time and effort into hearing the representations which were made with regard to that and other sectors.  Every representation got due consideration, whether it was in retail or any of the other sectors associated with it.  That feeds into the adjustments we make on foot of the representations before we publish the final valuations.  To give the Deputy a snapshot before I hand over to Mr. Lavelle-----</p></speech>

Essentially with retail, there is a technique called zoning that is used.  It is an international methodology for dealing with that.</p></speech>

One of the key tools the valuation offices and all surveyors throughout the developed world use for retail properties is the concept of zoning.  The theory is that the first 20 ft or 6.1 m back from the street is twice as valuable as the next and so on.</p></speech>

What we do not want is the benefit to go to out-of-town multiples that have free car parking, for example.  That could undermine or reduce the income that might come to a local authority from a vibrant town centre.  I question the methodology.</p> <p>  We often hear people saying it is almost a disadvantage to upgrade a premises.  Presumably that is something the officials will examine.  They say it is neutral when they do the revaluations and that people can look for a revaluation at an interim point.  How does it impact on that neutrality if there are significant revaluations in the interim and if there is not buoyancy with new commercial properties?</p></speech>

Revision is the term used to change the valuation of a property between revaluations.  Revaluation is a new valuation of every property in a local authority area at the same time, from the ground up and from first principles.  Under the definition in our legislation, in order to bring about a revision, there has to be what is known as a material change of circumstances to the premises.  It is a technical definition but would mainly refer to physical changes such as an extension or perhaps closing down and separately sectioning off part of the unit.</p> <p>  In a revaluation, we are very much looking at the rental value of the property.  We are examining the transactions and applying our analysis of that to all the other properties that do not have a specific rental transaction around the valuation date.  That is why we inspect some of those properties as well.  An improvement can affect the revaluation to the extent that it would reflect the rental value of the property.  That is how it would translate.</p></speech>

Revaluation is the tool through which we can pick up on things.  We all know of towns in which a street that was very prosperous at one time is not so prosperous any more.  Perhaps the mart that was at the back of it has now moved two miles out the road.  The street now has a lot of properties to let and a lot of vacancy.  We expect to pick all of that up in a revaluation.  We would expect the rental levels to have come down a lot.  That feeds back into the actual valuations.  We should not lose sight of the fact that over 60% of ratepayers achieve a benefit in their rates bill from the revaluation.</p></speech>

A general scheme of a Tailte &Eacute;ireann Bill was published some time back.  My understanding is that the Bill itself, as distinct from the heads, is with the Office of the Attorney General for drafting.

Two of the merging bodies would be a corporate entity in their own right; legislation established them and changes have to be made to that.</p></speech>

Limerick was used as an example.  Supposing there is a big revision in the middle, not a revaluation where it is possible to control its neutrality.  If there was a revision in respect of one or two big entities and there is no buoyancy, one would not have such neutrality.  Are there examples of that impacting on the income of the local authority?</p></speech>

We would do the revision and that is added to the valuation list.  The local authority gets a certain buoyancy from that for its rates and overall budget.  As Mr. Lemass indicated earlier, it is different in a revaluation whereby we are doing all of the properties at the same time.  There is a specific statutory cap put on the amount, that is, the overall rates take, that the particular local authority can operate in the year immediately after a revaluation.  New properties coming on stream have a beneficial effect on the finances of a local authority.</p></speech>

Waterford and Limerick were next because we wanted to perfect our technique of dealing with counties that had a mix of urban and rural.  There was concern that we would ensure that we would not have disparities between contiguous counties.  As Deputy Catherine Murphy states, it is very much about having whole sweeps of counties done around the same valuation date.  We also have to have an eye to the future, to the second and subsequent revaluations because we want to group larger counties together so that they can be done.  One cannot do it perfectly because there are towns sitting on the edges of county boundaries but we try to take that into account.</p> <p>  We have colour coded the map.  Everything shaded in purple has been done, blue is under way and green is the final stage of the programme.  The western seaboard counties have certain elements in common, for example they would have a tourism and leisure sector but some of the businesses in those areas would be seasonal.  We would think that may be reflected in the revaluation as well.</p></speech>

As of September 2017, the Valuation Office has completed 43% of the valuation process and has completed valuations on 78,000 out of 180,000 properties.

It is part of our business planning for our strategic plan every year.  Let me give the Deputy an update on the figures.  The figure of 180,000 properties is based on an historic figure but we think the true figure is 160,000 and we will be removing many properties that are no longer rateable from the list.  The figure of 43% or 44% of the total number of properties were revalued by September but there is another statistic we always look at, that is the percentage of the valuation base that represents in monetary terms.  That figure is 72%.  With the latest batch of valuations - the areas on the map to which Deputy Catherine Murphy referred and which are shaded blue - when those eight counties are completed, 82% of the base, in monetary terms, will have been revalued.  In numerical terms, it is 62%.</p> <p>  The Deputy is absolutely correct, a lot of work remains to be done.  There is a sense of urgency associated with it.</p></speech>

Let me draw attention No. 5 on page 14 of the Vote, which relates to employee numbers and pay.  There are 117 full-time equivalents.  I am perplexed that only six of the 117 full- time equivalents availed of overtime and that the maximum payment in 2016 was &euro;3,578, which would indicate that one person used 90% of the overtime budget.  If Mr. O'Sullivan is telling me that the staff know that the task is urgent, why is nobody doing overtime?</p></speech>

How does Mr. O'Sullivan justify that a business in Limerick or Westmeath may have had a 400% increase in rates but an equivalent property in a place such as Cork or Wicklow might have to wait seven years more before it is revalued?  The initial revaluation in some counties was carried out during the deep recessionary period, and that was the case for many midland counties, yet no revaluation was carried out in certain other counties during that period and businesses there are, in theory, operating off a lower rate, as some are, and will be revalued in 2021 when the recovery gathers pace.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.430" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1369" speakername="Peter Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#U01500"><p>I am missing Mr. O'Sullivan's point.  His office has returned some &euro;1.5 million to the Department but it is not getting through the revaluation at a fast pace.  Some businesses in certain categories want a clear reason why they have experienced a 400% increase yet businesses in other counties may have to wait almost a decade for an increase, which is of particular relevance against the current economic backdrop.  It does not appear that Mr. O'Sullivan is trying to push this forward, recognise that a huge injustice is being done to businesses in certain areas, and demand the necessary resources from the Department.  Is he knocking down the Department's door to highlight the unfairness in this regard?  The issue I am raising is that the Valuation Office has returned money to the Department.</p></speech>

We were putting a new structure in place and there were delays in negotiating it with the staff associations.  That was immediately corrected in 2017.  We secured an additional &euro;750,000 from the Minister in the 2017 Estimates to increase our staffing level in order to deal with the urgency of the matters outlined by Deputy Burke.</p></speech>

The matrix provided indicates that businesses in several counties will not be revalued until 2021.  Some might consider such businesses lucky.  There seems to be some disparity as retailers have to shoulder a bigger increase than industrial units or businesses in IDA parks etc.  Our town team did figures in that respect for Mullingar, where approximately 56% of retailers in some instances but only 16% of industrial units experienced increases.  The matrix is strange.  At a time when retailers are under severe pressure, they seem to be targeted in some counties.  How are they selected?  It is evident that Dublin, which has a huge number of businesses, was first to be revalued but the valuers did not go near Cork, which has over 20,000 units.  How does the office select which county to revalue?  How did it select, for example, Westmeath over Wicklow or Cavan?</p></speech>

As it occurred before the revaluation process commenced, I am not sure what the position is now.  It involved a major supermarket which had been opened in my county.  The council was doing its budget at the time and took a long time to rate the supermarket which had a potential rates bill of &euro;100,000.  The case led me to believe that while we were pushing small retailers hard and ramming revaluations down their throats, a number of new entrants to the system got away with not paying rates for a significant period because the Valuation Office's systems were not sharp enough to get back to local authorities.</p></speech>

The local authorities will be given the power to move quickly, which will allow the Valuation Office to drag its feet as it will take the view that there is no loss to the local authority because it has done the job.  It would be far more effective to have one agency doing the job properly, rather than giving the same powers to a second agency because the first is too busy to do the work.  Having two sets of powers is the definition of inefficiency.  It would be far more efficient and a better use of taxpayers' money to have one body with responsibility for making valuations in a timely manner, rather than having a back door, as this would remove the incentive on the Valuation Office not to do anything in a timely manner.  The office has been in place for 150 years, yet Mr. Lemass referred to getting a clean run at it.  Does he get my point?</p></speech>

I fully understand the point the Chairman is making.  The attraction of empowering the local authority is that it is on the spot and can react immediately.  There will be a finite amount of time for the Valuation Office to get to cases.  However, I fully accept the point that in the longer term one would not expect to use this facility as a default.  I also make the case, on behalf of the Valuation Office, that while it is digesting a major revaluation programme, there are challenges in its pipeline.  However, once it is on a steady run rate, with 31 local authorities to be dealt with in a ten-year cycle, or around three or four per year-----</p></speech>

On the theme addressed by Deputy Peter Burke, namely, the selection of the authorities, it seems strange that economically vibrant counties such as Cork and Galway have been left behind, if I can phrase it in that way, in the revaluation process and placed in the blue zone.  One would have expect these counties to have been a priority alongside Dublin.</p></speech>

Consideration was given to each county but we decided we needed to do counties with a rural and urban mix and Limerick and Waterford fitted that bill.  We could have taken Cork and Waterford.  That decision was made back in 2010.  I am not particularly sure what the rationale was but a decision was made.  Therefore, we then decided that we would concentrate very much on doing a swathe through the midlands.  Our current iteration is closing off all of that loop.</p></speech>

In relation to properties that are vacant or where we are looking at a particular street with a high vacancy rate, what one will normally see on such a street is that the valuation levels are quite depressed because there is an imbalance of supply and demand.  Generally speaking, what we see in revaluation projects is that the areas where there are high vacancy rates have lower valuations.</p> <p>  When one looks at the lifecycle of a building it goes from development stage and is maintained over a period and then perhaps for economic reasons it starts to fall into disrepair and it gets to a stage of disrepair where it is no longer capable of being occupied for that particular purpose and at that stage it becomes not rateable and it is struck off the valuation list.</p></speech>

To clarify, it is an area where there is quite a lot of confusion from time to time.  Under the Valuation Act, for a charity to claim the exemption under the Act, it has to satisfy two criteria; one is that it is a charity and it satisfies that by being registered on the charities register and, second, the particular property on which the exemption is being claimed would have to be used exclusively for charitable purposes.  We take the view, which is backed up by the tribunal and otherwise by the courts, that a retail activity carried out by a charity is regarded as retail as distinct from a charitable purpose even though all of the funds may be put to a charitable purpose.</p></speech>

As the law stands, the shops are rateable.  The way the Valuation Act is structured, all properties are liable for rates unless they are exempted and the exemption is set out in one of the schedules to the Act.  It is quite precise in stating that the purpose for which the property is operated has to be exclusively for charitable purposes and we have case law surrounding that so therefore as Mr. Lavelle said, our obligation is to rate charity shops for commercial rates.</p></speech>

Before he does that could he indicate how many applications are appealed and what is the success rate?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.526" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John O'Sullivan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2018012500002#W01900"><p>I will speak briefly on terminology first.  There are two terms, namely, representations and appeals.  Representations are what a ratepayer can make after he or she gets a first initial valuation &ndash; the proposed valuation &ndash; from us.  It is a very informal process and it can be done online.  People can take issue and give us extra information.  That is a form of appeal without it being a formal appeal.  During a revaluation we make a considerable amount of adjustments.  In the batch of counties we finished in September representations were made in 17% of all cases.  Of those, we made an adjustment in many cases and we also made an adjustment of similar properties that did not make a representation but appeared to us to be in the same boat &ndash; to be similarly circumstanced.  This is all about getting it right.  There is no impact on the local economy as there is no new list at that stage.  The rates are being collected on the old list.  It is a form of appeal but it is a form of perfecting the valuation list.  Representations must be made within 40 dates of the issue of notice.  We will consider point by point every representation that is made to us and make the changes that we deem necessary then in respect of the properties.  A classic example, if one were to take a street in Carlow, would be where we deem there to be two different valuation levels on the shops in that street and then during the representations we get in three new rents that suggest we are a little bit high.  In that case we would then take down all of the valuations on that street that appear to us to fall into the same boat.  That is an important part of perfecting the valuation list before we publish it.</p> <p>  The second appeal is the formal appeal.  That is made to the independent body, namely, the valuation tribunal.  It was set up in 1988 and continued under the 2001 Act.  It is entirely separate although I am the Accounting Officer for it.</p></speech>

Of the appeals that go to the tribunal we continue to be in dialogue with either the ratepayer or his or her representative throughout the process.  Based on the statistics we have approximately 70% to 80% of the 4.37% of cases would not go to a hearing before the tribunal.  In other words, we will agree it or the case will be withdrawn or something will happen that will not merit the case being heard.</p></speech>

There is a sliding scale of fees associated with it.  Ms Smyth will get the figures.  It depends on the valuation level that is set on the property.  Appealing to the tribunal is a formal process.  I will not say it is adversarial as it is not but it is quite formal.  The commissioner is the respondent in all the cases that go to the hearing.  As a public official my duty there is to defend the valuations on behalf of the other ratepayers who have not appealed.  That is an important part of the process.  The fees of the valuation tribunal for revaluation appeals are as follows.</p><p>There are four bands in total.  If the valuation is under &euro;20,000, the fee is &euro;95.  For a valuation between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000, the fee is &euro;125; for a valuation between &euro;50,000 and &euro;250,000, the fee is &euro;300; and for anything over &euro;250,000, it is &euro;500.</p></speech>

An industry has been created around the tribunal process.  Ms Smyth spoke of the difficulty in employing valuers.  Valuers have set themselves up to defend and help businesses when they are before a tribunal.  They do not come cheap and the company has to employ them as there is no point in going on their own.</p></speech>

That is their right as a citizen and ratepayer.  We give them every assistance but once they come through the door we are on opposite sides.  We are contending for one value and they for a different one.  In practice, many people handle their own case and we have seen this in Waterford and Limerick.  The Deputy is right, however, that there are several professional agents operating in this area, many of whom are members of the Society of Chartered Surveyors, while others are members of IPAV.  It is an important part of the overall process as it enforces the credibility of the work we do.</p> <p>  I was asked about outcomes and I can give the statistics for Limerick and Waterford.  In Limerick, 0.3% of the value of the valuation list has decreased.</p></speech>

The briefing material shows that a number of steps are under way and one of the things it has done is to roll out a call-over process, which allows it to assign cases to dates much earlier in the process.  There was a major change in the 2015 Act which allowed the tribunal to sit as a division of one person, where previously it had to sit as a three-person division.  The tribunal has up to 28 members with a chairperson, who is a lawyer, and up to eight deputy chairpersons while the rest are ordinary members.  The tribunal can also determine cases without an oral hearing and the tribunal is piloting work in this area as it is keen to pursue it.  These measures are aimed to bank loans.  Many cases are heard within six months and the tribunal is already hearing cases from the 2017 batch.  We accepted the recommendation in the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General in this regard.  The tribunal is also improving its website to allow more online services.</p></speech>

In general terms, the properties that have developed considerably since 1988, that is, which had a small presence in 1988, would experience increases under a revaluation as they would be very different types of property now.  Their rental values are arrived at by reference to their trading figures.  As for the urban-rural divide, many rural pubs would have experienced a decrease but there may be exceptions to that and a pub may be doing very well against the trend.  The trading figures will reveal that.</p></speech>

We would not just take the rental level at face value but would delve deeper.  Industrial premises such as factories, workshops, warehouses, etc., have not gone up in value over the 30-year period to anything like the same extent as some other sectors.  Some of them are experiencing a decrease in rates after the new valuations.  In any particular county, the outcome is down to the mix of businesses.  In towns, good quality retail will have a bearing.  The cake is always in the local authority area and we try to determine how much everybody contributes to it but the slice of the cake is determined locally.  The general trend is that industrial premises are coming down.  Retail would be very mixed and we have seen examples of streets that once did well but now are not doing well at all and have high vacancy rates.</p></speech>

Of the 1,271 cases, we would, as I mentioned earlier, continue to discuss them with the ratepayers and people representing them.  We would expect 70% to 80% of those not to proceed to a hearing.

I am suggesting the number is an awful lot smaller.  Those concerned endeavour to deal with them within six months.

On the exact point made, Mr. O'Sullivan said about 4% of the 1,200 cases were appealed and that 70% to 80%, or three quarters, do not proceed to a hearing.  Therefore, one quarter of the 4% go to a hearing.  Therefore, 1% end up in a hearing.  I believe I saw a figure today indicating the cases proceeding to appeals represented a reduction of only about 0.4% in the rates bill of the relevant authority.  Am I right?  It is something like that.</p></speech>

It states further recent analysis of the appeals tribunal was conducted resulting from the revaluations for Waterford and Limerick and that the analysis reveals the cases determined by the tribunal had, up to that point, resulted in overall reductions of 0.44% and 0.3%, respectively.</p></speech>

Given that only 1%, or one in 100, went to a hearing, and there was a reduction of 0.4%, it means there is a massive reduction concerning each of those that went.  Mr. O'Sullivan compared the number that proceeded to an appeal with the 99 that did not.  That is not relevant.  I am interested in the cases that went to appeal.  For each of the two counties, what was the valuation going into the tribunal?  What was the valuation that came out at the far end in respect of them?  What was the difference?  That is the only obvious question.</p></speech>

I know the Valuation Office compares the value to the value of the property up or down the street.  How does Mr. O'Sullivan deal with that?  He never mentioned an owner-occupied building in this context here today.  What percentage of the properties revalued have leases?</p></speech>

That is why, when we pick up on a lease from the Revenue Commissioners, the Property Services Regulatory Authority, PSRA, or directly from the occupier, we analyse that lease in great detail and we go and look at the property.  Our main method of assigning valuations is by comparison.  We are always looking to treat like properties alike, which is only possible where we have hard evidence that we have analysed down.  </p> <p>  In terms of the percentage of properties that are leased, that depends on the activity out in the market.  The PSRA probably knows and I could get a figure from it.  </p></speech>

The more commercialised an area is, the more leased properties there are, as in places like Galway city for example.  If one looks at Grafton Street or Henry Street, for example, every property is let.  However, when one starts to move into rural and provincial Ireland, the balance shifts quite significantly.  It has been changing in more recent times but from a revaluation point of view, we have a valuation date and are trying to get picture of what the market is like at a point in time.  Some rents are of no interest to us because they are too far removed from that valuation date or are too historical.  Generally speaking, we are going to finish up with around 10% of the properties or property transactions out there.  As I said earlier, we started looking at around 20% to 25% of rental transactions.  Some of those will be related parties of one sort or another.  We would normally distil it down to around 10%.  As the commissioner said, we then extrapolate from that and apply those valuation levels to other properties that we believe are similarly circumstanced.</p></speech>

Obviously, I am keen not to stray into the policy area but there are two requirements in the legislation to which we must give effect.  One is correctness of valuation and the other is equity and uniformity.  It is not just the rent of one particular property that will determine the rates bill.  The rent of other similar properties in that area will also have a bearing.  There are lots of checks and balances associated with it and that is the way the legislation is framed.</p></speech>

There is, therefore, a statutory process associated with it.  This was only made possible under the 2015 Act.  A new Part was inserted, but effectively on 26 February a lot will be seen because by that stage we will have written to and contacted every ratepayer in County Laois.  In advance of that happening, we will have a considerable outreach programme with anybody who wishes to engage with us.  Throughout the process we will have walk-in clinics in the county; they will be held one day a week or as often as is required.  We have had many discussions and will have many more in the coming weeks with the representative bodies, one of which we met yesterday.  We have briefed the local authority staff.  We will do whatever it takes to get this right because this is the first time it has been done.  It is generating a great deal of interest internationally, including in the International Property Tax Institute and similar bodies, because if it works well, it could result in us being able to conduct ongoing valuation cycles more quickly.  We have developed a new website for it, but it is not live yet.  We have made a number of videos to instruct ratepayers on how to, for example, measure their retail unit.  We ask them to fill in a form online.  We give an indicative valuation and the floor area to most ratepayers to help them along the way and they can either choose to accept or go against it.  If the floor area is incorrect, they are shown how to remeasure it and correct us in that regard.</p> <p>  There is a small category.  Trading data obviously drive many of the valuations.  We are doing it a little differently, but they are relatively small numbers.  The message very much is that ratepayers will see the first roots towards the end of February.  We propose to issue first draft certificates on or around 12 July which is the other key date.  They will have a period in which to make representations to us and we would prefer if they made them online.  The cut-off date is 21 August.  They will have up to 50 days if they make the representations online.  We will issue the final certificates on or around 12 October.  We intend to publish the new valuation list for County Laois on 26 October.</p></speech>

It would be remiss of me if I did not welcome everyone to the first meeting of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement for 2018.  We resume our important discussions on legacy issues.</p> <p>  Today we will hear from the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains about its important work on behalf of the families of the disappeared.  I thank the witnesses sincerely for their attendance today.  I welcome Mr. Frank Murray, co-commissioner, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, co-commissioner, and Mr. Geoff Knupfer, senior investigator.  We invite all three of the witnesses to make their opening statements.  Questions from the committee will follow.</p> <p>  Unfortunately, as always, there is a wee bit of housekeeping.  It requires me to read a number of notices.  I remind members, guests and those in the Public Gallery to please ensure their mobile phones or tablets are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting, as they cause interference with the recording equipment in these rooms even when they are in silent mode.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.<br/><br/>I invite the witnesses to make their submissions, after which we will take questions from members.</p></speech>

We thank the committee for its invitation to this afternoon's meeting.  We last came appeared before the committee on 16 February 2012.  We are delighted to have the opportunity to inform it about the work that has been undertaken by the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains in the intervening period.  We are very pleased that, since our last meeting, four disappeared victims have been recovered and their remains returned to their families.</p> <p>  Before we detail our recent activity, however, I would like to take the opportunity to outline briefly the background and functions of the commission for the benefit of any new committee members who were not present at our last meeting.  The commission was established in 1999 by the Irish and British Governments as one element of the suite of initiatives taken by them in the context of the peace process.  The commission is completely independent in its functions.  It is a non-political body that, since its establishment, has enjoyed cross-party and cross-community support.  This is important to us and the families.  The commission has a humanitarian mission and it is not part of the criminal justice system in either jurisdiction.</p> <p>  The purpose of the commission, as members will know, is to facilitate the recovery to their families of the remains of persons killed by paramilitaries during the conflict in Northern Ireland and buried secretly.  These victims are known as "the disappeared".</p> <p>  The interests of these victims' families have been at the forefront of the commission's efforts since 1999 and will remain so.  They have had to endure a particular cruelty, facing not only the tragedy and injustice of losing a loved one to murder, but also the added pain owing to a relative being missing.  All they seek is the return of the bodies of their loved ones for a dignified burial, to have a place to grieve and to have an end to the painful uncertainty of not knowing where the body of their brother, father, son or uncle has been concealed.  The commission is deeply committed to alleviating their suffering and will continue its work to that end.</p> <p>  In the pursuit of its objectives, the commission has been a model of cross-Border co-operation since its establishment.  The commission, the two Governments and police forces, and the many others who have provided services to the commission, have all worked seamlessly together towards a shared goal.  In that sense, the commission is a testament to the spirit of the Good Friday Agreement.  We are grateful for the unwavering support of the two Governments for our work.</p> <p>  As I stated, we have recovered four victims since our last meeting with the committee in 2012.  On 1 October 2014, the commission discovered the remains of Brendan Megraw at Oristown Bog.  Brendan disappeared in April 1978.  It would be 36 years and multiple searches before he was recovered and returned to his family.</p> <p>  On 25 June 2015, the remains of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee were recovered in Coghalstown, County Meath.  Seamus and Kevin were found during an extensive search being undertaken by the commission for another disappeared victim, Joe Lynskey.  They had been abducted and murdered together some time around October 1972.  The commission had previously searched for the remains of Kevin and Seamus in the Coghalstown area but those earlier searches had not been successful.  Their discovery during the Joe Lynskey search was unexpected but, of course, greatly welcomed by their families and by the commission.  Following their recovery, the search for Joe Lynskey continued for another five months.  Regrettably, we did not find him, and he remains one of our three outstanding cases.</p> <p>  On 6 May 2017, the commission recovered the remains of Seamus Ruddy at a forest in Pont-de-l'Arche near Rouen in France.  Seamus had been teaching in Paris when he disappeared in 1985.  Several unsuccessful searches had been undertaken by the commission and the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na previously.  However, following extensive inquires undertaken by the commission prior to the new search, Seamus was recovered and returned to his family.  The commission greatly appreciates the co-operation and assistance of the French authorities and the Irish Embassy in Paris in achieving the outcome.</p> <p>  My co-commissioner, Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, will speak about the remaining cases on the commission's work programme.</p></speech>

It is an important opportunity to brief members on the commission's activities, hear their views and elicit their support for our ongoing efforts.</p> <p>  There now remain just three victims on the commission's case list.  Joe Lynskey disappeared in August 1972 and is believed to be buried in the Coghalstown area of County Meath.  Columba McVeigh disappeared in November 1975 and is believed to be buried in Bragan, County Monaghan.  Captain Robert Nairac disappeared in May 1977, and the commission has received very little information to assist in his recovery.  He is believed to be buried somewhere in the Ravensdale area of County Louth.  </p> <p>  I should emphasise that information is crucial to the commission's work.  The receipt of information is our greatest asset and the pursuit of information remains our greatest challenge.  It is now over 40 years since the last three victims disappeared, and the passage of time creates obvious difficulties for accessing relevant information.  I appeal to anybody with information that may help in locating the remains of any of the victims to provide it, in confidence, to the commission using our freephone number or our PO box address.</p> <p>  All information provided to the commission is treated as strictly confidential and it can be used only to locate and identify the remains.  By law, it cannot be given to other agencies or used for prosecutions.</p> <p>  As commissioners we have always taken great satisfaction from the relief and solace that our work brings to the families of the disappeared.  Mr. Murray and I have attended many of the funerals of the people the commission has recovered and have always been struck by how these occasions of great sadness are simultaneously occasions of joy.  The families are joyful that one part of the great tragedy that has befallen them has finally ended.  I have also noted how the families of the disappeared provide great mutual support for one another, even after their loved ones have been recovered.  In that regard, I acknowledge with a deep sense of gratitude the tremendous support that the organisation WAVE has provided to the commission for many years and the work it has done with the victims' families.</p> <p>  At this point, we need further focused information to enable us to complete our mission.</p><p>We therefore appeal most earnestly to the humanitarian instincts of anyone with such information to pass it to us now through our confidential freefone number or our PO box.  We are grateful to the members of the committee for facilitating this meeting today and I implore them to use whatever influence they might have to encourage people with information to come forward in confidence.</p><p> I will ask the head of our investigation team, Geoff Knupfer, to give some more information on the final three cases in the commission&rsquo;s casebook.  We look forward to hearing the members' views and answering any questions they may wish to put to us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.716" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Geoff Knupfer" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2018012500002#C00200"><p>As members have heard from Sir Kenneth Bloomfield, we have three outstanding cases on our list of disappeared.  The first is that of Joe Lynskey, who was apparently abducted and killed in 1972.  His name was not included in the initial Good Friday Agreement list of victims published in 1999.  It only came to attention as a result of the publication of a book in 2010.  Nevertheless, we have since been given to understand that inquiries were being made into his case in 1998 and 1999.</p> <p>  Following the receipt of some rather patchy information as to the whereabouts of Joe Lynskey&rsquo;s remains, we undertook a search of a large field in Coghalstown, County Meath, in 2015.  In the course of that search we found the bodies of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee in a single grave in that field.  We had previously been informed by an intermediary they were buried in an adjoining field.  Despite completing a thorough search of the field following the recovery of the bodies of Seamus Wright and Kevin McKee, I am afraid we did not find any sign of Joe Lynskey.  We have been advised by the republican movement that it has no further information on this case.  We believe his remains are probably buried in the Coghalstown or Oristown area of County Meath and while we keep an open mind, our inquiries are focused on those areas.</p> <p>  The second case is that of Columba McVeigh, who was abducted and killed in 1975.  His name appeared on the list published in 1999 and the commission was advised that his remains were buried in Bragan Bog, Carrickroe, County Monaghan.  Information continues to be exchanged on this case and, to date, a number of searches of that bog have been undertaken but sadly without success.  Further refinement is being sought on this case and, if it is deemed positive, a further search could be programmed for Bragan Bog in the current year.  Nevertheless, the information we have on this case contains some inconsistencies and is far from complete.  Any additional information that could be made available would be very much welcomed. </p> <p>  I turn to the final outstanding case, that of Robert Nairac who was abducted and killed in May 1977.  At the time he was a serving soldier.  He was abducted from the Three Steps Inn in Dromintee, taken to Ravensdale and was killed.  Unfortunately, his body was removed immediately afterwards and was secretly buried.  Several people were tried and convicted of his killing and associated offences, but his body has not been found and no information has been passed to the commission as to its whereabouts. </p> <p>  We believe that this could be because he was a British soldier and that, since his death, his name has been linked in a number of books and articles with five separate killings and atrocities.  Due to this dearth of information, the commission has taken the unusual step of undertaking research into his background.  This has revealed that Robert Nairac was not and never had been a member of the Special Air Service; he was in fact a Grenadier Guard.  His role was that of a liaison and intelligence officer, liaising between the police and the army.  In military terms, he was a very junior officer and would not have had free rein.  Neither was he tasked with handling informants or sources as part of his role.</p> <p>  On the dates of four of the incidents with which his name has been linked, Robert Nairac was not in Ireland.  On the fifth occasion, he was actively deployed on an operation in Derry, many miles away from where this incident occurred in County Monaghan.  In all five cases we have been able to trace and interview witnesses who are able to vouch for Robert Nairac&rsquo;s presence in these various locations and not anywhere near the locations where the incidents occurred.  We in the commission are satisfied beyond reasonable doubt that these witness accounts are absolutely accurate and the individuals providing them are telling the truth.  It is most unfortunate that the army&rsquo;s "neither confirm nor deny" policy was brought to bear when these various allegations came to light.  Had they been countered at the time with the appropriate documentary and witness evidence, it is unlikely we would find ourselves in the present situation.</p> <p>  We earnestly appeal to anyone who has information on the whereabouts of Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh or Robert Nairac to contact the commission.  Any information received will be treated in the strictest of confidence and can only be used, as the committee has heard already, to recover and repatriate victims.  It cannot be passed to any other organisation and it cannot be used in a court of law.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.718" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1270" speakername="Brendan Smith" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2018012500002#C00400"><p>I compliment the witnesses on the excellent presentation and the appropriate manner in which they put forward the details on an extremely difficult issue.  I am very glad, as I did in 2012, to have suggested for the 2018 work programme of this committee to invite the representatives of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains to make a presentation to the committee.  My request met with unanimous approval.  The thinking behind my request was that we have to use every forum open to us to try to create awareness that people with information should provide it to the commission.</p> <p>  I compliment the commission on what it has achieved to date in recovering so many bodies.  Unfortunately the bodies of Joseph Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Robert Nairac have yet to be recovered.  I have been familiar with the work of the commission since its establishment following the signing of the Good Friday Agreement, as the first commissioner appointed by the Irish Government was my predecessor as Deputy for Cavan-Monaghan, my good friend and former T&aacute;naiste, the late John Wilson.  I was familiar with the work of the commission without knowing the detail of the work.</p> <p>  Mr. Murray and Sir Kenneth Bloomfield have been in very senior positions in the public service, as has Mr. Knupfer.  John Wilson told me that even though he had been in very difficult positions, including up to T&aacute;naiste and in government, nothing was anything like as difficult as his work on the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains.</p> <p>  I compliment the commission on its excellent work in trying to recover bodies.  It is absolutely appalling that so many innocent people were abducted, murdered and secretly buried.  I have met many of the victims' families over the years.  I do not have the words to describe the grief that they have suffered and continue to suffer.  Many of them said to me that they wanted to have a grave where their loved one would rest and where they would be able to go, say a prayer and lay a flower.  It is not a big request in respect of a family member who had been murdered.  These were innocent people murdered by thugs and murders masquerading as so-called republicans and loyalists.</p> <p>  I am sure that with every passing day the work of the commission does not get easier.  I assume that what it needs is information.  I sincerely hope the Governments provide it with the necessary resources to support its work.  In his opening remarks, Mr. Murray made the point that it is gratifying to have the support of the Government and the Oireachtas.  Part of my thinking in inviting the witnesses to make a presentation to the committee, with the full agreement of the committee, was to let those families know that their loved ones still being missing is a source of concern for all of us and to try to use this forum as a means of generating awareness</p><p>If somebody has some information, even though they might think it is irrelevant or just has some relevance, they should come forward and provide it to the commission.  I wish the commission well in the remainder of its work.  I know the terrain in north Monaghan and Bragan Mountain well.  It is part of my constituency and I know the area around Oristown in Meath, which is a neighbouring area.  The topography does not make it easy for the commission to do its work.  I presume that the commission needs information more than anything else. </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2018-01-25a.720" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1413" speakername="Niall &Oacute; Donnghaile" time="14:10:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/GFJ2018012500002#D00200"><p>I welcome the commission members and thank them for their presentation.</p> <p>  For many of us, the hearings into victims and legacy issues have thrown up many of the awful instances that happened during the conflict.  There is no question that this is a particularly awful situation and it continues to be awful for the families with the remains of their loved ones still not found.  It should not have happened.  This was wrong and our focus now has to be on supporting the families and loved ones who are left behind.  Thankfully, 13 of the named victims have been recovered but a further three remain missing, namely, Joseph Lynskey, Robert Nairac and Columba McVeigh.  I agree with Deputy Brendan Smith's comments on using this meeting as an opportunity and a platform to make the appeal once again for anybody to bring forward information they may have in any of these cases.  They should bring it forward under the certainty, which has been offered here again today, of absolute anonymity.  I am sure the appeal will be made again during this meeting.</p> <p>  Most of these 16 cases happened before I was born.  I say this because we are operating in a limited window with regard to information.  Sometimes the information on the outstanding cases goes back 40 or 50 years.  We have a short window in which this information can come forward.  This closing window makes it critically important to have the information.</p> <p>  Would Mr. Knupfer accept that he has received support for his efforts from former IRA activists thus far? Would Mr. Knupfer accept that they were genuine in their efforts to help?  Mr. Knupfer referred to the legislation that provides for immunity for information received but how important does he think this is in the broader campaign undertaken by the commission?</p> <p>  With regard to the continuing efforts to locate the remaining victims, Mr. Knupfer alluded to who those people are.  Perhaps the witness could expand on what measures are currently being taken.  This may offer the commission another opportunity to make an appeal for any information.</p></speech>

I believe they suffer from the same problem we do in that what they can glean is incomplete.  Having said that, I am sure there are individuals out there who do know the whereabouts of these remains or who have relevant information and could provide it.</p> <p>  It is important to say that we genuinely believe that we have never knowingly been misled by any of the information that has been passed to the commission.  It has all been passed with the best of intentions, albeit it has been inaccurate.  This, however, is entirely understandable given the timescales involved.</p> <p>  One of the other problems we have is that people who may have been involved in these events 40 years ago have now moved on with their lives.  Their relatives and families may not be aware of the part they may have played in these events many years ago when they were young.  We have had to tackle this problem.  There are issues and there is no two ways about it, but we have had genuine support also.</p> <p>  Reference was made to the consequences for passing on information.  This is not a general amnesty; it is a limited immunity.  I believe we would all agree that it has worked remarkably well.  Nobody who has passed information to the commission about missing victims has ever been interviewed, arrested, charged or appeared in court for anything related to that information.  We are comfortable that the legal structure works very well and I believe that the people we engage with are satisfied this is the case.  As the years go by, more victims are found.  Nobody has ever been questioned by the legal authorities about it.</p></speech>

The setting up of the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains has been one aspect of the Good Friday Agreement that is working in a lot of ways with a difficult task.</p> <p>  I attended Kevin McKee's funeral in St. Peter's in Belfast, in a personal capacity.  It brought back the awfulness of the tragedy of his murder and the secret burial which left his family grieving for many years.  That he was buried with his mother in Lisburn many years later brought back that fact that this young man was 17 years of age when he was abducted with Seamus Wright who was 25.  Across the Border we found it very difficult to comprehend these unfortunate times. </p> <p>  Three victims' remains have not yet been found, namely, those of Joseph Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Robert Nairac.  Can Mr. Knupfer tell the committee if there is a reluctance, a selectivity, a hierarchy, a cunning or a disrespect involved in the fact that Robert Nairac was from a British army tradition?  Is this why information is not coming forward about him? I watched the "Prime Time Investigates" interview with Robert Nairac's friend Fr. William Burke.  The victim was a British soldier, but he was a Catholic and he deserves a funeral.  He deserves that respect.</p> <p>  People speak about parity of esteem but there must be parity of esteem for these victims.  I understand there has been great co-operation but once again I appeal to anybody out there with information.  Robert Nairac came from a British army tradition but, should information be forthcoming, he must be treated the same as all the other unfortunate victims who are the disappeared.  Is the commission saying that information is not coming forward from some quarters?</p></speech>

My colleague referred to thugs and murderers.  Nowadays we would probably say "radicalised young men who did some horrendous things."</p> <p>  I cannot begin to imagine what it meant to the families for whom the long wait was resolved when the bodies of victims were recovered to at least have the remains of a body and a place to go to.</p> <p>  I have to hand a list of names, which appears to be a rather cold document.</p><p>We are referring to people, for the most part young men, who were taken from their homes to some dark and lonely corner knowing all the time that their lives were going to be extinguished at the end of the trip.  I frequently think back on these people.  Every time I hear mention of the commission's work, the horror of it all comes back.  I cannot begin to express my appreciation for what the commission has done.</p><p> To those who were the perpetrators of these atrocities and came forward to assist the commission, I will use whatever bit of charity I have and say "Thank you".  I thank them for ending the families' long suffering.  To lose a child, brother, sister, husband, wife or, as happened in some cases, mother is traumatic, but these families do not know where their loved ones are.  The commission has recovered bodies in bogs and dark, lonely and desolate places.</p><p> I agree with my colleague.  Robert Nairac was a serving British soldier.  Some say that what happened was fair and people were entitled to shoot him because it was war.  Maybe they were, maybe they were not.  I will not get into that today.  However, his parents were entitled to his body.</p></speech>

I pray to God that it will find whatever bodies are left, thereby giving some closure to the mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers who to this day wonder what happened to their loved ones.  The commission has found a number of bodies.  Finding remains has not been easy for the families, but at least it has given them closure.  At least they know that is it and the story is over.  Now they can go and pay their respects on a daily, weekly or other basis.  Nothing fills the vacuum left by the pain of losing a child but, for the most part, parents have somewhere to go.  I pray that those who were radicalised, carried out these acts and may be living with their consciences today come forward and clear their own minds because, if there is a God - it is not for me to say whether there is or what form he or she may take - they will have to meet him or her some day and face final judgment.  Come forward and give the commission the material it needs to finish the job it has started.</p></speech>

Thankfully, the body of that individual - John McClory - is one of those that has been found.  I know the hurt that this causes families.  It is upsetting.  That is why I do not intend to speak for too long on it.</p> <p>  I thank the commission for the work it has done.  I also thank everyone who came forward with correct information that allowed the return of people's bodies to their loved ones.  There is nothing as important in people's lives as being able to bury their loved ones and go to their graves to pay their respects.  Unfortunately, in the case of three individuals, their families are not able to do that.</p> <p>  I echo some of the comments that have been made at this meeting.  I appeal to those who have any information.  As mentioned, it does not matter how small it is - they should come forward with it as a matter of urgency.  I sincerely hope that the three individuals who have not been returned to their loved ones can be returned and that information on them comes forward.  Without such information, their families continue to suffer to this day.  I hope that people will come forward with information to alleviate that suffering and put this part of our past behind us.  I want families to be able to go to the graves of their loved ones and pay their respects.  That is what I do in respect of members of my family who are dead.  I urge people to come forward with the relevant information to allow other families to do the same.</p></speech>

I also thank them for their work.  Seamus Ruddy was a good friend and neighbour of mine.  I grew up with him.  Just before he went to Paris, I spoke to him briefly by telephone.  He went to Paris because, although he had been accepted to a course in Trinity College, he could not get a grant.  We were trying to get something sorted out.  Unfortunately, he ended up in France and we know what happened.</p> <p>  I am aware of what the Ruddy family went through.  Before she died, Mrs. Ruddy, God rest her soul, had his name put on a headstone in the hope that his body would be recovered.  Thankfully, it was.  I am aware of the hurt, not just of the Ruddy family, but of our community in Ballybot, which is one of the oldest parts of Newry and is very historical.  We grew up together, played football together, went to the old carnivals together and had some good times together.</p> <p>  I reiterate everything that has been said and ask those who have any information on the three remaining bodies to come forward.  Knowing what the Ruddy family went through, no other family needs to go through that.</p> <p>  The commission has received information and discovered and recovered bodies for other families, which was important for them.  I thank it for the work it has done.</p></speech>

As many of those present know, the area within three miles of where I live is where most of the bodies have been found - Iniskeen, Carrickrobin, my home village of Knockbridge, Ravensdale and Jonesborough.  Today is about recognising the importance of the return of the three gentlemen - Joe Lynskey, Columba McVeigh and Robert Nairac.</p> <p>  On behalf of the committee, I compliment the commission on its professionalism and sterling efforts in recovering the bodies.  When I met the witnesses outside, I told them of my first-hand experience of the commission's work when one of the bodies was recovered within 300 yd. of where I live.</p> <p>  Of most importance has been the confidentiality shown by the commission.  The message needs to go out loud and clear that the three remaining families need closure.  As was mentioned, that closure can only be brought about with information.</p> <p>  Will the witnesses comment on the rumour that one of the three persons whose body has not been recovered was not buried?  Without indicating what their information is, has this rumour been brought to their attention?  It was one of the main local rumours that did the rounds in the Border area.</p><p>I ask anybody who has information to please come forward, as others have asked, as it would give families an opportunity to bury their loved ones and put an end to this sorry saga.</p><p> In conclusion, I was 22 years of age when the body of Mr. Simons, whose case was not part of the commission's work, was discovered.  Coincidently, his body was found within 300 yd. of my bedroom at my home.  Like others here in this room, who have experienced the hurt of violence and been about to bring closure, such discoveries have been tremendous for the families affected.  I appeal to anybody with information who is listening today to give the remaining families that closure by conveying information through the commission's confidential post office box number and telephone lines.  I wish the commission  well in the future.    </p></speech>

We have not received any information on his case at all.  So far as reasons go, we guess this might be because he was a British soldier and, of course, because of the damaging allegations that have been made or connected with his name in more recent years.  That is why we have taken the unique step of trying to research his background to see whether this was fact or fiction.  At the end of the day this is not about Robert Nairac; it is about his loved ones.  It is too late to show compassion for Robert Nairac, unfortunately; this is about his family.  We would ask anybody who has any information to please pass it to us.</p> <p>  The Vice Chairman mentioned that there was a strong rumour that his body had been destroyed in a meat processing plant in the area.  We are assured by people who would know that this is actually not the case and the rumour was spread to distract attention, shall we say, at the time.</p></speech>

I remember days when people like me would have felt not very welcome in Crossmaglen.  I have been to Crossmaglen several times.  I have been entertained in the Crossmaglen Rangers clubhouse.  There is now is wide agreement across the community - left, right and centre - that this really is a blur on the history of our island and that really it is the duty of everybody to come forward and help us if they can.</p> <p>  I will repeat what we have said already.  We are not a court of law.  We are not a court of morality.  We just have a simple end in mind and that is to bring solace to those families that have been bereaved for so many years.  </p></speech>

They can always avail of other possibilities such as contacting a public representative, a clergyman or somebody of some standing in the community.  We do not seek to get anybody into any personal difficulties or anything like that.  Our sole purpose and remit is to find the bodies of the disappeared of which three cases remain - nothing more, nothing less.  No court case will arise out of anything that is given to us or said to us.  All we need is some focused information that might lead us to the right place.  Perhaps people who have come to us before and given information might think again on whether there is any additional piece or factor they overlooked when they gave information before?  Such information might be highly significant.</p> <p>  At the risk of embarrassing Mr. Knupfer, can I mention his involvement in the Manchester moors murder case?  I will let him tell the story himself of how Myra Hindley, when she was brought to the site, gave a piece of information that had not been given before or, maybe, had not been deemed to be of great value.  Her information led to breaking the mystery surrounding the whereabouts of the remains.  I will hand over to Mr. Knupfer.  I am referring to information that may not be relevant directly but indirectly.  </p></speech>

We had a fairly broad location for her burial in a piece of peat bog.  We knew she had been murdered and buried on a summer's evening.  We looked at this outcrop of peat.  Of course the question immediately arose whether the site could be seen from the road.  If it could be seen from the road, then clearly people could not have buried her in daylight.  If they had buried her in the dark then her body could be anywhere.</p> <p>  We had a facility to return to the office each evening and speak, on a one-to-one basis, with the offender, Myra Hindley.  We chatted about this and asked her whether she could remember if it was still daylight or had it gone dark by the time her co-offender, Brady, had buried the body.  She said she remembered it was just going dark; that it was just dusk really.  She said "I recall it because I remember looking across the valley and seeing the 'V' of the hills coming down into the valley on the other side of the valley we were in."  We said: "Okay, fine.  Thanks very much indeed."  We went back the next day and realised there was only one point on that piece of peat bog where one could see that "V" in the valley opposite and of course that led to the recovery of the body of Pauline Reade.  A little titbit of information made all of the difference in the world.  </p></speech>

They never cease to amaze and impress me with their dedication to the task in hand.  I have visited them working on site in different places.  I refer in particular to our archaeologists, Ms Niamh McCullagh and Mr. Aidan Harte, and to our contractor, Mr. Aidan Boyle, and his staff.  They are all tremendous people and they do not work in the most ideal of conditions, to say the least.  Queen's University Belfast has provided us with architectural expertise.  We also have Dr. Tim Clayton as our DNA expert, who comes from Birmingham or somewhere in the midlands in England.  Behind us there is another team of people without whom we could not have had the successes we have enjoyed to date.</p> <p>  To reiterate where we started, if somebody has given information before, perhaps they might have a rethink.  Is there any other little bit or fiddly detail?  The detail might seem fiddly but it could be important and lead to the recovery of remains.</p> <p>  Bragan Bog amazes me.  I have walked around the bog several times and it is vast.  We have searched all of the areas that we have been told to search yet we have not found the remains.  Therefore, a little piece of the jigsaw is missing.  If somebody thinks they might be able to point it out to us then I urge him or her to please come to us in whatever way he or she chooses, directly or indirectly.  All we want is the information that will lead us to the right place.  We have no interest in any other dimension.  We are not in the business of preparing files for prosecution.  That is not our bag.  We are only focused on finding the remains wherever they are - nothing more, nothing less.  </p></speech>
