Claims have been made recently in the media regarding fire-sales of NAMA assets.  I am a member of the Committee of Public Accounts for four years and, since NAMA came in to this committee, the sale of assets and the timeliness of the sale of assets has been a point of debate.  At the first meeting I made the case that, given the projections for an improved commercial and residential market, some caution should be applied and we should wait until the markets improved before disposal of assets.  As time has gone on, it was my understanding that, in some cases, NAMA was being criticised for not selling certain assets as quickly as some people would have liked.  NAMA was caught between a rock and a hard place - on the one hand having to bring money in to the Exchequer and on the other hand, noting the improvements in the housing and commercial market, holding onto serious assets that would improve in value as time went on.  For the people who work out of the Comptroller and Auditor General's office, within NAMA, that is part of their review, part of what they do when it comes to the correct time to sell assets.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General have a view on what Deputy Wallace has said recently or is it something that the Comptroller and Auditor General's office is engaged in on a regular basis?</p></speech>

I have not followed the debate in the Chamber.  Reference was made to embedded staff.  That is not a term I would use.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.22" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#B01700"><p>That was my term, I apologise.</p></speech>

The audit team there is focused on the correctness of the financial statements.  That is what they are working on at any stage.  We have reported separately in a number of special reports which go more to the question of what is the correct strategy and the correct timing of disposals.  In the financial statements one just tries to capture what is happening, not why it happens or whether it is the best approach.  We produced the tri-annual review for the period 2010 to 2012.  The second tri-annual review, provided for in law, is for the years 2013 to 2015.  We are just starting the work in relation to that.  I would expect that to deal with questions around the rate of return on disposals made, or assets that were held and invested in.  Ultimately the issue, and strategy being adopted, is a matter for the board of NAMA and it is a policy matter.  To a certain extent I cannot get involved in the pros and cons of what is the correct strategy.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.24" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#B01900"><p>That is fine, but the Comptroller and Auditor General does look at the rate of return?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#B02000"><p>When NAMA was at this committee last, I recommended that it adopted target rates of return for the overall portfolio and for individual projects.  NAMA disagreed with that recommendation so it is an issue that I will return to in the next review, but the committee had a discussion with NAMA about the merits of having a rate of return.  NAMA does have financial return measures but I believe they are too broad and do not really go into the project economics of any individual investment or divestment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#B02100"><p>The question then arises, from what the Comptroller and Auditor General has said, if he has a policy disagreement with NAMA, regarding the rate of return and how broad or narrow it should be - and he made that clear at the last meeting.  In the special reports that have been completed, has he found any evidence of a fire-sale as such - maybe put the term fire-sale aside - has he found any evidence of assets being sold at a lower rate, a rate that he believes was too low?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.27" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#B02200"><p>No. That is not a judgment that would be made in relation to any individual assets.  We have drawn attention to the fact that the disposal is at a faster pace than was originally expected by NAMA itself.  The reasons put forward as to why it doesn't want to set rates of return was that it could compromise NAMA's ability to be flexible in decision making and to take what it perceives to be commercial opportunities.  I do not particularly see the conflict in having a target and in the ability to respond to commercial opportunities as they arise, within the rates of return targets one wants to achieve.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#B02300"><p>Has the Comptroller and Auditor General found, in the special reports, evidence of any particular, singular assets being sold at a rate that, in his opinion, would be too low?  Can he confirm that he does have a difference of opinion with regard to NAMA's flexibility and that he believes NAMA could preserve that flexibility within the rates of return parameters which he suggested?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.29" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#B02400"><p>On the second point, yes, definitely. On the first point I believe our focus in the past has been on whether or not NAMA was selling assets at the best estimate of market rates. We did find cases where it had not engaged in a public competition for disposal of certain assets, but there were particular circumstances in some cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.30" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1091" speakername="John Deasy" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#B02500"><p>Is the Comptroller and Auditor General recommending that all the sales be held by public auction?</p></speech>

I am just speaking from memory now.  It is obviously a while since I looked at it.  There was one disposal where the original competition fell apart and I think a second bidder came in and made an offer, and the deal was done on that basis.</p> <p>  I think there were other circumstances - very often I think where there was a public body or maybe a charity involved - where there was not actually a market at the time and where they would have sought a valuation and said, "Our estimate of the market value of this property at the moment is X and if you match X, we'll sell it to you".  So in lieu of a competition there was a market testing of the value of the property.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.35" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1006" speakername="Joe Costello" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#C00300"><p>We discussed this when Department of Finance officials appeared before the committee a few weeks ago.  I extended the discussion from IBRC to NAMA because of the possibility of the linkage there.  Given that NAMA was established in 2010 with a ten-year remit, we are now 50% of the way through.  As no market existed at the time and NAMA was seeking to bring about a market and therefore obviously prices were very low compared with that they might be later, I asked whether it would now be appropriate to have a review of the NAMA remit from 2010 to 2020.</p><p>The Secretary General went into considerable detail as to how the Department was in two minds as to whether this would be an appropriate way to move forward.  The officials indicated that NAMA was now engaged in more strategic developments, such as the docklands SDZ development which will be over a seven to 15-year period.  Some of the NAMA developments are no longer individual activities, but are strategic funds involving investment over a period of time.</p><p>They had an open mind as to how NAMA should go forward.  It might be no harm for the committee to ask them - and NAMA - to give us a written response.  NAMA has indicated that it intends to push ahead with disposing of the impaired assets so that it would have completed its work by 2018 rather than 2020.  From the point of view of this committee looking at the best interests of taxpayers' money, is it a good thing that NAMA should move ahead rapidly to dispose of the impaired assets?  There is now a considerable market, both domestic and international, and there is huge demand for Irish impaired assets.  Huge profits are being made, as we saw with the recent Clerys debacle where 100% profit was made in the space of three years.  While that was not a NAMA building <i>per se</i>, it happened in the context of the collapse of the property market.</p><p>Perhaps we should ask both NAMA and the Department of Finance to give their views as we are now at the mid-term of the NAMA period for dealing with what the Taoiseach referred to as the largest disposal of assets in the western world.</p></speech>

I call Deputy Dowds on the same issue.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.37" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1011" speakername="Robert Dowds" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#C00500"><p>I agree with Deputy Costello that it would be good to get a written response from NAMA.  Is the Comptroller and Auditor General aware that assets put on the market are open to competition in a way that might not have been possible earlier in the process when nobody wanted to bid for anything?</p></speech>

As to evidence, no.  I think I would reserve judgment on that until I have carried out the triennial review.  I think we will go to market to look for somebody to assist us with, basically, project economics and disposal of bank assets.  I think that is something that would be useful for us to have for that examination.</p> <p>  I would envisage that we would take a sample of assets, both loans and-or property that was disposed of by NAMA and look at the decision-making process to dispose in those cases, as well as looking at a sample of those cases where NAMA has held assets and agreed to invest in them and to look at what kind of return it is expecting to yield from those.</p></speech>

I do not anticipate second-guessing the decision NAMA has made.  So it will not be looking back on it with the benefit of hindsight and suggesting what it should have done because that is not the situation they are in.</p><p>For example, what I will be trying to do is to look at, "You made a decision on, 1 March, what was the process that led you to that decision.  How do you set it in your overall strategy?  I am not going to be trying to second guess whether you should have sold that property or you should not."</p></speech>

When it appeared here before us, its delegation stated that it intended to make a profit of roughly &euro;1 billion.  Surely that is the rate of return that they are talking about and so long as they make a profit they have fulfilled the remit for which NAMA was established.  It considers it is doing its job.  However, the real question in my view should be whether at this point in time when we are halfway through that period whether that is the way we should be looking at it and whether the Government should be looking at something different than what was envisaged in 2010.</p></speech>

One way it can be benchmarked is if they pay &euro;34 billion and their costs are &euro;4 billion over ten years and they make &euro;39 billion then there is a surplus and that is a financial return.  The question is whether it is the best financial return.  It is left to NAMA and for this committee in debate with NAMA, to set the objectives and to set the framework and for the committee to decide whether it is satisfied that the way they are measuring the financial return is the best financial return for the State, not for NAMA itself.  It is quite a complex process and the committee has had this debate with them.</p></speech>

Our target date is some time in September for both issues raised by Deputy Collins and the other issues about NAMA raised generally.  On the same issue I draw the attention of the members of the committee to correspondence received last week.  While we are do not and are not supposed to deal with individual cases, it is difficult to avoid them when they raise the issues that all the members have raised this morning.  Even on the recent sale of property which a Dublin sporting organisation was interested in, it is difficult to explain how the social dividend is supposed to operate.  Second, relative to the correspondence before us today, I draw the attention of members to the public document from Patrick and Pauline Coughlan who say that at this stage NAMA owes them &euro;1.7 million while everyone else has been paid.  They raise that issue.  They also point out that, "It is basically bully-boy tactics by doing what they want.  'There is nothing you can do about it and don't be bothering us any more'".  Essentially that is their description of what happened to them in NAMA.  The final sentence refers to the loss to the taxpayer.  When one reads correspondence like that I believe there is an onus on NAMA to explain the circumstances relative to this individual case or any other case or their general approach to these things that would give rise to people believing that they are owed &euro;1.7 million and believing that they are being bullied into a position, the taxpayer is not getting money and that for some reason the State is using its vast resources to deal with a citizen or with a small business by use of a sledgehammer.  I do not think that is what NAMA was intended for.  In my opinion it is reasonable for the committee to ask in general terms all of what has been asked by the Deputy and for a response to the accusations contained in that letter dated 5 June 2015.  We will deal with these matters in September.</p> <p>  Turning to matters arising from last week's meeting, we dealt with correspondence from Jim Breslin, Secretary General of the Department of Health regarding allegations of abuse of children with intellectual disabilities in a foster home in the south east.  That matter is being dealt with in a letter dated 5 June 2015 in which they say a senior counsel is to conduct an independent examination of the process used by the HSE in commissioning the Devine and Resilience Ireland reviews and the adequacy and approach taken to the conduct of the two exercises.  I am not quite sure whether that is just in relation to the procurement process itself or if it will go beyond that but at least a senior counsel has been approved.  Next week we will deal with a short report on procurement relative to the HSE and we will publish that on Wednesday presumably, with the other reports.</p> <p>  I refer to correspondence deferred from last week from Mr. Tom Boland, CEO of the Higher Education Authority.  This relates to a matter raised by Deputy Connaughton about the &euro;436,000.  Does Deputy Connaughton wish to comment?</p></speech>

I want to ensure that the HEA will receive the correspondence and that people will be able to attend the meeting who have a knowledge of that case in order to explain it.  There remain many questions as to how the cost was arrived at, why there was no strict terms of reference and the issues arising from that letter.  Will someone from the HEA who knows the situation inside out be here on 9 July?</p></speech>

On 9 July we are dealing first with the Cork VEC report and subsequently with the HEA and the third level sector.  I suggest that along with those officials that we should have someone from the colleges in this instance because of the &euro;436,000.  Certainly we should examine the agenda for that day in case someone else is required from a specific college.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Correspondence received since our meeting of 11 June 2015 includes correspondence from Mr. Robert Watt, Secretary General of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform re submission of accounts and laying of reports.

They were certified by me at the end of December 2014.  I draw attention to, essentially, the board's reasoning behind the preparation of financial statements on the going-concern basis and they are satisfied that remains appropriate.</p> <p>  Also, the statement on internal financial control outlines measures taken by Bord na gCon to improve its procurement functions.  I have reported previously on a fairly systemic practice within Bord na gCon not to have competitive procurement but they are putting steps in place to rectify that.</p> <p>  County Louth VEC was there as well for the 2013 financial statements.</p> <p>  No. 4.3 is the Health Service Executive 2014 annual report and financial statements certified on 19 May.  There is a clear audit opinion but attention is drawn to disclosures in the financial statements.  The first one relates to an ongoing problem with compliance with procurement guidelines and regulations, which they disclose in the statement of internal financial control.  There was also a case, which they report on, of non-compliance by the Health Service Executive with the tax code, and they have made a settlement which is provided for in the 2014 financial statements.  At the time, they had not actually made a final agreement with Revenue in relation to that.</p></speech>

They may be in a position now to disclose the figure having made a settlement.</p> <p>  Then the final point drawn attention to there is that we identified in the course of the audit that the HSE had not fully complied with legislation in respect of late payment of invoices - there was a change in the legislation in 2013 which they did not implement properly - they have charged an additional &euro;9 million was charged to the income and expenditure account to recognise the expected cost of compensation due to suppliers.</p></speech>

There was originally a provision to pay interest on moneys that had not been paid to suppliers but, in addition, since 2013 there has been a further requirement to pay a compensation figure, and they did not implement that.  By the end of 2014, the total compensation that had not been paid to suppliers amounted to &euro;9 million.</p></speech>

In addition, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is the accredited paying agency for EU direct payments which amounted to &euro;1.4 billion in 2013.  These are accounted for separately from the Vote.  The Vote expenditure in 2013 was spread across four major expenditure programmes: &euro;327 million, or 27% of the total, was spent under the agrifood policy, development and trade programme; &euro;213 million, or 18%, was spent on the programme for food safety, animal health and welfare and plant health; &euro;412 million, or 34%, was spent on rural economy, environment and structural changes measures; and &euro;254 million, or 21%, was spent on schemes of direct payments to farmers.  Note 3 to the appropriation account provides further detail on the spending under each of the programmes.</p> <p>  Net expenditure under the Vote was around &euro;36 million less than provided for in the estimate for 2013.  With the agreement of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, &euro;16.8 million in unspent capital allocations under the rural economy, environment and structural changes programme was carried over to 2014.  The remainder of the surplus for the year, totalling &euro;19.4 million, was liable for surrender to the Exchequer.</p> <p>  The Department provides substantial funding each year for a number of public bodies that operate under its aegis.  These include: Teagasc, An Bord Bia, the Marine Institute, Horse Racing Ireland and Bord na gCon.  The Department is also directly responsible for management of the six statutorily-designated fishery harbour centres.  In the audit certificate for the Vote, I have drawn attention to the statement on internal financial control and the disclosure by the Accounting Officer that the Department procured goods and services under 19 contracts, to a value of just under &euro;5 million, that were not compliant with all relevant procurement guidelines.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.100" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#F00300"><p>I will briefly address some aspects of the Department's work in 2013 and then say something about the investigations division of the Department, as the committee has requested.  I will skip the first paragraph of my written submission as the Comptroller and Auditor General has just gone through the figures it sets out.</p> <p>  In 2013, having assumed the Presidency of the EU in January, Ireland successfully negotiated political agreement on the reform of the Common Agricultural Policy and the Common Fisheries Policy.  Leading these successful negotiations involved a huge effort within the Department in 2013 but the non-staff cost to the Department's Vote of the Presidency was only &euro;827,000.  The final shape of CAP focused on three key themes: sustainability, generational renewal on farms and greater market orientation.  The agreement also includes a range of flexibilities that allow member states to pursue targeted policies suited to their individual circumstances.  The end of milk and sugar quotas was confirmed and we largely protected our very large EU budget transfers on agriculture.  The new direct payment and rural development programme schemes will be of considerable benefit to Irish farmers, the agrifood industry, the environment and exports, and will provide an important basis for the further sustainable development of the agriculture sector.  Reform of the Common Fisheries Policy was also secured under the Irish Presidency and will allow for the rebuilding of fish stocks in European waters.  It will also reduce and eliminate discards where possible and aims to rebuild stocks to maximum sustainable yield.  The reforms agreed will govern the nature and operation of Irish and EU fisheries for the foreseeable future and are designed to usher in a new era of more economically, environmentally and socially sustainable fishing across EU waters.</p> <p>  During 2013, the Department continued to operate a wide range of schemes and initiatives which were of direct benefit to farmers and which also contributed to the development of an increasingly vibrant agricultural sector.  The sum of &euro;1.6 billion was paid to farmers in 2013 under the single payment, disadvantaged areas scheme and agri-environmental schemes.  The rural development, or CAP Pillar 2, payments are co-funded and made through expenditure largely through programme C of the Vote.  CAP Pillar 1 payments, such as the single farm payment, are fully EU funded and do not go through the Vote but are reported on in section 6.1 of the appropriation account.</p> <p>  At the beginning of 2013, the Department, working in close co-operation with the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, reacted swiftly to the equine DNA and mislabelling of beef issue.  FSAI survey results produced evidence of the presence of equine DNA at a high level in frozen beef burgers.  On receipt of the information from the FSAI, the Department immediately commenced an investigation to determine the source of the equine products focusing on the individual ingredients used in manufacture.  A number of these ingredients were imported into the State.  On the initiative of the Irish Presidency, EU Ministers agreed a DNA testing protocol and intensive testing of horses for phenylbutazone, or bute, across the EU.  The EU Commission committed to pursue an action plan over the remainder of 2013 and into 2014 which included specific actions and measures on fighting food fraud, testing programmes, horse passports, official controls and origin labelling.  It was because of the vigilance of Ireland&rsquo;s robust testing and control regime that what became a pan-European problem was exposed.  The robustness and transparency of our controls were again shown recently when a BSE case was identified through the Department's ongoing surveillance system, this time on fallen animals.  Overall the cost of the horse meat investigation was &euro;183,000, covering both the costs of the DNA testing and the bute testing of horses.  The figure does not include staff costs.</p> <p>  At the beginning of 2013, bad weather created major difficulties for some farmers.  The fodder transport scheme was introduced and was designed to reduce the cost to farmers of imported forage from outside the island of Ireland.  The aid substantially covered the cost of transport into the country, thus reducing the cost to farmers of a bale of hay by approximately one third.  While the scheme operated through co-operatives, marts and other approved agencies, the actual beneficiaries were over 18,000 farmers who needed urgent supplies of feed.  Total costs associated with the scheme amount to some &euro;2.8 million.</p> <p>  I turn now to the SIU issue.  The protection of food safety and animal health is a key objective of the Department.  This is a vitally important task in itself as it potentially impacts on the health of our whole population and it is also fundamental to the development of the agrifood sector.  It is, therefore, no accident that over half of our staff, which is 1,600 people, are employed in the food safety, animal and plant health pillar of the Department as shown in the Revised Estimates.  The agrifood sector employs over 170,000 people and last year produced record exports of over &euro;10.5 billion.  It is our most important industrial sector and is admired and respected internationally, not least in the over 170 countries to which we export our food and beverages.  It is also a sector that offers the strong prospect of further economic and employment growth in the years ahead.  This hugely important and successful industry is extremely susceptible to any breaches of our high food safety and animal health standards.  Our international reputation for high standards and transparency in this area is the key platform for our food exports.  It is therefore essential that the Department has a well-managed capacity to investigate potential breaches of food safety and animal health legislation and, indeed, potential instances of food fraud.  The investigations division, which incorporates the former special investigations unit, SIU, is one element in the Department's capacity to deal with this challenge.</p> <p>  The SIU was set up in the mid-1980s to provide specialist officers within the Department to investigate and deal with serious problems relating to use of illegal substances, such as angel dust, in animal production.  Apart from the risk to human health, the abuse of illegal growth promoters was posing a huge risk to the reputation of the Irish agrifood industry and needed to be addressed urgently.  This particular problem was dealt with quickly and successfully following a series of convictions.  The scope of the unit was subsequently extended to include legislation relating to TB and brucellosis, where very significant Exchequer funds were being spent, and other animal health and animal welfare legislation.  Its remit also extended to some investigations into potential fraud in relation to national and EU funds.  Apart from its success in dealing with the use of illegal growth hormones, the work of the SIU has made a significant contribution to the huge progress which we have seen over the past ten years in disease eradication, particularly in the case of brucellosis, which has now been eradicated, and BSE which, despite the recent case, has been controlled.  There has also been very considerable progress in the eradication of bovine TB, the incidence of which has been reduced to a record low level in the last number of years.   The progress achieved in eradicating these diseases has resulted in very significant savings to the national Exchequer.  For example, the cost, excluding staff costs, of implementing disease eradication schemes in the areas of bovine TB, brucellosis, BSE and scrapie amounted to &euro;180 million in 2002 but had fallen to &euro;38 million in 2014.  The SIU has also played important roles in dealing with the foot and mouth, dioxin and horsemeat issues in the last 15 years.</p> <p>  The inspections and investigations carried out by the SIU represent only a very small proportion of the inspections conducted by the Department.  Staff of the Department carried out over 41,000 inspections in 2014.  Over the past five years, the SIU or investigations division conducted some 607 investigations, of which only 58, or less than 10%, actually proceeded to prosecution.</p><p>However, where prosecutions were taken, the success rate has been very high - 90% in that period. </p><p> The payroll and travel and subsistence cost of the investigations division are relatively small and have reduced by almost 20% since 2008 - down from &euro;1.24 million in 2008 to &euro;964,000 in 2013 - mainly due to reduced staff numbers.  The legal costs incurred by the State in prosecuting cases arising from investigations by the SIU and by the Department generally are borne by the CSSO.  However, where the prosecution is unsuccessful and the costs incurred by the defendants are awarded by the court against the Department, these costs are borne by the Department, not the CSSO.  There were six such cases in the period 2006-2014 and the legal costs awarded by the courts against the State in these cases amounted to &euro;154,000.  However, in cases successfully prosecuted by the State, following investigations division investigations, during the same period, legal costs awarded by the courts to the State amounted to &euro;201,000 and my Department was awarded &euro;52,000 in expenses.  In addition, fines amounting to &euro;360,000 were imposed on defendants.  The committee has provided me with a report of a meeting held recently with seven people who made various allegations in relation to investigations division.  Unfortunately, a great deal of the information provided to the committee at that meeting was untrue and I will be happy to provide whatever additional information members need on these matters to allow them to make an informed assessment. </p><p> The Department has systems in place where people may bring complaints or appeals.  Generally these have not been availed of by the people whom members met.  I am also aware of serious allegations made against staff of the Department, which have been dismissed by the courts as having no substance, yet they continue to be made in the media and elsewhere.  I would like to make a few comments in this context. </p><p> First, a code of practice relating to the operations of the SIU, which codified previously existing guidelines, has been in place since February 2004.  Among other things, this provided for complaints to be dealt with through line management and, if necessary, subsequently through the quality service unit, which is a completely separate unit of the Department, with a separate line of management.  Complainants also have recourse to third party bodies such as the Office of the Ombudsman and, if necessary, the courts. </p><p> Second, the powers of officers in the SIU were the same as other authorised officials of the Department, contrary to what the committee was told.  They had somewhat similar powers to the Garda, with the important exceptions that they did not have powers of arrest and their powers are restricted to a very specific range of legislation.  This remains true today in relation to our investigations division and all other authorised officers of the Department. </p><p> Third, the investigative procedures adopted by the SIU complied with the standard requirements in regard to the taking and presentation of evidence and the rights of those being investigated.  They followed the same protocols as were used for criminal investigation carried out by the Garda and on many occasions investigations were carried out jointly with the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na </p><p> Decisions on whether a prosecution was warranted were made in consultation with the relevant division of the Department, the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and, where appropriate, the Director of Public Prosecutions.  The SIU investigated cases and, where appropriate, prepared files for prosecution.  It did not make the final decision to prosecute or to impose any administrative penalty.</p><p> Finally, the division works closely with many other State regulatory and enforcement bodies, including the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, the State Laboratory, the Revenue Commissioners, the Irish Medicines Board-HPRA, the State Forensic Laboratory, the Food Safety Authority of Ireland, and the various operational arms of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine itself.  It also works closely with the European Veterinary Enforcement Officers group and with colleagues from DARD Northern Ireland and the PSNI. </p><p> The Minister, Deputy Coveney, announced last September that a new investigations division would be established in the Department.  The Minister acknowledged the dedication and commitment of the staff who have carried out investigations in sometimes very challenging circumstance.</p><p> The intention with the new arrangement was to bring all of the Department&rsquo;s investigation capability into one division.  This has not yet been fully realised due to staffing constraints.  The investigations division includes the functions previously undertaken by the SIU. </p><p> The investigations division reports to a steering group chaired by the Assistant Secretary General for corporate affairs and including senior staff from a numbers of areas of the Department.  It includes the chief veterinary officer, another Assistant Secretary General, and the heads of legal services, internal audit and HR divisions.  This group reviews all new cases, determines whether the matter should be referred back to the relevant line division, investigated by investigation division or referred to an external agency, such as the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na.  The steering group oversees the conduct of investigations and, in conjunction with the head of the division, determines whether the submission of cases for prosecution is warranted.  A new code of practice for the division is currently being prepared by the steering committee. </p><p> The intention is that the new division will consist of a core group of full-time staff, with a range of skills and expertise, augmented as required by staff from other areas of the Department on temporary assignment on individual cases.  The moratorium on recruitment has meant that it has not been possible to date to implement this aspect of the new arrangements but it is hoped that some progress can be made in the near future in the light of a new and possibly more flexible system of staffing controls. </p><p> We aspire to high standards throughout our Department, and this reaches to all corners of our operation, including our various inspection and investigation systems.  Aspiring to excellence in this case certainly means continuing to give absolute priority to protecting the safety of our food and being unrelenting in pursuit of those who threaten the future of our most important industry and the health of our people.  It also means full adherence to the Civil Service code of behaviour, ensuring proper and proportionate procedures and committing enthusiastically to change. </p><p> I am happy to deal with any questions or comments members of the committee may have. </p></speech>

An animal died on farm.  We have a system where we assist with financial aid to remove animals over 48 months of age and then we sample the animals to see if there are any traces of BSE or other diseases.  In this particular case, BSE was found in one animal.  Tests have been carried out to confirm that and at present we are awaiting two further confirmatory tests.  That full epidemiological investigation is underway to determine both whether other animals that are related to that animal have it, and potential causes and so on.  That investigation will probably take some time.  It is ongoing.</p></speech>

I will not speak for other members but I found what I heard at that meeting quite shocking.</p><p>I come from a farming background and that is why some of the material I have heard is hard to fathom or take in.  Let us go back to the start.  How many people are in the special investigations unit?  How many people are on that team? </p></speech>

It has decreased in recent years because of staffing restrictions.  There are eight in our unit but if one wants comparisons, there are 17 in the Northern Ireland unit.  I know comparisons have been made with the Department of Social Protection and the Revenue Commissioners and their approaches as well.  The investigation unit of the Department of Social Protection consists of staff of the Department and garda&iacute;, and there are 111 people involved.  The investigations and prosecutions division of the Revenue Commissioners has 150 people.  Our unit is small.</p> <p>  The context I set out in the opening statement is important in the sense that the unit is only one element.  It is difficult to separate the investigations division from the rest of our processes around inspections, controls and so on.  A great many of our staff are involved in this.  I mentioned that in the Revised Estimates there are the staff numbers for each of the four programmes.  Under the animal health, food safety and plant health programme we identify 1,600 staff as being involved.  That includes a huge swathe of our inspection staff, veterinary staff, many of our agricultural officers and the administrative staff who work with them.  Members should see the eight staff in the SIU, or investigations division as it is now called, in that context.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.124" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#H00600"><p>There has been some change in staff numbers.  It is true that some of the staff have been there a long time.  This is a feature of the veterinary staff of the Department.  For a variety of reasons, including specialist expertise and geographic location, our veterinary staff are scattered throughout the country in individual locations.  This makes rotation of staff in areas a little more challenging on the veterinary side.  Furthermore, in the case of the investigations division, the issue of corporate memory arises and is particularly acute.  Cases take a long time to investigate, and, especially if they go to prosecution, to come to court.  In fact, delays in this area are among the criticisms made of the State, with some justification.  Changing staff can be challenging in that respect.</p> <p>  Nevertheless, the Department has a mobility policy in respect of its staff and it is a question of rolling that out.  There are new staffing arrangements.  Within the past two weeks we have got what is termed "delegated sanction" from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform in respect of our staffing.  I can go into what that means if the committee wishes, but basically it promises a somewhat more flexible arrangement than the existing or previous scenario with a moratorium on staff recruitment.  Obviously, a moratorium on staff recruitment makes any mobility of staff doubly difficult.  We need to bring people in and double up staff in some of more the complex areas rather than simply moving someone out and moving someone else in on the same day.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Driscoll made the point that a good deal of memory has been built up and it is a historical thing.  One of the issues we have heard about is to the effect that this group is out of control, that it is a small group of people who work among themselves, that they are answerable to no one and that they are left on their own to do their own business.  This adds to the feeling that these people have been there for a long time, they have a grudge against someone at this stage and that they can continue to work in any way they see fit.</p></speech>

No unit of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is out of control or operates on its own.  We are a chain of command, like every Department.  I am the Secretary General.  I have my Assistant Secretaries and chief veterinary officers reporting to me.  These people work within a chain of command.</p> <p>  I set out in my opening statement how significantly misleading information has been given to the committee about the powers of the SIU and how it operates.  For example, the impression is given that the SIU makes a decision to prosecute and, therefore, is in a position to, as it were, go after people, but it does not make that decision on its own.  This is made clear in the Office of the Chief State Solicitor statement to the Committee of Public Accounts.  In the case of prosecutions generally what happens is that a file goes to the CSSO or the Director of Public Prosecutions, in which case it is the DPP who makes the decision to prosecute.  If it goes to the CSSO, counsel is appointed by the Attorney General.  The counsel examines the case and recommends whether it is fit for prosecution.</p> <p>  It has also been suggested to the committee that the unit has special powers, far beyond what everyone else has.  This is completely untrue.  Those involved have the same powers as all authorised officers in the Department in respect of the legislation for which the Department is responsible, no more and no less.  They are significant powers.  We are protecting food safety and animal health.  They include powers of search and so on.  That is why I said in my statement they are similar to the Garda but not as extensive - they cannot arrest people.  They cannot search a house without getting a search warrant, except in a very rare circumstance.</p></speech>

Land eligibility is an important issue.  One of the reasons we are facing a potential disallowance - a large one - is because of land eligibility issues.  The committee may raise this with me at some point.  The initial estimate from the Commission was over &euro;180 million.  Therefore, it is a very important issue.</p></speech>

Under the system we now have in place, with the steering committee and the investigations division, a case would come into the steering committee, unless it was very urgent.  Some things might need immediate action.  For example, sometimes the Garda might approach us, in which case we need to react on the spot and quite quickly.  The head of division would do that and subsequently refer the case to the steering committee.</p> <p>  One of the important changes we have introduced is that the steering committee takes on two core functions.  One is to decide what should be investigated by the investigations division, as opposed to other line divisions of the Department.  I will come back to this in a moment.  The second function is to make a decision about when something should go to prosecution.  In the case of a question of whether something should be done by a line division of the Department, investigations are also conducted by our local veterinary structures.  This happens all the time.  One particular case has received a good deal of publicity.  It is relatively recent and is, therefore, in my mind.  However, it has nothing to do with the SIU or investigations division.  It was conducted by our district veterinary office staff and regional veterinary office staff.  They can conduct investigations as well.</p> <p>  The reason the investigations division was set up originally related to angel dust.  One of key motivating factors was the recognition that our staff did not generally have the kind of skills needed to ensure, for example, a good chain of evidence and the type of things that garda&iacute; are meticulous about and have experience of.  An officer might take a sample.  If the case is going to end up in court, not alone does he have to take the sample in the right way and test it in the right way and so on but there must be a meticulous chain of evidence.  He must know where the sample was at every moment and so on.  He would also need to know clearly what his powers of search are and so on.  In the particular circumstances around the angel dust scare, the view was that it would be useful to establish a division that had particular technical expertise in the veterinary area as well as expertise in gathering evidence and working with the Garda.</p><p> A number of the cases the committee heard about involved the illegal movement of animals.  If one hears of somebody moving animals in a way that is not in accordance with the rules I can understand that to the layman in particular it may not sound that serious, but our animal identification and movement system is the heart and soul of our controls of animal health.  Illegal animal movements were at the heart of some of the most costly major outbreaks of disease this country has seen.  Animal identification and movement controls are absolutely central to all of this.  Some of the cases are connected with a real concern that existed at one point about a good deal of breaching of that going on, so much so that my predecessor's predecessor took the unusual step of writing to the Chief State Solicitor's office, CSSO, identifying this as a significant concern and stating we would need to take strong action in the area to protect our animal identification and movement systems.  Some of the cases the committee has heard of directly related to this era.  It is some time ago now, and there has been quite a bit of water under the bridge since then.</p></speech>

A list of strategic risks facing the country was released recently by the Government.  I believe there are approximately 20.  One of them is a food safety breakdown.  One, identified on its own as a major risk facing the country, is antimicrobial resistance, which is about antibiotics and their overuse in human health and also the illegal use of antibiotics in foodstuffs.  This is a major global concern because it creates antimicrobial resistance in human beings.  Angel dust was a growth promoter.  Other growth promoters were involved in the cases mentioned and so were antibiotics, giving rise to the risk of antimicrobial resistance.</p></speech>

After a TB test, the vet returns after four days.  The animal may have a high reading and the lumps are there.  My experience of this a number of years ago was the vet said there was a problem and within a couple of days somebody came to destroy the animal.  The story we got in some of these cases was this procedure was not followed and there was a heavy-handed approach with lads piling in on top of cattle and farms within hours.  I am trying to distinguish between what the witnesses were told and how the process started.  What I have just explained happens on many farms throughout the country because of TB and brucellosis.  Unfortunately, it is a daily occurrence.  At what point did the Department make the decision in one or two of these cases that there was much more going on and that it had to get in much quicker?</p></speech>

I think it preceded them slightly.  We had a genuine worry about our animal identification and movement systems being circumvented.  We acted on this.  We wrote to the CSSO and said we would move to prosecutions in the area and we alerted the CSSO to the need for legal support for this.  The Deputy is right.  We identified there was a significant problem in the area and we had to move to solve it.  Much of this subsequently centred on the activities of one company and people and farmers associated with it.  Successful prosecutions were brought against the company and a range of farmers.</p></speech>

Successful prosecutions were brought against the company and several farmers relating to the issue of movement, thanks to the work of the special investigations unit, SIU, as it then was.  In the case of one individual who was centrally involved, he had a 50% share as I understand it and was director of the company involved.  The company was successfully prosecuted on five counts, so he was, in that sense, convicted.  In his individual cases, he took a long series of legal challenges against the legal basis on which he was charged and a series of other technical legal challenges over a long period of time.  This very substantially delayed the cases against him.  As the Deputy knows, it finally became the subject of a settlement which I would be happy to-----</p></speech>

In the case of one of the individuals who appeared before the committee, he was convicted of a very serious offence.  Again, we are speaking about the use of illegal products, in this case in pigs.  Pigmeat is very widely eaten in this country and everybody has sausages and rashers for breakfast.  We are talking about illegal products, a carcinogenic and a genotoxic.  We are talking about a product that the EU decided was a cancer-causing agent.  We are talking about something that was genotoxic.  Thalidomide was genotoxic.  This is serious stuff.  Let us be very clear about this.  This is why I am adamant on certain issues.  In this particular case, he was charged and convicted.  To be perfectly honest, it was an open and shut case.  It went to appeal and we did not defend the appeal.  The reason we did not defend the appeal has nothing to do with the substance of the case.  It was because in the intervening period the Supreme Court had decided the Minister did not have the right under the legislation to make and amend regulations.  It was a legal point.  Therefore, the legal basis on which the conviction had been secured no longer existed.  We could not defend the appeal.  I want to make it very clear the decision had nothing to do with the substance of the case.  When the substance of the case was tried in court he was found guilty.</p></speech>

The committee was again told an absolute untruth and lots of them.  I will speak about the case, which is particularly disturbing, and I can understand that anybody looking at the video would be disturbed.  Most lay people would never have seen animals slaughtered.  I have in my career from time to time.  It is never a pleasant experience, to be frank.  It is certainly particularly difficult for somebody who is not used to it.</p><p>We had found that the farmer had used a carcinogenic and genotoxic product on the pigs.  He agreed, in a statement made under caution, that he had done so.  This was not contested.  The animals had to be taken out of the food chain.  They could not possibly be put into the food chain so they had to be taken out of it. </p><p> I was out of the chain on all of these issues.  However, I have gone back over the papers on this as best I can.  The Department wrote to the individual concerned and told him that the animals had to be taken out of the food chain and should be slaughtered in an approved slaughter plant.  The farmer concerned then took actions in the High Court and the Supreme Court to try to overturn our decisions.  He lost and then approached us - I have the letter, which I have read - saying that he wished to carry out the slaughter on the farm using a humane killer, a captive bolt gun, and that he had the skills to do this.  We then assessed him as best we could, that is to say, some of our vets visited the farm and observed him killing pigs.  There were, I believe, about 4,000 pigs on the farm.  I should say that on a farm of that size the farmer would be well used to killing pigs.  It is normal practice if there is a sick pig or whatever that a farmer will kill it.  Therefore, one would expect him to be reasonably expert in using a bolt gun of this sort.  The farmer was assessed by our staff and found to be very capable of doing the job, both physically and mentally, as much as our staff could observe the mental issue.  He certainly had the expertise and certainly carried out the task correctly when observed.</p><p> We then moved to agree to the farmer doing it and we supervised as much of the slaughter as it was possible for us to do at the time.  My understanding is that we directly supervised about 25% of the slaughter.  During that time, he carried out the work meticulously.  In fact, our assessment from staff was that he achieved, if one likes, a hit rate on the animals, that is to say, immediate slaughter with the first shot, of between 98% and 99%, which is extremely high.  This is similar, as I understand it, to what would have been achieved in approved slaughter plants at the time.  He was also observed to carry out the slaughter very correctly.  There is material on file at the time of him approaching the pig from behind, stabilising the pig, applying the humane killer and firing.</p><p> The humane killer he was using was a particularly powerful one.  It was sufficient to kill a 600 kg bovine and the maximum charge was being used.  The maximum chance of an immediate kill was achieved with what was being done and he was doing it properly.  Of course, this does not accord with what is depicted on the video.  The video is approximately six and a half minutes long and from my observation yesterday, the clip in which the farmer is shown killing a group of pigs is one minute long.  It shows six pigs in the killing pen.  Our staff observed the farmer normally having about ten or even 12 pigs in that pen.  Obviously, if one has more pigs in the pen, they are more stable because they are up against one another and it, therefore, makes it easier to apply the humane killer and kill.  In that video, he got one of the shots obviously badly wrong.  This could have been one of the 1% that we had observed him getting wrong, which happens, I am afraid.  He shot another pig once and then very quickly shot it a second time.  He obviously made a decision that he may have not completed the task but there is no evidence that the pig was in any particular distress or whatever, at least I could not see any such evidence.  I am not a professional but our professional staff have looked at this. </p><p> Can I say something else?  This is an important point for anybody who may, unfortunately, have to watch that video.  I am informed by our expert staff that when one kills a pig, it is completely normal for it to make a paddling motion with its four legs.  This is known as a clonic movement.  It is normal and does not mean the pig is alive.  It is a particular feature of pigs that immediately after death, they make this paddling motion with their legs.  That, in itself, is not a concern.  In so far as we can see what he was doing, the farmer was doing the job well and correctly and showed no personal signs of distress.  He also did not complain to our staff at the time.  He had requested to do this in the first place and displayed a capacity to do it.  As far as we could see, therefore, the thing was being done right.  The video shows at least one pig being slaughtered improperly but more than 4,000 pigs were slaughtered.  </p></speech>

A good example is what I have just said about the appeal.  It is not untrue to say that the case failed on appeal but it is very important to understand why that happened.  We did not contest the appeal because the legal provision had failed at that point.  We could not contest the appeal if it was not about the substance.  This is an area where a kind of truth was told to the committee but without context.  However, some very serious and scandalous stuff was said about some of our staff.</p></speech>

This process was airily dismissed in some of the evidence given to the committee.  Every year, thousands of farmers use our internal appeals process, as the Deputy will know, on payments and so on.  In the case of payments, 34% of appeals on our internal appeals system are successful.  Very importantly, there are also independent appeals systems.  The Ombudsman is available.  It has been argued that an agriculture ombudsman should be established.  The Ombudsman is in place and has the remit.  What then are we talking about?</p> <p>  To address an extremely important issue, some of the allegations made by these people against our staff are criminal offences.  We have the Garda to investigate criminal offences.  Did they go to the Garda?  Did members ask them?  This is an interesting point.  I know of one of them who went to the Garda but the complaint was dismissed.  In some of the other cases, the issues have been raised in various forums and thrown out.  These issues have been recycled again and again and I understand the reason they make headlines. </p></speech>

I define that as being the best in the EU.  We operate in a part of the world with the highest standards in this area so if we are the best in the EU we are probably the best in the world.

We are not deaf.  As part of our approach to constant improvement in the Department, it is quite possible that these changes would have been brought in anyway.</p> <p>  The first of the two areas where I have given some emphasis to the role of the new steering committee is the reference for the case for investigation.  As it happens, when this issue was discussed by senior management in the Department, it was I who raised it.  I suggested it would be an important function.  It was put into the terms of reference of the steering committee.  The second area was the decision to prosecute, about which, again, there has been a lot of public commentary.  The public commentary is without merit because we prosecute in so few cases.  With regard to investigations division cases, one is looking at in the order of ten prosecutions per year.  Given the kind of stuff it investigates, the number is very low.  In the great majority of cases, the decision is taken not to prosecute.  Why?  The view is taken that while something may have happened here, the nature of it is such that it would not merit a prosecution.  There might be some other kind of sanction we could impose, or it might be that the evidence is not strong enough, or we might find, on investigation, that we believe there was nothing happening.  We prosecute in very few cases.  However, we did put the steering committee in place to act as a second pair of eyes to reassure people.</p></speech>

That contradicts not only the six or seven cases we heard, to which I will come back in a moment, but also the views of the current IFA president, Mr. Eddie Downey.  He has stated in public repeatedly that the unit that Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll lauds &ldquo;rode roughshod over the rights of hard-working farmers&rdquo;.  That was a view held by his predecessor, Mr. John Bryan, who was very critical of the unit.  I have a report from the end of 2013 and it is stated the Minister, Deputy Coveney, was at an IFA meeting in Cork, heard the many complaints and the reiteration of the IFA position and told the delegation that such conduct by the SIU was not acceptable and that he would have matters fully investigated.  I want to put it to Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll and put on the record that the account he has given of the SIU certainly does not reflect the account or experience of many others.  I refer to the cases we have heard about directly and more broadly within the farming community.  Does Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll accept that?</p></speech>

It was one of the 10% of cases that fail.  Why did it fail?  It failed in the court because an issue in relation to a brucellosis test arose.  The State&rsquo;s case was actually about a TB test but, in the course of the court case, matters took a swerve towards a brucellosis test which was never part of the State&rsquo;s case, and ultimately the case collapsed around the issue of the brucellosis test.  I have read significant sections of the court transcript &ndash; not all of it &ndash; and that seems clear.  The judge did make two core negative comments, in my view.  First, she said the approach by the Department had been heavy-handed.  Second, she criticised one of our key Department witnesses-----</p></speech>

In the case of this gentleman, Mr. Douglas Fannin, it has been through the courts, he has been vindicated and you can take whatever view you take on this matter but that is, with the greatest respect, largely irrelevant at this juncture.  What he had to say about the carry-on of the investigations unit in this case was very shocking.  Judge Reynolds took the view also that the officials were, as you say, heavy handed.  Mr. Fannin gave us chapter and verse of what it looks like when this unit is heavy handed and it did not make for pleasant listening.  Mr. Fannin gave evidence of the impact that it had on him, his family and his, son who is also a farmer but now in New Zealand and not contributing to this strategic sector in this country.</p> <p>  I understand that you are anxious to give the context for this but I find your approach not just defensive but dismissive of what happened to this man.</p></speech>

I am not in any way dismissive of the comments of Judge Reynolds.  They are important comments.  I fully take them on board and I do not contest them in any way.  In referring to the brucellosis I was trying to give the Deputy an understanding of why the case fell.  As well as knowing that it fell, it is also important to know why the case fell.</p></speech>

There are allegations in the report of your meeting that our witness gave false information.  That is not true.  It is true, the judge said he was a very difficult witness but there is a world of difference between those two things.  What happened with our witness is that over four and a half hours of questioning it is clear he became entangled in an argumentative relationship with the defence counsel - that is uncontested and that is what the difficulty refers to.  As to the heavy handedness, the judge was not specific as to what she meant by that or what exact aspect of the issue she was referring to.  It is relevant that a whole series of judges, State solicitors, etc., have complimented the SIU.</p></speech>

The understanding was not that it would involve incorporation but a brand new dawn for investigations.  The Minister was moved to that action for some reason.  I have already cited the IFA who, I think we both acknowledge, are experts in the field of agriculture and the experiences of farmers.  He was moved also by the outcome of this particular case, that of Mr. Douglas Fannin in Cavan, and made the changes which some now regard as cosmetic and which Mr. O'Driscoll has described in detail.  We do not seem to be getting off first base here because there is a fundamental clash, not just in the evidence of the cases we have heard but in the actions of the Minister, the views of the IFA and your contention that actually everything was fine and there was no need to make any changes as the unit was exemplary.  That is your position.</p></speech>

What I said is that we are constantly making improvements in the Department and this is another set of improvements we are making, in terms of the extent of the responsibilities of the new investigation division and the governance structure of that division.  These are significant improvements and we want to strengthen our investigative capacity in the Department.  If you look at the Minister's statement you will see that he paid specific tribute to the investigations that had been carried out by our staff up to that point.  He also said the new investigation division was designed to bring all investigation capability, both internal and external, into one division headed by a senior supervisory veterinary officer supported by a team of investigators, some of whom are core members of the team while others are drawn from areas where their expertise will be beneficial.  I have said that we have not been able to fully implement that, though we have implemented the new governance structure around the investigations division and it is a very good governance structure.  I have not said at all that the change was not needed - change is always needed and we are constantly changing and improving our systems in the Department and this is one such area.  I would very much like to continue that process of change by expanding the skill range within the division and by setting up the arrangement as it was originally envisaged with a core group of staff and staff drawn from other areas of the Department.  For the time being, we have not been able to do that but I am all in favour of these changes.</p></speech>

I did explain that he was four and a half hours in the witness box and got into a tangle with the defence barrister who, I am sure, was also being robust.  In respect of the heavy-handedness, which I think is the thing the Deputy is pursuing, I am fully prepared to apologise for anything a judge has found in a particular case but I am just making the point that on that particular issue, I am not clear what she was referring to.

I will remain with this particular case.  I understand that in the course of the case, it came to light that a senior vet associated with the special investigations unit seized animals on 24 March 2009 and that these animals were put into the food chain.  The same vet subsequently made a sworn statement under oath at Bailieboro Garda Station on 7 July 2009 that the animals contained a toxic substance.  How did animals that were suspected of containing a toxic substance find their way into the food chain?</p></speech>

In the previous period, he received quite substantial sums.  The allegation in the State's case was that there was an attempt to produce false positives in a TB test.  False positives can be produced through all kinds of methods.  A TB test is carried out when tuberculin is injected into the animal's skin by a vet and a lump develops.  That lump is then measured.  We have come across many cases of all kinds of products being injected into animals to produce false positives, including water.  It does not necessarily need to be toxic.  I do not think there was ever a suggestion that a particular toxic substance was used.  The animals in this case passed both ante and post-mortem examinations and were deemed fit for the food chain.  There is nothing wrong with an animal which has had water or some other product like that injected under its skin.</p></speech>

I am aware of at least one of the Deputy's interlocutors who went to one of our senior staff and who could have been described as having made an appeal.  He directly contacted one of the most senior vets in the Department, which could be regarded as an appeal.  It was investigated by that senior vet and dismissed.  The individual did not really go through the process but it could reasonably be regarded as an appeal.  I do not know who goes to the Ombudsman unless the Ombudsman contacts us and looks for evidence but in the cases in front of the Deputy - she mentioned Mr. Fannin - we found nothing in our complaints or Ombudsman folders.  We have found FOIs on that and a data protection case.  In the case of another case involving a pig farmer, there are no files in our complaints or Ombudsman folders from him.

The special investigations unit, SIU, would not have made the decision; it would have been made at a higher level.  We made the decision because of a lack of options.  We had initially asked the farmer to slaughter at a registered plant.  He said he could not do it.  The reason is not entirely clear to me.  Probably, he could not find a plant that would do it, given that they would not want pigs that had carcinogens in them.  It also would have been costly for him to pay for it, and I do not think he was in a position to do it.  Therefore, I can understand why he approached us as he did and suggested to us that he was fit for it, had the expertise and could do it.  On-farm slaughter is normal.  During the 2000 swine fever outbreak in the UK, there was much on-farm slaughter of pigs.  There is nothing unusual about it.</p></speech>

We supervised only approximately 25% of the slaughter and we were very satisfied with how the farmer did it.  In retrospect, we would not do it again, and we have said this publicly.  There are many aspects of it we would not handle in the same way.  I would have reservations about a farmer and his assistants slaughtering 4,000 pigs.  The farmer had a number of assistants working with them and handling the pigs.  I cannot say we could never allow it again, given that one does not know what circumstances might arise.  However, if it were being done, the biggest difference, as recommended in the report, is that it should be under full supervision.</p></speech>

I want to turn to the appropriation accounts on which I have a number of questions.  Section 5.1 deals with allowances and overtime payments.  It sets out that 873 people were in receipt of overtime payments, with 83 receiving payments in excess of &euro;10,000.  The maximum payment was &euro;35,519.  Can the Department provide me with some guidance on that?  What person in the organisation and at what rank gets overtime to the tune of &euro;35,519?</p></speech>

As such, we would be paying permanently for two shifts and the cost could easily be more than the &euro;35,000 in that case.  The same applies in the other cases.  Many of the payments relate to this kind of instance.  Where an individual received &euro;35,000, I take the Deputy's point.  It seems slightly high.</p></speech>

I know that he is well aware that this has been a very troubled issue.  The new hen harrier provisions under the green low-carbon agri-environment scheme are much more generous to a much larger number of farmers than the old measures under the National Parks and Wildlife Service.  I think representatives of the service would fully agree with that assessment.  The new provisions will give a large number of farmers access to a sum up to &euro;7,000.</p></speech>

The European Commission told us in Brussels as recently as six months ago that no farmer should be penalised for practices on his or her lands put in place for the protection of habitats.  That is not happening in Ireland.  The Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine is penalising farmers where habitats have been imposed on them.</p></speech>

These elements are covered in the normal level 8 courses in the main universities such as UCD, but they were not present in all of the courses undertaken in other colleges, including Galway-Mayo Institute of Technology.</p><p>We had a process of discussion with them to define what additional training they would need to provide to their graduates or their current undergraduates.

They are tested very thoroughly in the assessment process.  No tag is perfect.  Obviously, companies that lose a tender are always going to feel, maybe genuinely, that their tag is better than the one that won, but all I can do is assure the Deputy that the process of testing is very thorough.  Lost tags are a significant issue.  I was present at the final negotiations on the farmers charter and this was an issue right up to the very end before agreement was reached with the farming organisations.  The issue was how many lost tags we would regard as minor if a farmer had ordered replacements.</p></speech>

I will go back to the case that was raised earlier concerning Tom Galvin in 2002.  I am dealing with the case.  Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll made a couple of points in response to Deputy McDonald.  He was asked if a similar situation occurred again whether he would act and conduct affairs in a similar way.  He suggested that he would probably not do that but one never knows.  That is significant.</p> <p>  Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll said the Veterinary Council vets were exonerated.  That is fair enough too.  It is a serious body of people.  That does not mean that things that happened were not done properly.  The fact that the vets were exonerated means they did not do anything wrong, but that does not mean things should have happened the way they did.  Locally, Tom Galvin is someone who is very well regarded.  The feeling locally is that the Department treated him poorly.  How a Department deals with issues is subjective.  Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll mentioned the risks and the threat when it comes to moving animals, whether they should be moved and general issues relating to disease, but there is also the question of treating someone fairly.  My subjective view having looked at the evidence is that he was treated poorly, regardless of the constraints the Department&rsquo;s officials might have been under when it comes to the rules and regulations dealing with animals suspected of being diseased or being allegedly fed things that would affect the food chain adversely.</p> <p>  The case has been in court for the past 13 years.  I suggest that we should deal with the issue in a non-adversarial manner.  I will deal with the facts as they occurred 13 years ago.  Mr. Galvin deserves that.  It might be the first time to deal with matters on that basis.  Perhaps Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll could paint the picture of when the Department officials first entered the farm and the reasons they did so.  As Mr. O&rsquo;Driscoll starts to paint the picture, I will ask him some questions along the way about testing, decisions made once the alleged carcinogen was detected, and the events that ensued following that.</p></speech>

I do not take that away from him.  That is not an issue for me.  Deputy Deasy is correct that I have also said that if we did this again, I am quite sure we would not do it in the same way in the same circumstances.  In particular, if we did allow on-farm slaughter by the farmer I think we would supervise the entire thing.  As to whether we would allow on-farm slaughter by the farmer at all, I do not know.  I am unwilling to say definitely not.</p></speech>

It strikes me that when all of this was being explained, nothing as weighty as that was considered.  I do not just refer to the threat of what could go into the food chain.  It amazes me that when it comes to the obvious and potentially devastating financial result that did occur, only 25% of the slaughter was supervised.</p></speech>

It really surprised me when I found that out.  That is a fair point.  I will just take that point.  I will make a point that relates to our responsibilities, namely, 100% of the disposal of the carcases was supervised.  That is why our non-veterinary staff-----</p></speech>

Notwithstanding the fact that it was potentially a very serious case in terms of the food chain and the devastation to the individual, there was no change in procedure when that occurred.</p></speech>

It is fairly understandable.  My understanding is that he went to a couple of abattoirs and they would not take the animals for the obvious reason that they probably said they did not want any potentially contaminated pigs going into the food chain and they did not really know what they were dealing with.  Ultimately, when it came right down to it, the Department constructively made that individual slaughter those pigs himself.  It was a question of money as well.  It was probably the case that if he brought the pigs to an abattoir that was willing to take them, it probably would have cost him an awful lot of money to have the 4,000 pigs slaughtered.  It was probably the cheaper option at the time, once the decree was issued by the Department to the farmer in question.  Is that fair enough?</p></speech>

In fact, I think that is what I said in reply to Deputy McDonald.  It is difficult at this distance in time to be absolutely certain about these things but my understanding is that either it was too costly for him to go to a plant or a plant was not willing to do it because of the implications.</p></speech>

There are a number of different ways that a pig can be slaughtered.  It can be done with an electric current and it can be done with a bolt, etc., where there is bleeding.  He would contend, as would Mr. O'Driscoll and the Department officials, that the bolt element part was done correctly.  Those pigs should have been bled singularly, individually, and given time, but that was not conducted properly.  Is it still the Department's contention that the slaughter was done absolutely correctly?</p></speech>

Again, I am not a veterinary expert but my clear understanding, and I have talked to all our senior veterinary experts about this, is that the use of a humane killer, as it is called, and as Mr. Galvin called it, for putting down a pig is normal, but one normally also has to hand what are called pithing rods.  Quite specifically in the report of our vets on the spot, they noted that he had pithing rods available to him.</p></speech>

What he did where this did not work was to immediately apply a second shot.  That can be seen on the video where with one pig it is not even clear that the first shot did not work but, clearly, he is looking at the pig and he fired a second shot.</p></speech>

When the Department thought about a resolution in terms of what it needed to do and what transpired after that, in those three months the farmer was left in a situation where obviously he could not trade.  Did the Department second-guess or have any thoughts with regard to what occurred after the fact, medicines being taken away from him, the fact that disease was spreading among those animals and the financial situation he was left in which ultimately led to his financial ruin?</p></speech>

One should remember that the Department had already asked him - I am certain of this - to slaughter the pigs.</p></speech>

If it was the case that the immediacy of this issue deserved quick action, I do not understand why the Department would let those pigs remain on that farm for three months.  Ultimately, it seems it was quite a haphazard approach by the Department when it came to, as Mr. O'Driscoll talked about earlier, threat and the absolute need to act to deal with matters, even back in 2002 when the late Mr. Joe Walsh was the Minister.  We know what the late Mr. Walsh dealt with in his Ministry.  The Department left these pigs on a farm for three months, barely monitoring it in some cases, took medicines away from him and allowed disease to spread.</p></speech>

That just would not be possible, but here is the option we would have had and it is another option.  We could have taken over the pigs and got them slaughtered, probably.  However, if we did that, our legal advice, as I understand it, at the time was that if we took over the pigs, we would end up having to pay compensation.</p> <p>  One should think of the situation that the Department was in.  From our point of view, we had found somebody who, innocently or otherwise, and I take Deputy Deasy's point about 1999-----</p></speech>

If we then had taken over the pigs, incurred the cost and paid large sums of compensation to the farmer, I think I would be in here on a very different and much stickier wicket.

One could make the argument that, for fairness reasons, it might have been the best option.  I do not expect Mr. O'Driscoll to comment on that but it might have been the fairer outcome.</p> <p>  I will tell Mr. O'Driscoll where I am going with this.  I understand he was not dealing with this in 2002 and some of the officials probably were not around or dealt with any of this.  I understand he has to act as the person who is making the case for the Department.  I did not realise a review was done in 2005.  I do not know what is in that review, but what is interesting for me is finding out today that Mr. Tom Galvin did not involve himself in that review.  My guess is that - I have not asked him about it - maybe there was a legal case pending.  Maybe there were issues and he was advised not to.  The new steering group should take another look at this.  The Department probably should take a look at the events surrounding this for the sake of fairness for the individual in question who was put out of business.  The pigs cost him &euro;690,000 and the disposal of them &euro;45,000, none of which has been recovered.  The Department at least should offer him the opportunity outside of an adversarial court setting to make his case in the new steering group that Mr. O'Driscoll has set up within the Department.</p></speech>

Thinking on my feet here, maybe the best I could do is to refer the report that was done in 2005 without Mr. Galvin's co-operation - I am not in any way signing him up for it - to the steering group for its consideration.  If Mr. Galvin wishes to make a further submission in his own right - he can see the report because I will be giving it to the committee - and if he wants to contest anything that is in the report or only present his own narrative, then I would be quite happy to ask the steering group to have a look at that.</p></speech>

As I said, in the case of the investigations division only a small proportion of cases move to prosecution in the first instance.  One can take it, therefore, that in those cases, we think the evidence is very strong.  It is possible that some counsel over the years have told us they do not think the evidence is strong and recommend against prosecuting, in which case I imagine we would follow counsel opinion.  I am not aware of such a case.</p></speech>

How many cases thereafter did the Department decide to go ahead with?

As regards the first of those cases, that is, a product which is legitimate but is held for evidential purposes, we would hold on to it as long as we need to for evidential purposes - it might be the court case or some other purpose - and then return it.

I wish to ask Dr. Beamish about the Common Fisheries Policy and tuna fishing off the north west of Ireland for recreational purposes.  I was at Mullaghmore during the week and know the area has great potential for recreational angling.  The pursuit was in decline due to the 2002-2009 reduced commercial quotas.  When the Common Fisheries Policy was reviewed did we receive a quota for recreational angling?  Can the matter be pursued?</p></speech>

One is albacore tuna fishing which is just starting its season and we have a substantial quota.  Albacore is a summer fishery.  Albacore tuna migrate northwards off our zone.  We have a quota in albacore tuna fishery and a track record in it.  It proceeds as a commercial fishery.</p></speech>

The stock has been under significant stress globally because bluefin tuna have been overfished.  Bluefin tuna is managed by an international body called the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tunas.</p><p>Japan, America, the EU, other countries are party to that body, which operates under a UN mandate.  That decides on the global regulations applying to bluefin tuna and other tunas.  The EU gets a quota under that, which, under EU law, has been divided out for many years on the same basis as that on which other stocks are divided, known as "relative stability".  Under this system, the overall quota available to the EU is distributed on the basis of track record.  Ireland has no track record on bluefin tuna fishing and, therefore, we are not allowed to have a directed bluefin tuna fishery.  A small quota is set aside at EU level for countries that do not have a directed bluefin tuna quota, which is available to all member states without such a quota for by-catches.  However, it is not directed.  It applies where one is caught accidentally when a boat is fishing for something else and it is very small.  Therefore, we cannot license and permit a directed bluefin tuna fishery.  We do not have a legal basis on which to permit such a fishery.  That is the overall situation regarding bluefin tuna.</p></speech>

It is amazing that we cannot just get a recreational licence for this fish.  It just comes to the north west for the summer months.  I know there is an application with the Department for a recreational licence for sea angling.</p></speech>

As it stands at present we cannot license and permit a directed bluefin tuna fishery, whether on a sea angling vessel or otherwise.  We have been exploring for some time whether there was any means of securing support at the EU and at the International Commission for the Conservation of Atlantic Tuna for the introduction of a scientific tag and release scheme and we have had some correspondence with the EU Commission on that issue.  However, no such scheme has been approved at this point.</p></speech>

It has gone to Europe.  The Ombudsman's office found the Department was liable.  It was stated in a very clear report that this payment should be made.  There may be other cases, but no other case went to this level.  If an independent officer of the State makes a recommendation, it is very similar to the Comptroller and Auditor General making a recommendation to the Department, and I sincerely hope that they are taken on board.  The liability was clearly established and it was stated that the compensation should be paid.</p></speech>

It was not a case of just an Ombudsman's report and then nothing happened.  There was a very full and thorough examination of this issue by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Like issues that have been spoken about before, there is a long history but there was a very lengthy examination of it by the Joint Committee on Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  There was a very large transcript of the evidence and information from all the officials going back to the time when the events happened in 1981 or 1982 and a scheme that was run in 1990 to the committee.  That committee came to its own conclusion.</p></speech>

We saw the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General on the Department and an account of the Department's discussion on legal fees.  The family did not take the litigation route because of the cost of legal fees.  The Department took legal advice, but this lady could not afford to take the risk of engaging a legal team.  With due respect to the family, it would be different if they went down the legal route.  They did not because they could not afford it.  The family went through the European Union channels and the Office of the Ombudsman who clearly established their case.</p> <p>  I think it is a poor reflection on the role of the Office of the Ombudsman.  I have no doubt that the Office of the Ombudsman has a legal team to advise it.  I think the case would be statute barred now but morally, the right thing is to pay the money.  The sum involved in not significant in any sense.</p></speech>

I am not contesting at all that this family have certain rights and the Office of the Ombudsman found in their favour.  I want to make that completely clear.</p> <p>  If my memory is correct and I think it is, after the then Minister made the decision he or she did on the recommendation of the Office of the Ombudsman, the next step was that the Ombudsman referred it to the Oireachtas and I think that is what happened.  It was a reference from the Ombudsman to the Oireachtas, then the discussion, which Dr. Cecil Beamish has spoken of happened in the committee.  </p></speech>

I said in my introductory remarks that we had 170,000 people employed in the agrifood sector and that we had reached record exports of &euro;10.5 billion.  That is before the removal of the milk quotas.  The opportunity arising for this country from the removal of milk quotas is absolutely staggering.  It is an enormous opportunity.  The Food Harvest 2020 committee estimated that we could increase production by 50% by 2020.  Right now what the dairy processors are telling me is that we are heading in that direction.  Milk prices are low at the moment and there is significant concern about that.  Nevertheless, our dairy farmers are gearing up and all of the indications are that milk production will grow very rapidly.</p> <p>  One core estimate has been done of the potential employment aspects.  It was carried out by an independent group chaired by a senior person from Teagasc.  The group came up with a figure of 25,000 jobs on average if all of the Food Harvest 2020 targets were met.  About 15,000 of those related to the dairy increase.  The Deputy will know about another study carried out by the Cork Institute of Technology which estimated the impact in Cork alone of 4,000 jobs.  We are currently awaiting the report of the agri-strategy 2025.  A committee of the industry carries out ten-year forward strategies every five years and these are done with the support of the Department.  We await that strategy which we expect to issue in early July.  It will look forward to 2025 and will push out another five years.  I have no doubt that there will be employment numbers in that strategy.</p></speech>

My question relates to Bord na gCon and the Indecon report and what seems to be a decision by the Department to close down Harold's Cross race track which is a profitable race track, one of the few profitable race tracks out of the total of 17 in the country.  The implementation of the Indecon report seems to be very selective.  Why should the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine want to close down one of the two race tracks in Dublin, considering other counties with far smaller populations have two race tracks, such as Cork and Tipperary?  Why close down a profit-making race track which had a 22% increase in profitability in the first quarter of 2015?  How does the Department expect the smaller loss-making race tracks will be funded considering that the surplus profit from the three profitable race tracks was ploughed into the loss-making tracks?  Why is there this requirement that Limerick race track must be saved at all costs?  Why was there such an extravagant expenditure there in the first place?  Why should Harold's Cross be going for the high jump because of wrong decisions in respect of other areas?</p></speech>

The Limerick stadium has been the subject of a report by the Comptroller and Auditor General and I have given some reaction to that report.  The Comptroller and Auditor General made significant findings many of which related to a period before our Department took over the responsibility for the track.  That is not to say I am washing my hands of it - rather, that those are the facts.  That report stands, as does our response to it.  The issue raised by the Deputy is more fundamental.  It relates to Harold's Cross but it relates more broadly to Bord na gCon.</p><p>Bord na gCon moved from having a surplus of &euro;525,000 in 2011 to a deficit of &euro;986,000 in 2014.  I think it has debts of about &euro;22 million.  In the light of all the issues that had arisen in Limerick and other issues, Indecon was brought in to conduct a study and make recommendations.  I think it made 27 recommendations, among which was a programme of asset disposals, clearly to improve the finances of Bord na gCon and its balance sheet.  To be absolutely clear, no decision has been taken by the Department of Agriculture, Food and Marine.  It is for Bord na gCon to go through the Indecon report and develop an implementation plan, which it has done.  It is working through it.  Among the things it will have to do is to make decisions on what it wants to do on the proposed sale of assets.  Under the 1999 Act, it has to obtain the consent of the Minister for Agriculture, Food and Marine and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform for the disposal of any property.  The sale of the track at Harold's Cross has been recommended by Indecon.  We have not at this point received any request from Bord na gCon.  We are well aware that it is considering the proposal and will eventually come to us with a proposal, but so far the Minister has not made a decision on the matter.  It has not come to him for decision.</p></speech>

I have a few issues to raise and if they were specifically covered while I was attending other meetings, well and good.</p> <p>  Twice on the first page of his opening script Mr. O'Driscoll referred to the successfully negotiated agreement on the reform of Common Agricultural Policy which included the end of milk quotas.  Given that we were in the driving seat during the negotiations, was Mr. O'Driscoll aware at that stage, based on projections and knowing that the agriculture and dairy industry was gearing up to increase production to take advantage of this reform, that we were facing a superlevy bill of about &euro;69 million?  In the negotiations what did he expect the hit to be on farmers?  I would be shocked if he did not contemplate this possibility.  From responses to parliamentary questions, I know that there is an arrangement in place allowing the superlevy to be paid by the Department over a three-year period.  That is an issue for cash flow, but there is still a figure of &euro;69 million.  How many farmers are affected and what is the breakdown?  If Mr. O'Driscoll does not have it, he may be able to supply a chart showing how many farmers are affected.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to explain the recovery method.  Does the State have to pay the superlevy, with the Department collecting it from the co-operatives which collect it from farmers?  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to give us a note because I have not heard anything on this aspect of the matter.  Does the Department collect the superlevy that it pays over to the European Union?  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll to talk me though the big issue.</p> <p>  I will be upfront.  I fundamentally disagree with Mr. O'Driscoll's opening remarks in which he said it was a successful conclusion to the Common Agricultural Policy negotiations which resulted in a bill of &euro;69 million for farmers.  I do not describe that a success.  It may have been a success for officialdom to have an agreement, but it is not a success for farmers.  It had to be contemplated that the regime was coming to an end and people could not have been expected to wait until 1 April, the end of the superlevy year, before starting to increase output.  If we were to reach the targets mentioned, Mr. O'Driscoll must have known that there would be a build-up.  Surely it had to be within the Department's ability during Ireland's Presidency to secure some transitional arrangements to ease off on superlevy payments.  He might outline what the experience has been in other places.</p></speech>

I will mention just two aspects.  One is the confirmation of the abolition of milk quotas which was fought for right up to the end of the negotiations, and the abolition of sugar quota at the same time.  That is significant.  The other is the defence of our huge transfers.  If one looks at the transfers to Ireland in agriculture and compares them with those in other countries, we are completely at one end of the spectrum.</p></speech>

This is really important, especially with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform listening.  If it were not for the huge transfers we receive in agriculture, if in the morning the Common Agricultural Policy was abolished and everything was renationalised, Ireland would be a massive net contributor to the European Union.  The reason we are more or less in balance is that we receive massive transfers in agriculture.  We get &euro;3 for every &euro;1 we put in into agriculture.  I see my colleague from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform taking notes.  I am glad about that.</p> <p>  The issue the Deputy has raised is completely reasonable in terms of whether we tried to secure resolution of the issue of the superlevy in 2014 during the negotiations.  We did.  We fought very hard for this, even beyond the Irish Presidency and into the following one.  There was a major meeting of the Council of Ministers - my memory is that it was held in Luxembourg - at which this was battled for.  We sought to get the Commission, under the previous Commissioner, to make a proposal to adjust the fat level in milk as it was counted.  This sounds rather technical.</p></speech>

We fought really hard for this.  The Commissioner had to make the proposal and, in his wisdom, decided he would only make it if he was guaranteed in advance a qualified majority in the Council.  We fought very hard with colleagues to get this.  We secured a clear majority in the Council but failed to achieve a qualified majority.  A number of countries - some very unusual allies - lined up against the proposal.  Therefore, we did not secure it.  Unfortunately, that was the last chance to avoid this significant superlevy bill.</p> <p>  Personally, as somebody who is deeply involved - as I led the team of officials in the CAP negotiations, I have been up and down the EU policy area for years - the application of a superlevy this year after we abolished quotas truly does not reflect well on the European Union.  However, the fact is that we failed to achieve a qualified majority in the Council and we have a bill for &euro;69 million.</p></speech>

In fairness, the old Commissioner could have done more.</p><p>The new Commissioner put in place a system under which the superlevy could be paid in three instalments.  Ireland is one of the countries that made that proposal.  As committee members will know, the superlevy bill will be in the region of &euro;69 million, of which milk producers will have to pay one third, or approximately &euro;23 million, up front, with the remaining &euro;46 million to be paid in the following two years.  The Deputy is correct in that the State will have to pay a bill upfront.  I am sure the Comptroller and Auditor General is making calculations in his head, but in effect the Exchequer will have to carry the borrowing cost of &euro;46 million.</p></speech>

In cross-compliance inspections in 2014, of which there were 1,368,  26% of farms were given a clean bill of health, with no breaches; on 36% of farms there were minor breaches, with no financial penalty, while on 38% of farms there were breaches involving penalties.  There were 4,743 identification and registration inspections, in which 38% of farms were given the all clear; on 37% of farms there were minor breaches, while on 25% of farms there were breaches involving penalties.  What is the total amount in penalties levied by the Department as a result of breaches uncovered through inspections?  How does our inspections and fines regime compare with that in other EU countries?  Are we the good boys in Europe or are we laggards in that regard?  Are the fines extrapolated from these samples?  If the Department is only inspecting 5% of farms, are fines being levied on the State based on extrapolations?  How are farms picked?  Is the selection process random or targeted?  Will the witnesses explain the inspections regime and the amounts the country must pay for infringements?</p></speech>

For example, in terms of eligibility for the single farm payment, we are obliged to have a 5% inspection rate.  Some inspections are made randomly, while others are carried out on a risk basis, which is an EU requirement.  Risk based assessments include issues such as whether farmers had previously incurred penalties and so forth.  Tolerance levels and levels of penalties are entirely laid down in EU legislation and we have no discretion in that regard.  All of this is fully rendered in the farmers' charter which we recently renegotiated with the farming organisations.  We completed the negotiations last week on a new charter which sets out tolerance levels and so on.</p> <p>  The percentage rate requirement for the basic payment is 5%; for disadvantaged areas, 5%; for greening, 5%; for cross-compliance, 1%; bovine identification, 3% and so on.  Obviously inspections can be doubled in some cases.  I will not go through all of the figures, but for the REPS, the rate is 5%, which rate also applies to GLAS and the Burren scheme.  For TAMs it is 5% or up to 20% in the case of pre-approval inspections.  These percentages are in EU legislation, but they are discussed with the farm organisations and built into the farmers' charter.  Also built into the charter are the details on how inspections are actually carried out; in other words, the level of notice we give and so forth.  All of the provisions included in the farmers' charter must be within the terms of EU regulations which are detailed in this space.  They set out the tolerance levels that apply in different circumstances, including tagging, for example.  If we carry out an inspection and find that X% of animals on a farm only have one tag, what happens?  In such a scenario the tolerance level is set out clearly in the regulations and the farmer's charter, as is the tolerance level in a scenario where tags are missing from a significant number of animals but the farmer has ordered them, for example.  </p> <p>  While farmers, admittedly, will see it differently, we try to be as reasonable as we can within the terms of EU regulations.  It is only fair to say that on the issue of land eligibility which has proved to be the trickiest issue for us, in comparison with other countries, we have a much lower disallowance rate.  We have consistently been in the bottom four or five countries in the European Union in that regard.  Having said that, I am very conscious that there is a very significant disallowance rate hanging over us, with an initial figure from the Commission of &euro;180 million-----</p></speech>

This is where EU auditors come in.  These are not fines we have imposed on farmers.  EU auditors come in and take the view that our regime is not strong enough in certain respects and that we have not done enough in terms of disallowing farmers.  One could interpret the EU audit finding as saying that we should have imposed a further &euro;180 million in fines in that period on farmers.  I am using the word "fines".  Technically they are not fines, but I accept it is the common word.</p> <p>  We are negotiating with the Commission about that at present.  The reason I mention it is because of the question Deputy Fleming asked about how well we compare with others.  The one area the Commission has identified as an issue for Ireland is land eligibility, specifically, land eligibility of marginal land.  That is the area to which the potential disallowance relates.  This is why we did a great deal of work on land eligibility during the previous few years.  We issued a land eligibility booklet to every farmer in the country so they could ensure they were declaring the right land.</p> <p>  What this comes down to is the amount of land the farmer declares to us.  Does he declare that it is all eligible, or does he decide to draw a line around a given area because he recognises that it is ineligible?  That is the crucial thing.  Let us suppose the farmer over-claims to us and then we pay.  Then the auditors come in and decide that we have overpaid to the farmer.  That is how we get in trouble.  If we do an inspection of a farmer and find he has over-claimed, we will penalise the farmer in our normal process, but if we do not pick that up in our 5% of inspections - by definition 95% of the farmers are not inspected-----</p></speech>

Cross-compliance inspections are done in 1% of farms.  That is the figure Mr. O'Driscoll read out.  It amounts to 1,368, and 38% of these had fines.  Does Europe not say to the Department that the figure should be extrapolated to everywhere else?</p> <p>  In the other area there is a 5% inspection figure.  The Department does 5,000 or 6,000 inspections and finds fines in those areas.  Does Europe not decide that if it is in the 5% the Department picked, then, logic would suggest, it is in the remainder in similar proportions, unless the Department can prove otherwise?  I simply want to know where the connection lies.  Surely the people in Europe cannot be so stupid as to say they will only take the fines for the 5% the Department examined and ignore the other 95%.  That is the connection I do not get.</p></speech>

Why do they not do that?  It is because the idea of percentage inspections is that we encourage compliance.  The idea is that by doing a random percentage of inspections we encourage everyone to correct behaviour.  That is the idea.  The question of the percentage of inspections that should apply has always been a subject of major debate in Europe.  The question of whether 5% is enough or too much is often debated.</p></speech>

The Commission representatives can decide to do whatever they want when they arrive.  It depends on what they are auditing.  They do not go to every country every year.  An audit team arrives and, like any audit team, they do not give us much indication in advance of what exactly they want to look at.  Then, on day one, they tell us they want to look at this, that and the other.  If that involves a sample of farms, we will draw the sample and give it to them.  They will travel around the country and visit those firms.  I am sure farmers enjoy that experience tremendously.</p></speech>

I realise this is not on the accounts but it is keenly relevant to the Department.  How many farm deaths are there per annum, whether farmers, farmers' children or other people?  I know it is not a normal thing but farm safety is very important.  It may not be strictly under the remit of the officials present.  I have heard a good deal about cruelty to animals, but I was thinking that I know a lot of children who have fallen off trailers or bales of hay.  I am very interested in the people who have died on farms as well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.852" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Aidan O'Driscoll" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015061800002#GG03300"><p>Deputy Fleming is absolutely right.  We had a horror show last year.  If I remember correctly, over 30 people died in farms.  That was an exceptionally high figure.  We do not know whether it was a blip or the beginning of a disturbing trend, but we have been active in this area.  We introduced a farm safety scheme during the year.  Deaths on farms come from a variety of sources, for example, from animals, slurry pits - that is a common cause - machinery and so on.  There are things that can be done, physical investments that can be made, to make the farm safer.<br/><br/>We introduced a grant scheme for farmers.  I am pleased to say it was heavily subscribed.  Those moneys have been paid or are being paid.  The targeted agricultural modernisation scheme comes under the rural development programme.  We have built further grant schemes for the same sort of thing.  On top of that, part of the rural development programme involves what we call knowledge transfer groups.  This is where we bring farmers together in groups.  It has been found to be by far the most effective means of providing advice to farmers.  We have built a farm safety element to into the curriculum of those groups <br/><br/>What happened last year is very disturbing and we never want to see anything like it again.  The Minister has been particularly keen to make that point.  A great deal of work is being done by farm organisations and various other voluntary groups.  The <i>Irish Farmers Journal</i>has had major articles on this.  There is a serious effort throughout the industry to try to get this down.  We had 6,000 applicants for the farm safety scheme last year.  We used unspent RDP moneys.  The old rural development programme had some unspent money left in the kitty, as it were.  There was &euro;12 million.  We bundled that up and we are paying it out to the 6,000 farms.<br/><br/>It is an important issue.  Our customer service unit has introduced a single point of contact for bereaved families.</p><p>On a farm, it is the farmer who can die, leaving the family stranded with all of our schemes, which are not particularly simple.  We do not want the family going from Billy to Jack around the State system to try to sort it out.</p></speech>

If he wants to answer verbally, though, that would be fine.  The Department used to have a role in a great deal of forestry land, much of which it transferred to Coillte down the years.  Is it still the registered owner of any of the lands that Coillte believes is its own?  In particular, Mr. O'Driscoll might send me a note on Rathlaoise wood in Portarlington.  Coillte claims that it owns that, but someone else has said that the Department's name is on the title deeds.  Coillte is trying to sell it.</p> <p>  Mr. O'Driscoll might want to give either a detailed note or speak now on my next question.  What are the Department's plans for its major office in Portlaoise?  It is leasing all over the town.  The issue is a hardy annual for this committee.  The intriguing point is that there are other Departments in the Department's office in Portlaoise.  I am a local Deputy and do not understand why the Departments of Social Protection and Justice and Equality and the Probation Service are in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine's building while the Department's own staff are in six or seven other locations.  What is the position with the extension?  Has it been paused?</p></speech>

The first relates to something that the committee has been addressing in the report that we are finalising, namely, the State fishery ports.  We have been back and forth with the Department on this issue.  We understand that it and the problems in the system were inherited by the Department.  I do not know who in the Department volunteered for this or who ordered the Department to take it, but that is irrelevant now.</p> <p>  From what I know of Dunmore East in Waterford, the Department has made genuine efforts to improve the situation in terms of the buildings there.  The local opinion is that matters have improved a great deal, although there are complex issues surrounding arrears.  At the outset of the process, there was a suggestion on the future utilisation of the buildings post report and post dealing with the arrears.  The suggestion had to do with expertise within government and which agencies might bring some value to the buildings' utilisation, given the fact that the buildings are vital in the processing of shellfish and other seafood for export.  Thought was given to Enterprise Ireland, given its long history of supporting the food industry and the expertise that it has at the top.  Consider the background of its head, Ms Julie Sinnamon.  Mr. O'Driscoll knows her well and I have worked with her previously.  I told the Chairman that I was going to meet the head of Enterprise Ireland, which I did last week.  Her reaction to the suggestion of Enterprise Ireland having an involvement in this matter was favourable.  She understood that there might be some utility in Enterprise Ireland considering the suggestion alongside Bord Iascaigh Mhara, BIM, and the Department.  I spoke to the Minister for Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Coveney, afterwards and he agreed.  Some Ministers around here work on the basis that, if something is not their idea, it is not a good one.  Luckily, the Minister, Deputy Coveney, is open to suggestions as to what might be the best way forward for these buildings.</p> <p>  In Dunmore East, we do not have an acute problem with vacant buildings compared with other ports, which might be in worse situations, but it is still an issue.  There is agreement around this table about the direction that we are trying to move this matter, which I hope will be positive.  Considering that the Minister and the head of Enterprise Ireland have agreed to engage, what is the obvious next step?</p></speech>

With my colleagues, Dr. Beamish and Mr. Kevin Moriarty, who is up there among the gods, we have been working hard on the harbours issue since we took over responsibility.  It is no secret that there was a job of work to be done.  We have given some reaction to the committee's draft report.  I hope that it will be finalised and that we will see it.</p> <p>  We have made a great deal of progress on many fronts.  The issue of the accounts was raised previously.  The 2012 accounts have been signed off on by the Comptroller and Auditor General and have gone to the Government.  The 2013-14 accounts are ready and have gone to the Comptroller and Auditor General.  That is good and we have an understood format, etc.  As requested, we have conducted an evaluation of the ports.  The value assigned the harbours is an astronomical &euro;492 million.  That is striking.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of properties at the harbours.  This is a tangled story in some harbours, albeit less so in others.  There are 213 properties in the harbours.  Of those, 94 are leased with full agreements and so on.  Of the 61 leased without agreements, a significant number are leased to public bodies.  Only eight properties across the harbours are vacant and considered ready for tender.  Approximately 15 are vacant but not considered suitable for tender, either because of a legal problem or an operational or planning issue.  We have the number of vacant properties down to a low level.  There are 46 properties in respect of which people are in arrears with us.  Some have agreements and some do not.  We are trying to sort out all of this.  We are making good progress.</p> <p>  The Deputy has suggested the involvement of Enterprise Ireland and BIM in a process with us on the further development of the commercial potential of the harbours.  That is an excellent idea.  Like the Deputy, I know Ms Sinnamon well.  How closely our Department works with Enterprise Ireland is not often appreciated.  Everybody thinks of us as just working with Teagasc and Bord Bia, as they report to us and are our semi-State bodies, as it were, but there is a large chunk of Enterprise Ireland to which we provide a great deal of funding.  For example, our marketing and processing grants, which are listed in our appropriation account, go through Enterprise Ireland.  We work closely with it.  It is on our high-level committee, chaired by the Minister, that is in charge of the implementation of Food Harvest 2020.</p><p>We work very closely with Enterprise Ireland and I am delighted about the idea of involving it in this process.  The valuation figures brings the point home to us.  I mentioned the figure of  &euro;491 million and a huge proportion of that figure - I would have to add up the individual amounts - relates to the replacement cost of the harbour - in other words, not the properties.  When one thinks of the harbours, one is inclined to think of the properties around them.  Of the &euro;492 million figure, apparently, the properties are worth about &euro;30 million.  Therefore, the harbours are the main real asset.  That makes common sense if one thinks about it.  The harbours have all kinds of other functions.  My colleague sent me a photograph of a cruise liner coming into Killybegs - a fantastic sight.  It is a huge resource now not only as a fisheries harbour but as a key to tourism development in Donegal.  It is a fantastic resource.  Other harbours are being used for the export of stone, one of which is Dingle - An Daingean.  Therefore, a variety of different things are happening at harbours.  I know Deputy Deasy will be very familiar with Dunmore East and the work we are doing there in regard to the dredging to make it more useable.  My view on it is that a huge amount of progress has been made, and huge credit is due to my colleagues who have been working on this, but we can absolutely make further progress on this and we are happy to involve Enterprise Ireland, as the Deputy suggests.</p></speech>

When we launch this next week we will reiterate that and mention that there is agreement to engage with it.  My experience in my constituency is that many people have approached me about processing shellfish and getting involved in seafood for export in the past six months in particular.  Regarding the &euro;400 million odd that the harbours are worth and the buildings being worth &euro;30 million, the value of buildings is a bit more than that because they are the only buildings there.  There is an essential need for them to be utilised properly.  Given that in many cases they are vacant or there are legal issues surrounding them, the ports need a resolution of those issues.  The Department is working very hard on this but in many cases these matters have gone on for way too long.  That is the issue in that respect.</p> <p>  I will stick to issues related to Dunmore East.  I thank Dr. Beamish and his section for the work they have done in moving forward the dredging issue during the past year.  There have been issues with regard to tendering etc.  I have a general question for Mr. Beamish regarding funding for infrastructure into the future.  The need for that in Dunmore East is critical in two respects.  It is a stepping-off point for access for the cruise ships and it is also a busy fishing port.  There is not the space there for access for the cruise ships that are vital from an economic and tourism standpoint.  It is becoming a potential safety issue and they are not getting any co-operation from the port company in Waterford.  That is nothing new.  Anyone in Waterford would tell us that.  There is an issue there that needs to be examined and perhaps inquired into by the Department.  </p> <p>  Another issue relates to a breakwater structure.  That is the other essential piece of infrastructure that is missing from Dunmore East to allow for the leisure and the sailing end of activities to be built on and promoted.  What ideas has the Department for securing infrastructure funding generally, and I ask that with a caveat?  That caveat is that the proceeds for the sale of Aer Lingus have been tagged as going towards a regional connectivity fund.  They have said that it is potentially going to ports and airports.  Does that include State fishing ports to anyone's knowledge?  Has that been discussed with the Department?  Is there any suggestion that some of the funding from Aer Lingus might go to some of the fishery ports?</p></speech>

The next significant capital project on the line in terms of Dunmore East that is being examined is a breakwater which would provide benefit also to the marine leisure side of the harbour in terms of improved shelter over the winter and perhaps allow the development of small craft berthing on the leisure side of the harbour which has been growing very rapidly.  The exploratory work on what type of breakwater, its positioning and the scale and cost of it is getting under way over the next period as we move through the dredging work.  We will be deepening the entrance channel as part of the dredging exercise.  The overall dredging will be going deeper than was envisaged if had we gone ahead with it last year.  We are getting further output this year.</p></speech>

Mr. O'Driscoll is probably aware that myself and Deputy Michael Creed suggested the formation of a dairy forum given the post-quota era we are now in, mainly to governmentally manage the volatility that we all know will affect the dairy industry in the years ahead.  My understanding is that this forum will meet on 15 July.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We are talking about very senior people in the dairy industry who would be expected to go to that, so we are trying to line them up and have it on whatever date works best for them.</p></speech>

We have been speaking to a number of people since that suggestion was accepted.  The area on which we want the forum to focus and concentrate is the trade element.  We think it deserves it, considering that the dairy industry has been locked in a box to a certain extent for the past 30 years and we think that the Government should react accordingly.  Every agency and Department within Government should take a hand in that.  We have met the head of the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade and we would like its involvement in the forum but also some kind of nexus between our missions or industries aboard - specific ones where we think there is potential when it comes to exports of milk and milk ingredients.  I was in Vietnam recently and it was an eye opener to learn that the market there is worth US$6 billion every year but we have pretty much got nothing there.  The idea has been accepted by the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade that its involvement would be useful.  It was heading in that direction to a certain extent.  There would also be a reporting requirement from those missions back to the forum on a regular basis so that they can inform the forum and, by extension, the industry, of their capacity and capability when it comes to helping anyone from private industry who might want to get involved in a foreign market.</p><p> My own belief is that within ten to 15 years, the Chinese will probably sort themselves out to a certain extent and they will not be as reliant as they are on foreign milk products because they will effectively build up capacity in their own industry.  There is an issue in south east Asia but we have real capacity and capability in Africa based on our 50 years' experience, particularly in sub-Saharan and southern Africa.  I believe that using this forum, the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade really needs to capitalise on that.  The taxpayer should expect Government to react accordingly now that quotas are over and because it means such a massive amount to the rural economy around the country. </p></speech>

For what it is worth, the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine has a presence in either seven or eight embassies.  I cannot recall the precise number.  Many of us here have worked in those jobs over the years.  We have re-orientated those in recent years.  For example, we did not replace our person in the embassy in Madrid and our person in the embassy in Warsaw.  Instead, we set up posts in Beijing and Moscow.  This is a shift from a policy intelligence-based foreign service to a trade-based foreign service.  Our presence in the embassies is quite small.  I would like to see that continue.  In particular, I would like to see us develop a presence in the Middle East and Africa if the Minister approves.  I would see that as a priority.  I am very familiar with sub-Saharan Africa.  I worked there for eight years so I am very conscious of the potential there.</p> <p>  China is one of our biggest markets.  I have a list of the top dairy destinations.  It is worth &euro;395 million so it is very large.  A market in Nigeria, which is worth &euro;138 million and is growing rapidly, offers huge potential.  The Minister hopes to visit Nigeria before the end of the year as part of a trade visit to west Africa.  The market in Saudi Arabia is worth &euro;126 million.  These countries are very significant.  A place like Senegal that nobody would think of is worth &euro;51 million.  This offers serious potential.  </p> <p>  As I said earlier, the prospect of dairy expansion is one of the most important things ever to hit the agri-food industry in this country.  It is an enormously important event.  In my previous role and since assuming my current role, I have spoken to Bord Bia and the leaders of all the top companies very closely about this and about how they see market developments and whether we will find markets for the product.  They are very bullish and see huge potential.  In recent years, we have focused heavily on European markets.  All our beef products go entirely to European markets and many of our dairy products are focused on European markets.  In more recent years, we have begun to concentrate on places like China and Nigeria - the new markets.  That is the future.  Deputy Deasy is saying that the State needs to adjust to that with its offer and support for companies and I agree with him 100% on that.  I have talked to my opposite number, Niall Burgess, in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  I am very familiar with ambassadors in some of our key potential markets and have also spoken to them.  I must say that our colleagues in the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade are fully engaged in this.  We are also fully engaged in it.  </p> <p>  We formed the trade committee some years ago in the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It was designed to pull together staff from across the Department and Bord Bia who work on trade issues.  There are people in our veterinary division who work on trade issues such as certification of product for trade.  We tried to set up a committee that cut right across the Department taking in every bit of the Department that works on trade-related issues to co-ordinate and make it work better.  It is a major focus for us and we will certainly work closely with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade; Enterprise Ireland and Bord Bia on it.  </p></speech>

The farming organisations and individual farmers have raised the risks they fear would accrue as a result of the publication of these figures.  The Department must take this seriously considering the number of farms that have been subject to criminal attack and have been victims of crime over the past few years, particularly in isolated areas.  Does Mr. O'Driscoll have any view about monitoring it on an ongoing basis?  It would be useful if the Department said that it was concerned about it and that it is something it needs to keep an eye on.  I think it is a fair point.  One can make an argument about transparency in Government but when it comes down to the potential consequences for people who live in the country, it is a very serious issue and a question should be asked about it today.</p></speech>

We are required to publish the name of the person and the municipality in which they reside.  We were wrestling with the word "municipality" for a while regarding what it might mean.  Does it mean the full address or part of the address we have on our system?  How would that work?  Some farmers would have quite detailed addresses with townlands while others would have a much broader address because of the nature of the area.  A new Act in 2014 laid down the definition of a municipal district.  We now publish the name of the farmer and the municipal district.  To give an example, there are only four municipal districts in County Clare so they are pretty big areas.  All of west Cork, which is my home area, is one area.  If one checks for O'Driscolls in west Cork on our system, one will get a list as long as one's leg.  It is no more specific than that.  One finds the first name, surname and the fact that they are somewhere in west Cork.  That is an important point relating to the issue raised by Deputy Deasy.  Genuine concerns have been raised.  It is very important.  Every time we talk about this, we make it clear that cash does not transact here.  These are electronic transfers into people's accounts so for any mischievous people out there who might be listening, there is no question of people having bundles of cash.  I take the Deputy's point and we will monitor it.  It is EU law, however, and we do not have flexibility on it.  The definition of municipality we have used gives the broadest address one could imagine while being fully in accordance with EU law.</p></speech>

The officials might check the background to that and whether the lease on the building is available.  I will ask the clerk to forward the correspondence to them, if they do not have it already.

We have confidence in the board to do that job, but we will be looking at the proposals it makes to us regarding asset disposal and so on.

There is nothing in particular I can add in regard to Bord na gCon other than that I take the Chairman's point that it has a task to do.  Given what I have said about our own issues with procurement, I will not be critical about Bord na gCon's issues with same.  Like us, that body must up its game and do procurement properly in all cases and in accordance with requirements.  We regularly have meetings with bodies under the Department's remit in line with the code of governance for State bodies.  Another process that is there involves the requirement on all State bodies, including Bord na gCon, to have a performance framework in place.  That is the formal process.  However, what the Chairman is asking, as I understand, is whether we are keeping an eye on things, to which the answer is "Yes".</p></speech>

I will not go into the detail but we were told the matter was with the Chief State Solicitor's office.  However, it was not until after the meeting that a file was sent to that office.  I asked at the time whether the Department would, given the history of the matter and the moneys involved, consider entering into some type of mediation process in another attempt to resolve matters.  We are told the case is with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor, as I said.  I will give Mr. O'Driscoll the details after the meeting and ask that he examine the matter with a view to coming back to us on it.</p> <p>  I request that he do the same in respect of a couple of other cases.  We have had correspondence from a gentleman in west Cork and from another individual who is represented by somebody in Dublin.  Again, I will give Mr. O'Driscoll the names after the meeting.  We would like to get a final reply on these matters in respect of which we have been dealing with correspondence on an ongoing basis.  They seem to be genuine cases.  Where mediation might work, we would like to know.  If, however, it is the end of the road, the Secretary General might tell us so and outline the exact background and so on.  In addition, an issue has arisen in regard to health treatments being administered to horses.  There is correspondence on this matter which is not yet before us but which I intend to send to Mr. O'Driscoll.  As I said earlier, I will send him the correspondence on the court case where the client argues that payment is due but has not been issued.</p> <p>  The Secretary General mentioned in his opening statement that a lot of what the committee has been told in respect of the special investigations unit is untrue.  I do not want to get into a discussion on this today, but we spent a long time listening to a number of individuals who were prepared to come forward and have that conversation with us.  It is hard to believe that most of what they told us was untrue.  Aside from that, there were other individuals who came forward but, out of fear of how they might be dealt with by the special investigations unit, were afraid to give us the details.  One or two of them might very well be still in the process of the investigation.</p> <p>  It is difficult to hear from individuals that they have a fear of an agency of the State to the extent they do not want to discuss their issues in a public way and do not feel comfortable dealing with Members of this Parliament because of that agency.  While we have dealt with these matters with the Chief State Solicitor's office and the Department in terms of the costs involved, it seems from what we were told by those who are part of the report given to Mr. O'Driscoll by the clerk, as well as those who were unwilling and afraid to give information on the record, that they have spent considerable sums of money in an attempt to defend themselves.  Looking at the figures that were given to us in terms of the cost to date, it is hard to see how it could have cost so much on the private side of it while the cost on the part of the State was so little.  There is something not adding up in terms of what we are being told.  It is difficult for the committee to deal with the Office of the Chief State Solicitor and then the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on this issue.  There is toing and froing all the time as to who is responsible for what.  Will Mr. O'Driscoll provide us with a more comprehensive note on these cases, indicating whether compensation or anything else was involved?  I cannot equate the figures we were given with what might have been required in some of those court cases.  If the figures given do represent all of the cost to the State, the Secretary General might give us the names of the counsels and solicitors involved, because there are very few around whose services are apparently so cheap.  I certainly want to know the detail of all of that.</p> <p>  It is wrong of Mr. O'Driscoll to make a broad statement that what we have heard is untrue without providing us with what he refers to as the robust, point-by-point rebuttal of the claims made by the other side.</p><p>Once a document is submitted to the committee and becomes a document of that committee, it enjoys privilege.  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll if he will respond in the public interest to each and every point raised by the individuals involved.  I asked Mr. O'Driscoll why they were not paid and how much they were due but he said they were not due money.  That is a substantial conflict of opinion and I want to resolve it and determine where the issues arise in respect of those individuals who came forward.</p><p> I cannot reconcile Mr. O'Driscoll's complete defence with the previous evidence presented to us, although I understand he has a job to do as Secretary General and that other Secretaries General do the same thing.  My job is to listen to the complaints that are brought before this committee and to investigate the costs that emerge for the State.  There are too many stories.  Mr. O'Driscoll stated that the Department always acknowledges fair procedure.  I will take him at his word but I do not think the special investigations unit follows his word.  We have been informed about too many cases, none of which are connected.  My experience of the Kilkenny case led me to raise it on the Order of Business one morning because I could not believe what I was being told, and which turned out to be true.  A pregnant woman was pushed about and a car was damaged but the officer flashed his credentials and told a garda that he was from the special investigations unit and, therefore, almost beyond the law.  In fairness to the garda, he said that was not the case.  My knowledge of that case indicates that what is being done on the ground is not compatible with the story that Mr. O'Driscoll is telling.  I accept that a job is being done but when I hear about a veterinarian's practice being entered through a window or of veterinarians not being able to renew their insurance because of the activities of the special investigations unit, I have to ask questions.  There are too many common strands in these cases to ignore them.  I ask Mr. O'Driscoll not to ignore them.  I understand that he has to defend them but if I found someone in my business who was acting the cowboy I would hang him out to dry.  These inspectors represent the Department.  They do not represent the special investigations unit on its own.</p><p> Two individuals in different parts of the country gave us similar evidence about how their families were treated.  They entered the property of a man in Carlow, who is not represented here, and confronted his mentally challenged son.  That was not made up.  I urge Mr. O'Driscoll to go beyond the defence he has to offer and investigate what is happening.  It is not right.  They cannot all be telling us untruths.  While I am sure members will agree to dispose of Vote 30, we will not close off the issues that were brought to our attention.  They have not been heard fully due to the fact that we have been unable to examine Mr. O'Driscoll's side of the story in the type of detail presented by previous witnesses.</p><p> There is another way of doing business.  Given the devastation caused by the special investigations unit to a small number of businesses, it is hard to comprehend why the State would invest an endless amount of money to take people through the courts only for nothing to happen.  It is hard for a business person to rebuild trust after the State presumed him or her guilty and visited his or her customers as part of its investigation.  That is what happened in the case with which I am familiar.  Rebuilding trust with customers is difficult when the State believes a business person is guilty.  Fair procedure is necessary.  The unit's officers are entitled to carry out their investigations but accusations of bullying were made in too many of the accounts I have heard.  There are also too many stories about businesses being devastated and family lives being interrupted for me to ignore this issue.</p><p> I have listened to the evidence given by Mr. O'Driscoll and others but the committee has not received a written explanation.  It is my intention to revisit this matter once we receive the written explanation.  I will also inquire into the issue of fines, details of which I will send to Mr. O'Driscoll.</p></speech>

He rightly stated that the State should not presume anybody guilty.  I must ask the same thing for our staff.  Serious personal allegations have been made.  The Chairman mentioned some of them.  In a court case, a judge described some of the most serious of the allegations mentioned as an attempt at character assassination without evidence.  I agree with that judge.  Other judges were quoted today but the aforementioned judge made a very important point.  The Chairman is correct that I have not provided a point-by-point rebuttal of the document.  I would welcome the opportunity to do so.  I have answered members' questions as honestly and openly as I am able.  We touched on some of the untruths members were told.  I have stated clearly that I do not think the special investigations unit or anybody else is perfect.  I am sure we have made mistakes but malicious allegations were made against front-line public servants who are doing a difficult job.  I will present to the committee clear alternative evidence and I accept that the committee will do what it needs to do with it.  However, I have to ask for the same indulgence that the Chairman asked from us, namely, that he does not presume our staff are guilty.</p></speech>

Today, we will continue our hearings with senior officials from the Department of Finance who had key roles during the crisis period.  At this morning's session, we will hear from Mr. Kevin Cardiff, former Secretary General at the Department of Finance.  This is the first of two sessions with Mr. Cardiff and will focus upon developments in ... Mr. Cardiff was involved in up to the end of 2008.  So as I say, there are two sessions that'll be involving Mr. Cardiff.  This morning's matters will work up until the end of December 2008.  This will include matters such as macroeconomic policy, departmental resources, regulation, supervision, oversight, the domestic standing group, solvency, liquidity and the bank guarantee.</p> <p>  Mr. Kevin Cardiff was Secretary General at the Department of Finance from 2010 to 2012.  He joined the Department in 1984 and had a number of roles in the Department, including responsibility for the taxation and financial services division and tax policy.  In March 2012, he was nominated as Ireland's representative at the European Court of Auditors in Luxembourg for a six-year period.</p> <p>  Mr. Cardiff, you're very welcome before the committee this morning.</p></speech>

Good morning, members of the committee.  Well, the crisis in our banking sector that emerged in 2008 leading to significant Government intervention and ultimately international assistance was the worst in our modern history and, indeed, much of the same is true for much of Europe.  I was involved in many and, indeed, most of the aspects of the management of that crisis and I hope my evidence to the joint committee will give a helpful insight into the challenges faced and the difficult decisions made during this unprecedented period in our recent history.<br/><br/>As you probably know members, civil servants in most committees are precluded from entering into certain areas of debate.So it's a pleasure to be here to be able to answer questions where there is less restriction where we can discuss policy, we can discuss all that needs to be discussed.  And I have tried quite politely to wait for this committee before entering into public discussion.  People have asked me over the last couple of years why am I not talking.  It's because I have been waiting for this committee and it's a pleasure to be here to do this.<br/><br/>I have prepared a comprehensive report but my comprehensive report only really deals with about in total 20 weeks of the crisis.  It's because I just ran out of steam.  But I expect, I fully expect that you'll ask questions in relation to other parts because there was an awful lot that happened leading up, afterwards and so forth and I'm anxious to help with those issues too.<br/><br/>By way of background, I should outline the positions that I held in the Department of Finance and at what times because it affects a little bit the story I can give you.  And it falls neatly in half years.  Second half of 2001, 2002, 2003, 2004, give or take a month or so, I was assistant secretary general in charge of the unit in the Department of Finance dealing with financial legislation, including the Central Bank Acts 2003 and 2004.  For 2005, broadly speaking, I was dealing with tax issues including evaluation of the various property tax incentives and so forth.  And then for 2007, 2008 and 2009, I was a division head known as a second secretary general and for part of that time, headed what was known as the tax and financial services division.  When the crisis intensified in autumn 2008, the tax element of that was taken away so that I could concentrate on the financial services matters.  And obviously that was almost at that stage, entirely a crisis management job.<br/><br/>When the then Secretary General resigned at the very beginning of 2010, the Government asked me to take his position, which again, remained principally a crisis management job.  And I did that job for 2010 and 2011, broadly speaking.  I left just after the Troika mission of January 2012.<br/><br/>So as the crisis broke in September 2008, I became the <i>de facto</i>public sector co-ordinator for all the banking interventions reporting to the Secretary General and the Minister obviously, sometimes the Taoiseach.  During this period, I tried and did provide options and advice for the Minister and the Government and leadership to my smallish team and to other parts of the public service in relation to the liquidity crisis, the recapitalisation process, the nationalisation of Anglo and the NAMA legislative process.  Later the Government, by then quite familiar with me and my work, decided to appoint me Secretary General as I have said, to deal with the crisis.<br/><br/>As Secretary General, during the initiation and settling in of the EU-IMF programme, I was again the <i>de facto</i>co-ordinator and manager on the Irish side for the programme negotiations and for programme implementation working for the Minister, the Taoiseach and the Government.</p><p>I had the opportunity to introduce a number of significant initiatives in my two years as Secretary General.  One of the most telling was the four year plan or national recovery plan, as it became known, which in turn formed the basis of much of the EU-IMF programme, the non-banking elements, and it allowed us, I hope, to deal with Irish problems on an Irish basis, albeit not a very pleasant basis.</p><p> On the guarantee, and I run the risk of duplicating a little bit what's been in the papers but if you don't mind, my statement and report deal in a lot of detail with the run up to the Government guarantee for the banking system.  The big question for many people is, was the guarantee necessary, was there not something we could have done differently that would have, in sort of one elegant manoeuvre, taken ourselves out of the line of fire? The answer to that is, is "No".  I'm clear in my own mind that on the night of the guarantee, and we can go on to discuss why, but something had to be done.  Whatever was to be done had to be very significant, so significant as to change the otherwise very negative trend in events.  Intervention was, to my mind, very urgent to avert the potential for a real disaster for the many people who saved with and relied on these banks in our economic system.  There was a range of options available to the Government.  Considerable had been work been done ... work had been done by my team at the Department of Finance, by the NTMA and the NPRF, by the Central Bank and Financial Regulator, by the Attorney General's office and our various advisers, to ensure that these options were ready on the night.  Options included: loans in huge amounts for the banking system - cash had been stored up for that purpose or for ... against a rainy day for some time; a special collateralised swop arrangement was ready to provide the banks with a new mode of access to ECB cash - European Central Bank cash; documentation and collateral had been prepared to allow for emergency liquidity assistance, detailed legislative provisions were ready to allow for a nationalisation of a bank or indeed a building society, so allow ... so as to allow for its control or resolution; legislation was also ready to provide for guarantees and other supports.  But it was up to the Government to decide on the options it wanted and there were no ... there were no costless options.</p><p> Now I know some genuinely clever people, people I respect, will tell you with great certainty that things should indeed have been done very differently that evening.  A different type of intervention or a delay until a European rescue might become available with the use of emergency liquidity assistance in the meanwhile.  You can make that case but to my mind there is, even now, no real reason to believe that waiting a few more days, and in the meanwhile engaging with European partners, would have changed the situation much.  The granting of ELA would not have reversed the trend towards very large outflows of funds from Anglo, in some ways it would have facilitated it.  As news of Anglo's difficulty circulated, and you remember from evidence you've already had that they were going from place to place telling everybody about their difficulties, there was every possibility of a run on that bank.  And not just a wholesale run, a good old-fashioned, queues in the street bank run, sometime in the next day or two.  ILP, Irish Life &amp;amp; Permanent, was also nearly out of cash that week and was, in fact, expected to run out of cash that Thursday, give or take a day, exacerbating the systemic impact of the liquidity crisis.  So even if we had leaped into the weekend on ELA, was there really any prospect of a European solution?  The answer to that is two weeks later, two weeks after our guarantee, most of the leadership of the EU came together, all the eurozone Heads of State and Government plus Gordon Brown, and they agreed a common approach - but it was a common approach to national level rescues, there was no European solution.  Each member state for itself, albeit following a similar intervention design.  And remember, if the Government was plainly not behind the banks at the time of the guarantee, the ECB might not have allowed ELA so this theoretical view that ELA might have done something good for us, it's a reasonable view but it might not have been able to happen.  The ECB certainly would not have opened the purse strings for a banking system which was waiting for a European rescue to come along when there was no immediate prospect of that.  So of course things could have been different but they might have been a lot worse and it would have been a big gamble to wait a few more days.</p><p>And maybe having waited, if we would then try to play the guarantee card, the market and the public simply wouldn't have accepted it.  I think the point I'll try to get through in my whole evidence is there were no certainties.  This was a most complex situation in which it was extraordinarily difficult to predict the future and which the ... the main point of decision was not to get the ... exactly the right solution, it was to get the one that was least likely to lead to a disaster.</p><p> Specific issues around ... about the guarantee.  Let me try to answer some specific questions that ... that I think have arisen in the course of your inquiry to date, to the best of my recollection.  Yes, the banks did seek a broad guarantee, including for themselves.  Some people say it was four banks, some people say it was six, but if you nationalise two, then you have to look after them ... it's the same thing.  Yes, they did provide a draft.  Only one version so far as I can recall, though I know you ... you had in evidence someone suggest that there was a second version somewhere in the building.  Yes, they did provide other documents.  In particular, they provided to Eugene McCague, who was there as a solicitor acting with the Government, a list of the subsidiaries to which they wanted the guarantee to apply and I believe he passed that list on a couple of days later, in writing.  They also discussed the pricing structure that they would wish to apply to the guarantee and, yes, I understood that they wanted Anglo nationalised or otherwise in some way dealt with.  There were other views on the night.  Minister Lenihan and I advocated consideration of other options.  Later, the Minister changed his view and I discussed the reasons for that in my statement and report.  I advocated a nationalisation or a ... with a guarantee for Anglo, and a strong public statement, amounting to a political guarantee, for the other banks.  I think in doing so I was in line with the advice of Merrill Lynch and the NTMA.  And it's a wonderful thing to be here and say I advocated something differently but I don't know that I was right.  I don't know, still, that the guarantee was the wrong option.  I'm not convinced it was.  But certainly there had to be some guarantees that night, there was no doubt about that at all.  No official adviser advocated a liquidation of Anglo at that point.  Even now I think that would have been too dangerous to contemplate.</p><p> The guarantee was immediately quite well accepted in the market but it was a much more fragile edifice, even in the very first day ... very first week or so, than is now realised.  There was a great deal of work behind the scenes required to make it acceptable with the European ... European Commission, whose word is law on this stuff, with the ECB, and with other governments and financial institutions.  Apart from the people in the room, I don't know who else was advising the Government.  I know Alan Gray spoke to the Taoiseach and I read that certain Ministers had contact with ... with Mr. McWilliams.  And I know, too, that there'd been a discussion at Government ... some discussion the previous day, the implications of which I deal with again in the report.  There is absolutely nothing incorrect or untoward about a Taoiseach or a Minister taking advice beyond the Civil Service.  It would probably be negligent if they didn't do so but I just don't know exactly what the ... the full range of people in the mix were.  As you've already heard, there was no information to say that any of the banks were solvent on ... on some definitions of that, at least, on the usual meaning for this kind of discussion, on the night of the guarantee ... were insolvent, rather.</p><p> There were reasons, explicitly ... there were reason to wonder about their future business model, their resilience to shocks, their potential for future losses and these things were considered both ... both that night and, more importantly, I suppose, in previous discussions.  The scale of future loan losses was not known on the night, of course.  I see the Chairman is a little worried, am I going too slowly?</p></speech>

On the genesis of the broad guarantee, where did the idea come from?  Well, it wasn't a new idea, it had been done in other crises and other places.  And, as I laid out in my written statement and the appended report, no consideration of bank rescue options could have ignored the potential for use of guarantees.  In the Northern Rock case is one example.  It was not nationalisation ... it wasn't the point when they nationalised Northern Rock that the situation stabilised but it was the guarantee that did the trick there.  Maybe we over-learnt that message.  But there were also significant external voices who'd been expressing support for a broad guarantee, or something like it, at various points in time between March 2008 and the guarantee itself.  I don't think I was influenced, in any advice I gave, by the presence of those external voices.  So, of course, it's entirely legitimate for anyone who wants to contact the official system and give their personal view to do so.  It was just in the air.  The idea of a guarantee was in the air and I suppose that was captured in the McWilliams article that weekend.</p><p> So what about the bailout?  Well at the time we said it wasn't a bailout because it was money lent not money given, but we can call it a bailout for this purpose.  My report to the inquiry deliberately gives a lot of detail on how those discussions unfolded because it hasn't been much discussed.  The big question in the public domain in relation to the bailout seems to be whether entering the EU-IMF programme was a free choice or were we pushed.  Well, at the moment we entered it we were pushed quite hard.  The push was in some elements, in some ways direct and transparent.  You have seen the letter from-----</p></speech>

The push we got, as I said, in some ways was direct.  We knew who was doing it; we knew what they were saying.  In other cases though, the pressure came indirectly via some misinformation, via anonymous media briefings reportedly coming from official sources, which acted to accelerate market pressures and create enormous pressure on Ireland to enter an EU-IMF programme quickly.  The ECB advice in regard to entry to the EU-IMF programme was specific, it was directly tied to conditions they had outlined in correspondence, and there were consequences for non-compliance.  The ECB had its reasons and I don't say that they were wrong from their perspective, certainly, but their view was clearly an important pressure point.  But it was the combination of negative circumstances and market developments that were the real push factor, quite apart from the timing issue.  Barring some radical change of sentiment in the market and in the light of a very difficult domestic situation, and increasing scepticism prompted by the so-called Deauville agreement and public comments by the ECB about reducing atypical support for banking systems, increasing the risk of our stance on sovereign bond investors and so forth, it was unlikely ... quite unlikely that Ireland could finance itself in 2011.  We were unlikely to be able to borrow or might only be able to do so at such high interest rates as to make our debt become unsustainable.  We needed an alternative set of lenders, and I, for one, was grateful that there were institutions available to do that.  I also appreciated that the negotiating and technical teams with which we dealt with were generally knowledgeable, they were professional and committed.  They came here committed to Ireland and to its economic rescue within the bounds of their professional role.  There were natural professional tensions, which I've outlined in detail in my report but we aimed to make these negotiators ... we aimed to make these negotiators ambassadors for Ireland back in their head offices and I believe they did act in that role.  It was, though, clearly inappropriate that at the outset, at the point when we were trying to make decisions, that back door briefings of the media should be used to undermine our position in the markets so as to add to our pressures.  Democratic systems should not rely on undermining reputations and distributing misinformation via anonymous briefings.<br/><br/>What about burning bondholders?  Well, there is a number of misapprehensions which ought to be addressed.  There is a view that Ireland was always in favour of burning bondholders; the Irish Government and everybody else was always against, just to simplify.  Actually, the Irish Government did not always favour imposing burden-sharing on senior bondholders.  Advice was at various times that it might be legally impossible or very unwise from a market point of view.  However, by the end of November 2010, the Irish Government, represented by Brian Lenihan, did want to insist that senior bank bondholders would share the burden of bank failure.  At the time, my information is second-hand but it is quite strong I think, we understood that <font color="#222222">Dominique Strauss-Kahn</font>, head of the IMF, was not only in favour of imposing burden-sharing on the senior bank bondholders, but also that he believed he could persuade other major players, including the major European governments, the Americans and the ECB to go along.  Strauss-Kahn was to, and I understand did, convene in a conference call to make this arrangement.  We heard back however via the IMF team in Dublin that instead of a positive response, there had been a strong negative reaction from the ECB, from Geithner and others and that, moreover, the EU-IMF programme would not go ahead in senior bondholder burden-sharing was contemplated.  This was confirmed by European Commission and ECB negotiators in Dublin and the IMF negotiators reluctantly confirmed that this was now also the official position of the IMF.  So, of course, it was formally Ireland's decision not to burn bondholders, but it was one of those decisions without much option.</p><p>But, just to provide some balance, and in the theme of things not being simple, one should remember that, from a European point of view, the burden sharing was seen as a real and very serious risk; a new Lehmans type event, perhaps.  Even one of the IMF negotiators at the time said it might be havoc and Europe was teetering on the edge of a much more serious sovereign borrowing crisis than was already evident.  Europe could be helpful if Ireland, or Portugal, or Greece - smaller countries - found themselves in trouble, but what if the bond-buying strike, the absolute pulling back from the markets by bond investors, extended to larger countries?  Who could rescue them?  So, you see why some partners might not have favoured too much experimentation in Ireland.</p><p> On other areas of the negotiation with the external partners, we strove hard to get the best deal possible for Ireland and, indeed, we achieved some considerable wins.  First, no threat to our corporation tax system, on which many jobs depended and depend; no collateral requirement for the loans; adoption, wholesale, of the Irish four-year plan - national recovery plan; agreement to Irish figures for fiscal adjustment, so no addition front-loading of the fiscal adjustment beyond the numbers that had already been announced by the Irish Government.  At some point, we got an extra year to make the overall fiscal adjustments required.  We got a tacit - unfortunately not explicit, but a tacit - ECB commitment to continued banking system support and we got a "no fire sales" approach to bank deleveraging, which probably saved us some billions later.  And there were other gains in negotiations later on.  All of these were positive aspects of the deal, worked out by a relatively small group of people in Dublin, Brussels and elsewhere but, of course, the most positive of all was getting commitment to loans totalling nearly &euro;70 billion from a range of partner countries, many of whom contributed to our rescue through three separate mechanisms.  So, if you take, for example, Germany, they would have contributed about a quarter of the money for the EFSF, they would have contributed about 20% of the money indirectly for the EFSM and probably about 6% of the money from the IMF was theirs.  So, some people were giving money to us on the triple.</p><p> Later on, at the end of March 2011, with the new Government in power and itself intending to engage in some senior bond burden sharing in relation to Anglo bonds specifically, there had seemed to be some shift of opinion within the ECB.  The question of these Anglo bondholders was to be considered by the ECB governing council but in the end we received their decision - in terms very close to being an instruction - that bondholders were not to share the burden even on a purely voluntary basis.  So important was continuing ECB support and opinion that the Government decided not to take the risk of alienating them.  I've no doubt that Mr. Trichet and his governing council were sincere in their concerns and their actions.  It would certainly be wrong to judge the balance of the ECB's very active support and engagement with Ireland on the basis of this event alone but, that day, the ECB did a good deal more than would be implied by the phrase "simply gave advice" and we shouldn't hide from that.</p><p> To go back for a moment, State support for the banking system was not just addressing the immediate liquidity hole: it was protecting the integrity of the Irish payment system; it was protecting the willingness of trading companies to deal with Irish companies; it was protecting the willingness of payment card companies to allow international transactions to the customers of Irish banks; the willingness of credit rating companies to leave the banks with any sort of credit rating; the willingness of auditors to sign off on their accounts; and the readiness of clearing houses to clear payments for Irish banks.  Our banks were not just under attack from a single source - it wasn't just a problem of losing deposits - they were under siege from every quarter that they dealt with and their very existence was under persistent threat for much of the crisis period.  Every official intervention brought with it a new workload and none of the interventions in the banking system was in the least straightforward.  We had to manage within EU state aid rules and every minor aspect of our banking interventions had to be cleared and negotiated with the European Commission.  We had to overcome major statistical and accounting hurdles, usually in the direction of being less transparent, incidentally.  We had to negotiate through difficult moments with other member states and EU institutions while also negotiating with - or sometimes doing battle with - potential investors, hedge and private equity funds, vultures and angels, honest dealers and gougers.</p><p>From 2008 to 2012, there was not so much a crisis as, it seemed, a crisis per week.  There was, quite honestly, never a moment in that period when there was not some great peril to our banking system and our economy.</p><p> We are all well aware of the danger of judging events in the benefit of hindsight.  Being aware of it doesn't mean we shouldn't do it.  Those dangers are magnified where the events sought to be retrospectively judged were as complex and exceptional as those since September 2008.  It is, of course, understandable that people will want to know, not just how things happened the way they did but will also understandably want to know who was involved, who was there - and I was one of the people who was there.  Some other people will say "I wasn't there" or "I was away and I left me phone at home" or those things, but I was there for the whole time.  I believe it's important against this background to reflect on the fairness or validity of the now standard narrative that hopelessly inept civil servants, poorly led, were incapable of dealing with our nation's problem and that was the source of the difficulty.  Those involved in dealing with the crisis on the public service side, myself included, I think, worked diligently over huge hours, to the point of real exhaustion, in the face of pressures which most people in the public or private sector, thankfully, won't have to face in a full career.  The Department of Finance team, I believe, formed ... performed with competence and integrity in the face of those pressures, helping to hold all the public institutions together to work in the same direction, while seeking to protect Ireland's best interest when working with outside institutions.</p><p> I have, of course, already talked in previous committee hearings about failings and about issues that need to be addressed in this ... in the Department and in the Civil Service, so this is not to suggest that we should get a clean bill of health or anything like it.  But many of the Civil Service managers moved mountains over those four years.  They did things in a month which, in normal times, might be the biggest effort of a year.  A huge legislative programme, budgets and emergency budgets, negotiations on many different fronts at the same time, hundreds of EU-IMF programme targets, all of them met on time, except where a ministerial decision said "We delay."</p><p> This couldn't have been the case if we were all inept.  We were not.  And yet we had an enormous crisis.  To consider why, not long after I became Secretary General of the Department of Finance, I arranged for what became known as the Wright report.  I wanted a reasoned report on the past and a blueprint for a new Department of Finance.  Many of the recommendations from Wright I expected but otherwise were a significant challenge to my previous thinking and, of course, implementation was compliment ... complicated by the ongoing crisis, the change of Government, the split of the Department of Finance.  I was able to get some work under way in that time and, in particular, by bringing into ... in a variety of new and highly-skilled individuals, through a range non-traditional mechanics - secondments, open recruitments, special public interest appointments.  I feel I probably stretched the limits of Civil Service law in that period, in recruitment processes.</p></speech>

You can't just do it.  You can't just nationalise because bond covenants have change of ... change of control clauses - some of them.  And if you change control, you might create a default on a particular bond.  And if one bond default ... defaults, they all default.  That's just one example.  There are a few little steps you have to take before you can nationalise.  All right, we thought four days, five days.</p><p>So, in the meanwhile, on that morning, the plan was ... because we'd worked this out for Nationwide, the plan was a set of directions from the regulator to the bank saying, "Here are the things you must not do in the next few days while we prepare for your nationalisation", including things like ... now, I'm not saying they would have happened, but including things like moving money around, entering big new deals, those kind of things - keep the business going but nothing new.  The next day someone from the regulator would have turned up in the bank and would have been ... in effect, have ... have had to be there and with an instruction saying that "You don't do anything big in the next few days without consultation with me."  There would have been a team then from the regulator probably ... would have to be in the bank within two days.  The biggest problem of all was we would have had to find a new chief executive within about five ... and we had a list.  We knew who ... who in Ireland was not running a bank at the time who had run one before and we had some phone numbers and so forth but that would have obviously been a controversial decision because, at the time, there was a view that no ... no one who had ever been in an Irish bank should run an Irish bank.  So that would have been difficult.  But there was ... there was a process of legislation ready but also a good deal of thinking about what the steps would have to be.  It would not have been pretty but it could have been done in four days.</p></speech>

I got it three months or two months after I'd started writing.  And I wrote it because I wanted to put ... to put things in the public domain that were not yet.</p></speech>

No, I have a lot of contemporaneous notes - loads of them.  But ... and I'm sure you've had them on disclosure from the Department of Finance because I left them there when I left.  But, no, no.  No, it's not.  And I say explicitly ... on the very front page of it I say this has not been fact checked.  This is ... I've done a ... it took a great deal of research to put that much together but still there are things that ought to be checked with the people concerned and I've said that on the document.  There's ... a lot of my recall is in there.</p></speech>

Was there a reason for that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.957" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#K01200"><p>Yes, there's two reasons.  First of all there are ... there's a misunderstanding.  Some things that you have are not minutes at all.  I seem to have been the only person with a pen, but some things that ... that ... that you see are simply ... not just contemporaneous notes but simultaneous notes of things that were said in meetings, and I was just scribbling.  And then when people asked later for papers, I, of course, made sure that those were, were, were disclosed, as appropriate.  Other things are bitty ... are minutes but they're quite bitty and frankly, the reason is that we were dead on our feet.  We were working for some parts of that time literally 24 hours a day, other times more figuratively.  But, but there wasn't much time to sit down and write minutes of meetings.</p></speech>

Is that correct?</p></speech>

I mean, you ... the person you would bring in would have to be quite expert, and if you had an expert, you'd want them working on the stuff.</p><p>So that's it, there ... there's nothing sinister and despite what people say, so far as I know, there were no records deliberately destroyed or any of that kind of stuff.  That's just how it is.</p></speech>

It's quite clear from that document ... Irish bank shares were falling, the number of banks remain on negative rating, everything was very unsteady and uncertain.  And you'd accept, I take it, that by June things were in a precarious state.  Would that be fair assessment?</p></speech>

I'll answer the question as well as I can and what I was saying is, if you needed a definition of precarious ... yes, precarious, but then some things happened later that ... that were in a ... of a different order altogether.</p></speech>

And in a note in ... in July - there was obviously a memo to Government about the budgetary consolidation, obviously, that was going on at the same time - and quite clearly in that note ... it shows exactly how poor the finances were becoming that there was a ... that the ...  &quot;As a result, combined with the tax shortfall of at least &euro;3 billion, <b>there is now a strong likelihood that we will be in breach in 2008 of our EU commitments arising under the Stability and Growth Pact</b>&quot;.  So, again, as I'm saying, just there in June and July as we came in to the end of the summer, problems were already there on the horizon.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Where ... we ... we then see in our ... in the notes and things that have been passed to us and have been made available to us, there seems to be a pause in August, where we see no meetings ... no minutes no ... can you explain why there was a silence or a gap in the month of August?</p></speech>

I mean, August is a time when some people take holidays and so forth but actually there was a lot going on in August.  From what I recall, for example, the ... the budget that would normally be in December was ... was going to be in October and ... was brought forward to October.  And that decision was made, as I recall, at the very end of August so there were clearly people working on the figures and so forth during August.  On the financial side, as I understand it, the ... around about the end of July there was a new iteration of legislation which would have been worked on through August.  So it may have been that in the natural course of things that people weren't sending notes around as much but there was work going on, you can be sure.</p></speech>

By comparison to what went before, yes.  There was a sense that, for example, in ... in June when we were working on this financial sector legislation, we were thinking, this was a might.  In August we were much more of the view that this was ... this was real, this could definitely happen, you know, and we would need to use some of this legislation.  But we thought we might  be using it for one or two banks, we didn't expect, as it turned out to be, using it for every bank.</p></speech>

And when everyone returned in September ... and the first note we have, 3 September, that it then seems to have rushed into a crisis that then was ... I just ... I put it to you, that's what it feels like from the documentation.</p></speech>

I ... I ... I can understand why it would feel like that, but what actually happened at the very start of September was a ... there was a trigger.  Certainly on the ... on the ... on the financial sector side there was a trigger.  And the trigger was that ... Reuters published ... Irish Nationwide received a credit rating downgrade.  Not a good thing, but not in any sense fatal.  But Reuters ran a story and their story was ... their story was "Irish Nationwide about to be liquidated."  This was a trigger point because that could cause a run ... and it could cause a run on Irish Nationwide, this was a Friday, it could cause a run the next Monday.</p><p>And, in a sense, in our minds that was ... you know, this was the point.  This was ... well, this is, "Okay, lads, this is what we have been getting ready for, this is what we have legislation for.  We know now there has to be a series of meetings, we know there are a series of steps and we know that since we now have a specific case, the preparation will have to accelerate and become very specific."  Up to then, we knew we might be preparing for something, but we didn't know what.</p></speech>

So I think that's why on ... certainly on the financial sector side, that's why you see a sudden rush.  It's because of that trigger.  And that ... if that trigger had happened mid-August, you would've had the same rush in mid-August.</p></speech>

The minutes taken by both of the banks from that meeting would suggest that things were very bad indeed for INBS in talking about a hole in the ... on page 132 of Kevin Cardiff's Vol. 1, it talks about, "The banks reiterated it was not a realistic proposition for either institution to provide unsecured funding for an entity that had a hole in its balance sheet which would exceed its reserves," and a Bank of Ireland document also suggests that there was a funding gap of &euro;4 billion.  So, at that point, at the beginning of September, those two banks, in their assessments, assessed INBS as being in a very perilous state, I think.

Okay, now, what I got back was a different message.  What I got back was a message that they were concerned, that they were not in the mood to take on this problem, that they thought its property book had some real problems, but I saw absolutely no quantification of it and, indeed, when I was looking through the documents, and you have it here now, it wasn't clear to me whether their minute implies that they even told the regulator at the time that this was their view.  This seems to be a discussion that they had afterwards.  So, "No" is the answer.  They didn't say ... at least no one told me that they said that INBS had a hole in its balance sheet to that extent but they were certainly signalling some issues.  And for us, remember, this was important, not because of INBS which was, as I said, a small problem, it was important because if they were saying that about INBS, were there things we were ... started to ask ourselves were there things that they know about the property market from their own books that they haven't told us?  So, this was our worry.</p></speech>

I think I've already said these guys said that INBS had serious problems in its property book, but no quantification, no suggestion that it would run through their capital was made, that I can recall to me.  And I was, I was sitting in a room outside, it wasn't like it was, it was three hours between the time this meeting happened and the time I heard about it.  I was down in Dame Street.  The reason this meeting happened was because I insisted on it.  I insisted on it because the plan was always private sector solutions first.  Now I didn't really, in my heart, think that although they might have implied it in the past that two banks were going to come to our rescue at their own risk but that was always the plan.  The plan was private sector solutions first, so I wanted at least to make sure that we had explored that option.</p></speech>

Below me William Beausang was the assistant secretary.  Michael Manley was the principal officer and two or at most three people, I think, below that.  The reason it was secret was because we were afraid that at any point the knowledge that there was a team working on a banking rescue might trigger a run on a bank and we were ... well, it was handy.  The fact that the budget had been brought forward meant that there was lots of people in the building late at night, which meant that, you know, our team could work under cover of that.  I did remember once a colleague from an entirely different ... who happens to work very late hours at all times tugging me on the elbow and says ... saying, "I see a lot of people around here who only work on banking.  I know what that means, but I won't tell anyone."  So we were trying to do it under cover of other things.</p></speech>

I said yes.  Tiernan O'Mahony was the chief executive of a company that had run into trouble.  But he was, by repute, and probably was genuinely, an expert at raising funds for banks.  And since we had a bank liquidity crisis, the notion that you would have a meeting with a person who was expert in raising funds for banks is hardly surprising.  If a person of that sort rang me even today and said ... if I was still in the Department, and said "I would like a meeting," you would take that meeting.  When he arrived, and I can only go on the notes, because I didn't ... I don't actually recall the meeting.  I remember meeting Tiernan a couple of times, but I've no recollection ... I had no recollection of this specific meeting until a year or so ago.  Someone ... well, just before I left the Department of Finance someone showed me the note that I had taken.  But the note makes clear that, among things, that we talked about money raising, and he suggested a sort of a broad Government guarantee.</p></speech>

So I remember that there were meetings in the Department, whether Ministers were involved or not, with Sean FitzPatrick, Gillian Bowler, I know there were phone calls with Brian Goggin, there was that meeting with Tiernan O'Mahony, there was ... I've a recollection, though I'm not clear if I'm just mixing it up with the Gillian Bowler.  Also there was Denis Casey, the Central Bank had a series of meetings with each of the main banks, formal meetings to ... around the same time, and reported those back.  So I just don't want to confuse meetings I heard about with meetings I was with.  There was obviously the meetings in the Central Bank early in the month about the ... about INBS.  I think that Mr. Walsh, who was the ... was it Walsh, who was the chairman of INBS either had a meeting with or a conversation with David Doyle and there's a document on that.  Anglo passed us in a document about themselves.  That's all that comes to mind at the moment, but that's ... but yes, that's the kind of thing that you would do.  At the same time there was all sorts of ... a sort of a way of doing it; people would sort of ring you up and say, "My name is X, I'm a high-powered executive in such and such a bank with a very big name and, sure look, if you need any help, not saying you do, but if you need any help you know where we are."</p></speech>

He ... an awful lot happened that night and don't take me at my word on the exact sequence but my recollection is he started the meeting more or less along the lines of, "Look lads, we have this big problem" ... a very calm meeting incidentally, and quite professionally chaired and so forth, even though the pressures were huge.  He started the meeting along the lines of, "Look lads, we need a good broad solution that has a real chance," more or less along the lines of what I said in my statement, "that has a real chance of changing the trend, of doing one big job that will be somewhat comprehensive."  And it became quite clear in his discussion that, you know, what he had in mind by that was quite a broad guarantee.  Now, he didn't say "And here's the list of things."  That ... the list of features emerged later in the discussion.  But that took me ... not took me back, because it was one of the options, but it surprised me a bit.  I thought the meeting would go somewhat differently, where he would say, "Okay, Department of Finance or Central Bank or whatever, you start from scratch and build up."  But actually he had a view, I think, from the start.  Now, I've read since, I didn't know at the time, but I've read since that there was a ... some level of discussion at the very least of this option at the Government meeting the day before, which is perfectly appropriate and natural.  So maybe that was, that was what was generating that.  But, I mean, frankly, it was good.  Here we were, we had been talking about options for quite some time and now we had someone who was saying, "Let's make decisions."</p></speech>

It came from the two banks.  My impression was more likely it was AIB that was more on top of this particular wording, so maybe it had come from them.  But it was being presented as the banks' view.  Where it went I just don't know.  I've looked for it.  I can't find it.  And I looked for it some years ago.  Probably ... this was sort of almost like a Government meeting, so I would surmise that, as happens with Government meetings, at the end of the meeting whoever is running it takes up papers, and if they don't look like they should be put out on the street they get destroyed in favour of the official record.  But I'm just surmising.  I had a ... I have no concern with the ... with the notion that the banks would give us such a draft.  I did later have a little bit of concern about the content of it, which I've explained in my statement.  But to the very best of my recollection it was one document and it came from the banks.  It certainly wasn't generated by us and then handed to them.</p></speech>

But it was clear at a particular point in time, that he had ... I don't think that happened, I don't think it happened in that way.  I mean, I mentioned, round about, it must have been midnight, it must have been nearly midnight, that, even at that stage, I said to him, "Look, if we're doing a nationalisation, I need a few hours to get it ready - a few months would be great, but I need a few hours."  And he said, "Look, Kevin, I'm not going to be rushed."  He didn't say, "Eff off, Kevin"; maybe he did, but I wouldn't have, maybe I'm immune to that, but he certainly didn't.  There was no tone to it, there was no sense of, you know, "How dare you."  So I don't remember it; if it was said, it, maybe it was, but certainly there was a point in the evening when the ... the decision was made.  And honestly, to my mind, it's a bit of an irrelevance in what tone the decision was made, so long as it was made.</p></speech>

My recollection is that there three features, and I can remember what I think two of them were, if my recollection is correct.  One of them was that the banks' wording - we had a two-year limit - the banks' wording, as far as I can recall it, would have said that any new borrowing in the course of that two years would be guaranteed for the full extent of its term; and the second thing, and I'm less clear on this, but I still think I'm correct, it was my view that the wording, just through a turn of phrase, would be such that any existing long-term borrowing, at the time of the guarantee, would also be guaranteed not just for the two years, but for its full term.  Now, remember, this is not that the banks did something dreadfully wrong in giving us a draft.  It was that, if you're in a negotiation, it's not a good thing to take the other side's draft uncritically.  And I think this was a minor incident in a very big night, but the reason I mention it is because that the public has this view that the banks walked in, told ... said what they wanted and got exactly what they wanted.  It wasn't like that.  In fact, the decision to give them a guarantee was not fully made, but I think it was certainly in the minds of the Taoiseach long before that evening started.  Certainly at the very beginning of the evening, long before the banks came in, at nine o' clock or ten o'clock or whenever it was.  So it wasn't that the banks came in, that no-one had done anything and the banks came in and said, "Guarantee" and everyone said, "Oh yeah, okay".  It was a different sequence.  And my reason for mentioning that story of what I actually said, to the best of my recollection is to the Taoiseach, was, "They'll be laughing at us", was simply because anyone would laugh at you if you take their draft and you don't critically analyse it.</p></speech>

And finally, Mr. Cardiff, do you believe that Anglo Irish Bank had an influence on the Taoiseach that caused him to believe that he was not going to nationalise the banks at that point ... nationalise Anglo Irish Bank at that point?  Do you believe that there was an influence there?</p></speech>

I dealt with him for a long time, and I believe he was influenced, as anyone should be, by information that came to him, by discussions he had, but the implication of the question maybe - and it's a fair question - was was there some special influence there, and I never saw it.  You know, I could invent incidents, I could look at a whole series of incidents and say, "Oh maybe that, and maybe that", but in the round, I think, and still think, that the man was doing his best for his country, and I don't think he was trying to do his best for anybody else.</p></speech>

I just want to deal with one matter there with regard to the NTMA before I bring in Deputy Doherty, Mr. Cardiff.  It's reference document DOF, KCA, and it's coming up on your screen there, it's actually ready to go, I think, at this moment.  It relates to, it's about midway down the page, it says:</p> <blockquote> 	In the NTMA, Brendan McDonagh and John Corrigan were my principal contacts at this stage, and they were briefing their CEO, Mr. Michael Somers, on a daily basis.  For a part of this time, John Hurley was missing while recovering from the Oireachtas [<i>sic</i>]  [and we've discussed that earlier with Mr. Hurley] it was a relief when he came back in because the Dame Street system clearly worked better when there was a single person to co-ordinate. </blockquote> <p>In this regard, if I could maybe ask you, Mr. Cardiff, is it your view that senior staff at the NTMA were aware of the range of policy options being considered and analysed, including a guarantee, prior to the decision on 20/9/2008?</p></speech>

There was, I think, a meeting in April or May, about options in general, which the guarantee would have been discussed, but was never suggested that it would be ... it would be something ... that guarantees in general were discussed.  In September, according to ... I had a notebook that I was using as my sort of jotter, and I've had access to that since, so that notebook has a note of a discussion with Dr. Somers, sometime around 11 or 12 September 2008, in which I said on the phone to Dr. Somers-----</p></speech>

I said to Dr. Somers, "Look, people, people are talking about this option; what's your view?"  And got, the next day, just an informal view back that, well, it might have an adverse ... it might look bad in the market kind of thing, but, that's not to say you mightn't consider it in certain circumstances.  So there was that, then ... from then on the NTMA was our, as the Department of Finance, our closest advisers, very welcome advisers, and there were detailed discussions on almost every option.  So, yes, as the idea of the broad guarantee developed, they were involved.  Dr. Somers was not only talking to me, he was talking to Mr. Doyle, I think, he was talking to Mr. Hurley, I know, because I have a note of it, so I can't imagine that there was any possible way in which he didn't know that this was one of the options.  And, indeed, it was discussed at meetings he was at on 18 September, and again later, I think, I'm pretty sure, and he knew that his staff were attending meetings about these issues also.  For example, I have a note somewhere that says, you know, "Meeting such-and-such a date, would have been 25 or 26 September, Dr. Somers has decided to send Mr. McDonagh."  So they became our principal banking advisers in September, and they were engaged in all of the discussions.  I mean, there might have been a moment when Brendan wasn't there or John wasn't there when I was there, but we were talking all the time; it was ... it was an intimate, almost, relationship.</p></speech>

If the level of involvement with the NTMA that you're talking about now, prior to the eve of the guarantee, is operating at that intimate level, how was it that the NTMA were outside the door for the ... when the decision was actually being made and, from the testimony that this inquiry has that the only consultation that took place on that night was very much of an ancillary issue, not the substantive one?</p></speech>

I don't ... I was in the room.  So, I don't know what Brendan was doing outside.  There were people who had been in the room who were outside.  People who were in the room outside were in the room and so forth.   Now, part of the issue might have been that I think it was ... it was probably 9.30ish when Brendan arrived.  I say this as if I can recall such things but in fact I checked the door logs in the Department of Finance ... so.  The door logs show someone from the NTMA coming in around, you know, late that evening.  I also checked my phone logs which don't say what happened in any phone call but there seems to have been three or four attempts to contact Brendan and finally obviously, I got hold of him.  So, I was certainly trying hard to have NTMA advice available and indeed, I also telephoned ... both telephoned and e-mailed the Merrill Lynch people.</p></speech>

The issue was, was your view represented.  I tried to represent the view of the technical teams that had been working.  If Brendan's view was not sought directly, it was because the people leading the discussion either thought they knew what it was or they thought that they didn't need it.  What I suspect it was, was that they thought they knew what it was.  And remember there were people in and out and I ... because ... I was in an out myself a little bit because I was mostly in the room, I don't know what information Brendan was getting.  But, for example, William Beausang, who was in the room with Brendan, had been at the start of the discussion in the room ... now ... look, you're asking people to remember conversations or non-conversations of seven years ago.  There is a clear difference, I think, between what I'm giving you as evidence and what Brendan said.  But Brendan was a man of great integrity who was trying very hard to be helpful at a time when not everybody was, and I don't think, you know, I don't think he's making up this story, I think he just has a different recollection to the one that seems most likely to me.</p></speech>

I mean ... be clear, I didn't say that the documents were destroyed.  I said that my surmise is that, as part of a routine practice, documents left behind ... they wouldn't be just left around ... so they would be ... and in the Department of the Taoiseach where they take these things seriously, you know, they would probably be put in a confidential waste pile or something so as to be probably destroyed.  It's just a security thing so, it wouldn't require authority, it would be routine, if my surmise is correct.</p></speech>

So, we know ... we don't have access ... well, to my knowledge, we don't have access to any of the 12 drafts or thereabout of your statement, we don't have access to the AIB document in terms of the guarantee.  So, either they are lying somewhere in the Department of Finance or they were destroyed.  The question I would ask is who would actually, at that meeting, take the decision?  Who takes that decision to, "They're the papers from that meeting.  Therefore, I will take the decision that these aren't relevant for the future and let's dispose them?"</p></speech>

Not accurate, but not very helpful.  At a more specific level, you'd know it because you ... we saw what was happening in the banking system after Lehmans.  We knew that banks internationally were having great trouble getting funds.  We knew that the banks, Irish banks ... some were already very close to out of money and, for others, they still had money, but the term was getting shorter.  So, even back in ... in June what was happening was that the person who six months ago would have given you money and they would have left it with you contractually bound for six months and then they were saying three, and then they were saying one, and on that night, after the point when we already knew they were in trouble the banks were saying to us, "Actually, now they're only leaving it to us overnight."</p></speech>

The Central Bank told us; Anglo told us, because they had asked Central Bank for money the next day.  They said, "Look, we no longer have any cash, please give."  They'd asked in the middle of the month for a &euro;7 billion facility.  So that was an ... pre-notification, if you like.  We had pressed and the regulator had done it.  We had pressed that someone would be sent into Anglo to look at ... start looking at their loan book, but also to look at their liquidity position.  So we had a ... I believe a document from PwC.  Certainly that day, I'm sure you have it but we had e-mails from PwC saying, ''We're in.''  And for both Anglo and Irish Life and Permanent they said, ''Here's our current position as far as we can ascertain it'', pretty accurately, "and here's how the next week looks", best case, worst case and so forth.

Let me ... let me run through them.  NTMA, Merrill Lynch, some elements of the Department of Finance were advocating for a nationalisation of Anglo with guarantees for Anglo, because there was no point just nationalising it.  If it was going to fall apart the next day, and I think, just don't get me wrong, but certainly some level of strong public statement of support for the rest of the banks in the same way as had already happened or was about to happen in France, Germany and a range of  other countries.  The banks themselves came in and they said, "Deal with some form Anglo and ... or Anglo and Nationwide and give the rest of us a guarantee."  Now, why I said "No" to you is that and is that I don't believe it is particularly likely that they wanted Anglo and Nationwide to fall apart that day.  So they must have known when they advocated a guarantee for themselves that whatever was going to be done with Nationwide and Anglo would either involve a guarantee or amount to a guarantee.

Mr. Cardiff, see when we talk about broad guarantees and it's probably important that we define this because we can .... within broad guarantee there is a number of different versions.  And it would probably best helpful to ask about the political guarantee and the legal guarantee because what has been suggested in evidence is that if there was a political guarantee you would be able to nationalise ... keep the bank going until the weekend and then take the bank down through ... through some type of resolution mechanism or some ... so there is a difference between that.  But I'll ... I'll move on to ask you can you outline the individuals and organisations who suggested that a broad legal guarantee approach before the night of the guarantee?  Who sought the views of those individuals and organisations?  You mentioned that they had come forward.  You mentioned some to Senator O'Keeffe.</p></speech>

Then in ... a day or two later I ... a day or two after the time I think that conversation probably happened, I spoke ... I had the conversation I talked to you about with ... with Michael Somers, but he wasn't advocating a guarantee or anything like it.  He was ... he was, you know, just being consulted.</p><p>I think then afterwards that my notes would substantiate a ... a suggestion from Gillian Bowler, chairman of Irish Life and Permanent, in a meeting.  And my notes also suggest a discussion about it and my recollection is, though it is only a recollection ... a positive suggestion from Brian Goggin around about the 25th or 26th to Dave Doyle who was then the Secretary General.  Now my note isn't comprehensive, my note says, you know, "Discussion with Mr. Goggin, not have a bank guarantee."  My recollection is he meant ... he was saying, "Can we not have a bank guarantee?", but ... but ... theoretically, he could have said, "Never, let's not have a bank guarantee", but anyway ... that ... that ... but ... but my recollection is that at that point Bank of Ireland was sort of coming around to it.  But all of these were conversations; you wouldn't read too much into them.  These were ... of their nature, they had to be a little bit exploratory so I'm not saying that, you know, anyone was nailing their colours to a mast at any of these points.</p></speech>

Can you advise who in the Central Bank kept in contact with the ECB and who ... with who in the ECB?

If you just take senior level people, forget ... because the ... the Central Bank is part of the European system of central banks so they're in contact with them, probably, daily.  But at a senior level, if you remember since Mr. Hurley was ill, Mr. Grimes was the Governor - not, you know ... he ... in legal terms he had become the Governor for the period of the illness, I suspect ... I suspect that's how it works out legally, so he would have been the principal contact at senior level until the deputy came ... until the Governor came back.  And he was at meetings, for example, on the 17th or thereabouts, out in Frankfurt - the regular monthly meetings, I suspect.  There's a dinner beforehand and the reason I know the night before they have an informal working dinner, I think so he was in touch with them then.  And the reason I know this is because some of the working teams were discussing this and were saying, "We'd better get a message to Tony to say, you know, we need to press on the collateral issue", and the message back from Tony ... so you have the meeting ... and the message back was, "They're not going anywhere on the collateral issue."  So there was that discussion around about the 17th.</p> <p>  Now, I also have a fairly specific note which, I think, is in my statement somewhere at the back and it says ... it's headed, "JH after telecon with ECB", so John Hurley, after a teleconference with the ECB.  I think I said it's the 28th, it was either the 28th or early on the 29th.  It's location in my jotter suggests the 28th but maybe it was early on the 29th.  In any event it should be easy to find out when the teleconference took place, and that has discussion of a few issues, the two big issues for Ireland.  Issue No. 1, Depfa, Irish-based bank going bust.  The same reasons that different ... entirely different type of bank but the same reasons a lot of banks were going bust.  Actually, most of their lending was to the public sector around Europe, not that risky, but most of their borrowing was very short ... not most, but a lot of their borrowing was very short term so they weren't able to fund it, they were just running out of cash.  Much more the classic liquidity thing than the other banks, the Irish banks, turned out to be.  But that was a big issue and, as I recall it, John Hurley was saying, "Hold up now, lads, we've enough troubles without taking on this subsidiary of a German bank", although I suspect he was asked explicitly and he said "No, we're not going there thank you very much.  That's your German problem."  At the same day he had a conversation ... at the same time there is a note, in my notes, that he had a conversation with Mr. Trichet, and it's a very short note-----</p></speech>

So he reported back to us - you don't seem to mind - he reported back to us that Mr. Trichet had said ... okay ... maybe if you don't mind taking ... you, you have the note there and you have what I say, but I'll say ... so I'll say it in English and then you can check back against my more ... my more specific wording.  But, what the message was was that John had said to him, "Look, in Ireland, we've got significant troubles in a few days, in the next few days", and the message back was, "Well, look at what we've just been discussing.  The Belgians are looking after Fortis; the Germans are looking after HRE; Ireland has to look after its problems."  So the message that was reported to us, and it's consistent with the ... what I've actually written down is that the ECB certainly, and probably Mr. Trichet through this private discussion, but the message back was you have to make sure your own banks are dealt with by your own Government.  And I mean I think ... that ... that's my recollection of the message that ... that was passed on.  At the same time, I have notes that suggest that there were attempts back and forth to make contact so I don't know if there was an earlier contact or not, but that's a fairly specific recollection and it should help you along I think.</p></speech>

There was no evidence to the contrary to suggest that as of that moment they not only were solvent, on an accounting basis, but that they had additional capital sufficient to meet their capital requirements ... at that particular moment.  There was also a strong view from the Financial Regulator that into the future they were going to be okay; not that they'd have no troubles but that they were going to be okay.  There was a ... a rush, in the two or three weeks previously, to get views and opinions as to how their loan book was looking, not because there was a worry about whether they were solvent on the night, actually is a bit of a side issue, because what happened was not a ... the problem ... we didn't lose money that night; we lost it later in huge amounts.  So where are they going was the issue.  And if I just run through them, the particular issues ... the particular two big ... the banks with the two most issues at the time were INBS and Anglo.  There was a ... an exercise to evaluate INBS by Goldman Sachs and Goldman Sachs knew the business somewhat because they'd already been doing work for INBS.  The regulator took advantage of that and said, "Okay, so you're in there, you know the business.  Now we want you to stop working for INBS, contract with us and give us advice."  And INBS, I suspect, agreed it had to be-----</p></speech>

We, we knew, and I said explicitly, that Merrill Lynch are saying that the Anglo business model is not sustainable into the future.  Not saying that they were insolvent, or going to be, but they would not be able to do the same kind of business in the future as they are now.  They had, therefore, a real business problem.

We may come back to that, that issue later.  Mr. Cardiff, you, you say in your statement, in relation to the Minister for Finance, that he didn't trust his ... at least one of his Cabinet colleagues, in terms of keeping information confidential.  We know from evidence we have before the committee that Minister Lenihan wrote to the Attorney General in relation to the nationalisation Bill and asked him to circumvent the normal procedures where he would seek approval for that before Cabinet, before he would go to the Attorney General.  Did Minister Lenihan confide in you who he didn't trust, and therefore these issues weren't discussed at Cabinet?  And can you inform the committee if, if that individual or individuals were, were named to you?</p></speech>

There was a problem at various times that the Minister was concerned that if he put specific information into the, into the Cabinet, it might leak and might undermine our attempt to keep things together.  I,  I never had a ... any inclination ... indication ... inclination of who he suspected or if it was a particular person he suspected, or just the process.</p></speech>

And it did, it had implications for ... I mean it's a democracy, so the Cabinet needs to be informed.  So, we always wanted the Cabinet informed and we were giving the Minister notes on a regular basis about what was happening, himself and his predecessor, so that he could brief the Cabinet informally as things developed.  I'm not sure if he was doing that.  I mean, he wouldn't come back ... you don't discuss ... the Minister doesn't discuss in detail what happened at the Cabinet meeting, so he doesn't come back and say ... but we were giving him notes and I'm not sure just on body language and things I've heard since, that, that they were hearing all those things at, at the time.  And, I think it was a bit of a problem later when I think, you know, a couple of Ministers made statements that turned out to be regarded as not, not credible.  I think it might have been a, a problem even then.  I don't think there was anyone ... I don't think there was any malicious intent anywhere, I think the Minister was just trying to be careful about what he said in places where it might, it might spread.  So, I think it did have a little bit of an implication for how business was done over the next few years, even down to the moment when we produced the, the memo for Government on the IMF bailout process, you know.  I saw the Minister checking the figures, not because he wanted to hold anything back but because he was thinking, "Well, what can I expect to be in the public domain in the next few days?"  That, you know, is this really confidential now or is it not?  So, it had that implication, it's ... it, it was a pity.  I mean, we're all for ... I worked on the Freedom of Information Act for years and, and I'm a great believer in it.  There are moments when people have to have a little bit of space to discuss in confidence and I think this problem was ... I don't even know if it was real but that perception was a bit of a problem at times.</p></speech>

Why ... but it's not the case that nobody examined ... if you, if you ... you recall, and you know from your previous witnesses that there was a whole system, with a Financial Regulator, with stress tests, with examinations, with external bodies and so forth, doing that work.  And, we believed ... were led to believe that the regulator had a good picture of the banks under its remit, that reasonable loan loss stress testing had been done, that the banks were regarded as solvent, resilient, capable of withstanding significant shocks and we accepted that.  And we stopped accepting it at the beginning of September when, when we had the Nationwide issue and it became clear that in fact, this general sense of how the banks were being run wasn't,  wasn't being backed up by very specific data.</p></speech>

Within weeks of the guarantee decision being made you had information, for example, that the banks had loaned out &euro;426 billion, including over &euro;200 billion to property.  In early December there's a note from Jones Lang LaSalle and PwC that the value of assets to different banks would be ... were overstated, in AIB by 40%, Nationwide 40%, Bank of Ireland 25%, Anglo 25%.  And, what I ... what I'm putting to you is, was not the single biggest economic decision of the State made with incomplete information?</p></speech>

Okay.  If we had a sense, or, in retrospect, greater wisdom, we would have, as the Department of Finance, asked harder and pressed harder on the Financial Regulator to evidence its, its views.  But it's not that there was no evidence, as I said, and I've explained why not.  So, it was certainly the case ... it is certainly the case, in hindsight, that more and better information would have been desirable, not just on the night of the guarantee but even before then.</p><p>As it turns out, when the work, the initial work was done by Pricewaterhouse in the two months after, they weren't coming back with a sense of the loan books that was very very different to the one that the regulator was providing, allowing for the fact of two more or three more months of information on the property market and so forth.  So I don't think it would have made a lot of difference to the decision on the night to have this more intrusive information available.  It probably didn't make much difference but that doesn't mean that it oughtn't to have been available, it ought to have.  So it was a failing.  It was a failing mostly of the regulator, it was a failing of imagination and-----</p></speech>

Here's the answer, okay?  Actually when the capital was put in, it was put in ... yes, the first tranche was put in because yes, PwC had gone in and so forth and that, and yes there were some, they had a picture of the loan book.  Actually the first tranche of capital was mostly because the ... it was clear that whatever was the PwC evidence or whatever was the Financial Regulator's view or the bank's own view, that the markets were no longer happy with a 4% capital ratio for any bank either in Ireland or in the UK or anywhere else.  All of the recapitalisations that had been happening up to that point around Europe were being done to a standard of an 8% core tier 1 ratio and our banks were somewhere in and around, well the minimum was 4%.  So even if there had been zero problem with the loan book, they would have needed to raise capital in those months and that's what that first tranche of capital was about.  The loan losses that PwC was talking about were on stress cases and all the rest.  They were speculative.  As it turns out, they did not speculate nearly as far as things went but that was the future.  So, so notwithstanding your suggestion that this capital made it clear that there was a hole that hadn't been known on the night, actually, no, the hole became a bit clearer a bit later.  And the situation was changing very quickly.  Remember now, property values in retrospect when you look at the figures, they have started to fall off but the biggest, you know, the first, they started to fall off and then there was a bit of a more, more swift fall-off.  That was in the third quarter of 2008.  Data that wasn't available and couldn't have been available at the end of the third quarter 2008.</p> <p>  So even a perfectly reasonable bank, bank accountant would not have been able to say, even on a revaluation at that point, that actually we have this big problem yet.  But that property value thing kept going and it went well beyond stress tests and it went well beyond stress tests for a few ... because of a few different confluences of events.  First of all, we had a bubble here in Ireland.  Secondly, the kind of international ... and very important is the international situation we had was extraordinary.  There was not just a huge fall-off in property values in Ireland.  There was a substantial fall-off in property values in other places, including the ones that ... that the places that the Irish banks had used to supposedly diversify their book.  And there was an absolute liquidity freeze and in a liquidity freeze, there's no money to buy anything and if there's no money to buy anything the values are forced down even further and it, it feeds off itself.  So, none of that was known and could only be guessed at, in truth, as of even December 2008.</p></speech>

There were certainly a lot fewer than the Wright report would have suggested and we were as Wright said, reliant on generalists who became economists, more than he thought was appropriate, more than, looking back on it, I would think was appropriate.  And certainly, you know, and when you look back, I suppose the evidence of what you think you did wrong is what you tried to change and that was one of the things we tried to change quite early on.  But I don't think this was what created a crisis in any sense.  Remember at the time, the bulk of the economic crisis was not ... of the economic profession was not seeing the world changing a lot differently to the way that the economists in the Department of Finance were saying.  The bulk of the banking profession, who ought to have been the experts, were also not saying that things were very different.  So if we had had more bankers and more economists in the Department, we wouldn't necessarily have gotten a different answer.  Groupthink can apply to big as well as small.</p></speech>

I'm sorry to ... I know you've got a time pressure but what we might have done is had more skills for handling the crisis.  Especially on the ... I know the economists are important but especially on the banking side, especially on the banking side.  That is why we needed to rely so much on the NTMA.  We didn't have in-house expertise.  As the Chairman said, they handled ... they and the Central Bank handled our banking for us.  We had to look to them immediately and even they then had to bring people in.</p></speech>

I wasn't there, I don't know what they were getting but I would have assumed they were getting a lot of data on concentration limits, on who borrowers were and so forth.  We had a bit of a problem, in the Department of Finance we used to have a process that when the Governor, when the Secretary General got board papers, he would sort of circulate them around the Department for comment.  But the 33AK stuff and all the rest, that started to seem like it mightn't be fully legal so that practice stopped.  But before it stopped, which was back in the 90s, I used to see Central Bank papers and they would have things like ... I don't know if they had names but they would certainly have lists of big concentrations and they would have ... there would be regular reporting that would suggest these things were being looked into, and maybe they still were but I don't know.  So if they ... so, depending on the quality of the information they were getting, I think the quality of decision-making.  But also remember there was an enormous pressure, huge pressure on the new regulatory system to spend a great deal of time on consumer matters.  That is not ... it is not a flaw but if it was at the expense of prudential matters, then it had a consequence and, you know, it was probably a feature of the thing being newish even in 2007.  If it was a more settled organisation, the consumer side would have been up and running and they mightn't have had to give it, you know, relatively speaking, so much attention and they might have spent more time on the prudential side.</p></speech>

But we had responsibility for the legislation under which they supervised and that gave us an influence.  So, for the supervision itself, zero.  For the system, yes, that was ... the legislative structure was there for us.  But here's the sort of circular problem: if you're responsible for the legislation for the financial supervisory system, to whom do you go for advice?  You ask the regulator, the supervisor, to tell you what they need and what they don't need.  As it happens, the actual supervision system they were working within wasn't designed that way because actually the political system ... very much, as it happens, the political system had decided they wanted a different supervision system and that was sort of ... they imposed a model.  But all the minor ... all the, sort of, more micro-level legislative adjustments were heavily based on advice from the supervisor itself.</p></speech>

We were not getting ... except what was in the financial stability reports themselves, we would not have been getting data on sectoral lending risks.  My assumption was, as I told you, because I had seen previous board papers and so forth, was that the systems that had been there in the past for checking on those things were still there, especially since the ... I think they call them now the supervisory directive is the capital requirements directives and so forth that came afterwards, made various sectoral limits and the like compulsory.  And we would hear, from time to time, and we would be informed of particular initiatives that would be taken actually that were sort of reassuring.  So, you would hear, as we did, that, for example, they were concerned about additional property lending so they had changed the capital rules, or they were making a change in capital rules to deal with housing lending and so forth and it had the picture ... it gave you sort of a picture of quite an active and interested regulator.</p></speech>

In that regard, I'm ... it's now 11.45.  I'm proposing that we would break until 12 noon and return at that time.  I'm also proposing that we would just go into private session, just to deal with some administrative issues that we have with regard to notifications coming in the following weeks.  So, with that said, I now propose that we break.  The witness is reminded that once he begins giving evidence, he should not confer with any person other than his legal team in relation to his evidence on matters that are being discussed before the committee.  With that in mind, I now suspend the meeting until 12 noon and remind the witness that he's still under oath until we resume and, in doing so, if I could maybe, just with people's cooperation, get the public Gallery cleared as well so we can briefly go into private session.  Thank you very much.</p></speech>

It's a very broad question, Deputy, but on liquidity ... first indications of stresses were in the middle of 2007.  There was a ... I'll run through it very quickly as I know you've time limits.  But there was a heightened concern in ... towards the end of '07 because of the end of year liquidity action slows down typically at the end of the year.  And over, on a sort of a gradual basis over the next several months there was a tightening of liquidity and as I described in particular a shortening of the terms on which banks were being lent to, there's one exception to this I'll come back to.  And then in September and especially, especially after Lehmans, there was an absolute sea change, an amazing revolution in how the world's financial markets were operating after Lehmans.  So, there was a gradual build up of the crisis, but the Lehmans event was a significant, additional change in the structure.  The one exception I wanted to mention was Anglo, which had some particular stresses around the end of March 2008 ... which eased over time, but they had a ... their share price fell a lot and they had a problem.  There was a, sort of a, a view that at least some of this was coming from a serious attempt by hedge funds and the like to both short their stock and talk them down to create rumours to undermine both their deposit base and their share price.  The truth of that, there's always stories as to why things are happening or not.  But the Central Bank and Financial Regulator did take action to ban some of the practices that might ... exacerbate that.</p> <p>  On solvency, well the banks were regarded in 2007 as not just solvent but resilient to future difficulties.  You'll have seen in the various papers you've got and in the various indeed in the papers you've given me that ... the SLAP principle or slam principle, SLAP principle applied.  SLAP was solvent, liquid, assets and I forget what the last one ... personnel was okay.  So that was the message both from the Financial Regulator, but not just from the Financial Regulator, all the external commentators even up to July 2008 were saying, "Banking system okay."  I think, for example, Goldman Sachs issued a paper along those lines in July or August 2008 ... the credit raters were holding them on quite a high credit rating until the first sign of trouble from them, that side was the, from recollection was the INBS problem.  So that's the sort of story in summary.</p></speech>

I have had done very extensive work to prepare for this hearing, as I think you would expect.  As part of that I have been granted access to old papers and files which have informed my evidence to you.  If I hadn't had that you wouldn't get as much evidence from me, maybe you'd be delighted.  I've also talked regularly ... to former colleagues at different levels to try and see whether, where I had gaps in my recollection, I could fill in those gaps to assist you.  And I have had, we had one session in the Department of Finance where we got together a number of people who were involved, including people who were more junior in the hierarchy, so as to try to have as much information as possible so as to service your committee as well as possible.

But it would not be possible for me to give the evidence I'm giving today if I hadn't started my preparation long before Christmas, so I have been preparing on spec all along.</p><p>Indeed, when you finally give us instruction you say, "Cover 23 lines of inquiry and, by the way, also we'll ask you questions about anything else the inquiry is dealing with and anything any other witness says."  So, really, you get very little instruction as to what you want from me.  I have done my best and I think I'm doing okay in terms of information flow at least.  So, I'm a bit ...

Mr. Cardiff, during your term as second secretary of the Department of Finance, and from your own knowledge, would you say that the Department was aware or to what extent it was aware of the risks to the overall economy from over-reliance on property sector lending by the banks and exposure by the banks to the construction sector?  And the background for that question would be - it's in the evidence but we don't need to take time to go there - but what ... the charts will show that property lending by banks went from &euro;15 billion, roughly, in February 2000 to &euro;175 billion in October 2007, an increase of 1,100% and construction credit for projects from &euro;3 billion in 2000 to &euro;26 billion in 2007 - 866% increase.  How aware would you have been of a threat that this can pose to the macroeconomic situation?</p></speech>

There was ... in the usual fashion, Deputy, I read a document this morning that I can't remember and I read a document years ago, I can't ... there was certainly specific advice to Ministers about problems that might come from over-reliance on the property sector, in particular, in the fiscal field.  It wasn't coming from me so I can't ... I can see if I can find it where I saw this and send it in to you.  But there was advice on that.  There was also very specific advice and probably much more specific than any of the external agencies were giving and so forth, and I think the Wright report says this, for example, in relation to the fiscal position.</p> <p>  In relation to credit, there was a clear knowledge of the fact that credit was growing very strongly and I think there was also a general belief that most of that was underpinned by, sort of, fundamental shifts in the economic position.  That was ... the things that were shifting that would support a credit growth or more credit in the economy - first of all, the sectoral change in interest rates, we had moved from a place where there was always ... pre-EMU we had always had to have higher interest rates to avoid outflows of funds from the economy so, in EMU that ... and for other reasons too, monetary policy reasons, in EMU, we had the European interest rate, which was lower, and that was a sectoral shift.</p></speech>

In fact, in ... for example, in the financial stability reports, things were dealt with but also, in 2006, there was quite a detailed paper by a guy called John Kelly and a colleague, I think, in the Central Bank, that they published that, sort of, looked into the documents in credit.  Now, the last time I read that was in 2007 so I can't tell you which quarter bulletin to look at but it was there.  I only remembered it because John was a friend of mine at the time.  So, there is a, sort of, a ... there was a real attention to the fact that credit was changing, growing and so forth but there were also these other factors that people were using to explain it-----</p></speech>

So, this was a note of a meeting but it was based on my jotter and my jotter didn't just say "8&frac12;", it actually broke it down into numbers that I can't ... I don't remember the detail.  But ... so I'm pretty sure that, yes, that was definitely said and it's down beside Dave Doyle in my jotter so I've checked back in it ... it seems like it was him but, yes, in the confusion of a meeting, maybe someone else said it, but it was said.  "After capital" was my recollection of it when I wrote this note.  Now, at the end, I should ... maybe I should've put this in the note too but the very next page of my jotter, it says, "Merrill Lynch says, 'This is all finger in the air stuff, we just don't know.'"  I think what was happening, to be honest, is that people were testing assumptions, as you would expect them to do.  Trying to say, you know, if X was so much worse, then Y could happen - that kind of thing.  At the end of the meeting, I'm sure ... and I'm sure that later in the month, we did not have a view ... none of the official bodies had a view that these banks were insolvent at that point.</p></speech>

But what I did say in my answer to - I think it was Deputy Doherty's questions - is that, yes, we went into that meeting knowing that there were property exposed and if things went in a bad way, then, yes, of course, they would have problems.  And we said in the meeting, we said ... I said, "You do know, if these banks have problems and need capital ..." or I don't know if I said it exactly like that but I made clear "... if they need further assistance, the guarantee means that we have to give them the further assistance or else pay out on the guarantee."</p></speech>

But was it very strange then, Mr. Cardiff, that the Taoiseach came in and from the very beginning, according to your statement, was for a broad pre-emptive guarantee, rather than doing the sums first and seeing what the potential exposure might be?</p></speech>

I mean, just to put it this way, remember the Taoiseach wasn't, you know, a <i>deus ex machina</i>that arrived at the last minute to sort things out.  He'd been involved in discussions prior to this, and with the Minister certainly, even in some of the formal discussions that you have notes of, so this wasn't a sudden Pauline conversion based on no information.  He had information, and the information was that, yes, you know, if you apply extreme stresses, then things would be worse, but as of that moment the extreme stresses hadn't arisen.  The stresses that happened in the next two years turned out to be worse than we'd all imagined, unfortunately.  But so no, I don't think it was strange.  It did take me as, I think, by ... as I think I said, a little by surprise because, well, frankly because I'd a different view and, therefore, I was, I suppose, grappling with the fact that someone else in the room had a view that wasn't mine, and was trying to address that.</p></speech>

Just by the way in passing, you might say in a word before I ask this question or when  you answer it, if, if the Minister for Finance was overruled on the issue of broad guarantee on the night, as some have, have speculated.  But I want to ask you just this last question, Mr. Cardiff, that in response to Deputy Doherty, you listed really one big player after another in the financial world throughout 2008 who came looking to the Irish people for a guarantee of the banks and the financial institutions.  And what happened to the brave new world of deregulated financed capital, where as Nyberg summarised it for us in his report,&quot;the paradigm of efficient financial markets provided the intellectual basis for the assumption that [finance] markets, left essentially to themselves, would tend to be both stable and efficient&quot;, which was also underpinned by a document you're familiar with, I'm sure, Regulating Better, of 2004, which essentially said that regulation should be subordinated to competitiveness?  And was the cohort, the entire cohort of public service supervisors, people like yourself at the senior level, taken in by this as much as apparently the establishment politicians were, and forgot the real nature of these institutions, which was private profit maximisation being their<i>raison d'&ecirc;tre</i>?</p></speech>

I've probably become more of a socialist over the last few years than I used to be and that's probably because I see some of the things you're talking about.  I don't think we were ever as taken in as you say, otherwise we wouldn't have had a regulator at all.</p></speech>

Maybe I missed it.  But no, I don't think that, I think, for example, the Regulating Better document you referred to, which I haven't seen in a long time, but I imagine, from recollection, that if it had said what you said ... what you say it says, we would have stopped it.  You will see, for example, in the legislation that established the Financial Regulator, where it says, the Financial Regulator should be supportive of growth in the financial sector, growth in the financial industry, it says, and I might have had something to do with putting it in, it says "without prejudice to the prudential protection of the system".  And without prejudice doesn't mean you do it a little bit; it means you don't do it if it prevents ... if it goes against the prudential necessities.  But what we did want to do, and we were very encouraging where we could be, is create new jobs in Ireland.  And certainly my personal predisposition, whenever I met people with ... in the banking sector who might bring new jobs to Ireland, was to be positive.  Because, I mean, maybe by the skin of my teeth, but I haven't lost my job in this recession, but I was out of work for a year in the last one and it's an awful thing, so I always have a predisposition, Deputy.  If someone comes in and there's jobs involved, I'll do whatever I can for them.  But the regulator always had that provision.  And, as I say, I don't know if it was me put it in, but if I hadn't ... if it wasn't me I would have put it in, "without prejudice to prudential supervision."</p></speech>

Now ... so it wouldn't be that I wouldn't be unaware or that I wouldn't be co-ordinating with those people, but it wouldn't be me most of the time who would be giving that advice.  Just going back to 2004 then, when I was in the financial sector unit, and the credit growth was starting to take off, no, I didn't ... I never gave, at that point in time, a specific advice that said, "Look, this credit growth is now a real systemic problem."  Probably it was a bit too early to say that anyway, but I did have a little bit of a concern that, to be honest, that the ... see, what I was running was a factory, it was a legislation factory.  You don't see most of it because most of it actually is in transposition of directives and so forth, so it doesn't come to the House except to the relevant committee.  So you won't see it.  But there's a huge factory job that goes on in that, that part of the Department of Finance of producing legislation.  And in that unit then there was ... there was one or two people whose job was a holdover from pre-EMU, which was to, sort of, keep an eye on markets and credit growth and so forth.  And I didn't really think that we were doing that analysis job.  We weren't giving it justice, doing it justice, because the unit wasn't ... it was doing other things.  So I arranged at the time that that unit would be moved into the economics area, so that credit would be seen and I think it later was, in fairness.  It was sort of wrapped into overall economic analysis.  I then went off elsewhere to a different job, so ... so the answer is no, but not, but you know, it wouldn't necessarily have been me.  But if you read the Wright report there's a fairly, a fairly detailed exposition of who or what advice was given and wasn't given.  And I was on the management committee so if I thought, if I had a sense that there was something being done seriously wrong or seriously inadequately, I would have said so.  I don't remember saying so, which makes me think I didn't have that sense.</p></speech>

We were ... the system ... the management committee was mostly a co-ordination committee, but the managers, the senior managers were aware of systemic risks building up, did bring them to notice, did explicitly advocate tighter, significantly tighter fiscal policy than was decided by Government and was not ... and their advice was not followed.  According to Mr. Wright, we should have not just given the advice when we did but we should have banged the table more, should have been more strident or more insistent or whatever, even more public.  But that wasn't the system we were operating at the time.</p><p>So there was, explicitly, advice and there was, explicitly, advice on these kind of imbalances, but there wasn't a kind of strident opposition, internal opposition, if you like.  There also wasn't, and to be clear, there was not a sense of a looming crisis of the scale we reached.</p></speech>

I wanted a better Department of Finance, and I didn't want what happened to be repeated.  And, you know, that being the case, I'm hardly likely to say, "Well, I disagree with the criticism."  I wanted criticism, because without criticism, you can't have improvement, so yes, I agree with him.  I don't think yet that our system is developed in the way that it could be, that would allow us to do what he says.  For example, he wants a more open and expansive Department of Finance which would ... indeed where the Secretary General would be making his own economic statement on a yearly basis.  I haven't yet had the, sort of, understanding that the political system would run with that, even while I was still in the Department.  But what the political system does accept and has run with is a more public Department where, for example, individual economists are making ... doing papers and so forth in public, where, I notice my sort of half successor, Robert Watt, who took over half of my old bailiwick, is much more regularly in the public than I would have been.  Maybe it was ... I suppose when I was Secretary General there wasn't much choice ... much time to be doing speeches but ... so there is movement in that direction, but the political system, even now I'd say, would resent a sort of a public internal opposition, that on the one hand was working with it, and on the next day was making a statement that said, in public, you know, "By the way, the Minister didn't do this when I told him."</p></speech>

I'm running out of time, Mr. Cardiff.  I just want to follow up a couple of things that weren't clear from the documents you presented to us.  The Sunday Cabinet meeting the day before the guarantee was made: was any decision taken at that Cabinet meeting, because you provided in documentation a quote from John Gormley, who was in Cabinet at that time, "The arrangement had been made the previous Sunday [right] and we had gone into that in quite a bit of detail and said, "Yes, this is the expert advice to go down the guarantee route?"  So was the decision made the day before, on the 28th, on the Sunday?</p></speech>

But there was no formal decision, because that would have been ... we would have received that; and if there was an informal decision, that wasn't, you know, we weren't told that.  But Government decisions tend not to be informal; it's either a decision or it's not</p></speech>

I know I've left the Civil Service, but you'd never get a civil servant to say that the, the Government isn't competent to make the Government decisions.</p></speech>

When you look at the people who were in Government Buildings on the night of the guarantee, were they in at the Cabinet meeting attending on the day before?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.1330" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#AA00900"><p>No.  No, the Cabinet meeting on the day before was, I think, explicitly to discuss the budget which had been advanced, so it wasn't ever so far as I know intended to be a discussion of the guarantee.  Indeed, just to underpin that, at the same time as that Government meeting was happening, there were meetings happening - I presume at the same time - there was a very lengthy meeting in the NTMA that day, where we were supposedly still working out the options, so it would not have made sense for that, you know, for the Government ... there was no paper put to Government about the guarantee or anything like it that night .... that day, because we had been instructed to meet the same day to finalise a range of options.</p></speech>

So, and all I did is I put it out because I don't know the answer, but, I mean, that's, thankfully, that's your job.</p></speech>

Just to move on then to the next day, and you said in your report on page 29,</p> <blockquote> 	But once the main decision to grant the broad guarantee had been made, the level of movement in and out of rooms and corridors went up considerably.  There was a lot to be arranged:[ including]...  	- Preparations had to be made for an incorporeal Government Meeting<br /><br />- a consultation of Government members and decision to be taken by telephone.  </blockquote> <p>Was the decision made at that point or not?  Essentially, I mean.  Substantively, was the decision made?</p></speech>

The first one was to recommend something to Government and the second was the Government's decision itself.  So, I mean, you couldn't ... well, it depends on how you look at it, Deputy.  If you think that when a Minister, a Taoiseach and an Attorney General come to a conclusion, it's likely to be carried by the Cabinet, then we were at that point before the Cabinet was rung.  But they were called, they were each advised of what was being done, and they could each have queried it.  But, realistically, I mean, there's a, sort of a ... people ... Ministers occasionally get slated in the press, "Why didn't you stop it?"  If the Taoiseach rings you and he says, "There's a big problem and we have to stop it and it's urgent, and, by the way, this is what we're doing", you probably have to take it on trust.  And, also, in fairness to various political parties and so forth, the next day, when the Government came to them in the D&aacute;il and said, "We're going to have to do this", it's not really fair later to criticise them for saying, "Okay."  When it's a crisis, you have to come behind something, and unless you're dead sure, you're going to come behind the Government, so this criticism of people for agreeing to the guarantee or not agreeing to the guarantee or some people saying they did and some people saying they didn't, and some people saying on the day that they don't really agree but they're going to vote against it anyway, the truth is, the Government presented ... the Taoiseach and the Minister presented to the Government and then to the general public and to the D&aacute;il, a problem and a proposed solution.  In the event that they hadn't ... in the event that the Dail had voted against their proposed solution, we might have had a much bigger problem.  There wasn't much choice for Ministers at that-----</p></speech>

Mr. Cardiff, before I move on to Deputy O'Donnell, I just need to ask you one question.  From the period of 1998 to 2008, if you could please describe the general nature of the advices, if any, that you provided to the Minister and Government on the risks associated with the trebling of expenditure, especially the growing dependency on construction-related economic activity and tax revenues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.1344" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Kevin Cardiff" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#AA02300"><p>No, I can't, specifically, for the very good reason, as I explained to Deputy Murphy, that mostly it wasn't ... that advice wouldn't have come from me; it would have come from the Secretary General or it would have come from whichever senior officer at the time was in the fiscal co-ordination because the economic unit and the fiscal co-ordination unit were usually together under the one manager.  Now at various times on the ... when I was dealing with tax, in particular, I would have given advices on particular aspects.  For example, I ran the process, ran it as hard as I could, that led to the abolition over ... on a phased basis, of the tax incentives.  And at the end of that period ... so that would be, I forget, you'll know, you'll remember better than me, probably end of 2005 or beginning of ... whenever that was ... whenever we were abolishing the tax incentives.</p><p>At that point, there was already some sense in the mix that, you know, maybe we're abolishing these things actually just as property is about to top out.  So, the property incentives were to be phased out rather than immediately cut and there were two reasons for that.  One was because in, in natural justice and having regard to legitimate legal expectations and so forth, people had made plans on the basis of existing law and were entitled to finish through ... to carry through their plans.  But the other was, that at that point, if the market, if the property market was toppy, you could actually ... you could actually, sort of, precipitate something more quickly than you wanted to.  I think it was Nigel Lawson said that the economy doesn't crash ... it doesn't crash on the fast downhill run, it crashes when you put on the brakes ... maybe it was Brittan.  So, there was a danger, I suppose, at that point, in relation to that particular issue that if you slammed on the brakes very hard, you might have more impact than you realised.  But the general fiscal advice was coming from someone else , so my pieces of it would be a bit different.</p></speech>

The first one up there is the increase in credit between property and other sectors excluding financial intermediaries and you see in February '99, there is kind of a concurrency.  Okay, one is over the other but by February '09, it's like the difference between Carrauntoohil and Mount Everest - the difference between those two spikes or two peaks and if you can just move on to the next number of graphs there.  You have the ... if you go on to page 3, or sorry, page 11 of the next document, you have cyclical taxes as a percentage of revenue which is page, sorry page 3, my apologies there.  It's page 11 on the other document ... page 3.</p></speech>

But I wasn't ... after 2004, I wasn't the person who would be ... who would have the pen, if you like, in drafting the response but there were quite specific advices about risk.  Even in the budget, you'll see ... even budget '07-'08, you'll see a listing of risks and even in the manifestos for the 2007 election, you'll see that those similar risks are not just noticed but acknowledged by the various parties and everyone, sort of, decides "Well, we see the risks but we keep spending unless things get bad."  Well, that's reasonable within limits.  The Department of Finance was advocating much tighter fiscal policy than governments and even oppositions were ... were acceding to but even we didn't have a sense of the impending doom that was there and while we might have been more conservative than most, we weren't conservative enough.</p></speech>

So, it's not a case of, "Well, we know this now, we didn't know that back then", it was known back then.  And this would show that there was 24% of the Irish economy in construction.  It would show that if there was to be a slowdown there, that there was a relationship between employment and construction.  It would show that there was a lot of the taxes that were coming in were based upon consumer or consumption taxes instead of what might be considered a real economy and so forth.  And at any time, was there an advice from you as part of your role in the Department of Finance to say, "That we need to kind of slow this down, we need to cool it down, that there's a lot of concentration going on here and that there may be a cliff that we could be going over if we don't pull ourselves back from the exposures that we have at present?"</p></speech>

Now, the truth is, Deputy, that most people who saw the crash coming or who now say they saw the crash coming, saw it too late to be in a position to undo most of the damage.  And even those people who had an inkling and there were some, in the official system as elsewhere, that things were now in a dangerous spot in space ... at that point, say, end of 2006 and so forth.  The quandary at that point was, you know, how do you climb down ... like you're on the cliff, the wind is blowing, how do you climb down off the cliff without precipitating the crash?   So, as I said, the thing I was involved in at the time, the property tax exemptions, which was a big enough thing - we were saying "Yes, you have to stop these but watch out for this slippy slope that you might actually create a ... create the event that you're trying to avoid", and it was also by, by certainly in '07 but even by '06, it was a bit of a problem in the construction sector.  We knew that construction, even kept going in 2007 but in '06, the end of '06, there were small changes or retrospectively smallish looking changes in the rules and mortgages and so forth.  But you could see that there was now a top ... kept going a little bit but there was a sort of a top to the market but you couldn't just say, "Well, let's, let's draw a line."  Let's say at that point that suddenly we'll cut credit by 20% because you'd have a ... you know, you would precipitate the crisis even earlier than it happened.  Maybe, in retrospect, if you knew you were going to have the crisis and there was no soft landing, you would choose to do it earlier rather than later but the soft landing, the soft landing looked in prospect and what people were talking about when they talked about that in the official system, it wasn't a soft landing in a sense of, "Ah, it'll be no problem, lads."  It was a soft landing in the sense of,Yes, you might lose 3% or 4% or 5% off your GDP but you'd be able to manage it.  So for the-----</p></speech>

We have to establish where that theory came from.  Mr. Doyle, to us yesterday afternoon, confirmed to us that there was no - unless you have information to the contrary - that there was no modelling, no assessment, no financial examination that they had actually based the soft landing theory upon, that it was other reports externally outside the Department of Finance that ... to which that discourse and language came from, nothing that they had by means of evidence.</p></speech>

I'm sure that Mr. Doyle is right.  He would know much better than I.  I don't remember anyone ever using, widely at least, soft landing as a soft landing theory.  But what I do recall is that people were putting assumptions and risk statements into budgets.</p><p>And for the 2008 budget, the assumption was ... don't quote me, I'm here ... but, from recollection, the assumption was something like 50,000 house constructions that year compared to 90 the previous.  And 10,000 houses was about 1% on GDP or GNP, I'm not sure which.  So, there was, at least within the assumptions, a very significant shift in that dimension alone.  Within ... so there was no one ... so when people say we all expected a soft landing, it wasn't that soft.  That was quite a bump that would have a real impact on people's lives, lifestyles and expectations in relation to what they would get or not get from the Government system.</p></speech>

For most of the years we are talking about, especially if you are talking about pre the time when I was Secretary General, I wouldn't have been the co-ordinator.  But, basically what happens is an IMF team arrives, they spend a couple of weeks, they do an extensive consultation, they have generally done a very, very thorough desk analysis before they arrive and before they leave, they write up a document - 30 or 40 pages, I think - which is their assessment.  They then come to the ... what they call the authorities ... but to the Department of Finance or to the Central Bank Governor or whoever.  I think, in theory, both the Minister and the Governor are members of the IMF in some way or the other.</p></speech>

Are we wrong?"  And the Governor will say, "Oh well, you know, this could be different or that could be different."  The Department of Finance would probably be quite critical in that situation and they'd say, "Well, we don't see where you get that, we don't see where you get this.

And there was no sign, from the limited discussions that people had had with the management, that they saw that.  So the thing to do was to wrap it into what we were calling nationalisation, protective custody.  Grab this institution and manage it in a way that reflected that reality.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Cardiff.  In relation to the OECD reports, which Deputy O'Donnell just touched on, from 2006 to 2008, can you outline for the inquiry if there was a discussion within the Department on the findings of those reviews, in particular with regard to house price inflation and the financial health of the banks?</p></speech>

I do know ... I think I know, I do recall at least that there were notes, as there would be with any OECD report ... there would be notes prepared for the Minister and for the Government that would say what was in the reports, what our view of the reports, what our Department's view of the reports was and so forth.</p></speech>

So that was already happening.  Also '06, there was a further ... some further suggestions on tax policy, including property tax, which frankly we didn't even bother, no chance at all, and there was some interim on interest reliefs, but I think we'd already done something on interest reliefs at the time so that probably was regarded as somewhat taken care of.  And that was ... I mean in my side ... in my side of the house at the time would have been the tax, that was ... that's my recollection of that.  In '08, although to be perfectly honest, Deputy, at this stage I don't even remember the '08 one; it's not in my head at all.</p></speech>

On page 3 of your opening statement you describe a crisis simulation exercise as being "carefully constructed".  It involved the Department of Finance, Central Bank and the regulator, conducted in 2007 on a potential bank failure.  I'd ask you to comment on that description and how it fits with the fact that the exercise lasted less than three hours.  It was described by Governor Honohan as "excessively cumbersome" and it ... rather than featuring a failure of an institution, it merely featured difficulties for a single borrower rather than an institution or a ... the whole sector.</p></speech>

So, I wouldn't have that ... it was carefully reconstructed, it took ... it was really well constructed in the sense of a lot of thought went into it over a period of weeks or months by the people concerned and there was a real attempt to make this a realistic thing that could happen, probably with the recent Northern Rock in mind.  Why didn't ... why wasn't it a simulation of a system-wide meltdown?  Well, that was never the intent of the exercise but also, frankly, a system-wide meltdown wasn't regarded as in prospect at the time.</p></speech>

One of the messages, lessons from the, the meeting was that look, if this notion of having different people in different places with their own teams doesn't work so let's, let's make sure that we don't have that happen the next time.  And you could see some reflections of it in our first reaction to the Irish Nationwide.  First, one message from the crisis simulation - don't run straight to a guarantee option, there's other options.  So, in the INBS thing, our first response was to look for a private sector's approach.  The second thing - don't have people in separate rooms.  When INBS happened, our first reaction was get everybody in the one room and work in on this together.</p></speech>

It wasn't a nugatory exercise, it was useful, it taught us some lessons but it didn't teach us to deal with the major meltdown because, quite honestly, at ... in December '07, we were expecting to prepare for a bank or two in trouble on foot of, you know, changes in the general situation.</p></speech>

I just want to turn to INBS and refer to page 4 again of your opening statement where you say "in the first half of September 2008, when it was clear that INBS was in ... difficulty, I told the staff in the [regulator] that [Bank of Ireland]  ...and ... AIB ... would have to be called in to assist in a resolution for [Irish Nationwide]".  What did you mean by the term "resolution"?</p></speech>

After that crisis simulation, the sense was that now this rush to the guarantee arose because we hadn't thought about a private sector solution and a private sector solution in Ireland meant the two big banks, and what you would look for in a resolution situation was that, you know, two larger banks would be basically handed the keys and said, you know, there that's yours now, you have to pay something for whatever value is in it but, basically, one or other of you, or both or you, subsume-----</p></speech>

Can you understand then that if you felt that that resolution had to be reached, that, you know, people watching might have difficulty in accepting that, you know, the guarantee subsequently, which you were part of the decision to take, included guaranteeing Irish Nationwide?  That if you felt in, in those comments in early September 2008 that a resolution had to be reached, reached for Nationwide, why was the guarantee ... why did it include Nationwide?</p></speech>

The guarantee was a ... no.  What you're really asking ... without ... so if I, if I avoid going into a big long explanation of why guarantees and that, what you're really asking was why didn't ... why did we think INBS was sustainable enough to guarantee it?</p></speech>

And I think they were even saying that actually, "Things are not as bad in there as we had expected to find."  So there was an expectation that INBS, over time, would lose capital.</p><p>I think, even in my notes there are ... I couldn't bring all the notes that I took, but, in those notes, there's even suggestions that they don't even run out of regulatory capital for a year and a half or two years on some assumptions.  So, it wouldn't have been untoward to rope them in.  Now, the question was were they big enough, the other question is were they big enough to be systemic?  In other words, were they so important that, if we just let them fail, that would have knock-on implications for the rest of the financial system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.1477" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/966" speakername="John Paul Phelan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#EE00200"><p>Okay.</p></speech>

For example, INBS, in terms of Irish GDP, was probably about the equivalent of Washington Mutual in terms of US GDP, and in Washington Mutual, they let it fail.  But a lot of people afterwards, including Tim Geithner, thought that was a mistake.  So, was it big enough?  I don't know.  But in normal times, you might let it go, but when everything else is very "febrile", to use Brian Lenihan's word, that he used a lot when everything else is very fragile you might decide that it's not worth the saving to protect it.</p></speech>

My time is running out, I'm sorry, I'm not trying to cut you short but, again, on page 12 of your statement, you pointed out ... and that on the night on the guarantee in the room "...once guaranteed they could not in any circumstance be allowed to fail &ndash; and so any capital or cash shortfall would have to be addressed".  At that point in time, did you believe that there was going to be a cash shortfall in the banks, and that the taxpayers would have to address that shortfall?  And, on the night in question, and prior to it, immediately prior to it, were the banks themselves asked specifically did they believe that there was going to be a cash shortfall?  The reason I ask this, and I'm not going to get back in again, we've had evidence from Mr. Goggin, and from other people, that two weeks after the guarantee, Bank of Ireland knew that they needed to be bailed out by the taxpayer.  And, would it not, on the night in question, have been appropriate for somebody, and not just yourself, to have asked them whether that bailout was on the horizon?</p></speech>

If they really thought that at the time, then they should have bloody said so.  We were managing a crisis, we weren't in the ... in a situation of having to play games, pussyfooting with ... with feck acting like that.  If that's their view, they should have said so, but they didn't.  But, let's be clear, we had that Pricewaterhouse analysis done.  It said they need capital, but not because that they had a big capital hole, but because the general capital expectation was going up and the numbers that were being said for them, even for three or four months later, were not huge numbers, it was ... it was &euro;2 billion of State capital plus &euro;1 billion of additional "underwrited", so &euro;3 billion.</p></speech>

You say in your statement: "...one should not jump too quickly for a guarantee approach, and should insist on a broader consideration of options".

It actually takes some preparation; you can't just do it, you know, it takes some preparation.  We had the possibility of giving very extensive loans from both the Central Bank and the Exchequer's own resources, which had been prepared for, and we'd actually built a cash pile, or the NTMA had built a cash pile for this purpose.  We had the option of giving loans from the NPRF in various forms, with paperwork already tested out during the ... during the previous months.  We had the option of setting up a CLS or an SLS, a liquidity swap arrangement along the lines of ... that had been used in the UK for several months at that stage, which would have converted bank assets into Government assets to ... so that they would get cash from the ECB.  In other words, a way to get back-door financing of the banks from the ECB.  I think there were other things too.  But that was the sort of list of things that we could do pretty much on immediate notice that night.</p></speech>

And there is no way of assessing the probability ... no realistic way, that night, of assessing the probability of things going wrong.  But there were some concerns about some of them, reasonable concerns.  The first was ... if you think about the idea of a direct loan, from the Exchequer resources, for example.  Well, we had the cash, we had a lot put aside, but, you know, in terms of capital, in terms of the Exchequer, &euro;20 billion is a lot of money.  In terms of the overall size of the banking system, &euro;20 billion might get you only a couple weeks down the line, if you'd a real out and out run at wholesale and retail level.  And then you'd be the Exchequer that had no cash.  You know, only your day-to-day cash, but not much.  So there were pros and cons of everything, and there ... the liquidity swap arrangement was at a very advanced level.  In fact, the final documentation on that was ... it was finalised at 4 o'clock that morning, so it was ready to go, whoever ... whatever bright spark was still working at that stage.  So, that was ready to go, and it was ... it had quite a lot of positives, but it had some of the same negatives as the guarantee, which was that this worked by putting the Exchequer's credit behind the banks, so if there was a loss in the banks, there could be a loss on that.  It was ... it would have been more collateralised than a guarantee, but still.</p></speech>

Now, I'm ... so, the ... what you said is ... is interesting in that regard, yes.</p></speech>

Well, to be honest, Senator, I mean, I could think of a dozen things I wish I'd done differently, but it wasn't that we turned up on that night and no ... there was no preparation.  There was a huge amount of preparation.  We might have prepared other things, we might have prepared for worse.  That ... that's the big failing.  But we didn't just turn up ill-equipped or unequipped for that night.  It would have been nicer ... better to have the discussion, maybe, the two or three days previously, and have a full weekend over it, but a lot of work had been done.</p></speech>

You say on page 36, in the case of the Financial Regulator, he was not in a position to give the DOF a clear insight into the depth of the problems of the loan books of the individual institutions and it was necessary to engage outside advisers.  In fact, we've found that, I think, Anglo and Bank of Ireland were both regulated, I think, by three people.  Should it not have been the situation that we should have had warnings about concentration in property, reliance on wholesale market and too much borrowing at too high a loan-to-value ratio and that these things should have been flagged and the Financial Regulator should have been able to tell you that some of the individual institutions were in serious trouble?</p></speech>

When we set up the new structure in 2010, I slipped in with the permission of the Minister a provision and the provision is that every three or four years the Central Bank structure, the supervisory structure, must be reviewed externally.  But, in fact, even in 2006, it had been reviewed externally and got a pretty solid report so there was something wrong not just with the Irish regulator, frankly, but with people's perception of what a good regulator would look like in that period.</p></speech>

Should a lot of those issues not have been sorted out when we joined the single currency, that we could have assumed that the single currency would be the lender of last resort instead of the fatuous relationship that you describe on page 26?  We should have had a working relationship because it was part of the European currency and it's only late in the day that Mr. Trichet says no Irish bank should fail and there's even doubts as to whether he issued that in any documents.  Was it not a normal part of being in the single currency to have all those issues resolved?</p></speech>

To be clear, I would bet an awful lot that there was ... that Mr. Trichet had issued that in no document and that it was only said informally but it was said deliberately, I am sure, but informally, and that was the feedback I got second hand through the Governor of the Central Bank.  So in that sense you shouldn't try to pin Mr. Trichet on things that he didn't do or say and, indeed, in some ways, Mr. Trichet was a good friend to Ireland.  My ... you're talking about tensions there.  My problem with the Central Bank at times or the ECB was that it was doing all this wonderful stuff for us to be supportive, but it wasn't supporting us in the market.  So, you know, they weren't out there saying,  "This is what we're doing and this is what we will keep doing", so people were always concerned that they might pull back.  Sorry, I have now lost the track of the question.  What-----</p></speech>

Even within the Irish system and in every other system where things started to go wrong there was, if you read the UK reports as well, there is a tension between central banks and regulators, and between central banks and regulators and finance Ministries.  The tension is always about who does what and whose job it is, and that was magnified at the European level so at the European level for the first two years of the crisis, the ECB was always saying,  "Okay we're doing this but we don't want to.  We think that governments should be doing more", and the governments were always saying,  "Well, look if only the ECB would...".  So this stand-off, you know, it wasn't a full stand-off but there was this sort of sense of a stand-off that got in the way and, of course, it would be nice if that was dealt with in 1999.</p></speech>

Remember, we were talking about the new globalised financial market in which everyone was fishing for liquidity in this enormous big liquidity pool.  It turned out that the liquidity, the globalisation was just on the surface and as soon as that little bit of surface money was taken out, everything was in much more restricted pools, like the tide going out.  It looks like it's global but when the tide goes out, you find there's little rock pools.  And the Irish rock pool in terms of liquidity for the Irish system was much smaller than it might have appeared.  Similarly for other countries and worse.  Those other countries and ourselves started saying,  "Well, look we better look after ourselves first so, Ireland needs money but we are not giving it to them because we have to look after France or Germany or, you know...".  I don't have evidence this happened, but a strong suspicion.  Certainly, in Ireland we were trying to say, "Look after each other."</p></speech>

If you look at in the US commercial paper market ... I've looked since at graphs of what was happening in that market and, suddenly, in a week - and most of the money is one week plus money so it couldn't happen much faster - but in a week, there is a huge shift in the amount of funds being lent in that market.  At the same time, in the UK interbank market, there is a significant shift in how much money is available between banks.  There are ... and this is a global phenomenon, the willingness of banks to lend to each other changed quite literally overnight.  And our banks were more, as the Senator was just saying, were more exposed to this kind of wholesale funding than many other people and, indeed, more exposed to the US than others because, you know, English speaking and we know the language and we know the place, so they tended to fish in that pool.  So when that market closed down and other interbank lending starts to get much more restricted and, suddenly, people were saying, "Well, you know, we'll lend you overnight or whatever", and then, on the night itself, the bank people - and they brought with them market knowledge which was useful - they were saying actually some solid lenders, some people who had regularly been their clients and their lenders were saying, "No quote for Ireland",  not just no quote for Anglo or INBS but nothing for Ireland.  So, in that sense, things that had been on a, sort of, gradual tightening path over a long time, that gradualness just evaporated and suddenly you'd a fall off a cliff in a very short time.  Now someone else we have to give you the numbers for all those, but that was the sense of it.  That was what we felt what was happening.</p></speech>

So, basically, the Governor and the Minister sitting on the now famous 7th floor of the Central Bank that day, sort of, discussed it.  I was there.  I did not disagree.  I was uneasy but I thought, on balance, if we had a week, it would be better.  The decision was, well let's ... since it looks like they can last till next weekend, let's take an extra week for preparation.  In particular, I think the Minister had it in mind to prepare the Government because neither he nor anybody else wanted a Government meeting in the middle of the night.</p></speech>

The Taoiseach was in favour of the guarantee without nationalisation.  The attorney, in fairness to him, was the legal adviser so wasn't pressed, I suspect, for a market decision and the secretary to the Government, I don't remember him giving a view but it wouldn't really have been his role.

The civil servant is not responsible for the decision made.  The responsibility for the decision made is held by the politicians.

The funding cliff was in our minds from early on.  Two issues arose later, I don't know if I may go into them, about the funding cliff.  One was that we change the nature of the guarantee so as to address ... to allow the funding cliff to be addressed, so within limits, within fairly tight limits, not on everything, we allowed longer term debt to be issued from, well, as soon as we had the legislation so ... and the Commission approval, so probably from 2009 onwards, which was addressing the funding cliff.  The other thing was that we started the process with the European Commission of getting renewals in place for the end of the guarantee.  We started that process months and months ahead and, for whatever reason, it was a long, drawn out discussion.  I suppose they didn't like the guarantee, and others that would be advising them didn't, so it was only finally ... the extension was only really, finally, formally agreed a week or two before the end of the period and that made dealing with the funding cliff more difficult; it made it harder to handle.  So, answer is it wasn't dealt with on the night, but certainly there were strategies in place and work going on early enough to address it but, as it turned out, the situation had moved on so much that even if they could issue securities at that stage no one wanted-----</p></speech>

The real question at that stage, Deputy, even in hindsight, the question is not if you could roll out the future and know what was going to happen, and know that there was, you know, X billion of losses in the system.  The real question ... the one ... the question that has been troubling us all along, all of us, and the public and everybody else, is not just how much loss there was, but if you knew how much loss there was, it would be how do you share it out?  Now if you knew the extremity of the losses, you would look much harder than we did that night for ways to share it out, ways to pass it on.  But you might still have found that there wasn't a good way to share it out and that you would end up bearing something like the same losses, because remember if our system ... if we had taken choices, for example, burning bondholders and all the rest, that would have had a negative impact on other systems.  Those other systems were the ones we relied on two years later to rescue us.</p></speech>

I think, for sure, if we had a perfect foresight of what was going to happen, we would have reacted faster, differently, much more aggressively.  But you won't ... you wouldn't have avoided all the cost.  You might have avoided very non-trivial amounts, like you know, &euro;10 billion to &euro;15 billion, depending on how you might be able to do it.

It was considered earlier in the year.  It was considered that it couldn't be ... that something like that couldn't be assembled in the kind of timeframe that we might be talking about, a few months.  And it was considered also there ... do you remember, that there were really significant legal difficulties that might not be capable of being overcome, because remember, what is a resolution mechanism?  The core of what you and I are talking about is: you take control of the institution, you manage it out, you share the burden of the losses.  Now, how is that different from nationalisation?  In a nationalisation, you take control of the institution, you manage it out and you consider what's to be done with sharing the burden of the losses.  But the reason, even in January 2009 when we did nationalise Anglo, we started thinking, as we would have done had we nationalised it September, how do we share the burden of the losses?  And at that point even, even with the knowledge that things had moved on and that things were looking worse than they were in September, even at that point there were significant legal obstacles to a little plan we had to force a few losses onto the subordinated bondholders-----</p></speech>

But if you wanted to burn bondholders, then, especially senior bondholders, then you have to talk about major constitutional issues that we didn't see a way around in, sort of, June 2008 and even in January 2009, even for subordinated bondholders, there were obstacles, both market and legal.  So, you know, this idea that there was a magic solution in the SRR system, it, it's not fully tenable.  It might have been a useful set of tools, but remember what SRR legislation does, usually, is it produces a set of tools.  What we had on the night was a set of tools, many of them the same kind of things.  The big difference is in how you share the burden.  And that's really important but it wasn't a decision that was coalesced on that night.  Those decisions coalesced over time.  It wasn't even the most urgent of decisions that night, because some of the issues about burden-sharing were addressed later and, you know, were capable of being addressed later.</p></speech>

Can I just ... this ... the very end of that question, and then the question which I need my phone for here.  If you had got your way, and you've pointed out that you didn't know whether you were right on the night but this was your view in terms of nationalising Anglo and presumably INBS and a guarantee for the others, in that event, who did you envisage wouldn't be paid?  So, what saving would there have been to the State?</p></speech>

It wasn't at that stage envisaging somebody wouldn't be paid that would be paid under the guarantee.  It was saying, let's grab control of this entity.  Let's get in there ourselves and run it ourselves.  Let's have the State run it and run it with the view to minimising whatever damage it would do and also run it with a view to reducing its scale of business because it didn't seem to have a set of customers who were going make ... keep it profitable over time.

Last question.  You mentioned earlier on about Governor Hurley bringing back the message, as it were, that no bank should fail.  Just to confirm, in his evidence, he confirmed that it was 29 September 2008.  You'll know that we had an unusual event where Mr. Trichet attended.  When asked by my colleague, Senator O'Keeffe - and I'm quoting through my phone - "[Mr. Trichet,] just to clarify ... you or the ECB never gave any message to Ireland in September 2008 that no bank should be allowed to fail."  Mr. Trichet responds, "No message to Brian, no message to the Government of Ireland."  What is your view as to the accuracy of Mr. Trichet's account?</p></speech>

Morgan Stanley pulled out.  They did really good work for two days and then pulled out for potential conflict of interest reasons and then the NTMA, Dr. Somers, decided to have ... to approach the chairman then of Merrill Lynch - I think his name was McDonagh - and he ... he arranged for Merrill Lynch to be brought on board.  So there was a general view that we needed advice.  There was my initiative, followed by Dr. Somers's initiative, followed by a team.  And then, at that stage, it was all sort of formalised in an email from me on behalf of the Minister directing them to give us advice and to take on external advisers and feed back in.</p></speech>

And, I think, the last line probably best succinctly captures that where it goes ... I think it's about the fourth line up, just coming in from the left, it says ... or the right, "Irish banks - in effect, they were in a vicious cycle: their inability to raise funds made them less creditworthy, which in turn made fundraising more difficult, and the credit rating downgrade would accelerate the downward cycle."</p></speech>

Other people started to rely on the guarantee as their only ... as the ... too ... like, if there wasn't a guarantee, they wouldn't have got their auditors to clear them.  And if they couldn't get their auditors to clear them, they were sunk.  If they hadn't had the guarantee, they wouldn't have ... their ... the guarantees that trading companies relied on from the Irish banks wouldn't have been recognised.

It allowed the ECB to get used to the idea that Irish banks would need support.  It did allow things to happen, but, yes, the storm was even more perfect than it seems here.  It got worse and worse and was masked somewhat by the guarantee.</p></speech>

I'm sure he'll describe it differently and better than me.  But, basically, unless you know ... unless you actually know that a bank has big losses, forcing losses onto people who have property rights is a real difficulty.  And they're entitled, not just to object, but they're probably entitled to injunct the actions you're taking and all the rest.  So it's that sense of ... because, remember, you're taking ... when you do a special resolution regime-type arrangement, you're saying ... you're taking value from bondholders, explicitly ... if the bank has value left in it, you're wrenching that value from out of the hands of the bondholders and you're handing it to the depositors - some of it.  And that's a difficult thing in Irish constitutional law, as I understand it, and I'm not the lawyer.  We were getting advice.  But there are also more practical ... sort of more micro-level legal challenges as well.  But that's it basically.</p><p>You have this <i>pari passu</i>principle ... that the ...

So, as I understood it and as I still understand it, there were potential constitutional issues.  Another very significant issue is that most of the deposits are in Irish law but most of the bonds are in English law.  So, you don't just have to ... you can't just change Irish legislation, it has to be legislation that can pass internationally.</p></speech>

I'm not presenting any position.  This is what I understood at the time was the law.  But, remember, later on we were able to share burdens but later on it became clear - more and more clear - that there were real loesses there which under ... which would've undermined the bondholders' entitlement to ... to sue.  So, what you could do in 2009 and 2010 you might not ... you might not have been able to do in ... in ...in 2008.  And remember, too, we did bring in SSR legislation later but, as I recall it - maybe I'm recalling wrongly - but I think that was even at that stage constitutionally controversial enough that it was referred to the Council of State - I don't think it was ... it was signed by the President straightaway.  And remember, too, that the new SSR legislation is, you know, I imagine has a different ... situation because it's perspective.  So, a bondholder buys a bond now knows he does so in the context of legislation that's already there.  So, how can he claim later that we're interfering with his property rights?  Whereas if the legislation comes after the bond is bought, I think that is probably different.  But, almost certainly, the Attorney will either tell me I'm wrong or tell you I'm wrong or have a very different and better way of explaining it.  The former Attorney.</p></speech>

Your Minister - former Taoiseach - at the time of 17 March, Mr. Cowen, Minister Cowen, had a phone call with Seanie FitzPatrick.</p><p>On 24 April he had a private meeting with the board and executives of Anglo Irish Bank and on 28 July he had the event at the Druids Glen golf club or social club.

Can you clarify this issue for me in relation to when was the point of no return for the State in terms of guaranteeing the liabilities of the bank?  And I ask that question ... you mentioned in your opening statement about the fragility of the guarantee and the potential challenge.  Now we know from your statement that the legislation was passed within days of the guarantee being announced and then the scheme was passed in the D&aacute;il about two weeks later, that banks were invited on 22 October to enter the scheme and the order was signed on the 24th.  Can you inform us, when was the point where the Government ... where we had moved from a moral obligation to do what the Government announced on the night, to we were legally bound to guarantee Anglo, Nationwide and all of the other banks?</p></speech>

But, what we were also seeing in those 24 days, Deputy, was this perfect storm issue that I've been talking about.  It actually became very clear, that without the guarantee, an awful lot of things could happen that would be even worse than what we had at the time and the idea that you would pull it ... remember, a lot of new money came in on foot of the guarantee but it didn't come in four weeks later.  It started coming in immediately.  So, that you would pull out of the guarantee with hundreds of millions, billions and millions of deposits, based explicitly on it, would've created a ... would've created ... I don't know.  It would've been extraordinarily risky.  But, no, I don't recall - to answer your ... to actually answer your question - I don't recall a discussion about pulling out at that stage.  I think we'd gone beyond that point.  In practical terms, we were beyond the no return point.</p></speech>

Mr. Chairman and members of the committee, I welcome the opportunity to be here today and hopefully the testimony will be helpful to your important job.  You already have the written statement that I have distributed, so I'll only just hit some of the main points orally and we can discuss other matters later, should you wish to do so.</p> <p>  I'd like to, however, first just mention that it really was a great honour for me to join the Department in 2011 and to be able, with my colleagues, to play a part in putting in place the recovery we are seeing in the Irish economy and the banking system.  To have been able to play a role in bringing a country back from the edge from bankruptcy to one of the fastest growing economies in Europe with unemployment now reaching below 10% and continuing to decline, is one of the greatest honours I shall ever have had.  If the changes we worked to implement and the information we share today help prevent the occurrence of a similar economic disaster for Ireland, I shall be very happy.</p> <p>  Just pointing out a couple of things, I suppose, as we go through this, I think one of the most important things I picked out from the terms of reference, which is the context in which you're looking at the work you're doing, was that despite what is often said, our crisis was not just a banking crisis, it was very much a fiscal one.  I think we see people and in a way I've said in my statement ... people, sort of, are used to watching thriller TVs and movies and they are accustomed to seeing plots with high suspense - good guys, bad guys.  They wanted the drama of this crisis to be written and couched in terms of irresponsible overpaid bankers, reckless developers, the night of the bank guarantee and the burning of those faceless bondholders.  It makes good TV but it's not the reality.  The reality is much more mundane.  A simple rhetoric has been entertained in Ireland that if we had not had the collapse of Lehman Brothers and the Irish banks had burnt the vulture funds, we would have had no issues.  One thing is for certain, the property collapse led to awful widespread destruction and growths of unemployment, poverty and emigration but the sad reality is that it was the acute lack of fiscal capacity at governmental level that restricted the flexibility in how we might deal with that since 2011.  </p> <p>  The fiscal rectitude we are now experiencing, in my view, is more accurately a result of the perilous structure of Ireland's fiscal income and expenditure.  Revenues collapsed as spending continued and indeed, had to rise to protect the vulnerable.</p><p>This caused recurring deficits which had to be painfully funded by piling yet more debt onto the back of future generations.  Today, we are still giving ourselves public services, wages and payments for which we ourselves are not paying enough and leaving the bill to our children and their children.  People like repeating that we have put &euro;64 billion into the banks. The reality is we'll probably recover about half of that.  People talk a lot less about the fact that each year we have loaded debt onto the country to pay for ongoing annual deficits, none of which we&rsquo;ll get back.  And that debt is going to end up being more than three times the net bank debt.  This should not be forgotten.  Nor should we forget that the fact is that without austerity measures ,which have reduced the recurring overspends, the debt would be even more and would have grown even more by deferring those austerity measures.<br/><br/>Prior to the crisis, nobody had considered what might happen to stamp duty, capital gains and nobody provided for what might happen when stamp duty, capital gains taxes, PAYE revenues related to the property sector, employees and social welfare payments related to unemployed property sector employees or even to spend your wages in the economy and people's standards of living.  What would happen when construction would resize to what we knew and could have known?  It was a more sustainable quantum.  It's true that it's important to understand why the Government, the Civil Service, the regulator or even the banks themselves had not done enough and not done more to restrict borrowing and the growth of the property market.  It is important to know why and how the Government took decisions about the bank collapse, but, for me, it is even more important that we understand for future-proofing our State, what was it in the structure, the operation, the DNA of the organs of our State, the political system, the Civil Service, the broader public sector that allowed this precarious fiscal situation to develop?  The decision-making processes related to the collapse of the banks may give you some hint, but I encourage you to look at the answer to that more general question.<br/><br/>Had alternative routes been followed beforehand, how much less painful would the last couple of years have been when the rug was taken out from under our fragile structure by the collapse of Lehman's and the international wholesale funding?  With a better underlying fiscal situation, we might have been able to show ... shoulder the bear ... the burden of capitalising banks without austerity measures or a bailout.  Where was the debate recommending these alternatives, which might not have been so politically popular?  How did the decisions get made?  Why did no political party manifesto contain proposals for the introduction of property taxes, for the introduction of charges for the consumption of water, more appropriate burdens of sustainable taxes to pay for the necessary public services, the reduction of public sector pay back to long-term sustainable levels?  Why did windfall gains from capital gains or construction sector payroll taxes not get put aside for a rainy day fund?  Because we in Ireland certainly know that no matter how long the sunny, dry spell will be, it will rain sooner or later.  And when we say the Irish public played no role in this crisis, ask would we - and I am one of those - have voted for such a party making those promises in the 2007 election promise?<br/><br/>You asked me to talk about the role of the EIB and the EU.  I am happy to say more about that later and I have laid out a lot more in my statement.  But just to say that my early impressions was that they, like us, were learning what to do in a complicated troika-type scenario.  This was new territory for almost everyone, bar, perhaps, the IMF.  And I can remember, for example, really, very strained discussions in early 2011 trying to convince the ECB team that it was simply not possible in the markets of 2011 to sell tens of billions of mortgage loans in the UK to allow for faster repayment of the ECB without having a fire sale to the great disadvantage to the Irish banks and State.  Happily, we prevailed.<br/><br/>But recalling what I said above, had we not also been faced with funding large fiscal deficits for 2010 and for the foreseeable future thereafter, our negotiating power during those years would have been very much stronger and the bailout much more limited in its terms.  There were other issues, of course, where we held opposite views with the troika, but both sides always tried to reach a solution and I think that served us well when you compare the performance of the Irish recovery to those of others.  And, of course, the evolving role of the EU, which we can talk about in more detail, now means that they have greater oversight over our affairs and we have greater oversight over other European governments.<br/><br/>You also asked me to talk about IBRC.  Clearly, I am not able to discuss matters that are also before the commission of inquiry.  So I'll talk about two other matters in ... that also relate to that .. that entity.  The first one I picked was what might have happened if we had achieved more burden-sharing in 2011.  In simple terms, when we look at it today, the State's direct loss from the banking collapse is likely to be the taxpayer money contributed to IBRC.  There are many reasons to justify why senior, and not just junior, creditors might have borne more of the cost of the collapse witnessed in the Irish economy and the banking system.  But by the time I got involved in these issues in 2011, this question was significantly less meaningful.  The guarantee had already been issued.  The decision to fund the repayment of the creditors of Anglo and INBS with the promissory note payments had already been taken.<br/><br/>So our decision was based on the following facts.  Only &euro;3.7 billion of senior, unsecured bondholders remained in what was IBRC at that time.  This is still a large sum but it needs to be compared with the potential prizes we could gain by continuing to work with the troika lenders.  Recall that, shortly afterwards, we negotiated a significant interest rate reduction worth some &euro;9 billion.  Unless we could have gotten the ECB on side, there were major funding implications for the banks and they were very much opposed in March 2011 and vocal about that.  We would also have to consider what would be the impact for retail depositors of a withdrawal of Central Bank funding to the banks and also their refusal, perhaps, to allow for troika disbursements to a State fast running out of cash.  There were implications of ... on a future funding costs of the banks, not just IBRC.  Senior unsecured creditors, I think, you explained ... was explained this morning, included depositors to the banks.  And banks, as we all now know, depositors were ranked <i>pari passu </i>with bondholders.<br/><br/>Capital had already been introduced into many of the banks so reducing the hole could not be done necessarily because there wasn't a hole there any more to be filled by burden-sharing and still reflect the normal distribution of creditor rights.  And the six banks were six individual legal entities so we couldn't take a deficit from one to use it to ... to justify bond ... burden-sharing in another bank.  In rushing to over-emphasise the impact of this decision, I would also like us not to lose sight of one simple fact much overlooked in the public debate.  Burning senior bondholders, a route resisted by the troika, especially the ECB, was not going to be the solution to our problems in 2011.  Yes, it would have been nice, it would have maintained social cohesion a little better and it would certainly have appeased public anger, but we needed actions with repeating annual impact to reduce the deficit on an ongoing basis.  As I explained more in my statement, contrary to the perception which has been created by some, burning bondholders was not going to generate cash, income and windfalls to the State to ease austerity.  If it could have been pulled off, it would have only increased the value of the banks, so, ultimately, when we would sell or liquidate them we may have gotten a bit more or given more, in fact, back to creditors, or it would have done what we did, which was to borrow some money that, thanks to the promissory note transaction, will now only need to be repaid 30 years from now.  So at best we were looking at that time at a reduction of 1% or 2% of our debt number, not cash, when the debt was over already 100% of GDP.  <br/><br/>The other thing I think we may need to talk about is IBRC and the promissory note transaction.  And I think we will probably come back to that specifically so I won't dwell too long, other than to say that to me, without doubt, replacing the existing debt commitment of the State with longer dated, lower interest rate debt was certainly a very good deal for the State and a key to our exiting the bailout successfully.  Remember, the annual pain that we have today from what I might call the IBRC debt, namely, the debt which replaced the promissory note, to the annual deficit is only the annual interest demand.  And I would remind you, as it has been pointed out by other commentators, that all of our bank bailout debt causes only about &euro;800 million of interest expense out of the &euro;7.5 billion of interest payments faced by the State in 2015.  I don't want you to pick me up on the exact numbers because I am quoting a, sort of, commentator on that and didn't check that with the Department, but it gives you some sense of the disproportionate magnitude of the debt related to deficits compared to the bank bailout debt.  And while this transaction did not take away the burden of the pre-2011 decision, it made it a lot more affordable for the State.  It provided fiscal space to increase spending in the short term for other priorities and it deferred the burden to a time where we might be in a better position to pay it.<br/><br/>Equally, the reputation of the country and its sovereign covenant was maintained.  And I think the counter-factual of what might have happened otherwise is playing out, sadly, before our eyes in Luxembourg today in the discussions about Greece.  By contrast to Greece, because of the significant release of funding pressure, we actually reduced our borrowing costs to allow us to also fund the tens of billions of debt to fund the cumulative annual deficits, which are now more affordable.</p><p> The other main area I thought I should just touch on is the appropriateness ... you asked me to talk about the appropriateness of advice to Government.  And I'm not going to talk about individual pieces of advice but I thought there were some observations I had, as somebody who came to the system from the outside, that might give you, sort of, some additional insight.</p></speech>

I had mentioned I was just on the point of identifying a number of observations about the way I saw the system working, perhaps coming from a unique perspective as a so-called reputed outsider holder of a Secretary General position.  And as I said, a lot of these are laid put in more detail in my written statement, but, first, I suppose I found it surprising, in joining the Department, how little debate on strategic issues for Ireland was, or could be, led publicly by civil servants.  It seems other Ministers often have discouraged this practice in the past; I was lucky not to have one of those.  Officials are criticised for not engaging more outside their own Departments but when they do venture out into the public debate, are they supported by the public?  Are they supported by the public representatives?  My own experience was to suffer what I consider still to be unacceptable interference into my personal life by the media, and, indeed, inaccurate public criticism by serving public representatives when I dared to stimulate discussion on key choices in housing policy and stated facts in a neutral but truthful way about repossession statistics.  Unless our system robustly defends, not attacks, civil servants acting in good faith, is it fair to expect them to be more vocal and point out alternative, however unpopular, political choices or to protest loudly when perhaps a wrong decision is being contemplated?<br/><br/>Secondly, I was surprised at how little proactive - and I stress that word &quot;proactive&quot; - debate about strategic longer-term choices for Ireland was taking place, even in private, within the corridors of power in ways that involved the full broader leadership team of all of the Government Departments.  I had imagined I would be stepping into a cauldron of debate about all sorts of important issues about the long-term future direction of the country and whether we were on the right track.  Perhaps the crisis had crowded out this debate, if it was happening before, but, should our political system not also encourage this more and not allow or demand that time to be crowded out by an agenda dictated on short termism? <br/><br/>Next, elected representatives have a nature and role different to those employed on a long-term basis in the public administration, but both must work together.  I observed from both sides what I would say are unhelpful perceptions on the lack of equilibrium in relative status given to political decision makers and to the public service, especially the Civil Service.  Have we really achieved an unqualified environment of mutual respect to encourage true free debate across the system?  The Cabinet, which I know you've looked at quite a lot, is a primary hub of decision-making in Ireland, where not just the decision making about the bank guarantee took place but, indeed, all major Government decisions.  How does advice get to this forum?  Is it the right choice, in 2015, that civil servants with the background technical details from relevant Departments are excluded from the debates at Cabinet?  What if, during the debate, someone raises a novel technical point not addressed in the supporting papers?  Does one just defer?  When I came to the Department in 2011, I had no reason to believe it would be that way; in fact, I thought it was the opposite.  Is it right in 2015 that traditions developed when the world was less complicated, vast and interconnected, continue to form the basis of our most fundamental decision-making forum?<br/><br/>Another interesting aspect of the operation of Cabinet sub-committees is how often status updates on the deteriorating, or improving, economic and banking system helped come to those issues ... to those forum.  What happens annual reviews and plans of Departments which are not ... which are debated not in the presence of the Secretary General?  Another surprise was to discover that former Governments seemed at least, so the story goes, to have discouraged, maybe even banned, the idea of Secretary Generals as a group meeting together to discuss policy unless their Ministers were present.  I had expected to find much more robust debate among the senior Civil Service team as a leadership group on the issues facing the country.  I had expected to see fora for the Civil Service leadership to debate the same issues that I mentioned in my written statement.  I would have expected to have seen before Cabinet ideas about the State's financial priorities for spending and the rest.  The troika process actually meant I didn't notice this vacuum for quite some time as we were, in fact, doing that in part of the troika process.  But if Secretaries General can't meet to discuss policy without Government Ministers, I'm left to wonder when was the last time the Taoiseach of Ireland, all of the key Ministers and their Secretaries General, perhaps their advisers stepped out together for a senior management one or two-day off-site to discuss the priorities they see facing the country?<br/><br/>I arrived at the Department when the Department was being restructured into two separate Departments and maybe that accentuated the vacuum.  It leaves me wondering if putting spending and taxation in different Departments is the right way forward to facilitate holistic thought process about priorities.  Oireachtas committees might also help by acting as a forum in which technical civil servant experts, together with public representatives, may discuss matters freely and publicly, but some committees prefer interrogation styles rather than debating among equals.  Debates are often done Department by Department rather than involving officials from across the system to a relevant subject matter.  Does the adversarial nature of Oireachtas committees encourage the type of informed cross-party political debate which might serve the country well into the future?  Why, for example, would those posing the questions not simply always provide at least their preliminary question or areas of inquiry in advance with precision?  We all know how much better our answers were at school when the lecturers gave us significant hints about the questions coming up on the exams.  This should not be an exam to catch out civil servants or a Department with surprise questions but should rather be a public debate on the issues to inform.<br/><br/>We've been asked to talk about the Department&rsquo;s relationships with the NTMA, and I would assume from the papers I received that there would be some significant questions on that, so I won't necessarily go in to those.  I laid out some of the changes we made on the banking policy governance side in 2011, which, I think, were important, to allow us to move decisively and cohesively on the bank restructuring.  I've explained the changes we made to the NTMA to change very much the governance structure there and I think I've also pointed out the key role that the so-called principals' group could make and the challenges of making that a more strategic, rather than an operational, forum.<br/><br/>I want to just finally deal, as a last point, with this important issue of the management of contrarian views.  As I mentioned in my statement, I set out in detail for the PAC measures we had taken to reform the operation of the Department just before, or in fact just after I had resigned as Secretary General and that speech is included in the documents I know you have before you.  I can't improve on the description by restating it in new words here.  I would just repeat for you one paragraph of my speech last year, for those who haven't, and the public, had time to read it:</p> <blockquote> 	For [this job] further embedding of a culture of openness, of internal and external challenge and peer review, of risk management and robust and innovative policy formulation is key.  This is not easy stuff though.  It requires ensuring adequate investment to have access to the best talent and information.  It means learning to listen.  It means embracing an environment often lacking in organisations across the world of open, free and honest debate and mutual trust where everyone&rsquo;s views are well received and cheap shots avoided.  It requires the nurturing of talent so as to create the leaders of tomorrow who need to be instilled with a sense of creativity to develop policies for a changing world but also a sense of conviction and courage to be able to identify the next problem and shout stop, when it is needed. </blockquote> <p>It is hard to change tradition.  In my written statement, I have laid out all of the various changes that we went through in the Department and I know Derek is coming on afterwards so I can perhaps just stop there now, Chairman, and let us go to questions and we can go on to the details of any of those changes, if we need to.  Thank you very much.</p></speech>

We're a bit later starting I think than scheduled but you're welcome.  A couple of things from your opening statement that I want to refer to at the start, and I want to quote you directly actually.  You said, "My own [personal] experience was to suffer what I still consider to be unacceptable interference by the media into my personal life."</p><p>I just want to ask you, how did that manifest itself - and how do you believe that that could be safeguarded against into the future - and did it impact on your decision to leave the position?</p></speech>

You know, I ... I think people maybe remember the ... the situation, I was trying to ... or I had been having a debate about urban planning, and what we should actually have in terms of ... of the future development of ... of a country where there was most certainly a shift towards greater cities, globally, and what would that mean for Ireland.  And I suggested that if we were to continue as we did back in the ... in the 2000s, to continue building with a ... a need for three bedroom semi-D houses, that that might in actual fact not be the right choice.  But it wasn't my ... my point to make that decision, I just simply thought that that was a relevant debate because what I'd seen in other cities was that the quality of accommodation, in terms of multi-family dwellings, was much different.  And I learnt fairly quickly afterwards that people had knocked on the door of one of my ... the apartment I have in New York to actually take photographs of it and I read the newspapers that weekend seeing photographs of ... of property I owned across the ... the ... in different locations.  Without, of course, people having noticed that in the larger cities, in which I had stuff, I lived in apartments, not in three bedroom houses.  So, it should have actually proven the point.  But, that was, I mean, also something that was raised by my neighbour, who found that their back garden was also photocopied and stuff like that.  And we thought long and hard at the Department about whether it was appropriate to file a complaint about that but in the end it was decided that that was probably not going to win.  The Attorney General's office had to be involved in terms of actually having the conversations and, ultimately, what it showed to me was that the system was not built ... because it wasn't used to having those types of attacks on ... on civil servants and wasn't built to actually protect their rights to privacy.</p></speech>

But, I mean, you know, it was one newspaper, it wasn't them all, but I ... the reason I mention it here is that I think political representatives have fora all the time at which they have the ability to defend themselves.  That is not necessarily the case with ... with people that are working in the public sector and, therefore, they are more exposed in these environments and need to be protected.</p></speech>

You outlined a difficulty, as you see it, with the operation of ... of Cabinet meetings in terms of the availability of senior civil servants to contribute.  How would you envisage Cabinet meetings operating if the list of people which you mentioned were to be all present and contributing?  And, in effect, does the current system not allow for senior civil servants to be present on ... when particular issues are ... are being discussed?</p></speech>

There we met with the commission of the Central Bank on the night before the board meeting, we presented to them what we thought and, although we weren't necessarily there for the decision "Yes" or "No", there was a full interface with the ... with all the members ... of the people making the decisions.  In Cabinet at the moment, a paper is presented based on discussions, which may or may not take place across different Government Departments, and only the members of Government are present, essentially, to actually make the decision.  And when the bank restructuring was taking place, I was asked for two evenings to present that to the Cabinet as a seminar on the night before - a bit like the commission - but I was left outside the door of the Cabinet, on hold, ironically on a day when I had an awful lot of other things I could have been doing.  But I was on hold in case I was needed.</p></speech>

I am very nervous here because I do believe we have actually got territory that ... that needs to go.  I think I have said, and I think everybody knows, that there was a mandate for the bank, at the time the management team were appointed, which had changed as a result of decisions made by the Government, which were based on advice I made.  And, in some respects, we had a different mission for the bank than perhaps was there before and that was likely to ... to lead to ... so, you know, discussions.

Mainly along two frameworks.  The first was: was the bank in question, which could include PTSB, AIB, Bank of Ireland or whatever, being restructured and reformed to continue as a going concern or was it being wound down?  And, based on that decision, then, what was the appropriate level of supervision - and I use that expression very loosely because we were by no means supervisors in the Department but we were ultimately representing the shareholder in terms of our trying to secure the best deal for the shareholders ... what was the right level of involvement by the Department in AIB, Bank of Ireland or, indeed, any of the ... any bank?  And the level of that was dictated as much by the State aid rules and everything else and was encapsulated in relationships frameworks, which were set out.  And, I think, I don't need to tell you, Deputy, that ... that during the course of a period of time shortly after 2011, because the mission of some of the banks had changed, the relationship frameworks needed to change for those banks too.</p></speech>

I'm not trying to catch you out in that sense, Mr. Moran.  Liquidation of IBRC was discussed in an EMC paper, dated 10 October 2012 ... the transaction proposal ultimately planned to replace the promissory note with "long-dated Government bonds" and this was seen as vital to avoid a funding cliff in the near term.  Can you comment on the reaction of the EMC to this paper and what was the alternative funding option to allow the appointment of a special liquidator to IBRC if the proposal hadn't got approval from the ECB?</p></speech>

But I think it's probably helpful to understand, in terms of deadlines along the process, right, that ... that we had been dealing with the legacy, if I call it that, of a promissory note funding that had been set up for IBRC, pretty much from the beginning.  Okay?  I mean, I had discussions ... people think that this idea of a liquidation suddenly popped out of nowhere in the middle of that year.</p><p>This was something that we had been discussing, we had been discussing all sorts of different options from back in 2010, that might actually sort of deal with how we would resolve banks, how we would deal with everything else, so lots of these ideas were moving around.  The intensification that you can see in the papers from October onwards was an intensification that was driven by a number of things.  There were budgets coming down the end of that year.  There were implications of some of the decisions around what that would mean to the deficit.  So there were an awful lot of moving parts in the process and there was an ongoing discussion every time we met the troika about how could we deal with the ultimate problem, which was that as Ireland would approach the exit of its bailout, we needed to be able to say without any reservation that its debt was sustainable.  And the presence in the system of the promissory note, which was ultimately Government debt, had carried historical and therefore high interest rates, not representative of the rates at the time, was causing difficulties in that respect, both in terms of duration of the debt, sorry, in terms of the interest rate burden of the debt and also its duration and that's where it started.  October, you can look at the EMC papers in November, you can look at December, as we got closer and closer to the budget decisions were to be taken whether or not we could do something on our own or we would continue with negotiations.  Obviously, our Department weren't involved, it was done by the Central Bank, and I think actually what I would like you to take from the process of the papers you have hopefully seen is just how much thought went into all the various options.  The decisions whether it might have been wise, unwise to move unilaterally, how we would deal with the ECB, what we may do with the other troika partners and the consultation with all the various stakeholders, leading ultimately to the decision in December, or sorry, in the beginning of the new year, once we actually had gotten to a much better place.</p></speech>

As a follow on, there is a memo from the Department of Finance to Government dated 6 February 2013, regarding the IBRC liquidation and promissory note settlement, seeking a decision to set in motion the liquidation of IBRC.  The direct cost of proposed liquidation is estimated by KPMG to be of the order of &euro;30 million to &euro;35 million.  What process was there within the Department of Finance to verify this estimate and what steps were taken to ensure that KPMG's proposal was both reasonable and competitive?</p></speech>

I mean, we're talking about the liquidation of an entity which, you'll also see in the papers, there were potential scenarios in which we would have lost &euro;8 billion if the liquidation had been done badly, right.  A process was undertaken.  By definition, it had to be done without public procurement, given the nature of the decision, to try and take advantage of the rates that had been negotiated by other parts of the system.  I think at the time NAMA, who were not actually under the same secrecy obligations when they were negotiating their rates, to try and negotiate the best deal with IBRC, or sorry, with KPMG.  This is a liquidation which, even if it costs us &euro;150 million, right, will compare to the cost of the liquidation of Enron, which was &euro;700 million and Lehman Brothers, which was &euro;2 billion or &euro;3 billion, right.  And if we achieve it for &euro;150 million or &euro;200 million and I'm not suggesting that KPMG should charge that much if they have not finalised their terms with their colleagues but I think, in the context of the end result, where we are actually talking now about a recovery of over &euro;1 billion when we never expected to get recovery and we may have actually lost as much as &euro;8 billion, I think it will be a job well done and spending that much money for a job well done is I think, something we need to do.  And this is what I mean by, we need, in our broader system, to keep a context around these issues.  They are very large numbers but there are equally larger numbers at stake.</p></speech>

Briefly, in your opening statement I want to just put one more quote to you,  "Another surprise was to discover that former governments seemed, at least so the story goes, to have discouraged [or] (even banned) the idea of meetings [between] secretary generals as a group to discuss policy unless [the] Ministers were present."  Who told you that these meetings were banned or how did you come across that information and what impact did that have, in your view, on how Government operated?  And was there a change in your time as Secretary General of the Department?</p></speech>

I might have to do the same, I don't know when, I certainly asked the question because it was sort of strange to me, as a second secretary, that it was a bit strange that what I thought of as the people that were in the system leading the various Departments weren't getting together to discuss issues.  It was made known to me by numerous people that, in actual fact, in the past the practice had developed.  Maybe it's not a rule, maybe it should never have been there, but the practice had developed of discouraging what people referred to as the permanent Government from meeting separately.  I am not saying it should be meeting, I am just saying that there is a question mark I would put out there.  I thought it was strange that we didn't have those kind of meetings more frequently and actually my kind of suggestion here is actually it would be good to just get everybody in the same room, the Ministers and the civil servants periodically, like you would see in a company and actually just thrash out where are we going and what have we got to do.</p></speech>

In that ... what turned out to be your farewell address to the committee on public accounts, where you quoted about the openness in the last paragraph in your own presentation.  You also say a couple of pages earlier, back in 2012, like statements of being Irish when abroad, saying one word to the Department of Finance was something people avoided volunteering to others.  This was not a comfortable place in which to drive policy innovation and implementation.  I think Professor John FitzGerald when was in to us, echoed those sentiments.  He said there was a cultural change in the Department of Finance in the last decade:</p> <blockquote> 	It became more concerned about the politics of things and less interested in the technical detail.  I would have had less interaction [with the Department]. </blockquote> <p>You have raised such ... we could have the entire inquiry into reform of public administration but could you expand on those ideas that you had in that part of your paper this afternoon?</p></speech>

But it really did strike me, both at the Central Bank when I joined the Central Bank and again at the Department, that people that were involved in sorting out the crisis, some of whom had been there through the process and were working through that, some of whom were new, were at a stage where they wouldn't even say to a taxi driver that was taking them home at midnight or even beyond that where they had been working, for fear of the recriminations that they would get.  And I guess my point is that if our system has come to that and we're not defending that, we're not defending that kind of effort that these people are putting in to, to in fact make the system work.  And clearly, this system has worked because we have seen one of the best recoveries in terms of a post-crisis recovery and so the system can deliver.  We need a sort of, you know, now as no longer a member of that system, and I think you as public representatives need to be defending that system as well.  I mean, clearly it's not perfect; no system is perfect.  What I meant by the, sort of, the problem is, one cannot have creative thinking and that type of environment that you want to have for innovation, where people are afraid and so we have to look and see what it is that actually creates that culture, that atmosphere, so people can actually take a risk.  The first question I was asked when I did a presentation to a series of assistant secretaries shortly after joining - it was ironic because it was by somebody at the back of the room, right, was, what was my attitude to people that made mistakes.  We had developed a system of people who were afraid to make even the smallest of mistakes and that's not the type of environment or type of country I think we need and it's not the Civil Service and the public administration that we want.  If people make mistakes and people always do make mistakes, we have to sort of, certainly not hide them - that would be a bad idea - but we have to find out what we can learn from that and move on.</p></speech>

Did we lose something when that process ended?</p></speech>

So I think that's an important distinction that was made earlier, I think, and I would repeat that, right.  What I made reference to there is at the time that we were going through the troika process, and I didn't know the system before so I think there are some very interesting questions for you in this context because, first of all, you had a Department where all the spending decisions, all the knowledge about the various Departments and what they do and the different sectors was also with the macro and that got split.  What the troika process did was it in a way brought some of that back together again.</p><p>It picked out the large structural issues that needed to be addressed - take the legal services Bill, some of those issues around mortgage arrears - and it put those in a context of meetings that were happening every quarter to actually look at where we were, take stock of where we were, what were we going to do over the next quarter, and the system knew what it needed to do and delivered.  The question is that when you have both split the Department of Finance into two different Departments and you have also not got that sort of quarterly process of coming together in the same formal way, and as you know what happened at the troika ... it's not so much special to the troika, but the process was that, for a period of a week and a half, there were interviews with external people, both domestic and international.  There were people who came in from outside knowing our system and we all sat down and took stock of what was actually the state of play with the Irish and, indeed, the European and world economies and what did we need to do for the next period and we set it out.  And therefore that is missing, I think, in the ... I don't know, Derek will know more what they're actually doing.</p></speech>

So it may be less pessimistic than ... than you illustrated there.  Could I ask you about the joint programme for Ireland, the recapitalisation of &euro;10 billion, banking support, &euro;25 billion, and financing of the State, &euro;50 billion, the &euro;85 billion and the &euro;17.5 billion come from the pension reserve funds.  Could you fill us in on how those discussions took place with the EU and the IMF and yourselves?</p></speech>

And, indeed, for the following year, even after I moved to the Department, the focus, as head of banking, would have been on only those parts of the troika programme that would have related to banking measures.  It was after I became Secretary General that I would have led at least the Civil Service negotiating team for the broader, macro side.  So, the actual debate, I think maybe Kevin went into it this morning, Derek may or may not have been involved, I think he was, so he may be able to shed a greater light on that.</p></speech>

That's been said in ... a lot of times, not at this committee, but that, when they removed local managers, the thing went haywire and they didn't know who to lend to and then had to come into the Department of Finance looking for rescue.

I mean, there's a ... there is a broader cultural issue that the financial services industry needs to get to grips with, in terms of understanding how it operates and I don't think that, that I would put Irish banks necessarily in a different space than what you see across the world.

And so the system didn't necessarily protect against that but I think you have to ... you have to look at both sides.  What we did see when we started, which I can speak to more specifically, in the years 2011 and 2012, was that we found that the ability of the banks to actually underwrite loans had changed significantly from what I would have expected it to be and that the ... that became a real problem for us as we tried to get credit back into the system because they simply weren't able to look at cash-flow lending and that ... because they  had relied so much on property collateral and that was certainly a big change, I think, for me in terms of what we were seeing and one that has been worked through in the last while but certainly caused problems.</p></speech>

The more capital you have to put across a loan, the more expensive the loan is, and that's actually some of the ... the debate in the Basel III rules.  It may make the banks more safe, it may make them much more like utilities: the shareholders get less return but ultimately, for them to make money, they need to be able to pay back ... have a return on the capital.</p></speech>

There was a parliamentary question subsequently, on 17 December, where the ... that showed that, back in 2008, that number was 44 master's and one PhD, so in fact we've lost five people with those qualifications while we're trying to develop a more professional Department of Finance that you've described, and taking part in more policy papers and so on.  So, is the situation actually getting worse between 2008 and currently?</p></speech>

I mean, that's rough ... roughly saying ... because some people may have ... are likely to have gone to the Department of Public Expenditure and therefore if they had been doing the same thing as we'd be doing, they're there.  But I will say one thing, right.  I mean, it comes back to what I said earlier, on the earlier thing, we have to make it attractive to work in the Civil Service, right.  It's one thing to say that we want to have all these, you know, highly qualified people, but unless it is actually attractive to work there, there are options and people will go to other places and it was, at numerous stages, a disappointment to me, having changed our own recruiting practices, where we would actually have said - to a certain extent against resistance from the system - that at levels of assistant principal or above, we were going to have open competitions, which meant that anybody could apply whether they were in the system or outside or whether they had just joined last week or whether they'd been there two years ago, could apply to become an assistant principal or above in the Department and we got very few people.  I mean, I recall that during the time we tried to get a chief financial officer and chief operating officer into the Department of Finance, what amazed me was I didn't get one female applicant, in a profession which has a very significant female participations across Dublin in terms of professional firms, partners at accounting firms and the rest, and that was to take up the role as the chief financial officer of the Irish State.</p><p>And ... now there's something wrong in the system, I'm not saying ... blaming anyone ... but we also didn't also have a lot of male representatives who came in from outside.  And so I think, you know, you have to look at these issues and you have to look at the qualifications and all the rest, but you have to look at it in a holistic way across the system, as to why is that.</p></speech>

I can speak from my experience, right, and I can speak from the experience of other people who actually did join the Department of Finance, whether it was even just as summer interns and whatever.  The technical expertise and the technical experience that you get in this Department of Finance, and, indeed, in the Central Bank and others, is second to none, right?  In terms of the difficulty of the questions that you're dealing with - we'll probably talk about some of them later, the questions that we faced in the bank restructurings - the burden-sharing, the rest of that, was second to anything I've ever experienced in any of the jobs I've had before.  So there's no doubt in my mind that that is there, and people have a hunger for that.  What I think shows that we also ... but things need to change.  We also encouraged our economists, who in the past had been discouraged from doing that, to publish papers and put their names on them, so that the Department of Finance economists weren't at a disadvantage to economists at the earlier part of their career in other organisations because they may not have been getting any publicity for their good work, and allowing them to actually go and present their work, both to other agencies in the State and, indeed, to the broader public.  That's what you need to do.  And if you do that, guess what?  The people that come in show just how good they are, and they get interested in the technical stuff.  But there's also, and again I'm going to perhaps stray to areas that are important for you guys to understand, but also that you need to hear, the consumption of time that takes place in a Department of 300 people with the likes of parliamentary questions and the rest, that's what takes you away from the technical, right?  I think we used to get something like 5,000 or 6,000 parliamentary questions.  That's a lot of time for 300 people to actually go through that process.  Now we can speed it up and we are putting in place an electronic system to allow that to happen, but you can't necessarily lay the blame on the people without understanding what are the demands and the competing demands because the one thing we know is the demand and the deadline for a parliamentary question is the first priority because you have to make it.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, while you were Secretary General, did your staff regularly engage in meetings on a European level?

So the level of engagement we had with Europe was, obviously, very significantly more than it might otherwise have been.</p><p>But I think ... and, again, these details are in the annual reports that we have published, we have actually listed in those the number of meetings that were going on, the number of visits we were arranging, and the reports back.  I mean, the Department staff are involved not just in, sort of, meetings like the European Investment Bank, not just the official parliamentary-type ... I'm sorry, ECOFIN-type discussions.  So you have a financial services committee, you have committees that actually deal with the ... with the economic side.  You have the people in the permanent rep in Brussels actually engaging in working groups.  And we were also, beyond that, actually volunteering to lead efforts.  It was a member of the staff in the Department that is now the chair ... or at least I think he still is ... by the time I left he was certainly the vice chair of the financial services committee of Europe, because of the level of participation, which is unusual for a small country because, remember, the UK does the same thing but they do so from a very different base.</p></speech>

Would it be incorrect if somebody interprets some remarks you made today and previously that you minimised the role of the banks' property speculation and profiteering in building up this huge bubble that disastrously crashed in 2007 and 2008, legislated, of course, for by a political establishment?</p></speech>

We had a ... two things happening at the same time, right, in terms of what went on in Ireland.  What I was trying to explain is that if we didn't have the vulnerabilities in our fiscal situation, which didn't need to be there just because there was a property bubble, right, we could have not had our tax revenues based on stamp duty.  We could have had the same level of property sector taxation on ... which, rather than being a transaction-based stamp duty, could have been a recurring property tax.  One thing I would have known and my predecessor would have known is that, despite the crisis, there would still have been income related to property coming in.  It would have dropped because the values would have dropped, but we would have still had something.  Instead we had zero.</p></speech>

But, because of time, I want to move on and ask you - it ... this happened in your time and your advice to the Minister - do you think it's right that Bank of Ireland and Allied Irish Bank, after being bailed out by the people, should have these deferred tax assets - Bank of Ireland &euro;1.2 billion, which means it will earn &euro;9 billion in profits before it pays a penny in corporate tax, and Allied Irish Banks, &euro;3.24 billion, which means it will earn &euro;20 billion before paying a penny in tax?  Is that just in view of what the people have suffered to bail out these banks?</p></speech>

You're essentially dealing with a rule and by applying it specifically to the banks, you can make it sound different than others.  I think every person who runs a business, whether it's a small shopkeeper or a larger business, knows that they should pay tax when they make money, and the system for a long time has said that if you have a loss in one year and the following year you get some recovery of that, we don't charge you tax until such time as you've made back up your losses, right.  And that applies to every business, whether it's a small shopkeeper, a plumber, or whoever else.  If he makes ... if he loses money for two or three years, the recovery years are not going to be taxed, because they fill the hole of what he had already before, okay?  And that's the rule that we're talking about here.  Now, apply that to banks, it doesn't seem quite as fair, because the banks lost an awful lot of money and that means that in that recovery period, we may not be able to charge them tax, under the existing rules, until such time as they're kind of back to zero and making a real profit.  But I didn't make the rules - they're the rules chosen.  And that's what's actually happening there.  What was a decision was that there would actually be a form of levy that would actually take some level of taxation from the sector, just to make sure.</p><p>Actually, frankly because it was never going to be paying an awful lot of tax for a long time.  But, actually ironically, the DTA of which your talking about has perhaps saved the State, because if we get value for that, or some form of value for that from the capital calculations of the banks, right, then we may not have to put in more money into the banks than we actually owe, and yet meet the regulatory approval.</p></speech>

Statements I've heard attributed to you and even today might indicate a belief in a capitalism that is red in tooth and claw.  I'd be interested in seeing what your attitude is if you look at the sweep of the last ten to 20 years in the financial sector internationally.  Nyberg said, I quote, "the paradigm of efficient financial markets provided the intellectual basis for the assumption that financial markets, left essentially to themselves would tend to be both stable and efficient."

And I encourage the clash of ideas but we're just not going to have in two minutes the time to debate whether or not we should have a capitalist world or anything else.  I think everybody knows that the need was there for greater regulation of this sector, okay.  As people have understood that it was necessary to regulate many other different types of sectors, okay, not just banking over the course of things.  And lessons have been learned, and the question to me is really, have we gotten to a point were recognising that ... and I don't make the rules, right ... that the decision is that we have a particular form of society that we're operating in at the moment, have we put enough protections in place?  Do we have a regulatory system that will actually help to stop these issues, if they're going into space that they shouldn't go into?  We'll have to have this conversation afterwards.</p></speech>

Because, for the reasons I set out in ... in my written statement and a little in the oral statement, our advice at the time, having debated this backwards and forwards, was that if we were doing that unilaterally, the prize, however politically for the, you know, attractive that might have seen, the prize that would have been generated in terms of cash, relative to the disadvantages that we might have suffered, didn't make it worth while doing.  And, as I said, for those who don't remember, weren't in the room, the reason I said about the speech is because we actually stapled the Minister's speech, when we did print it the wrong way, and he read it and realised he was actually reading the wrong page twice.  So, if you watch the video you'll see that he had to go back to read back page 3 or 4, I can't remember.  But ultimately it was a negotiation that was going on to the minute before, or indeed probably the minute after, the speech should have been made.</p></speech>

So in order to burden share with senior debt holders at that time, we would've had to still show that the hole in the bank was sufficient to have allowed us to burn through effectively the equity, or rewrite the law.</p></speech>

I can certainly tell you, and you can draw your own conclusions from that, that we had a Minister and a Government who were very anxious to take a decision to burden share with the bonds ... or with those bonds.  And the only person stopping them, essentially, as far as I could see at that stage, was the person at the other end of that phone call.  And I don't think that our Minister, had he been given the go ahead to do it, would've changed his mind about the burden-sharing at that point.</p></speech>

I guess, some of what I've tried to do in the written statement, right, is I've also tried to explain the processes that we adopted in the Department around decisions.  And this was probably only two or three weeks after I had joined the Department, right, so it's probably more obvious when you look at some of the papers you see on the subsequent decisions on IBRC.  Our job was to try and establish all the possible scenarios that could've arisen around decisions, in terms of giving advice to the various decision makers at the time.  And it is not possible for me to have asked the Minister ... or, sorry, suggested to the Minister the scenario around borrowed burden-sharing you're talking about without actually spelling out to him that one of the things that we were very exposed on was the amount of ECB funding in our system.</p></speech>

It comes up later as well.  And I don't think, again, you ... perhaps, everybody understands this.  It may not have been withdrawal.  It just could've become very expensive, right?  And a 1% or 1.5% increase in the cost of ELA or the ECB funding to the Irish system would've been &euro;1 billion or more a year, at that time.  And we were talking about a potential prize of however much you can get out of &euro;3.7 billion.  So, all of this has to be taken into the context of the decision making.  If it was a question of having &euro;56 billion of, you know ... where our senior creditors in the bank at the time, then you may have had a different, sort of, you know, set of scenarios to look at.</p></speech>

Prior to your appointment, what was the level of implementation on these recommendations?  Do you have any comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.1953" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#ZZ02300"><p>I think that ... when I approached the Wright report, and, I mean, we've actually talked about this at various PACs in terms of what was ... the first problem with the Wright report, when you actually - if I take the first day I joined as to what I had to do - was that it actually applied to a different Department, right.  So it applied to a combined Department of Finance.</p><p>So there's a lot of issues that come up in the context of the Wright report actually were somewhat moot by the time they came to us.</p><p> The second thing I would say is that my background, when I looked at the Wright report, was that ... and my response to the Wright report at the time was, while it had a lot of very good recommendations about the Department, it perhaps didn't get into an issue that was really important from my perspective, which was the framework and the culture around, sort of, risk and analysis of risk and the rest of that process.  And so we took that as a good starting point in terms of where we wanted to go, but it was by no means our practice of, sort of, saying this is what we've got to do in the Wright report, and this is all we're going to do.  Our restructuring of the Department, which, of course, was begun then relatively quickly after I started, was all around the concept of creating a ... what I refer to as a corporate centre, right?  It was putting the control functions, both for the Department itself and for the broader economy, into a space where they weren't crowded out by the policy-making decisions.  So people who have ... and you've been exposed, I'm sure to an awful lot around this table, of thoughts about how banks should work and things like that, but this concept that the front office, if you call it that, the policy making is in a different space to the people who are the watchdogs, the second line of defence, and that's not addressed, to my mind, in the Wright report.  And, therefore, what I had to do was to blend that together with where we're going.  I think the stuff that we talked about, the MAC and stuff like that, I agree with a lot of what he said, but I think that, fundamentally, we were trying to move it very ... into a different space and, again, they are the core issues to my mind, some of which Mr. Wright actually refers to, but the MAC, as I'm sure now everybody knows around this table, I certainly didn't when I joined, stands for an advisory committee.  So, by definition, presence at the MAC table suggests that you only give advice to the Secretary General who runs the Department, and you probably only really give that on your own area of specific interest.  And that ingrains this concept, not just in the Department of Finance, but I gather across all Departments, of, sort of, independent silos in a Department.  As opposed to moving towards what I think the Civil Service reform plan certainly had when I left ... this ... more of a concept of a management board where everybody participates.  And so there wouldn't have been a conversation about, sort of, some of the budgetary matters, some of the rest, without actually having a full discussion with everybody of the senior team.</p></speech>

And I joke about that, but I'm actually very serious.  What I ... well, first of all, the Department and I kept this under the radar screen from the Department of Public Expenditure until I put it in out Vote but we actually hired 100 people into a team of 300.  So despite the fact that nothing has changed, almost a third of the people in the Department, even by the time I left, hadn't actually been in the Department when I joined.  So that changes things very significantly, by definition, because it allows new thinking to come in, it allows people to get promoted, it allows people to actually, sort of, you know, adopt different challenges, and finally get a bit of space to actually think.</p></speech>

I think the other thing that probably was a significant change, and I should probably grab my speech and just ... because I tried to summarise them all in one line at the end, and if you need to take notes, you can just refer to that at some stage ... I think the other thing which we didn't finish, but I think again it's an important issue for me, was, sort of, you know, the whole, sort of, concept of technology and using technology, right?  There was no budget for technology before I joined the Department.  And, you know, we found ourselves even during the couple of weeks after the bailout certainly at a significant disadvantage to any of our international colleagues with the technology we were using and how we could access information.  And that is something that, frankly, I would say is not going to happen easy.</p><p>If you read that speech very carefully, that I gave to the PAC, you'll notice that I actually asked the PAC to support my successor in the very significant investment that he was going to have to make in information technology because it's a big spend, to actually get the right type of information you can mine, the right types of data, the right types of documents and be able to pull stuff up, you know, and that.  You, kind of, put the information, the cultural change, the breaking down of the silos; and the other thing that I think was interesting for me - and I announced this quite early on, actually, when I did the ... the strategy - was training.</p><p> There was officially a training budget there but people didn't actually think that they could use it.  They weren't using whatever was there for IT and they weren't using what was there for training.  And we have moved the Department, in terms of HR, I think, very significantly.  Derek will probably talk more about it later, if you need to, but, you know, our PMDS - it's a matter referred to in the Wright report - I think the Department was bottom of the table at the beginning of my term, mainly because everyone was dealing with the crisis and they didn't think this was too ... that was an important issue.  We made it a leadership requirement and we went from 32% compliance on PMDS forms - now, I'm not saying the quality of the forms, it was just even completing them - to 100%.  You know, we managed, sort of, people, sort of, you know, that were under-performers in the Department and it became, sort of, an issue so we started doing peer review of all of our colleagues, as part of that process.  And we were leading - I think, with a very few other Departments - that process through ... throughout the time we were there.</p></speech>

I think we've made a lot of progress, at the level of the State, on risk assessment.  It's now a risk assessment ... we've a risk ... I mean, during my time, with myself and John Corrigan, a risk officer was appointed at the NTMA, there was one appointed at the Department, I think there were others.  We made ours a member of the management team, rather than just a junior official, right, and we have a risk committee.  That can all feed up.  I think it would be a useful exercise, once a quarter, to actually just look at all the risks with the Government and the senior officials.</p></speech>

I think they can be dealt with differently and it could be helpful.  I think, I'm just, sort of, saying you come into an environment out of large organisations, right - in Zurich we had 68,000 people, so it was comparable to the size of some of the public sector - and you see it operating differently in terms of how the ... there were still silos, there were still different areas but there was an effort to bring people together to have a common, sort of, purpose and I think that's really ... but I go back to technology, I mean, it could be a huge way of breaking down those issues.  I mean, we'd got to a point, by the time I'd left the Department - which was in a relatively short period of time - where people were starting to use, you know, laptops or, sort of, tablets they were using, sort of, you know, video conferencing backwards and forwards to each other, so if they were in a WiFi zone in Brussels, they could WiFi back to even their assistants or to their team back here and have a conversation.  And that was happening over a relatively short period of time.  If you could move the system on two or three more years in terms of that, we would ... you would potentially transform all this, with chats, with all of the new technology ... just have ideas flowing around.</p></speech>

So, when I joined the Department, I joined as head of banking and, therefore, the biggest priority I had for the first couple of weeks was the PCAR process, then I had to discover my friends, sort of, start looking at the other banks in the system and move through the processes and I would never have, you know, seen and certainly not foreseen at that stage that I would have had to be responsible for the economic side of things, so only a year later.</p></speech>

And in terms of the structural shortfall that was there, what was that sum that you were correcting on a year by year basis as head of finance?  There was a structural deficit.</p></speech>

I'd be misleading if I gave you the numbers ... about 7% or  9%, I think, was the underlying structural deficit.</p></speech>

If you don't take out the recurring deficit, you have that every year, so a deficit measure of &euro;3 billion, if you don't make that adjustment, in three years you've added another &euro;10 billion to the debt and it keeps going ... it's not stopping-----</p></speech>

In terms of fixing difficulties with the structural deficit, which you've just indicated was not dealt with on a compound basis, as you just outlined, was there potential for that to actually to become a bigger financial sum than the legacy debt from the banking crash?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.1979" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#CCC01000"><p>It already has.  I mean the legacy debt from the banks, looking forward a little bit in terms of what we're ... I gather ... I mean, I'm not on the numbers any more but from what I hear in the newspapers and that, it is expected, at least, that we should broadly speaking wash our face on the pillar banks between one ... some pluses and minuses across them.  The ongoing banks will probably recover as much capital put into it, which essentially means the legacy debt is the promissory note and the bonds that replace that, so that's &euro;30 billion.  The legacy debt, if you want to call that, that is being accumulated with the deficits run, despite the measures taken even before 2011, to try and reduce that relatively quickly, is going to be over &euro;100 billion, you know, and so that's three times the other number.  So that's why I say this and I'm not saying that they were the wrong decisions; that was to protect the vulnerable, that was increases in unemployment and the rest but we need to keep things in context.</p></speech>

Civil servants need to be paid, teachers need to be paid.  There was income and outcome that had to be dealt with.  So, was correspondence in around September-October 2010 from the ECB leading ... or alluding to key funding by the ECB to Irish financial institutions that this could potentially be jeopardised, if Ireland didn't enter a bailout programme?  So ultimately, the money that we needed to meet that structural deficit would not be available to Ireland, if we did not proceed into a bailout.  Do you have any insight into that?</p></speech>

The funding of which we are talking about is the money that we would have needed to raise on the markets to ... or taking it from the pension fund in order to pay the pensions and the wages the following month.  This is the Greek dilemma, if you want, right.</p><p>The banks are potentially being supported by the ECB, but who is going to actually pay the wages of the civil servants, the unemployment benefits and the rest?  And at the time that we were going into the bailout and I don't want to be quoted on the number but I have the magnitude, I think, right.  Our cost of funds had gone up to about 14% and there is no way in which the State could have continue funding itself at that level-----</p></speech>

Because, we are now at something like 3% or 4%, right, and the debt is sustainable.  At 14% it was most certainly not.  And the markets could see that.  And that's why it was 14% because if we had not had an alternative supply of funds, which could come in at admittedly at too high a rate because the structure of the bailout was wrong in the first, at the beginning, right.  But it was certainly a lot cheaper, at that cost of bailout money, than any alternative.  And the other, the only other alternative we would have had at that stage would have been an immediate stop of the deficit, which would have meant savage cuts on, on public services.</p></speech>

The question I am asking you, we know that the banks needed the funding and we knew that we had a shortfall, which is then ... and you use the analogy of being similar to the Greek dilemma.  The question I am putting to you is that we ... funding was needed for both and was the requirement for one funding potentially jeopardised or would ... was the ECB alluding that if you didn't enter a bailout programme that you would not get the funding that was required at the day-to-day operational level?</p></speech>

I mean, I mentioned one in my statement, right.  I mean, there was certainly a big debate which I would have been more involved in at the beginning, which was the speed ... what was a reasonable speed for the deleveraging for the system to take place?  And the trade-off was most certainly the following, which is that the quicker we had to dispose of assets, the more likely it was that we would have gotten a bad deal for them, particularly because we didn't have a quantum of assets in the earlier days in markets that were working well like the United States to be able to get there.  And the UK example I gave, which I can't remember was it &euro;30 billion or &euro;40 billion of ... of UK mortgage assets that were put into the non-core book of some of the banks.  It was in our mind then, we had Barclays Capital with us at the time, luckily enough, giving us advice.  It was impossible because there wasn't liquidity in the market to actually get enough buyers of those assets, even in the UK at that time.  So that was ... the debate starts there, right.  We went through a series of debates across the ... the course of the next months, I remember participating in, some were around what we should be doing about the minimum wage and one thing was to reduce them and one thing was not to do that.  We had the obvious discussions about the interest rate where the programme as set up at the outset contained this principle of sort of moral hazard, which is, don't give the country an interest rate that looks attractive or they might stay on the bailout and so we'll charge a penal rate, I think it was 6%, and so the negotiations had to take place to try and point out that actually we'd have by far preferred not to be on the bailout and have the troika every month or every quarter in the process and ... but it was actually not helping Ireland to be charging a penal rate.  As soon as we could get out of it, we would have moved.</p></speech>

One of the first things that I think we negotiated that ... I mean it didn't happen, sort of, with me specifically involved but I was in the Department was all about the jobs initiative.  It was changing the ... the VAT rates so there would be no down, which was clearly a measure.  Fundamentally, what happened in the troika programme, and again you see this in the debate going on at the moment about Greece, is the creditors cared, as did we, about the ability to repay the debt.  So the debt had to be sustainable, okay.  The initial interest rate structure of the programme, such as it was decided, didn't help on that front.</p><p>And it was relatively quickly understood that would no more help here than it did in Greece and in Portugal and that actually the way for solidarity to take place was to allow funds to pass through to the ... to the programme countries at roughly the cost that the European partners could actually borrow them.  The second thing that was agreed was that if the individual countries could identify measures that they wanted to substitute, then that would be a conversation we could have, especially if we could show that it was actually a structural change that would contribute to growth.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, you were still saying, in April 2012 from the evidence we have, that as part of the sixth annual review, that the programme was at serious risk owing to the absence of growth related measures to counter fiscal consolidation.

Some of the type of questions that we were negotiating was if we were going to sell assets, sell State assets, which was actually part of the original programme, what could we do with the proceeds? Okay? And we wanted the ability to use ... and that would have been frankly the ... the ... this, I mean the way these things work by this stage, we have the troika come in to our large conference room, we have a good debate, we have a conversation with the Ministers, we keep going through the rest of the week, we come back at the end with the Ministers and hopefully we have managed to take issues off the table, and if we haven't, they are the ultimate negotiators on the last ones.  A lot of the discussions are setting up for the requests that we have agreed, with the EFC and with the Cabinet earlier, going to be the important issues.  So it may very well have been that that particular review was one of the ones where we were trying to get the ability to use the money from the sale of State assets to actually spend it back into the economy.</p></speech>

Did the Department ever investigate whether there was uncontrolled withdrawal of credit or deposits?

The process of liquidating the bank was that at the point at which we may have announced we were liquidating the bank, the board would still have been in place, and the board would have not been able, at that point with - depending on what signs or what decisions had been made with respect to the promissory note and the rest - they may not have been able to continue trading under the obligations they had.  And they may have had to try and seek, as the board of a company that existed, a winding-up order of their own.  Not the one that ... that I've explained to you on the night if I recall ... you know in terms of the legislation that we actually passed to liquidate the bank.

Because I think it's important to understand, sort of, the way things were.  And I ... I understood, from the conversations yesterday, there are some documents in the Department that couldn't have been released.  I talked about the ... the choices we may have taken in terms of unilateral actions.  And the ... in those documents you'll see very considerable long lists of the risks and the pros and the cons of various actions.  And it has always been in the documentation that, at a point where the public might believe that the bank is about to be put into liquidation, that there is a significant risk to the assets that ultimately belong to the State.  And this is no different, I mean ... bank are probably harder, because you can move your money a little faster, but if you put a furniture shop into liquidation, there's a serious risk that people are going to go and want to go in and take back the furniture they've paid deposits for, right?  And the assets of the ... may not be in ... in accordance with liquidation.  So, that was the backdrop.  Whether it was a Bloomberg story, whether it was a press leak, whether it was just somebody speculating as a creditor, the same risk existed, and that is reflected in all of our documents.<br/><br/>For those that don't think we were actually prepared, right, this is the decision tray for what we call the &quot;red restructure&quot;, right, which had a whole load of different choices that we would be making, depending on what would happen along the way.  Right?  This is actually the pack that I was given on that day, which ... it actually didn't include the meeting with you originally, because I wasn't going to be doing the briefing, with all the telephone numbers of the people who we were supposed to be ringing, as this day went through, with all the people we wanted to tell, because we didn't want this to be a surprise.  We wanted all the stakeholders to know we had it all planned.  And these are the pages that actually outline all of the things that were gonna happen.<br/><br/>Now, with the best planning in the world, we weren't going to be able to figure out whether it was going to be Reuters or Bloomberg or <i>The Irish Times</i>, or whoever, that might have got wind of it.  But one of the other concerns was that if the Minister had gotten a phone call from the board, asking him whether or not he was planning to put the company into liquidation on that day, he couldn't have lied.  Right?  And if he had told them that he wasn't necessarily ... or, sorry, if he had told them that he was maybe doing that, and withdrawing the support that the State had given to them, which was the only basis on which they could trade, they would of have had no option but to do a liquidation.  And that we needed to protect against.<br/><br/>Now, we weren't suggesting that they were going to do anything other than what they would have to do under the laws of the Companies Acts in Ireland.  But the protection, which was set up, wasn't just being caught out.  The protection was that we had a system that we could put somebody in to, in effect, take over the obligations of the directors, who could be directed by the Minister not to do what they couldn't otherwise be directed-----</p></speech>

I do ... I couldn't talk very specifically, right, but I think Ann's coming in later, you could ... you could also ask her, she'll have time to prepare, to check.  We were trying to monitor it as best we could, right?  But remember we didn't have ... we weren't running the bank, right, so at best, I mean, without actually raising a hare in the bank itself, we were asking them for their daily, sort of, liquidity deposit numbers.  It may have been, and I don't know because maybe they were getting that as a matter of course from all the banks so as not to ... to have that information, but without necessarily raising an issue.  On the question of timing, without any question, we would have preferred, in effect, to have done this a day later.  Because a day later was when the European Central Bank board was meeting to actually address the issue of the conversion.  And, had that happened, and we would have actually been able to do things differently.</p><p>We were prepared, if we needed to, to actually split the two into two measures, right, which was the liquidation of the bank ... what that meant in terms of the transfer of the security into the Central Bank and then finalise the arrangements in terms of the replacement of the bonds or, sorry, the promissory note, for the bonds that was occurring.  But you're right, if we could have planned this and if we could have controlled all the elements, we would have preferred to have been able to have had the discussion you and I had about the legislation the following evening, once the ECB had taken their decision or whatever it was to unanimously note what was going to happen.</p></speech>

The question I have is, given that the imminent liquidation of IBRC began to seep out to certain parts of the public, did the Department of Finance ever investigate whether there was credit or deposits, approvals or withdrawals from IBRC that were probably questionable in the couple of weeks, not questionable as in dodgy but you know, in a couple of days before the liquidation of IBRC?  This is something that was put down in a parliamentary question, after the liquidation of IBRC ... was not answered given ... so I am hoping that the banking inquiry can get to this point.</p></speech>

If I have a way of finding out, I will  try and figure out the answer.  This I think was written, a standard text, to a certain extent, because I think if you had been a depositor with IBRC or if I had been, and you had thought that there was a liquidation you would have actually, even if the board was still in power, you would probably have withdrawn your money and we did not want a run on any bank.  This is more precautionary than anything else.  Your question which is, did it actually happen is a factual one, I would have thought somebody can check that up and I can't answer the question.</p></speech>

What we did ...  which at the time I was at the Central Bank ... was we tried to take all of the banking system and in a sense make sense out of it, not necessarily just because of historical legal entities, but looking at what the system needed in terms of size, what it needed in terms of type of lending, and where were the potential for that to occur.  There had been up to that point I think, certainly an understanding that the mission that had been given for Anglo's management team - property more so than the IBS, I don't know anything about that - was that they should try and do what, effectively, Jeremy and the team had done at PTSB very successfully, which is to clean up the bank and move it onwards.  Because of the nature of the business plan and the business activity, where it wasn't significantly a retail bank and everything else and all the rest, our analysis was, as taken to the commission of the Central Bank, taken to the troika and ultimately to the Government, that the Irish banking sector would not necessarily benefit from having the exercise of trying to make that bank into a working bank into the future.  We may have been right, we may have been wrong, I don't know, but that was ultimately, the analysis was-----</p></speech>

I guess the first place to start is that when we were running the troika programme, in a sense we were agreeing with our lenders what were, in their mind, the most important things they wanted to have done in the system and they were always ... and I think it's actually referred to in Ajai's or Craig's testimony, which I know you've circulated to me, there were always robust discussions at every one of these quarterly meetings about what actually we would be signing up to do.  And that was fundamentally because we had started on the process that if we were going to say we were going to do something, it was because we thought it was a good idea and we thought we could deliver it in the timeframe required, because that was the credibility that was built up over the programme.  Now, the other thing that was happening, in complete parallel you might say, was that we also had other things we were doing but we weren't going to let them become troika programme commitments.</p><p>I can certainly recall ... having said numerous times ... because when we would mention these to the troika, they would suddenly think they were also good ideas and they would want to impose them as requirements in the programme.  And we would refer to that as being penalising the good performers because, one, we were coming up with new things to do and, two, because we had done our lists from before, they certainly thought that they wanted to add anything.  So we had numerous issues that we would be working on at the same time to improve stuff, for example, the creation of the strategic investment fund.  That was never a requirement of the troika programme, but it was huge in the macro scheme of things in terms of the power and the firepower we were putting in to potentially investing into the economy, to create the growth that actually was mentioned earlier.  But it wasn't a programme ... a troika programme.  There are always opportunities that were probably missed.  I mean, you know, we spent a lot of time doing the medium-term economic strategy trying to identify what actually more we could be doing in terms of the ... the system.  But, I think, broadly speaking, we got to a reasonably good space and now there's an opportunity to do the rest.</p></speech>

Thank you, Mr. Moran, you're very welcome.  Excuse me.  Just to continue on from that line of questioning from Deputy O'Donnell, you said earlier that the structure of the bailout was wrong at the beginning.  So, just to be clear, what are you talking about there when you talk about the structure of the bailout?  Are you talking about the rates and the pace of the adjustment?  Do you mean wrong for Ireland or ... just to clarify that?</p></speech>

What I meant by that specifically and, I mean, there was an adjustment to the amount of time to do the adjustment anyway of one year, but what I meant specifically was that the ... the ... and if you'll forgive me, because I don't know the exact ... the numbers, but let's just, to make it easier to understand ... give ... put two numbers on it.  Let's assume that the interest rate that was being charged to us on the bailout was 6%, okay, and it was set at a level that was effectively two or three percent above the cost of funds of the European partners ... and the reason was is that they had a fear that if we actually got cheap money, because Ireland was never going to be AAA in the short term, that we might decide that this was something we should stay on and we keep on it even though the country recovered.  The ... the IMF rules are slightly different, they actually apply a surcharge at a certain point, so the interest rate steps up so that you don't stay on it.  Our sense was that if you ran our numbers, on a 6% number, which was really creating a 3% benefit - and again I ... I'm ... I don't want to be quoted on the 3% but-----</p></speech>

We had no reason to want to stay on the programme.  But more importantly, by giving us the benefit of their cost of funds, at the rate at which Europe could borrow them, it meant that our ability to succeed increased significantly because for each year that we were on the programme debt, we now could find ourselves in a ... in an environment where our debt sustainability was better.  And that was why ... and the length of it and everything else ... that was why the interest rate reductions and the maturity extensions were all part of that negotiation.</p></speech>

Was it in an initiative from the Secretary General of the Department or where did it come from?</p></speech>

I mean, I, kind of, refer it to in my written statement and, I think, actually Kevin, because I saw some of his testimony this morning, would've referred to it as well ... our approach - and to his credit, he would have had lead that Department at that time - was one of building up a level of trust with the troika partners -sharing the problems, understanding where we're going and figuring out what, frankly, we might do differently.  The bailout was discussed in an element of secrecy, less people involved, less thinking about it.  As I said in my own statement, people were learning, right?  You even get ... a couple of months down the road, you start rerunning the numbers, you start looking at it.  We knew how much the PCAR was going to be, we knew how much we were putting into the banks, that meant we had a credit of &euro;10 billion we hadn't used that we might ... thought we might have used.  You rerun the numbers, you say, "Jesus, this is ... we can get here but were not going to get here easily and why don't we actually ask for this recovery?"  Part of the process is actually building up credibility.  If we had gone in on day one looking for that, I don't think we would have gotten it.  Once we had done the PCAR, once we had actually ... not burden shared with the Anglo ... banks, right, then you start to build up a relationship with your lenders.  And you build up an openness, while at the same time, politically, and indeed with .. the staff, Jim O'Brien and the others, they were reaching out to European capitals across Europe, trying to build friends because what happens is you have 18 people making a decision.</p><p>And if you have all 18 on your side, you get a change.  If you have all 17 against you, you don't.  And so, you know, this comes true.  The reality was is that the crunch point that year, if I can recall it correctly, was around the Greek situation.  But part of it was that the seeds had been sown from here.  We'd spoken to Portugal.  They knew it as well.  They were having the same conversation.  So this revelation, if you want, or the mist, the fog slips over this issue, and suddenly people say:</p><blockquote>	That's helpful.  Now, what can we do to help out Greece?  We can do that but we can't do that without actually giving it to the people who were talking about this for the last couple of months anyway. </blockquote><p>And everybody benefits at the same time. </p></speech>

I mean, I didn't have a very long kind of history ... well, no, sorry, in a sense, I wasn't in the Department for most of the previous situation, right, you'll appreciate.  I think it is a combination of a lot of other issues.  Right, you have to recall that by the time we got to ... no, but, just, by the time we got there, we had a whole series of troika people, including the ECB officials, who were coming here once every quarter, with whom we were interacting all the time, who had become supporters of what we were trying to do.  So there were more people in the system, both in the ECB and elsewhere, anxious to try and find a solution to that problem.  I mean, there were declarations about finding resolution of the Irish banking debt.  I mean, this was all iterative.  Ultimately, there was a ... a ... a ... a new President of the ECB, who was willing to entertain things that perhaps others wouldn't have entertained in the past, who has shown since then, frankly, on a European scale, that he's willing to entertain things that, perhaps, people would have said were impossible four or five years earlier.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, in your statement, you say:</p> <blockquote> 	the sad reality was that the acute lack of fiscal capacity at Government level removed flexibility in easing the impact of the problems.  The fiscal rectitude we are experiencing since was a necessary result of the terrible and perilous structure of Ireland's fiscal profit and loss. </blockquote> <p>Now, I know you have discussed this to some extent.  But what would you say ... do you believe we've passed that point or are we still in a case of an acute lack of fiscal capacity?</p></speech>

I mean, the ... a question I got asked when I was at my last PAC, I think ... the thing ... because we were coming up to the banks' stress test, was whether I thought we would need more capital for the banks and was that going to cause this major problem.  And ... it was in advance, right, so I had no idea what the answer was, but my answer, if I recall correctly, was that we might have needed more capital in one or other of the banks, but if we did, it wouldn't be of a magnitude that would cause a problem to the State, right?.  So I answered it that way.  I mean, the information that's there now with respect to sort of our banking sector would suggest, and, indeed, previous sale ... or recent sales of PTSB would say it's been validated now by others, other than just the regulator, that we don't at least have to worry about a hit to our fiscal coming from the bank situation, right?.  We have, as I pointed out in this statement here, the reality of the situation even still in 2015, is that we are spending more money than we are paying into the system, you know, so the taxpayers of Ireland and ... and the rest, and our other revenues are still lower than the amount of money we're spending, even no matter how bad we may think elements of the public sector are and how much investment is needed, we are still putting debt onto future generations for us to live in 2015 and 2016 right?</p><p>So, we have to be very careful in that scenario that we don't do anything that causes difficulties, we are-----</p></speech>

But, but there is a path that has been set out, which is to get to a position where we're no longer borrowing money to keep the lights on and I think that's one that we should continue to, to keep doing.  And look at, the example I give in, in my statement is that when you are building 50,000 or 60,000 houses and you only need 25,000, lots of things are happening in the economy that is not sustainable, it won't continue all the time.  And you actually find yourself with an awful lot of payroll taxes coming in, in those years.  And you could sort of consider those almost to be windfall gain, you may still need to build those houses on that time but it's not going to happen all the time, sort of a blip in the system.  If people are selling an awful lot of houses at the time your capital gains number goes up.  If you could take that money and put it aside, so that when you actually start building 25,000 houses again and those 25,000 houses and all the people are now on the unemployment list, you draw down on that money to pay the wages.  That's what I mean by building these rainy day funds up, right, we aren't in a luxury at the moment of having those rainy day funds but we do need to protect against, and I said this, I think, at something before I left.  We do need to protect against the fact that interest rates could go back up.

So our role was whether or not the Minister would agree to it or not.

And she had come at it, perhaps, from a slightly different perspective.  Our perspective was exactly what I think actually people wanted us to do - which was we were looking at the balance of interest and we were saying that the classic problem we now had in Ireland was an excessive debt problem.  And as long as you had that - whether you had it in households which wouldn't be spending, whether you had it in companies which couldn't grow - the banks needed to actually solve the excess debt problem of their customers.  Not just because we wanted to give away the taxpayers' money, but because, by doing so, the economy could start working again.  And, guess what, with the economy working, it was actually in the interest of the banks, because their profits would start growing as well.</p></speech>

But I know I made a lot of private interventions as well with them, at the same time, to make it very clear that the shareholder's perspective was that ... was not what maybe some shareholders may have said, "Just don't give any money away," ... was that we thought, from the broader perspective, it was actually in the interest of both the economy and the individual banks to just get on with it.  And I think what has happened - and you'll see it in the context of people ... some of the people we hired into the system ... one of the people we hired in to manage PTSB, had a particular expertise in debt management and therefore was able to actually lead in many respects, in terms of the better technology processes.  What we didn't appreciate, perhaps, at the time - and it only became obvious - was the lack of preparation that had been done at the levels of the banks and the inadequacy of their systems to actually be able to deal with customers.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, you're welcome.

It might have helped to avoid being shut out of markets and to have avoided a troika bailout entirely. </blockquote> <p>Was it the deficit and the deficit over those coming years or was it the banking crisis that led us to being shut out of the markets?  Or both?</p></speech>

I mean, the ... ultimately what the markets were saying when we were shut out ...  I mean, we weren't, I suppose in some ways, shut out, we were just going to be borrowing money at 14%, right, but it's self-fulfilling, because if you borrow at 14%, you now need to pay more interest expense.  They were saying, "You cannot repay your debt and we can't have confidence if we give it to you that you will repay it."  What could've happened, is if we weren't running a deficit at that time, the ECB had a primary responsibility to keep the banks running.  As long as the banks were solvent, the ECB had to continue giving their funding so the ATMs would've kept working.  What was important, and the reason it was difficult, was finding money to pay for the ... what you refer to as the deficit, what I refer to as just keeping the country running.</p></speech>

We're being told it might make &euro;1 billion profit.  But that's after the almost 60% write-down.  Can I ask your view on that?</p></speech>

I mean, I think if you end up in the context of the markets we've had recently making a profit, while a very large number, right, in the absolute, but as a percentage of that it shows that the process that was actually gone through, right, to apply the discounts was done with a very ... you know, was actually quite accurate in the background.  Had they bought them at 60% and we were looking at them making a deficit of &euro;20 billion we'd be having a very different conversation, because the money would have gone to shareholders of the banks.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2129" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#NNN01800"><p>Yes, it's actually an interesting question, right?  It's a bit like the debt relief one we just had, right?  In 2011 and 2012, and I can't really speak to what was happening in '09 and '10, right, nobody wanted to invest in Ireland, right?  I mean, they wouldn't buy even the Government's debt.  They most certainly weren't going to put money into the building of the infrastructure of the country, right?  And our dilemma was that in order to stop freefall of the asset value, of which we were actually a very significant owner, right, we had to find a way in which we would have investors and buyers willing to come into the market to buy up Irish assets.  And our banking system didn't have the capital to be able to fund that, right?  We're talking about the net cost of the capital, but we most certainly would be having a different conversation if you were asking me what we would have done if we had put another &euro;30 billion of equity into the Irish banking system in order to generate capital to be able to buy these assets, or fund people buying the assets.  So our dilemma, as indeed always happens when you have a market crash like that, is you have no idea where the floor is, but what you do know is you won't find it until people are able to buy the assets and willing to buy the assets.  And so the first success in the Irish recovery was proving through the course of 2011 that, unlike some other jurisdictions where they had put assets for sale but actually not sold them, that we were, in fact, going to sell the assets, because that encouraged investors to come in.  Now, the irony of that ... it's actually not so much an irony; it's just actually a particular good result, is if you look at the scenario that have been said for the liquidation of IBRC, even in October 2012, I think it is, when the calculations were done, there were scenarios in which the liquidator thought he may have a deficit of &euro;8 billion in the IBRC liquidation.  Now, we had that obligation already because everything had been guaranteed through the system.  So by having the assets improve across the whole country in terms of value we actually also gained because NAMA's asset value went up, and the IBRC value went up.  And the other thing I would say which was in question - and I'm going to tread carefully here because I don't want to step into the commission of inquiry issue, but it's an important, sort of, system-wide thing - we had to sell assets across the world that, actually, if we had held them on for four or five years we would have made a bigger profit, right?</p><p>But our choice in terms of the advice to a Government was:</p><blockquote>	Do you want your capital invested in assets in the United States or in  Poland or elsewhere?  You might make money, which might help pay some of the, you know, the funding of the State, or do you actually want to invest the available capital you have, in Ireland, by building schools and hospitals in Ireland, or do you want to be a real estate player in the United States? </blockquote><p>And that's the choice, right, so the choice when you're faced with a recovery mission that we had to do, was we ended up owning an awful lot of assets, an awful lot of banks, that we didn't actually, as a Government, really want to own.  And our choice was, how do we release the capital-----</p></speech>

Is that good business for the Irish taxpayer, of which ...?  We keep hearing, " NAMA's going to make a profit".  Of course it's going to make a profit after a 60% write-down.  Is that good business?</p></speech>

As I said, I don't think that, in constraining situations, that it is a good idea for a Government to be using its valuable capital, right, to be involved in activities it doesn't need to be involved in.  We all know that over time, if we hold on during a recovery period, you may get more by selling later.  That's actually why people have bought, because they expect to make a profit.  Now, if you can sell in 2015 or in 2014 at the real price of that time, we won't have any investors in our system; I mean, we're sort of getting into a debate that I suspect I'll have with Deputy Higgins, I mean, this evening, you know, as to what is the role of government and what, in fact, should it be doing.  I mean, your ... I think the suggestion you're making is that if the Irish Government could, it should own as much real estate in Ireland as it can, through this recovery period, it should own all the banks, because the banks will be worth more if the economy recovers-----</p></speech>

I wouldn't consider them vulture investors.  There are lots of Irish people who have bought assets, there are REITS that we set up in order to get capital into the Irish system, the shareholders of which are maybe Irish people as well as foreigners.  Our question, and your question is, do you want to have a system that encourages private investment into the system or do you want it all done by the Government?  Because in a rising economy, asset prices go up.  The more assets a Government can hold, the more profit it will make.  NAMA is just one example of the assets, right, if we hold the shares in AIB in a rising economy, it will go up.  If we hold it for 50 years, it will probably be worth more than it is today.  But at some stage I'd prefer, if I was being asked by the Minister and the Government, I would say, "If we could release that capital,  although we will release the future profit, let's spend that on building schools and universities because that's the business of government."  But I may have different views on what the level of government is, and the involvement and the size of government is, than you may have, and I'll just simply express my advice.  And, and you will find, and it's not, I don't think, as I said earlier, helpful to be talking about vulture funds, we are talking about investors without which we wouldn't have office space, without which we wouldn't have housing, and we're talking about a housing crisis in this country.  We need to have people wanting to come in and invest.  They're not doing it in Greece, which is why their economy is reducing in size and people are suffering.  So, anyway, it's a personal view, but-----</p></speech>

I'm going to bring matters to a wrap-up there, Mr. Moran, and I just want to get one feel for your understanding of the troika dynamic and the different relationships that each partner brought in your engagement with them, through the Department of Finance.  And maybe if I could look at that at two levels.</p><p>You touched upon it at one level with Senator D'Arcy in the opening line of questioning with him with regard as to what would be the contested interest rate that Ireland would be paying.  Maybe if you could comment upon what the three different partners' view was, by your familiarity, as to what the optimum or preferred interest rate would be in terms of the higher rate and the lower rate?  And if you could give some indication as well as to the implementation of the programme in regards to its timeframe and other conditions that might have been met as to where there would have been differences between the troika partners?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2147" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#PPP00200"><p>Okay.  I don't to be very fair ... I don't remember who had what position on the interest rate issue, right.  So, I think I'll try and answer the thing in a little bit more general way, okay.  The troika programme was effectively staffed by counterparts to ourselves from the various institutions, right, and I think I could say that in terms of the relationships we had with them without exception, I think they were all as anxious to find a programme that worked as we were and certainly, they were there ... my office, of course, was across the road from The Merrion, so I could kind of keep an eye on ... when they were working late as well as ... as when we were working late, they would see us.</p> <p>  But what I meant earlier by the reality of the world is that when the IMF rolled into town, they bought straight away a photocopying machine they were ready to go the following Monday.  The Commission have told me since, they didn't realise that you should have done that and they didn't realise how they were going to photocopy because this was the first time they were doing this.  And we had to sort of ... actually in the Irish programme find a way to get this to work and the Portuguese used to kind of copy us in various things.</p> <p>  Our principle of negotiation was that ... the room wasn't much different to this ... they used to sit on one side, we would sit on the other ... is that there were times when you had to be particularly firm with all three.  There were times when you had to be particularly firm with one or the other.  The rows I recall that probably, you know, had some of the bigger differences of views may actually have been around things like the banking side.  For example, there was a big debate for quite a long time about the need for Ireland to have a stress test of its banks in advance of that of the European, sort of, system.  And you would find, as you do in any way of life, that when you have three people negotiating against you, there is a skill that you have to deploy across your own team at different levels of trying to make sure who's on your side the most and whose not because obviously, their interest was also to come back on the Monday morning and I can't remember ... I think I saw it in some papers described that they were trying to decide their process over the weekend and come to us on Monday.  We were trying actually to make sure that if we had one of the teams or two in our camp a little bit more than the other, we would take advantage of that and there would be bilateral conversations and trilateral conversations.  And it changed depending on the issue.  I mean there were some ... the Commission tended to be a little bit more focused on some of the structural issues because that's what goes into the excessive deficit procedures.  The IMF were certainly very focused on things like the sustainability of debt and I think the ECB folks probably looked at the banking sector a little bit more than the others.  Does that help?</p></speech>

Briefly, Mr. Moran, as somebody who is often portrayed as an outsider to the Civil Service, after your arrival to the Central Bank and subsequently into the Department of Finance, did you ... well, firstly, did you believe that you had an advantage or disadvantage because of your private sector background in entering those positions and, particularly, becoming Secretary General of the Department of Finance?  And secondly, did you encounter any ... I don't know how to put this diplomatically ... internal opposition or difficulties as Secretary General of the Department from maybe people who had served for longer in the Civil Service?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2150" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#PPP00500"><p>The first one is quite easy, actually, because I had the great advantage of not knowing how anything worked.  So, I was likely to do things differently.  Not because I didn't want to do it any differently but I didn't realise that it should be done in a particular way.</p><p>The .. I had the advantage as well of having colleagues in the Civil Service who knew how things should work and were, I think ... hopefully I will look back and see that I didn't make a mistake anywhere along the way because they were protecting me and making sure that we weren't doing anything that ... that was wrong.  And ... and I think that, sort of, in a way that ... that the answer is in there, right?  We moved, while I was in the Department, to a situation where we brought the NTMA team into the Department specifically so we had the ... the corporate finance guys from the NTMA physically in an open-plan area in the Department.  We integrated the ... the people that were going to stay with the Department as civil servants into that room.  They worked together.  And so, I think, you found that there was a bit of fear at the beginning as to what does this all mean and is this a change ... but that by integrating the two teams, I think, we actually got a lot of buy-in.</p><p> I think that the other thing that I would say in terms of going into the system first - and, again, I have been saying this for some time, right - it was grossly under-resourced.  That's the first dramatic, sort of, impact that you probably had when you ... when you walked into the... into the system.   And at the Central Bank at the time, it was already changing.  But at the Department of Finance, it had most certainly not at that time.  And that's on all fronts.  I mean, that's just the ... the support for doing your job, the ... the fact that there wasn't a ... what I call a corporate centre.  So that a lot of time was being spent ... a lot of the, actually we talked about it earlier, the technical expertise was being spent doing relatively administrative type tasks and then repeating them because actually nobody knew that they had been done somewhere else.  And so ... so the structure needed to change in the ... in that respect.</p><p> You know, I think inevitably when you come in to a situation and you find that there are, sort of, different ways of looking at it you can see it differently.  What I can say is I don't ever recall a situation where anybody said, you know, "We don't, sort of, welcome you into the system."  But I would comment on one or two things which are, sort of, perhaps not even surprising and they weren't done in any ... any sort of bad faith, but people used to refer to the fact that they were ... had recently joined the Department, they were there less than three years, right?  I don't think in many other organisations - if you have actually lasted three years, you've probably done quite well, right - you would still consider yourself not part of the system, right.  But that was as much the people coming in perhaps, as the people being there.  What ... what we did find was that there was a growing integration of the system.  But what worries me is, what I said earlier, which is if you go in, you find that you are doing all this fantastic work but is there enough support to be able to do it, for people to actually stay?  And I don't think we should, sort of, assume that transiency in terms of staff means that they are not welcome.  It may just mean that they realise that there are better places, potentially, in terms of support to work.</p></speech>

Most of the cost-benefit analysis, I think, that should be in the system should be done by colleagues in power and they should be equally requiring the Department of Finance to do it.  So, you know, with the kind of culture I am talking about, with all ... with respect, is to me the more important one is it's the kind of things of, you know ... I used to just sort of walk up to people's desk.   The other senior managers would do that, they wouldn't ask them to be summoned.  There was, I hope, a greater equality.  I mean, it's actually funny around the table here.  You know, I spent quite a lot of time convincing people to call me John and not Secretary General, right?  But that was important to me, that we weren't using titles just for the sake of titles because somebody who calls you Secretary General all the time or even Mr. Moran probably treats you differently than somebody who calls you John.  And they may not actually say things to you just quite as easily, you know.</p><p>And that's the kind of culture change I'm taking about ... that's the kind of culture change I was talking about earlier you know.  It was mentioned, and I mean it's only testimony - I look like I actually watched all of Kevin's testimony this morning, but I ... I was kind of just picking up documents and stuff like that over in the thing - you know he made reference to the fact that civil servants expect to be kept waiting four hours for a meeting.  That shouldn't be happening.</p></speech>

I think that during the period of the crisis that worked very well, but where it is necessary, and I'm not saying you have to put it back together, I'm saying it would be useful to analyse that scenario to make sure that there is an infrastructure, or a forum or whatever it is, that allows what used to happen before within one Department, one Minister, one Secretary General who actually had a much greater understanding of the whole thing, to be able to do it.  And the example I gave in my written statement was the housing sector, because that's what you've been looking at.  We have housing sector problems at the moment, we've had them for two years, they're what I was talking about when we were talking about repossessions stats.  But it's split up all over the place, some of the banking stuff is in the Department of Finance, some ... how do you bring all that together in the current structure, that's just what I was saying in terms of finding a way to do that.  And maybe the separation, which is contrary to the Wright report, is actually not a good idea - but I'm not saying it can't continue, you can find an alternative way of making sure that you understand that's there, and bringing it together.</p></speech>

The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming again in public session and, as I've said, I'll be asking those members and those in the public Gallery to ensure their mobile devices are off.</p> <p>  Today we continue our hearings with the senior officials from the Department of Finance who had key roles during and after the crisis period.  At our present session we will now hear from Mr. Derek Moran, current Secretary General at the Department of Finance.</p><p>Derek Moran has worked in the Department of Finance since 1989, from July 2003 to July 2014, he was an assistant secretary to the Department while his responsibilities, where his responsibilities included the budget and economic division, the tax policy division, the fiscal policy division and human resources.  He was appointed to the role of Secretary General  in July 2014.<br/><br/>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect to their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to do so, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry, which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2170" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Moran" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015061800002#XXX00300"><p>Chairman, thank you very much.  I don't propose to go through my witness statement, I'm going to keep it through to four or five minutes.  I think everybody will be probably grateful for that.  The first few comments just basically on two topics, one, on the advice the Department gave pre-crisis, and, secondly, on whether we're in any better position than we might have been then in terms of dealing with future challenges.</p> <p>  It's a notable feature of all the reports to date, Wright, Nyberg and so on, that they find the Department did warn on the adoption of inappropriate macro-fiscal policies.  It's equally notable in all the reports that they're critical of the Department for not, for either not heightening the tone of that risk or for linking fiscal and, and, and the financial properly.  As I said in my witness statement, this is fair and accurate comment.  Nonetheless, warnings were given, and to quote Wright, they were "more direct and comprehensive than concerns expressed by others in Ireland, or by international agencies".</p> <p>  It's also true that external bodies, such as the IMF, warned of the same risks and on occasion in some detail.  But as time went by, the narrative tended to soften, commending Ireland, for example for impressive economic performance, and prudent fiscal policy by the IMF or, or citing Ireland as an exemplar of compliance with the Stability and Growth Pact, the EU Commission.  And the context here for these international bodies is important.  It has to be ... remember that time, and I'm talking about 2005, 2006, Ireland had been growing consistently for a very long period of time and the budget was either close to balance, in surplus and the debt ratio was a low, only around 25% of GDP.  These were very impressive headline numbers by international standards at that time.  </p> <p>  If we take a step back a bit, in the mid to late 1990s, the objective of Government policy was very clear: run a budget policy that was sufficiently tight to qualify as a founding member of the single currency.  You can see this in the numbers.  Spending in '97 and '98 were lower than they were at any time for the next decade and the budget started to run a surplus in '97 at 1.3% and growing to about 2.6% by 1999.  The introduction of the Stability and Growth Pact at this time was all about governments appropriately managing their key remaining policy lever in EMU, fiscal policy, as monetary policy moved from domestic central banks to the ECB.  </p> <p>  The Department advised, from about the start of the last decade, that it was necessary  to create a buffer against risks, including from about 2003 onwards ... over-reliance on housing sector.  It's important to be clear about what that means.  It means telling the Government of the day it should not allow spending to grow or tax be reduced by as much as they might want.  In technical terms, run counter-cyclical rather than pro-cyclical policies.  While this isn't an easy message, it's one that the Department must deliver.  On housing, notwithstanding the warnings, we did not conceive a collapse to the magnitude that actually happened, and I think we have to say that upfront. </p> <p>  It is unfortunate that if you constantly predict a recession year after year and it doesn't happen, then you run the risk of the advice you're giving becoming sort of a debased currency.</p><p>In the end, it's probably the role for Government to make policy decisions, having considered all the advice given to it.  And the failure to run tighter budget policies had profound consequences for the public and for the public finances.  Had tighter budgets been adopted in the early and middle of the last decade, it would've reduced significantly the need for very painful expenditure cuts and tax increases during the crisis resolution period.</p><p> In terms of the second piece, I think it's better now.  Do we have better systems?  Have we learned lessons?  I believe an answer ... on balance, the answer is "Yes".  I think we have ...always have to be aware that systems and processes need to be continually evolved if they are to remain (a) relevant and (b) effective.  In terms of external macro-fiscal surveillance, we know that prior to the crisis, the EU Stability and Growth Pact was not sufficient to meet the task.  The changes to the pact have been very significant.  Its principle elements are enshrined in domestic and constitutional law in member states.  It has become much more automatically enforceable - it has real teeth.  In many respects, you are now presumed guilty until proven innocent under the revised framework.  It is very difficult to under ... overturn a recommendation for action for a member ... to a member state from the EU ... from the Commission.  The improvements in the European economic and fiscal governance arrangements over the last number of years should result in the earlier detection and warning of emerging vulnerabilities and the enforcement of earlier action, either by European authorities or by individual member states, as the case might be.  These changes are important and to be welcomed.</p><p> Domestically, we've also put in place improvements - budgetary rules have taken on a much greater significance than those that applied before the crisis through a target for the structural balance, complemented by an expenditure benchmark.  The expenditure benchmark helps illustrate room for manoeuvre available to Government in setting its annual budget.  This was presented for the first time in the spring economic statement this year and it's the first time that we have publicly available, six months before a budget, a range of, of room for manoeuvre that's available now for public and commentator and political debate.  The advent in the independent Fiscal Advisory Council is another voice charged with specifically overseeing and endorsing the official economic forecasts and comments on the status of policy.  They have embraced that role and their independence and, again, this is to be welcomed.</p><p> Extensive changes have been made in the organisation of the Department.  These are aimed at ensuring the Department has the capacity to do its job and relate properly to its stakeholders.  We've increased the publication of technical studies, policy reviews and other relevant papers.  We've entered into a research partnership with the ESRI, whereby members of the institute and the Department work together on a number of fiscal and macroeconomic projects.  Engagement with the stakeholders, think-tanks and other experts can only improve the quality of advice.  We've also participated in a number of public consultations, as the Department, including, for example, on macro-prudential rules, the Low Pay Commission and agricultural strategy.</p><p> Many of the other changes in the organisation flow directly from the Wright report.  These include: structures to handle corporate affairs; professionalisation of HR; improved communications; cross-divisional work; and so on.  We've also, for the first time, formally codified our governance structures and processes in a single document.  From my point of view as the Secretary General, there's no fixed target for improving the Department - it's a process.  It should be ongoing and continually challenge the organisation to be the best it can be and, where we can, benchmark our performance against others.</p><p> Thank you, Chairman, committee, for your time and attention and I hope my contribution will be of some assistance to the committee in its work.</p></speech>

I mean, the nature of economics is that it is a, sort of, discursive, collaborative discipline.  And, you know, the process that we go through to develop a view of the economy would include discussions across the range of people feeding into the overall view of the macroeconomy.  And that would've taken on board very, very different views and it would've ... in the end of the day, you had to come down and develop a central forecast, I suppose.  We can only publish one set of forecasts, one view of the economy and that has to be credible to both the external accommodators, to the markets, to the rating agencies and so on.  And, I think, during that period, whether we were right or wrong, they were.  So, dissent ... or ... or contrarian views, you know, are accommodated within that, sort of, dialogue that goes through the process.</p><p>We also, I mean ... I mean, within any organisation, I think, where people might have profound difficulties they have opportunities to talk to more senior people, or we used to run each year this, sort of, annual review where the staff met the entire management team and were afforded an opportunity to give their views directly, if they felt they needed so ... so I think we had in place procedures and processes that allowed an appropriate discussion, particularly of the ... of visions around housing and construction and so on. </p></speech>

Within the institution, there was always the opportunity to articulate that to a more senior level, including collectively in those sessions.  But I think the Department's responsibility, ultimately, is to give the ... the Minister the complete view, if you like, the view of the Department, on balance, of the likely prospects.</p></speech>

How do we accommodate that now?  We have ... we tend to take major policy issues, including the economic forecast, the economic outlook, to what we call a policy committee, which is a peer review committee within the Department.  And we've broadened that over time, not to just be about sections or divisions bringing their policy initiatives for peer review, but to allow horizontal groups of people to bring it in, in terms of cross-divisions, but also importantly, I think, and it's to deal with the sort of situation, among other things, Deputy, that you're referring to, if an individual wants to do it, they can bring their views forward and, sort of, have them peer reviewed, you know, among peers at that fortnightly meeting.</p></speech>

Given the Department's primary role in terms of fiscal policy and in light of the fact that during your tenure, you would have had considerable experience in the areas of taxation and budgets, can I ask you to comment on the fact that cyclical taxes, including stamp duty, corporation tax, capital gains tax, rose as a percentage of total revenues from about 8% in 1987 to 30% in 2006, and towards the years leading to 2006 a greater acceleration in the growth in the overall percentage of such taxes?

And the big difficulty was ... ultimately, is that those cyclical benefits, which were transitional and based on transactions, they weren't permanent, there was no underlying ... it's not like income taxes, it's not like corporate tax, it's not like VAT, there's no underlying element to it, they were basically transactions, and once those transactions stop, the money goes.  But permanent decisions weren't being made on the back of those transitional ... of the transitional taxes ... that tax relief, tax relief or tax reductions were being made on permanent expenditure increases based on that windfall that came each November from those taxes.

And that was at the heart of it, about this risk.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, each year the Governor of the Central Bank would issue a pre-budget report to the Minister, known as the Governor's letter.  You state that these letters did not suggest that the Governor had any concerns about financial stability.  Should the Governor's letters, or any other reports from the Central Bank, always be taken at face value, and not subject to challenge from within the Department, or would you put forward a different view on that?  And what processes does the Department of Finance have to challenge information that it is being given by the Central Bank, including in that letter, that annual letter?</p></speech>

In terms of the formalities, my understanding is, the Minister probably meets the Governor on the letter and the Department would brief on, on the details of that.  It's, you know, we would have, there would be differences, you know, but it's always important to get other, other views.  In terms of the, the financial stability, the guard dog was the Central Bank, you know-----</p></speech>

I mean, I think ... financial stability is a matter for the Central Bank, okay, it's their responsibility.  I think the one thing that we have learned is that we have to be much more acutely aware of its importance, and to question, and be able to interrogate if we've got a concern.  And I think in the period of the crisis, we, certainly, from what I was doing, I would not have been conscious that we were posing those questions, and asking those questions.  Certainly in terms of the budgetary process, financial stability issues didn't arise.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, in page 5 of your opening statement, you state that in general terms, the biggest deficiency of advice prior to the crisis was not linking macro-fiscal and financial stability risks.  "The Department shares that deficiency," you said.  Can you advise the committee more recently what changes have you introduced to address that issue, and how, can you give us an assurance that that has now changed?</p></speech>

I suppose, if you consider - go back to the middle of the last decade, a lot of the macroeconomic models ... dealt very effectively with impacts on the macroeconomy, but didn't link across to the financial sector.  And this has been a big challenge for economics in the intervening period, but how do you make those linkages across?  The ESRI is currently at an advanced stage - we would have used the HERMES model, developed by the ESRI.  The ESRI are currently at an advanced stage of developing a new model which is called COSMO.  I don't know what that stands for, but it's called COSMO nonetheless.</p><p>It will have this capacity built into it and we're making a staff member available, a PhD student, who we have who's ... who's on special leave doing a PhD but when they come back, they go down to the ESRI and work with them on this and then when it's developed which I believe ... it finishes towards the end of this year, we'll have that capacity within the Department and somebody, you know, at a PhD level capable of using it.  So, you know, we have ... in terms of the future solutions, you know, we've been sort of actively involved with the ESRI on that. </p></speech>

Mr. Moran, Mr. Wright in his report on the Department notes that the transfer of treasury operations to the NTMA "impaired the Department's capacity to respond to the banking crisis".  There were, he went on to say, "shortages of skills in the requisite disciplines and inadequate knowledge of underlying developments in the [construction] sector".  So, can I ask you for the duration of your tenure as assistant secretary, and you covered at different times, budgetary policy, fiscal, taxation roles, were you satisfied that the Department and particularly the function that you were in charge of, had the requisite skills and expertise for identifying and mitigating those key systemic economic risks?</p></speech>

When I came back in 2003, there had been a lot of change ... that very few of the personnel that I would have recognised and there was a concern at that stage about the economic capacity and that wasn't just me coming in, that was the staff themselves to be fair to them and I don't think I'd be showing any disrespect to them in that regard.  Coming in July '03, I did ask them to sit down and sort of self-diagnose, you know, what are the problems they saw, what are the things that we needed to do.  And among the things that they sort of came up with is ... and came back to me on is things about getting the right people and having a career path for economists within the Department, the need for training and development.  If you can't buy in, if you don't have the wherewithal, the financial wherewithal to buy people in, well then develop your own people.  Improved communications - I think it's hard to believe at this stage that for eight years, the economics unit in the Department of Finance was split, one in ... part of it in Mount Street and part of it in Merrion Street and in what's a discursive, you know, set of interactions, that's a very odd and unsustainable thing that some of the organisation structure, some of the economists were mixed in with budgetary policy and they needed to be separated and we used to have stronger links with the ESRI.  That ... they were the sort of key things that came back and effectively, you know, over the next period of time starting in early 2004, one of the key things they had ... saw,  is that we had a group of good undergraduates who had come in but we didn't have anybody more experienced to develop them and bring them along.   I would have gone to Mr. McNally, who was the second secretary at that stage and said, "Listen, there are these range of concerns, you know, and we need to do something about it."  And I suppose, the things that we did initially is to bring people into one location, you know, so that you could get that interaction that you'd be missing, to clarify the budgetary and the economic functions, that they weren't mixed and to have some sort of strategic plan around HR and get in the right people.  So, for example, just in practical terms, went to the Central Bank and seconded an experienced economist who has since, you know, ten years later became the chief economist in the Department.  We recruited a PhD from students ... somebody who was completing their PhD in Trinity at the time and brought her in.  Got an experienced economist, who was finishing up tenure with the NDP evaluation unit, and bring them in, to give that core of senior experience to try develop the other people and to also take, I mean again, this thing ... and you have to remember, it's salary levels in the private sector in terms of attracting economists for much higher than they could have been in the private ... in the public sector, is to take some of our very bright younger administrative officers and send them out to UCD to do a masters in ... to bring their skills up ... to do a masters in economic science, which we did with two of them.  Incidentally, having spent that money, we no longer have them.  That's always the risk you take, you know, that you invest in people and they move on but it's a risk that you have to take and we continue to do.  So, there was a blend of them and just a little bit later in 2005 I went on and, you know, went and recruited ten additional graduates and to try build up the capacity.  So, there was a capacity issue.</p></speech>

But then you ... you cite some of the criticisms in the Wright report:</p> <blockquote> 	...it is critical of the fact that the tone of warnings did not escalate, that warnings were given within the framework of the Budget memoranda but not much beyond that and that advice was given to the Minister orally without a record being kept. This is on balance a fair comment. </blockquote> <p>Can you just clarify what your reference to advice being given orally to the Minister is?

What was held constant in an improving budgetary situation was the deficit target and any additional money came in, that was spent.  That ... that's what happened.  It doesn't mean that between then and the formulation of the budget that there was nothing happening because the expenditure campaign would have ... it would have initiated the expenditure campaign and there would have been regular briefing and updating through that channel back to the Minster and through the Government about progress on that.  So the pressures would have been identified.  And the pressures are twofold.  I mean, let me be clear about that.  The pressures on the expenditure side were overruns on the current year that inflated the base even further from the starting point and additional policy initiatives.  And those things would have rolled up over the period.  And it was one of those things with a December budget and with a November flow of revenues that came from the cyclical taxes going back to our earlier point, it allowed very late decisions to spend more and to tax less, and goes back to the point, based on largely transitional revenues.</p></speech>

Welcome, Mr. Moran.  Sorry for detaining you.  During his hearing in the context phase of this banking inquiry, the well known economist - we are talking about economists - Professor John FitzGerald said:</p> <blockquote> 	There was a culture change in the Department of Finance in the last decade.  It became more concerned about the politics of things and less interested in the technical detail.  I would like to have had less interaction. </blockquote> <p>Would you give us your own views on those comments?</p></speech>

And I mean, this is ... I mean, I got the sense in reading the extracts from his testimony that this centred around a couple of interactions that we had, I think, a combination of "Nervous Nellie" and - what was the other one? - and "Grumpy", and we are still looking for them within the Department.  It's ... the Department's a big organisation.  I don't know about the politicisation, I'm not sure that it's a fair comment, you know.  I mean, certainly ... I know in the preparation of the 2006 medium-term review, there would have been a round-table meeting between the ESRI team doing it and the Department's team in terms of back and forth and iteration and an input into that.  Some of the tension seemed to be over some commentary about the possibility that the capacity to increase corporation tax and on the front-loading of the capital programme.  But certainly it wasn't my experience and I've always found that I had a very sort of healthy interaction ... but I mean they're Professor FitzGerald's views and I respect them.</p></speech>

I suppose that styles get embedded, particularly where you have, effectively, the same Government over a very prolonged period of time, you know, and that, perhaps, can influence the way people think and behave; there's a consistency or a constancy.  But I think at the individual, official level, to be honest, there has to be healthy tensions between different commentators and the Department.  I think that's the way it should be ... that there are some times - and I give a personal view on this - that the Department relies on independent institutions saying things that possibly the Department can't say in its role.  And members here will know that when officials come in to committees, they can't comment on the merits, or otherwise, of policy, you know.  And that's the way the system operates, that's the way the parliamentary and democratic system operates.  So, therefore, in my view, it is very, very important that you have other voices saying things that perhaps you can't say.  So, I-----</p></speech>

You refer in the statement in the Wright report and its findings that the Department did warn against the adoption of inappropriate policies, although not as forceful as it should have been.  During your tenure as assistant secretary from July 2003 up to the banking crisis, were any internal analyses undertaken on the growing dependency on property-related tax revenues?  Was the matter discussed at management board level?  If so, how frequently, and what was the general outcome?</p><p>Now, I note in your presentation that you do make reference to it on page 10, where you make reference to that you did carry out a report.  The question I suppose I'm asking is twofold.  Your model was based around that if there was a ... so many ... a 50,000 unit fall in housing output, would give arise to &euro;1.7 billion, how is it we did not model a much deeper collapse than actually happened?  So, I suppose what I really want to ask you there is, the type of sensitivity analysis you did there, why wasn't it more in-depth?  And, I suppose a kind of, a related area that I ... I suppose, that you might deal with as well, is that when you were looking at that were attempts made to quantify the effects of a soft landing and what impact this would have on Government finance in terms of loss of revenue, increased expenditure?  What advice was Government given in this regard?  And I'm basing ... because so much was ... of the revenue, was coming in around property.</p></speech>

From December '04 onwards, and that would be in the projections we produced for the '05 budget, we started to build in projections for a fall in housing output.  And the economics and the projections going forward and the tax revenues around that would have ... would have been ... so, for example, we would have set out in ... for the '05 budget, assuming that 80,000 output.  It didn't quite come in at that at the end of the year, because we were doing this before the end of the year.  And that would fall to 76,000 in '05 and fall to about 62,000 by '07, so that's about a 22% phase drop.  And that's the point at which we started building that through the ... so we were modelling and feeding that ... that through the projections, and that rolled on in the couple of years after that, that I would have still been there.  Invariably what happened was that the output ended up being higher in the year that you first slowed it down.  Then you need to go back up and calibrate, and come back down again.  And, it is ... so ... so, we were doing that.</p></speech>

You said, "The Department had been warning of the risks to the Budget and the economy for nearly a decade before the eventual crisis hit in 2008."  How were you doing that because clearly it wasn't coming through in terms of the budgets?  How were you doing that to the Ministers?</p></speech>

I also say in it and I just look a very quick look at all the memoranda during that period and there was a range of risks highlighted.  The view is that this level of growth wasn't sustainable in the long term and that it was going to ease back and that was, I mean it was through that type of forum.  We continue with that, you know, it's ...  I think one of the memorandum, it sort of refers to the fact that this extraordinary growth phase is now over.

I go back and look at the tax strategy group papers from the late 1990s and there's a series of them which raise questions.  They are publicly available and they are the nearest thing to the commentary from the Department.  They are already raising by '96, '97 that really the long-term future of these, they've done it and they should be reviewed and so on.  It took a terrible long time to get traction on that.  It was around late 2004.</p></speech>

You pull these very quickly and you have got your very sharp downturn in the economy and I think that informed it as much as anything else.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, if I can maybe just move on to kind of a similar theme with you?  You seem to indicate in your statement that for the period of 2003 to 2008, the Department was reassured by the absence of any reference in the letters from the Central Bank Governor to a slowdown in housing, and by favourable assessments from an international body such as the IMF.  However, Professor Honohan states that even before the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 2008, Irish residential property prices had been falling for more than 18 months and few observers expected the fall to end soon.  We also know from hearing stuff we have had with regard to the financial stability reports, that certain people that were involved in them would say that they were maybe exercises and not frighten the horses and they were maybe not as accurate a reflection as we now know.</p><p>We know that Professor FitzGerald, in his engagement with the inquiry, was saying that the model that he was using for testing the economy was not measuring the level of bank exposure that was there and so forth.  And then you say, on page 5 of your statement, that "In general terms the biggest deficiency of advice prior to the crisis was not linking macro-fiscal and financial stability risks ... [and] The Department shares in that deficiency."  Could I maybe ask you to elaborate on that statement, referring, in particular, to the critical features of the deficiency you refer to and to the remedial steps, if any, taken since the crisis?</p></speech>

I suppose at one level, there was that point in the late 1990s where the emphasis of policy perhaps moved.  The separation of monetary policy going to the ECB and fiscal policy becoming a ... very much the central consideration for governments.  The model that Professor FitzGerald was using, which is HERMES model, we would have used as well, which didn't have the capacity within it, you know, and there was, as I say, this ... this sense of the bank and the regulator were doing their jobs and all the external commentary sort of validated that, you know.  Now, I ... I mean, I think it is a weakness in the Department that the fiscal piece and ... and the ... the monetary piece, or the credit piece, weren't joined together adequately, but I think some of it is based on this view that the job over here was being done and our job was to concentrate on this piece and that was mistaken.  And we are ... you know, and I'll go back to COSMO, the unfortunate COSMO, you know, we are, you know, kind of ... having that capacity, using the structures within the Department where the chief economist is involved and chairs, for example, our housing and construction group, which involves people across the Department, you know, in a much horizontal way, improving some of the risk function in a way that we can actually get the risk function to challenge people and add the pieces together and come back to it.  So, I think we've become much better at the horizontal pieces and joining those together and it's probably one of the important things that we've learned out of the crisis.</p></speech>

Can I maybe just move on to one other item then?  You refer to the December 2005 stability programme update which warned of the economy being vulnerable to the construction sector and that the Department had concluded that reliance on construction was becoming one of the biggest risks to economic development in the country.  Could I ask you to elaborate in what way, if any, the Department followed up on that warning and what response, if any, was received, especially from the Minister of the day and/or the Government and was lobbying both internally, within the system, or externally a factor in both of those regards?</p></speech>

I mean, it's not a coincidence, I don't think, that around the same time there was eventually traction on the phasing out of the fiscal incentives for property.  You know, no matter whether you think it was done quickly or not, you know, around budget '04 or ... it was announced in December '04 as part of budget '05 that these were to be reviewed and then, the following year, to be phased out.  So, in terms of a policy response, albeit in my view late, I think that's the traction that those sorts of warnings started to get.</p></speech>

We did that in 2011, we got 700 or 800 responses to that and we found a mechanism by ... which allowed us cut off the legacy at the end.  It's not an easy issue.  People have vested property rights etc., etc., and you have to unwind those.  So, I mean, I know from my own experience that it's not an easy journey to travel.</p><p>The part ... the weakness I think ultimately in, in the ... the phasing out, and this is just ... this is my view, in the '06, '07, '08 is that, you had a decreasing amount of tax relief available, but all the way up to '08 you'd new people coming in at those lower rates and I think that was a mistake.  I think it should have been phasing out with ... with no new entry.  But, I think people ... you probably have witnesses who were closer to that at that time, before you. </p></speech>

But on the fiscal strategy piece, I think the, the ... and the real test Senator, is going to be from here forward.  Since '08 we were tied into a set of fiscal targets agreed with the ... with Europe, in terms of getting the deficit, in other words we had to hit nominal deficits and so on, so it was very clear what we had to do.  We went into the programme in, in 2010, that continued for three years.  And at the moment, we're under what's called the preventative arm ... preventative arm, with the Stability and Growth Pact, where we have to, over the next three years, or out to 2018, get down to a balanced budget in cyclical terms.  So, so we've had a map, a very clear map, over a prolonged period of time.  In terms of the architecture after that, I think some of the most important things that we ... that are there are the changes in the rules but actually, the integration of those rules into what we do, and I know some people, some people weren't very complimentary of the spring economic statement, but it is an attempt to have a serious discussion about the budget that's coming in six months later.  We'll have to see how the national economic dialogue in July works, in terms of actually having a, a proper dialogue around the issues.  I've always been concerned ... just to be, is that ... budget day is sort of one of those once-off pieces of theatre, rather than the end to a serious dialogue around important policy, that's important to everybody.</p></speech>

Internally, you know, we have a much stronger link between budget policy and, and an economic policy.  We have ... and it works well, I think, but the separation of the Department between expenditure and tax and the ...  it is risky.  And we have a memorandum of understanding between us and the Department of Public Expenditure that makes it work reasonably well.  So, so overall I think, both in terms of the adoption of external rules, the embedding them into a sort of a revised budgetary framework, that sort of greater professionalisation of economics, I think we've put a lot in place in terms of improving the overall budget framework.</p></speech>

All right.  In your statement on page 3, you say that the Department had concerns with the tools used by the Commission for measuring the cyclical stance of the budget, seeing them as inadequate.  Can you tell us over what period of time did you have those concerns and if you felt, therefore, that they were inadequate, what did you do about it?</p></speech>

And the model works perfectly well for a large economy.  So that cyclical growth goes up and down according to cycle but the trend growth or the ... you know, is still a fairly stable number over time.  When you do that for Ireland, it just doesn't work, it bounces around the place.  We endeavoured ... we have pointed out, I mean, on numerous occasions, to them that this doesn't work and its results give you bizarre outcomes.  And, for example, some work done by the economics division looked at in retrospect applying those rules to some of the more trenchant, deep cutting budgets of recent years and it comes up with a result that the 2011 budget was expansionary.  In other words, it didn't really raise billions in taxes and cuts ... it was expansionary in those terms.  And we've been engaged on ... and it's got better.  Two things: the Commission are far more willing to engage now and we have made some headway in terms of getting them to adjust some other assumptions within the model and we ... but we've got more to do.  And it's not clear that it'll, ultimately, work.  But what happens now is that they have two.  They have the cyclical measure and they have the expenditure benchmark, and it's not quite an either-or, but one can deal with the country specific issues in a ... you know, in a way that it wasn't a tool available ten years ago.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Donnell has already quoted this.  On page 7 of your own statement, ''The Department had concluded that reliance on construction was becoming one of the biggest risks to economic development especially where some external shock might interact with and affect the construction sector."  Now we heard from Tom Considine yesterday, who took some pains to explain how you can advise and Governments decide.  So, if you were giving that advice - and you've said in your response that you were - that the Department rather was giving that advice, if you see that some of your advice is not sticking or is not being taken or is being taken in a way that isn't just quite what you thought, what were you doing then to, sort of, correct or to re-correct or to try to go, "Okay, well, if they haven't taken that advice, what are we going to do now?"  Or do you just sit back and go, I'm exaggerating slightly, but do you sit back and go, "Well, they haven't taken our advice this time."  How do you keep fighting that fight or did you give up?  Did the Department give up and go away?</p></speech>

A personal view, and it can be no more than that, is I think we're very conservative in our interpretation of where the line between advice administration lies and policy lies, and how far we can go in terms of articulating publicly concerns and I think we've got better at that ... and by that I mean, and this is not because ... no civil servant will cross the line into policy; that is a matter for the Government, you know, we will not offer a view on policy; it's not appropriate.  But you can inform, you can publish research, you can participate in political debate.  So, I mean, I did reference that ... or not political debate, policy debate.  You know I did reference in my few words at the start is that during ... since I took over we have participated in public consultations around policy decisions like the macro-prudential rules, like the Low Pay Commission etc., as the Department, not as the Minister and so on.  Now to do that you have to have the support of the Minister because is to publish them in that way, and if they don't give it, then you don't but I do think that there are various ways in which we can have a say and I don't think we leveraged them terribly well in the past.</p></speech>

We were talking about the outcome of the Goodbody report, and you've mentioned the Indecon Goodbody report.  Was that ... is that your understanding?  Was that what you understood?

To invest, you have to have surplus cash to be able to invest.  So, yes they, by definition, go to people with higher incomes.  The interesting part was in ... you know, when they were restricted ... so was also introduced in the same budget the restriction of reliefs.  The, sort of, minimum tax regime was introduced in 2006.  So in other words, not only were you phasing them out but you were also restricting the capacity of people to use them, and that was brought in in 2006 as well.</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, in 2005, when you were assistant secretary for the budget and economic division in the Department of Finance, the Department of the environment expressed concerns at the effect of the introduction of 100% mortgages, indicating that it could give rise to serious indebtedness of households.  And in response, the Department of Finance adopted the position this was a consumer matter, rather than a macro-financial stability one.</p><p>Were you involved in preparing that response and on what basis was that conclusion arrived at?</p></speech>

Mr. Moran, in the course of the bubble period, when you were in the budget and economic division and then in the taxation policy division, we have evidence in the core books - which I'm not going to take the time to put up - but of strong lobbying by construction interests and developer interests.  There is an example of a letter refracted through a member of parliament from a developer and then the Irish auctioneers have a strong proposal to a committee, for example, "[opposing] any system in which individual landowners are deprived of the open market value of their land in the interest of favouring other more disadvantaged members of the community."</p></speech>

A routine and normal part of the annual budget cycle is that you get, in recent years, somewhere between 700 and 900 individual submissions from groups lobbying around a range of issues and this would've been one of those.  It doesn't surprise me in the least.  To the extent the vast majority of people that do this lobbying and make submissions don't get access and don't get a meeting with the Ministers.  It was the case, up to about 2007, the Minister would've met a much wider range of groups than they do any more.  They meet very, very few.  It's much more selective and it tends to be the bigger, if you like to call, the social partner type groups, rather than industry ... so, does it surprise me?  No.</p></speech>

From freedom of information and other sources, we believe that the current policy of the Department of Finance is that house prices should rise ... it would be a good thing if house prices went up.  And <i>The Sunday Business Post</i>, just Sunday gone out, said that there would be a &euro;200 million fund from the National Pensions Reserve Fund to developers in relation to new residential developments.  Now in view of the nightmare our society has been through with throwing money at developers with massive house price inflation, etc, is that really the road to take?  Is that ... does that indicate that we've learned from the past?  And would you say, and this is my last question, that perhaps there would be an argument for thinking, to go back to the '60s and '70s model of public sector provision of badly needed housing, to sort the housing crisis that we have at the present time - would that be a lesson to learn from what we've come through?</p></speech>

And I think the sort of initiatives that you're talking about, which is assisting, sort of, the change in funding model for construction going forward is actually about increasing supply and taking the pressure off prices, rather than the other way round.  One of the things that has happened out of the crisis is that developers can no longer 100% debt fund development.  They need to find a mixture of other funding.  So they might be able to raise bank loans for 60% of it but they have to have some equity input as well.  And so we organised a, sort of, a conference or get-together to try to bring some of that together, to bridge that financing gap.  What you're talking about in terms of the NTMA or the ISIF funding is there are certain things that developers can't get funding for, and it's looking at ... and it hasn't been launched, it's still being examined, as far as I know, at how the ISIF can get in and help with that sort of investment and get a return to the State.  So it's actually more about encouraging a supply of houses to actually ease the price pressure where the demand is, rather than the other way round.</p></speech>

Professor Honohan, however, states that, and I'm quoting him here, "Even before the failure of Lehman Brothers in September 208, Irish residential property prices had been falling for more than 18 months and few observers expected their fall to end soon."  Can you set out your Department's own assessment, if any, of the housing market at the time or did you rely primarily on the analysis of the Central Bank and other external bodies, such as the IMF?</p></speech>

I mean, I think, to be fair, and I've huge respect for Professor Honohan, that's the analysis looking back.  I mean, you know, when you're in the moment, these things aren't as obvious.  Perhaps they should be, based on the data available, but they're not as obvious.  You know, with the benefit of hindsight and knowing what happened, you know, yes, he's right.  At the time ... and incorrectly, let's ... you know, there was a broad-based consensus that, you know, that housing was going to ease back slowly.  There was a view that - indeed from the Central Bank itself - that the banks were well capitalised and buffered against a slowdown and even a small fall in prices, and that was reflected in the commentary from other agencies.  So they're the things that you had at the time.</p></speech>

And through the two of those they generate a report, which we iterate a bit, back and forward, generally what they do is they take factual comments and clarifications and then that's presented to what's called the EDRC, the economic development and review committee, which is a committee in a huge room with all the 30-odd member states in it.  And you go through a tortuous day's interrogation during that process, you know; I was at the receiving end of it just once, so, it, it's really hard work.  There are three or four lead countries who take you through every line and so on, so forth, and it's open to all the member states including, I think, the IMF are represented and the European Commission are represented at it.  And at the end of the day - and incidentally, it also goes through lunch where you sit down with the ambassador and the key examiners, and you get asked questions all through that and don't get a bite to eat, it's a bit like this, actually.  </p><p>But it's a very prolonged period, and at the end it's down to the chairman to sum up.  And the chairman sums up, and it is only within the context of the summing-up of the chairman and the discussion during the course of the day, that you can get any amendments.

So what are the key issues arising from those reports that remain outstanding that affect the work of your Department, which you are still working on?</p></speech>

They're not really very specific about that; they're more about the things that need to be done in a broader context and a lot of that has been delivered.  I think that the spirit of virtually everything has been implemented.  We've sort of gone for a much more professional HR regime, we've a huge learning development capacity, we've brought in a much greater number of professional people, all of those things.  We have huge steps towards codification of our governance arrangements and clarity around that.  We look at the ways in which we communicate and so on, so, I'm fairly well satisfied that, you know, we've pretty much implemented them all.</p> <p>  But I go back to my statement: my view is that this is never a finished project.  You need to keep doing more and more and more and to the extent possible, benchmark what you're doing against best practice elsewhere.  And just recently, we launched a learning development strategy, which is hugely important in terms of keeping the skills levels and so on, at the appropriate level.  And we went up, we benchmarked that against industry and out of whatever number of entrants across 250 companies, we came in the top three.  So we know we're going in the right direction.  Previously we benchmarked tax policy practices in an Oxford study against what other countries did - I'm not sure that was ever completed by the academics doing it but we did participate.  And I think that's hugely important.  So it's, it's not a fixed exercise, and we keep, we need to do more and more, but it needs to keep relevant and you need to keep it effective and that changes over time.</p></speech>

I'm going to bring matters to a conclusion, Mr. Moran, and I invite any closing remarks that you want to make.  But maybe if I could put them in a context, that would create that space for you.  The troika have, and the surveillance programme that the country was in ended during your tenure.  However, there is still a major deficit, that this country in debt, that this country has to face into, and whilst a very structured programme may not now be involved in, there is still ongoing surveillance.  Am I correct in that regard?</p></speech>

And we have still a set of matrix that we now need to adhere to and the obvious outcome is if we didn't adhere to them, we could potentially be in a bailout programme again.</p><p>So, I suppose, it's a very simple question is, now that we're out of the programme, are we grown up enough ourselves to do it independently and what action are we taking to retain monitoring and warning controls to ensure that we do not become a country that enters a bailout programme once more? </p></speech>

It's ... I think rather than go back into a bailout, I think the chance ... the risk is that we end up with fines and penalties under the Stability and Growth Pact.  In fact, I don't see it.  But you're obviously right, we have a very significant sovereign debt overhang to manage, you know, and it's going to take us many, many years to get that down to something that is less troublesome.  Look where we came from, we came from a 20% deficit up to 121%, 122%, 123% at the peak in a very short space of time.  So, that's where the concentration has to be.  Yes, we'll have twice yearly surveillance from the funding partners for the foreseeable future until we've paid them back I think it's 75% of what we owe them.  And I have to say, you know, and this is my personal view, in terms of the maturity of our fiscal and economic debate, I'm not sure we're there yet.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy Gerald Nash, who has responsibility for business and employment, and his officials to the meeting.  Before we begin, I ask members to switch their phones to airplane safe or flight mode, depending on their device.  It is not enough to put them on silent mode as this will maintain the level of interference from the committee rooms and impacts negatively on the broadcast.  There are 29 amendments tabled to the Bill.  It is intended that we will consider this Bill until we conclude Committee Stage today.  Is this agreed?  Agreed.  We will proceed through the Bill and if members wish to suspend for 15 minutes at a later stage, we can do so.</p><p>I refer members to the list of amendments grouped for the purposes of debate, which has been circulated.

This amendment excludes section 23 from the collective citation for the Industrial Relations Acts.</p><p>Amendment No. 3 is a technical amendment which adds a definition to the Workplace Relations Act 2015 for the purpose of the Bill.  This is necessary as the Workplace Relations Act had not been enacted at the time of the publication of the Industrial Relations Bill 2015.</p><p>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment, No. 19, seeks to provide an enforcement role for trade union officials.  The amendment would also provide for the Minister to make regulations to provide for a right of access to trade union officials to the workplace and employees.  It also prohibits an employer from coercing workers to relinquish or abstain from a registered employment agreement, REA.  With the indulgence of the Chair I wish to go into some detail in response to the particular proposal.</p><p>Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n is absent, but he would probably know that I have seen a more general variation of the proposals and some alternative versions have been submitted to me by the trade union movement.  I have had an opportunity recently to reflect on them and to give them detailed consideration.  Proposals along those lines do not appear in the Bill, and I will not accept the amendments for the following reasons.</p><p>The first point is that the legislation is being introduced because its previous incarnation was struck down by the Supreme Court as unconstitutional on the grounds that the Oireachtas had transferred the law-making powers of the State from itself to external bodies.  In the McGowan case in 2013 the Supreme Court referred to &ldquo;private bodies&rdquo; being given the power to make laws.  This is a point of which we should always be mindful when considering this much-needed legislation.  I hope members will agree that inspection, policing and enforcement of laws is as much a core function of the State as the making of those laws in the first place, and to delegate that function to a private, external body, no matter what its standing and regardless of where we might stand personally on the principle raised by the issue under consideration, could be considered to be an abrogation of State responsibility.  Even if it could be done under the Constitution it seems to me to be wrong in principle on a number of points.  However, such provision would leave the legislation possibly open to legal challenge as regards an employer&rsquo;s constitutional right not to engage with or to recognise unions.  Whether one accepts that or not, this is a consideration that I as Minister am obliged to take very seriously.  Having worked with the relevant sectors and actors recently to restore the sectoral frameworks following the McGowan decision in 2013, I am absolutely loath to open the door and to actively invite such a challenge.</p><p>Members should be reminded as well that the powers of the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, inspectors are quite extensive and they include the power to use reasonable force to enter a place of work or a premises reasonably believed to be used in relation to the employment of persons or keeping of records.  NERA inspectors have powers to copy records, remove books, documents or records for a period the inspector reasonably considers necessary.  Inspectors can, under warrant of the District Court, enter a domestic dwelling with other inspectors or members of the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in pursuit of documents or records.  Those extensive powers are rightly and appropriately reserved for officers of the Minister, who are public servants of the State.  Ultimately, Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n&rsquo;s proposed amendments relate to his concerns about possible compliance and enforcement issues.</p><p>In respect of REAs, it is clearly a matter for the parties concerned whether they wish to include in the agreement provisions access to the workplace for trade union officials.  Sectoral employment orders, SEOs, will operate in sectors that might include large unionised workforces on the one hand and the smallest enterprises on the other, where employees are counted sometimes on the fingers of one hand and where the question of union membership in all likelihood does not arise.  The sector may also include workplaces run by employers who insist on exercising their right, regardless of whether we might like it, not to recognise or negotiate with unions.  The Bill and the SEOs made under it will have to apply and be enforced in a smooth and even-handed way across every workplace that would be a party to them or subject to their provisions.  SEOs may well be enforced in workplaces where there is not an REA and no collective bargaining.  It is not the function of an SEO to govern relations between unions and employers, and while there may well be room in a collective agreement for provisions to do with dispute resolution or compliance and monitoring or trade union access to workers, these provisions do not have a role in the context of an order which must be complied with and enforced in every workplace in the relevant sector.  I emphasise that SEOs are all about securing minimum sectoral rates of pay.  If an employer does not have trade union members in the workforce or if the employer does not recognise the union, the question then arises about how we can oblige the employer, by law, to provide what might be considered to be privileged access to union officials and under the remit of law enforcement.</p><p>My final concern relates to the sheer impracticality of the amendment as tabled.  The proposals submitted would themselves require a level of policing that would be unachievable, and it would be unreasonable to expect me to make and then enforce regulations about legitimate and illegitimate grounds for access, permissible conversations with staff who are not union members and the reasonable duration of such conversations, and then to construct a legal framework around that to allow for a worker&rsquo;s pay to be deducted where a trade union official overstays his or her welcome.  My question is who would stand there with a stopwatch conducting that particular exercise.  The measure is not practical at all.  That said, I agree there are legitimate and validly held concerns about the enforcement of sectoral employment orders and they have been raised with me by both sides of industry.  A recent submission I received from the Construction Industry Federation points to the importance of ensuring contractors, for example, can tender on a level playing field, and that is what the legislation is all about as well, from the perspective of employers in the construction sector in particular.  On the enforcement and compliance piece, in many ways this is not an issue that will go away, so I have to close my mind to any additional responses, whether they be administrative or legislative.  I will continue to examine any reasonable approach that may be taken to improve the enforcement of the law in the interests of workers and industry.</p><p>Amendment No. 20 provides for an entitlement for a union to represent an employee&rsquo;s interests under an REA or sectoral employment agreement, including matters involving discipline and grievance procedures.  In this regard, section 41(15) of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 already provides that a trade union official can accompany a worker in proceedings before an adjudication officer in relation to a complaint, while section 44(9) of the Act has the same provision in respect of proceedings before the Labour Court.  Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p><p>I have dealt with amendment No. 21.  Amendments Nos. 22 to 24, inclusive, provide for the enforcement provisions in relation to registered employment agreements and sectoral employment orders.  Amendment No. 22 introduces a new section 21 in the Bill which provides for the standard record-keeping requirements.  Employers to whom an REA or a sectoral employment order applies will be obliged to keep such records as are necessary to show whether they are compliant with the terms of the REA or SEO.  Any employer who fails to keep such records shall be guilty of an offence and liable on summary conviction to a class C fine.  In any proceedings before the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC, or the Labour Court, the onus of proving compliance with the record-keeping requirements is on the employer.</p><p>It has been necessary to await enactment of the Workplace Relations Act to include enforcement and compliance provisions in relation to REAs and SEOs under this Bill.  That was necessary to ensure enforcement and compliance measures are consistent with the measures in the Workplace Relations Act in relation to employment rights compliance and enforcement provisions generally.  The Workplace Relations Act has recently been signed into law and my colleague, the Minister, Deputy Bruton, has announced that the Workplace Relations Commission will commence operation on 1 October next.  The Act provides for procedures aimed at delivering a world-class workplace relations service which is simple to use, independent, effective, impartial and cost-effective.</p><p>Amendment No. 23 provides for the functions of an adjudication office of the WRC and the Labour Court in relation to section 19, which deals with the prohibition on penalisation by an employer of a worker for invoking any right or making a complaint in relation to provisions dealing with SEOs, breaches of an REA, and breaches of an SEO.  That is an important point to make.  If it is determined that a complaint considered under section 41 of the Workplace Relations Act in relation to the provisions of this Act was well-founded, an adjudication officer shall do one or more of the following: require the employer to comply with the provision in respect of which the complaint relates and, for that purpose, require the employer to take a specified course of action, or require the employer to pay to the worker compensation of such amount as the adjudication officer considers just and equitable having regard to all the circumstances, but not exceeding 104 weeks&rsquo; remuneration.</p><p>A decision of the court under section 44 of the Workplace Relations Act, on appeal from a decision of an adjudication officer, shall affirm, vary or set aside the decision of the adjudication officer.</p><p> Amendment No. 24 inserts a new section 23 which provides for the necessary amendment to the Workplace Relations Act of 2015 to accommodate the enforcement requirements in respect of registered employment agreements, REAs, and sectoral employment orders, SEOs.  These include the addition of  provisions relating to complaints concerning victimisation under section 19 of the Bill and breaches of REAs to the list of enactment set down in Part 1 of Schedule 5 of the Workplace Relations Act; and the addition of provisions relating to complaints for breaches of a sectoral employment order to the list in Part 2 of Schedule 5.</p><p> In addition, new inspection powers given to the National Employment Rights Authority, NERA, under the Workplace Relations Act 2015 will be extended to the provisions of Part 2 of this Bill, that is, the REAs and the SEOs section.  In this context, section 27 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015 restates and consolidates all of the functions and powers of NERA inspectors in one location, having regard to current best practice and developments in case law.  The powers of inspectors are supported by criminal sanctions provided to ensure that inspectors can carry out their duties without hindrance or obstruction and it will be an offence to obstruct, mislead or provide false information or documents to an inspector or to fail to follow a lawful requirement of an inspector.</p><p> Amendments proposed to Schedule 6 of the Workplace Act 2015 provide the necessary redress provisions on decisions of adjudication officers of the Workplace Relations Commission and decisions of the Labour Court.</p><p> Amendment No. 29 is a technical amendment to the Long Title of the Bill to insert a reference to amending the Workplace Relations Act 2015, as the new section 23 of the Bill provides for amendments to the Workplace Relations Act 2015.</p></speech>

It has been one of the massive difficulties until now, even during the period of this Government.  All the best legislation in the world is not worth a penny candle if it is not enforced and if we do not have compliance from employers.</p> <p>  In the natural scheme of things, in the operation of a workplace, there are unions to make sure workers' rights are upheld.  My amendments, Nos. 19 to 21, inclusive, simply seek to allow that natural representation to exist.  The amendments provide for access to the workplace for designated union officials.  They also provide for a right of employees to be represented by a trade union official in their place of work and to ensure compliance by employers.  Prior to the McGowan judgment, these entitlements were part and parcel of the REA framework.  As such, the amendments are not a revolutionary addition at all.  It is just an effort to ensure that the natural relationship between worker, union and employer exists and that we have compliance.</p> <p>  If we do not have compliance, our own experience as public representatives tells us that there is a breakdown in the relationship between employer and employee; and massive industrial relations problems develop, which is not good for employers, for completion of contracts or for the employee who has to stand on a picket line to enforce his or her rights.  I appeal for the Minister of State to accept these very logical amendments, Nos. 19 to 21, inclusive.</p></speech>

We need to acknowledge that there has been a lacuna over the last few years, since the McGowan judgment.  We have seen the effects of that, particularly in one industry which has concerned us all.  It may very well have been the case that access for trade union officials was provided under certain REAs under the previous regime.  There is absolutely nothing preventing both parties, subject to the terms of a registered employment agreement, from  making such an arrangement.</p> <p>  Enforcement and compliance concern us all.  We have a State agency, the National Employment Rights Agency, which has in many ways enhanced rights to police, enforce and inspect in order to ensure compliance on the SEO side, which is as it should be.  As I said in my earlier contribution, it is up to the State, the Oireachtas and the Executive to make laws.  It is then a matter for the responsible State agencies to enforce those laws and ensure compliance.  I will be keeping a very close eye on the performance of our agencies in terms of the compliance and enforcement sides of the sectoral employment order piece.  It is important that we reflect on these issues.</p> <p>  Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n will be only too familiar with the reasons the Supreme Court struck down the former REA system, which had been in place for many years.  We will not go into all of those complex arrangements now.  As I said earlier, what I do not want is to provide any space or invite an opening for any potential challenge to this critical legislation.  As Minister of State, I have a responsibility to make sure the legislation is as robust as it can possibly be and to take all of the advice available to me to ensure that is the case.</p> <p>  Earlier in my contribution, I informed the committee that I would not be accepting that amendment but I will be keeping an extremely close eye on the enforcement aspects of this matter.  It is critical for employers' rights and for the performance of certain industries which may very well be subject to the SEOs that it happens.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2416" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1080" speakername="Peadar T&oacute;ib&iacute;n" time="13:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BUS2015061800002#C00400"><p>In good employment law, there should be a natural equilibrium which allows for workers and employers to resolve their differences in an efficient, fair and open manner.  That negates the necessity for massive State machinery to be called in to fix the problems.  Often if problems are not nipped in the bud when they arise, they become very difficult, as people become entrenched and the courts are used.</p> <p>  We do not have that natural equilibrium at the moment.  There is chaos, literally, in some sectors at the moment, the construction industry being one such sector.  We have yet to see the proof of the functioning of the new arrangements but, to date, NERA and other organisations have had massive difficulty and time delays with enforcement.  We have seen what should have been small difficulties fester and become big problems.</p> <p>  One of my worries would be that if, for example, a trade union official came onto a construction site and had a conversation for 15 minutes with a staff member, the boss could say he was not working for that time and dock his wages by 15 minutes for that meeting.  Separating out the natural equilibrium of oversight that trade unions should have will only going to create more problems down the road.  I cannot overstate the importance of enforcement and compliance to the well-being of workers.  Anybody who has listened to any trade unions in their discussions will say that the lack of these elements causes the most difficulty for workers.  </p> <p>  If the Minister of State is not minded to accept these amendments, does he have an alternative wording that could bring about that level of natural oversight with which trade unions should be empowered?</p></speech>

In recent years there has been a gap and exploitation has occurred.  That is my view and I have said it publicly before and will say it again.  The reintroduction of a system such as this can and will promote harmonious industrial relations.  It has more than the potential to do so.  If anybody is concerned about mechanisms to resolve differences between employees and employers, the legislation also provides a very strong dispute resolution mechanism.  We should be mindful of it and people should point to it when they are discussing the legislation.  They should consider all of the measures in the legislation in their entirety, including the protections provided for employees and how SEOs will be policed and enforced under the law.</p> <p>  Many myths have developed about how the old REA system operated.  It was the case in many REAs that trade union officials had the name of an access officer with a particular company who would discuss issues as they arose.  There was never any right of access to employees on site.  Matters worked differently in some respects and sometimes there were informal arrangements, which was fine.  It is up to trade unions to organise workers in particular sectors to ensure density is increased and I would be very supportive of this.  It is the role of trade unions to represent their workers and work with the Government to ensure we have strong enforcement and compliance measures.  They have done it and have been doing it for a long time during the years.  In recent months they have been doing it with me and my colleagues to ensure we have strong legislation to protect the interests of working people.  It is up to the State agencies, empowered by Parliament, to enforce the law and ensure those subject to the provisions of SEOs pay the rate and comply in every aspect.</p></speech>

While State agencies have worked on many occasions, they have also failed employees on many occasions.  A solution would be to try to fix matters before they reached the State agencies.  There will not be a meeting of minds on this issue.  However, I welcome the thrust of the legislation and hope it is enacted as soon as possible.  I also welcome amendment No. 22 in the name of the Minister.  If we did not have it, compliance would be impossible.  The legislation includes many positive elements.</p></speech>

It seeks to specify that an employer may subsequently apply to a court to become party to an agreement in its application to any worker or workers to whom it applies.  Representatives of ICTU and the TEEU have called for the procedure to allow an employer who was not party to an REA when it was originally registered to subsequently sign up to it.  It would not alter the REA in any way but would increase the number of people working in a sector who would enjoy the same level of support.</p></speech>

The variation provisions under that section will allow for an application by a new employer to become a party to an existing REA, subject to one of the existing parties to the agreement making the application to the courts.  An existing party would have to make the application to the court.</p></speech>

In this regard, the trade union would have advance notice of the Labour Court&rsquo;s consideration of the issue.  Moreover, it is not considered appropriate to allow an REA to remain in place for three months after it has been determined by the Labour Court that a trade union is no longer substantially representative of the workers involved.</p> <p>  It is also important to remember that a cancellation of the registration of an employment agreement does not affect an individual worker&rsquo;s entitlement to the terms of an REA under his or her personal contract of employment, which can only be changed by agreement between the worker and employer.  Accordingly, I cannot accept this amendment.</p></speech>

There is a balance to be struck between the employer and employee and it is important to be fair to both sides.  On many occasions, however, the legislation is skewed in favour of the employer.  A three-month notice to a worker of a change in the climate in which that worker works is decent practice.  If the union cannot come up with the goods on why that decision is incorrect, the decision is enforced.  That is a rebalancing in favour of the employee&rsquo;s needs and rights.</p></speech>

That would pose all kinds of legal questions.</p></speech>

Everybody would welcome that.  These terms and conditions are ordinarily included in enactments, collective agreements or other pay arrangements that apply generally in respect of employees or any class of employees.

Section 12 of the Bill provides for a definition of &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; for the purposes of a Labour Court recommendation for the terms of an SEO.  The definition is based on the definition of &ldquo;remuneration&rdquo; included in the Protection of Employment (Temporary Agency Worker) Act 2012.  That definition includes basic pay and a list of other elements in excess of basic pay that may be included as part of the court&rsquo;s recommendation for a rate of remuneration for a particular sector.  In this context, I do not consider subsistence, which is normally paid to workers to cover out-of-pocket expenses incurred for the purposes of carrying out their duties, as part of a person&rsquo;s pay.  Moreover, subsistence payments are normally treated differently for tax purposes by the Revenue Commissioners.  Accordingly, I do not propose to include it as part of the definition of remuneration and I cannot accept this amendment.</p></speech>

Section 15 sets out the matters a court shall take into account when it makes a recommendation.  These include levels of employment and unemployment and competitiveness in the particular economic sector.  Although they are intended to assist the court in finding a balance between employers' and employees' claims, they are described through the prism of an employer's perspective.  As legislators we should also take account of other issues, including the high percentage of workers on low pay in this State.  My amendment would require the court to have regard to workers earning two-thirds or less than the median income, which is the definition of low pay, and the pervasiveness of part-time or short-time contracts.  Given that the Minister of State has committed to dealing with the issue of low pay, it is strange that the issue is not included in this Bill.</p></speech>

The question of low pay and decent work should be addressed in its totality.  Section 15 of the Bill sets out a comprehensive and challenging set of factors that the Labour Court must take into account when making a recommendation to the Minister in respect of a sectoral employment order.  Amendment No. 10 would add two further factors that the court would be required to take into account.  However, adding factors to the already wide-ranging list set out in section 15 could result in the court finding it difficult to undertake the level of analysis that would be required.  I had given consideration to the factors that might be taken into account when determining an SEO and I do not consider it necessary to refer specifically to median earnings or proportions above or below particular proportions of median earnings.</p> <p>  The question of part-time and short-hour contracts is being examined as part of the comprehensive study that I have commissioned into these issues.  I expect to receive the findings of that study in the coming period and where the evidence supports the need to change laws or regulations in this area, I will make recommendations to the Government in that regard.  As we know from the McGowan judgment, the John Grace Fried Chicken case and other court cases, the more we put into legislation of this nature, the more we expose it to challenge.  We need to take a careful approach to these matters.  I think the Bill strikes a sufficient balance in respect of the factors that a court needs to take into account.  We need to be conscious of the judgments of the courts on the REA and JLC structures.  I am satisfied that the factors that the court will be obliged to take into account are robust and sufficiently balanced.</p></speech>

We should proof everything we do against low pay.  The Department should not produce anything that is not equality-proofed in respect of pay and wages.  If we do not include these factors, the court will be directed by the legislation to disregard the prevalence of low pay and precarious work.  The level of unemployment and competitiveness will be the only factors taken into account.  The Minister of State has an opportunity to change this and I suggest he apply the rule of thumb of eradicating low pay in all the legislation for which he is responsible.</p></speech>

That is not something anyone would be prepared to stand over.  The Bill sets out a robust range of factors to ensure standards are improved in the industries to which SEOs apply and that rates of pay are well in excess of minimum wage.  We should also be mindful of the other measures I have introduced or am in the process of introducing, which will have a transformative effect for people who are on low pay.</p><p>I caution against isolating one particular piece of legislation and saying that it does not do enough to protect people on low pay.  I have spoken about this to people from the TUC in the UK.  They would love to have sectoral employment orders.  They would really like to have systems like this where we can improve the pay, terms and conditions of people in exposed and vulnerable industries.  We are doing that.  Unlike some other countries across the world during the great recession, we have not hollowed out our employment rights legislation.  In fact, we have enhanced it.  We are introducing new frameworks and wage setting mechanisms to protect people in vulnerable industries.  This is considered to be a positive thing.  I am satisfied that the range of factors we will ask the Labour Court to take into account enshrined in legislation are sufficiently strong to achieve the objectives of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n, which I share.</p></speech>

This practice involves a systematic surveillance of trade unionists who are simply active within the legal parameters of that country.  They have been targeted and victimised by employers and companies which are employed simply to identify who the trade unionists are and give their details to employers to make sure they are not employed.  If a subcontractor is working in a particular area and one of these trade unionists is involved, the subcontractor is not to be employed.  It is incredible how organised and commercial its development in Great Britain has been.  It has led to disasters for people.  It has led to unemployment, violence and horrific hardship for families and communities.  </p><p>The Minister of State might feel that we have not had many examples of it here but we know that some of the companies that have been named and shamed in Great Britain operate in Ireland and have previously won State contracts.  Examples include Balfour Beatty, BAM and Carillion.  Over 30 of these companies work in the State at the moment.  My worry is that if we do not tackle this and use an opportunity to prevent it happening, friends and family who are trade unionists and are simply seeking to ensure that workers have decent pay and conditions could be blacklisted and prevented from taking up decent work in the future.  This section relates to the prohibition on penalisation of a worker by an employer.  The section deals with many different issues so this is why I would like to include blacklisting in it.  </p><p>Amendment No. 14 relates to the same issue, trade unions and trade union activity.  I do not fully understand amendment No. 17.  In respect of amendment No. 18, the Minister of State has obviously included intimidation and coercion in this section.  Intimidation and coercion are, obviously, worthy issues to focus on but I would include harassment because it can be a more low-level, insidious and difficult issue with which a worker must deal.  I was going to include haranguing but that might mean that politicians would be able to use that as a defence in future.  </p></speech>

The purpose of amendment No. 14 is to add trade union membership or activity to the activities in respect of which an employer may not penalise a worker to whom an SEO applies.</p> <p>  A number of protections have been in place for some time for workers who consider that they have been subject to victimisation in the workplace.  Any worker who find themselves subject to victimisation already has the opportunity to take a case under the Industrial Relations Acts.  The 2004 code of practice on victimisation provides that where there is a dispute in an employment where collective bargaining fails to take place and where negotiating agreements are not in place, no person should be victimised or suffer any disadvantage as a consequence of their legitimate actions or affiliations arising from that dispute.  Procedure for addressing complaints of victimisation is set out in the Industrial Relations (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2004 and these protections will be enhanced in the context of provisions in Part 3 of this Bill relating to the Government's commitment on collective bargaining.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendments Nos. 13 and 14.</p> <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 15 is to change the reference to Minister in section 19(1)(b) of the Bill to the Workplace Relations Commission.  This is required following the enactment of the Workplace Relations Commission Act 2015, which provides that complaints will in future be made to the commission rather than to the Minister.  </p> <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 16 is to specify that proceedings relating to a complaint of victimisation in this section are now provided under the enforcement provision contained in Part 4 of the Workplace Relations Act 2015.  </p> <p>  I want to flag that I will seek to further amend amendment No. 17.  We want to correct an incorrect reference there to the Workplace Relations Act and to propose a new subsection and I will address this on Report Stage.  </p> <p>  The purpose of amendment No. 18 is to include harassment as part of the list of victimisation measures to be covered by the term "penalisation".  Section 19(4) of the Bill provides an non-exhaustive list of acts or omissions by an employer that would constitute penalisation for the purpose of this Bill, the main concern being that they affect a worker to his or her detriment with regard to any terms or conditions of his or her employment.  In this context, harassment would clearly come within the scope of this overarching definition.  That being the case, I do not consider it necessary to include a specific reference to it in the Bill.  Accordingly, I cannot accept amendment No. 18.</p></speech>

It is a serious threat to workers and has been evident in other countries.  It is carried out in a very professional and focused manner.  Rather than us sitting here in six months or, God willing, two years' time and discussing the fact that this has taken hold, is a crisis and is in the media and being debated during Leaders' Questions, would it not be better to be comprehensive in the way we deal with the rights of workers in this scenario and make sure that blacklisting is not allowed to become prominent within the Irish system?</p><p>Harassment is a problem.  It could easily be said that many of these issues could logically be covered by "penalisation", but they have purposely been identified individually to provide a clear definition for those who will have to make judgments on them in the future.  I suppose that is why we are looking to have them included in the Bill.</p></speech>

I would guard against addressing the issue of blacklisting in the context of this Bill or indeed in any piecemeal fashion.  We will all agree that blacklisting is a disgraceful practice.  I discussed this matter with leading officials in the British GMB union when I opened their annual conference in Dublin a couple of weeks ago.  They spoke with some experience because this is a live issue in the UK.  I do not have any evidence to suggest it is a widespread practice in this country at present.  If such evidence is identified, I will deal with the matter comprehensively and quickly.  It would be incumbent on me to do so.  I assure Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n that if these practices emerge in this country, they will be addressed forthwith.</p></speech>

However, the voluntary nature of union recognition is probably not where the Minister and I want to go on this issue in the long run.  I know there are constitutional issues, etc., that may preclude us from going down this route.  It is important that we seek compliance with the judgments of the European Court of Human Rights on this matter.  We should not lose sight of that objective.</p></speech>

An important definition of "collective bargaining" is provided for in this section of the Bill.  The courts found flaws with the absence of such a definition in the past.  This matter is fundamental to this whole discussion.  The purpose of Deputy T&oacute;ib&iacute;n's amendment is to remove the reference to the term "voluntary" from the proposed definition of "collective bargaining" in section 23 of the Bill.  In developing legislative proposals on collective bargaining, the Government has been keen to respect the positions of stakeholders and develop proposals that sustain what has traditionally been described as the "voluntary" system in this country.  Crucially, we also need to make sure workers have confidence in the system.  In the absence of collective bargaining, effective systems should be available to workers to make sure discussions on issues like remuneration and terms and conditions can be determined by the Labour Court in the context of a set of legal arrangements like this.  Those considerations should be made on the basis of comparisons with similar companies.  It should be possible for recommendations to be secured by way of Circuit Court order if necessary.</p><p>Worker and employer representatives have played a key role in working with Government to develop clear and workable frameworks in this area in the spirit of real social dialogue and social partnership.  It is in this context that the definition of &quot;collective bargaining&quot;, as provided in section 23, has arisen.  It was the subject of detailed discussion involving me, my Department officials and others as well as employer and worker representatives to reach this point.  It has been agreed with stakeholder interests.  More fundamentally, the definition will deliver for our economy, working people and employers.<br/><br/>It is important to remember that this position is consistent with the policies of successive Governments down the decades.  It takes on board a great deal of the institutional learning that has been acquired over generations through the prism of the voluntary system of industrial relations, which is premised upon the principles of freedom of association and freedom of contract.  This system has not been without difficulty but, by and large, it has served the country, the economy and society well.<br/><br/>It is worth noting that the principle of volunteerism is recognised at international level.  Article 4 of the International Labour Organization, ILO, Convention on the Right to Organise and Collective Bargaining, CO98, reads:</p><blockquote>Measures appropriate to national conditions shall be taken, where necessary, to encourage and promote the full development and utilisation of machinery for voluntary negotiation between employers or employers' organisations and workers' organisations, with a view to the regulation of terms and conditions of employment by means of collective agreements.</blockquote><p>Accordingly, I cannot accept the amendment.</p></speech>

The same logic applies to a worker who is seeking to have a trade union official represent him or her in a workplace dispute, as the individual may not be <i>au fait</i>with the landscape as regards his or her rights.  My amendment makes representation mandatory in that regard.  </p><p>It is a question of balancing the rights of employers and employees.  When both are on an even footing, there is the most respect between them.  It is where groups are on uneven footing that there are the most industrial relations battles.

He will talk to us about the EU country-specific recommendations 2015 for Ireland.  He will be with us for about 25 minutes and at approximately 2 p.m. the Minister of State at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Dara Murphy, will attend to tell us about the Government's planned responses to the country specific recommendations.  We will also ask him about the migration crisis in the Mediterranean and for his views on what is happening in Greece.</p><p>I welcome Mr. Coffey.  As many will be aware, he has been before the committee on a number of occasions to help us on a range of economic matters concerning Ireland and the European Union.

In terms of examining the issue of the country-specific recommendations, I will make some comments on where they come from and then focus briefly on some of the particulars with regard to Ireland before dealing with issues the members might want to raise.</p> <p>  Following Ireland's exit from the EU-IMF programme we have become more familiar with what is termed the EU semester.  One criticism that might have been levied at the EU in the run up to the crisis, and particularly during the crisis, was that certain parties took their eye off the ball in regard to imbalances and risks that had built up in certain member states.  It appears now that the EU has responded in the sense of overkill because as I am sure this committee is aware, a huge range of documents are now produced by the EU on an annual basis that examine issues across the entire spectrum of the economy for each of the 28 members.  It starts in November with the annual growth survey, moves on to an alert mechanism report, followed by a macro-economic imbalance report and then the Commission staff working document that finally leads to the Commission's country-specific recommendations that were published a fortnight ago.  It is a barrage of material and, in a sense, the EU has gone a bit too far because I do not know if anyone reads it in detail any more.  There is simply too much material and by the time one gets to the detail, much of it has been lost in the noise, so to speak.  We have gone from a position where the EU as a whole did not look at what was happening in individual countries and now it is looking at it in too great detail when perhaps it should focus on particular issues.</p> <p>  It does seem to be learning from that.  Even though it is our second year in the process it has been going since 2011.  If we look at Ireland, in the first year we got seven country-specific recommendations across a broad range of areas.  This year we get four.  The four are part of the set of seven so they have carried through but they have dropped three, and that is not simply because we have met them.  The three that have been dropped relate to active labour market policies, issues relating to performance small and medium business financing, and issues relating to the costs of legal services in Ireland.  In its report the Commission states that we have made some progress on the first two of those but limited or little progress on the last one regarding legal costs.  </p> <p>  Those country-specific recommendations are not included this year.  This year, we are down to four.  One that appears regularly in regard to Ireland is looking at the public deficit.  There is then the issue of the work intensity of households, and Ireland's standing as having a very high propensity of very low work intensity households.  There are many households in which nobody is working.  There are then issues relating to apparently high health care costs in Ireland, particularly in the area of pharmaceuticals, and also the way we fund our hospitals via block grant rather than through activity-based funding.  Finally, there is the issue of addressing the carryover from last year in regard to mortgage arrears.</p> <p>  One issue with the country-specific recommendations is that, by and large, they are just concerns.  Reading through them one can see they contain very few concrete proposals.  Essentially, the Commission is highlighting these as problems and it leaves it up to the individual members to solve them.  It identifies the problems and asks them to address them.</p> <p>  The only one that has a numerical target is the deficit where it requires a reduction in the structural deficit of 0.6 percentage points of GDP.  In terms of our own documents - not only do we have a barrage of documents from the EU but we have Ireland's stability programme update, SPU, and our national reform programme update - if members read the stability programme update, as our fiscal council has done, they will see that the intention is that we will not meet that structural deficit reduction target in 2016 whereas the EU rules require us to reduce it by 0.6% of GDP.  If members read the current targets in place they will see that the SPU published by the Department of Finance states that the intention next year is to reduce it by 0.3%, which is half the required target.  However, when it comes to work intensity, health costs and mortgage arrears, no numerical targets are mentioned; they just list these as problems.  The issues in regard to solving them are left at national level and the EU next year will say whether much, some or limited progress has been in regard to those targets.</p> <p>  Moving away from the deficit one, issues regarding very low work intensity have been highlighted for Ireland for a number of years.  It comes from the SILC, survey of income and living conditions.  In that survey, 23% of people are said to live in households with very low work intensity, essentially where there is no work taking place.  That is a complete outlier in EU terms.  It is the highest in the EU.  The EU average is approximately 10% of people living in households with very low work intensity; we have 23%.</p> <p>  There are some doubts about the figures, and concerns have been raised that there may have been some measurement issues in that we are such an extreme outlier something else must have been going on.  Figures from the quarterly national household survey put the number at 17%, which is the second highest in the EU.  The Central Statistics Office, CSO, is examining these two figures and trying to decide what is the actual figure.  Whatever the figure is, Ireland is quite high in this respect.  </p> <p>  We must examine the reason our figure is so high.  Is it something we need to fix, a structural problem or simply a demographic problem?  One issue that stands out in the case of Ireland is the number of lone-parent households.  The 2011 Census of Population showed there were approximately 1.7 million households in Ireland and of that number, 180,000 were lone-parent households.  More than 10% of households in Ireland are headed by lone parents, which compares to approximately 5% across the EU.  We have far more high-risk households, and for lone parents it is much more difficult to enter into employment given child care costs, issues relating to the supports available, and the possible loss of welfare benefits.  One reason low-work intensity is higher can come down to demographics but do we want to change that?  Do we want to force single parents into the workforce or are we happy to have them at home rearing their children?  While the EU might raise this issue as a concern and for us to reduce the number, it is up to us to decide whether it is priority.</p> <p>  Regarding mortgage arrears, there is more probably more emphasis here to do something about that.  The EU states that we should have a system in place that sets out what we are trying to do in this area, what represents a sustainable solution, how long should such provisions should last, and what can happen to people who cannot reach a sustainable solution.  We still have a hodgepodge of solutions, including interest-only payments, arrears capitalisation, hybrid split mortgage or the possibility of participating in a  mortgage-to-rent scheme, and there are very few repossessions taking place.  The EU would like to see something happening in terms of defining what represents a sustainable solution.  It states we should do this but that no progress has been made on it.</p> <p>  On the health area, the EU notes that we seem to have relatively high health care expenditure.  Given that we have a relatively young population, our health care expenditure is towards the highest in the EU.  It also has issues with the way we fund hospitals.  We generally give them a block grant in that they are allocated their money for the year and they use that for their needs.  That practice tends to disadvantage the more effective hospitals where more procedures are carried out.  They will spend more money and by October or November they tend to run out of money, whereas hospitals in which fewer procedures are carried out can better balance and manage their block grants throughout the year.  The EU is asking us why we do not fund hospitals on an activity-based system, whereby if a hospital does more in terms of providing more health care, it will get more funding.  There is a change to move away from the block grant system to more activity-based systems.</p> <p>  There are also the long-running concerns about how much we spend on pharmaceuticals in Ireland.  The prices for them appear to be higher here.  We appear to have a greater level of expenditure.  It is unclear why that is the case, whether it has to do with agreements relating to the large presence of multinationals in the pharmaceutical sector here or that we are such a small market we cannot get the price lower.  It is an issue that has been raised time and again, with little of no progress has been made on it.  Those are my brief comments on the process and some of the specifics in regard to Ireland.</p></speech>

It might be an idea for our committee to write to the other relevant committees that are referenced by the country-specific recommendations, CSRs, to bring to their attention the recommendations.  I am not sure if the health committee, for example, debates the CSRs or gets a chance to question the Minister as to whether changes are being made.  We might make a recommendation on foot of this discussion to write to the clerks of the relevant committees and ask them to table items for their agendas.  We have a number of speakers offering, the first of whom is Deputy Bernard Durkan.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2597" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061800002#B00400"><p>I apologise as I will have to leave the meeting fairly soon to attend another meeting but I will return after that.  I welcome our guest speaker.  He is right that there is always a danger that we would go from one extreme to the other, in other words, from having virtually no regulation to over-regulation.  However, in our economic situation which is recovering I would warn that we could find ourselves in the same position once again whereby there would be a tendency to overlook the necessity for regulation and find ourselves in a difficult situation down the road.</p> <p>  I particularly draw attention to the period prior to the introduction of the European semester whereby there was a five- or seven-year period without adequate monitoring of the trends that were beginning to emerge.  That was a big fault at the time, and I made this criticism previously.  We waited until the end of the term before action was taken and it was then too late.</p><p>I consider the semester system to be much better in that it gives an opportunity for an annual review of progress.  It is not rocket science to determine which way the economies of European Union member states are going.</p><p> We need to get more recognition for our own efforts in this country and for the efforts of the people of this country.  For instance, we came from a really serious annual budget deficit of 15% or 17%.  We reached a peak total debt of 125% of GDP, which has come down dramatically, and the budget deficit is ahead of projections.  Our total indebtedness is coming down rapidly.  There is a need for a recognition of the efforts made by those in this country by the rest of the European Union, because some countries have made those efforts while some have not, to my mind.  As we are intrinsically interlinked with each other in our fortunes and our futures, economically, socially and politically, it is important that we encourage all other countries to follow what appears to be best practice in order to achieve the result that is required as quickly as possible.</p><p> My final point is about the workforce.  I do not think lone parents or parents should be forced into the workforce.  There should be a provision whereby one person in the household should at least have an opportunity to be at work, and the second person should also have such an opportunity if possible.  The most important factor is that the second person should not be forced into the workforce by virtue of high mortgage repayments, which means that all he or she is doing is working for the repayment of the mortgage, perhaps to the detriment of his or her health. </p><p> I do not accept the notion that lone parents are reluctant to go to work.  I have never had any experience of that.  Like other colleagues, I have dealt with thousands of lone parents over the years, and I have never once seen a situation in which there was a reluctance to go to work.  On the contrary, there was every indication that lone parents wished to go to work at the earliest possible opportunity.  As soon as this was possible, either by means of child care or when their children were at school, they went into the workplace very quickly for reasons of their own satisfaction.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2600" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1030" speakername="Eric Byrne" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061800002#C00300"><p>I think I am the victim of Deputy Durkan's excesses.  I thank Mr. Coffey for his rapid-fire and impressive presentation.  For the life of me I do not know why the legal services segment has been dropped and we are reduced to four.  I am very happy that we are quite capable of dealing with the four that are highlighted.  In fact, why would one want to drop the legal services issue in favour of a solution for the restructuring of the majority of mortgages in arrears?  We have been doing that consistently.  However, what we have not been doing is reducing the bloody cost of legal services.  Mr. Coffey is an expert in the field and he may be able to tell me what kind of juggling is going on that has resulted in the reduction in the list from the original seven items to these four.</p><p>I absolutely agree with the concept that nobody should be confined to welfare or have to live a life on welfare.  It is repugnant to my feelings about citizenship and humanity.  The State should encourage everybody.  Work needs to be valuable and the rewards for going to work need to be greater than those of being on welfare.  However, the issue of the lone parent allowance has been raised.  I do not know whether Mr. Coffey advocated it, or where this thinking originated.  It may have come from Europe.  We want to remove people out of poverty.  However, in so far as this policy of adjusting the lone parent allowance is concerned, of the 30,000 locked into that lone parent allowance system, the vast majority of them will be happy with the adjustments and will gain from them.  However, there is a core of 4,000, mainly women, who will potentially lose and suffer from the adjustments.  While we are all in favour of getting people back to work and facilitating them - the majority of lone parents on this allowance, with the adjustments, are likely to earn quite substantially more than their allowance - why do we need a system that is structured in such a way that 4,000 people who are lone parents will suffer?  If Europe and the Irish Government agree and we all agree that we want to take people out of poverty traps - it is well documented that lone parents and their children are the most vulnerable to poverty - then why would the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and <i>The Irish Times</i>be arguing against the adjustments that are taking place?</p><p>In conclusion, I have two brief questions.  Is Mr. Coffey arguing that our Government, which has done a phenomenal job in creating jobs and in turning the country around, would be overstepping the mark in the next budget?  Is Mr. Coffey arguing that we should be putting the windfall of the success of economic growth into paying off our debts?  We would argue that the economy is lively enough to be able to spread some of the benefits to a wider audience.  I will conclude on that point.  Mr. Coffey's presentation is very interesting.  I apologise that we are under pressure of time, as this topic merits a more in-depth debate.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2601" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1076" speakername="Dominic Hannigan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061800002#C00400"><p>On that point, Mr. Coffey will be aware that after the Second World War the United States reduced its debt-to-GDP ratio not by paying off debt but by increasing GDP.  In 1991 Ireland had a debt to GDP ratio of 90%, and that went down to 35% a decade later, not because we were paying it off at a rapid rate but because we were growing at a rapid rate.  I would be interested in Mr. Coffey's view as to whether we should rely on the current large growth rate of 3% to 4% per annum to reduce the debt-to-GDP ratio or we should be paying down the debt.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2602" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061800002#C00500"><p>I thank Mr. Coffey for his presentation.  He referred in his presentation to the cost of pharmaceutical products, which increased from &euro;570 million a year in 2000 to &euro;2 billion by 2010, a huge increase.  No checks and balances seem to have been applied.  Legislation on the use of generic drugs has been introduced and we are moving closer to the same usage ratio as in the UK.  The consumer price index compares the prices of a basket of products with prices in nine other countries.  Has enough been done in this regard?  Is further work required?</p> <p>  I refer to the issue of health care costs. The health budget is approximately &euro;13.2 billion, and about &euro;3.26 billion is paid out to 2,600 organisations, including hospitals, those caring for people with disabilities and very small organisations.  Are we getting value for money for that &euro;3.26 billion, which is more than 25% of the budget in real terms?  Is there a need for a more co-ordinated approach to the amalgamation of services in order to be more cost-effective?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2603" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus Coffey" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061800002#C00600"><p>I thank the members for those comments.  I refer to Deputy Byrne's comments about the choices made in cutting the list from seven to four.  No indication was given as to why those three items were dropped.  Legal services was the matter on which the judges of the European Commission had made the least progress in 2014, yet that was the one they dropped.  Legal services in Ireland cost up to &euro;2 billion per annum.  Costs in the Irish legal system are quite extensive when one considers the cost of solicitors, barristers and court cases.  The costs appear to be relatively high.  I agree that there could be greater benefits for the broader economy if that system were reformed.  On the issue of mortgage arrears, sufficient progress has not been achieved, but some progress has been made and at least we see the problem and people want to solve it.  In contrast, with the legal costs issue, there are large vested interests - those who benefit from these high costs - and it is unclear why this item was dropped.</p><p> On the question of what we should do with the benefits of economic growth and whether the extra money resulting should be used to pay off debt, as the Chair has mentioned, we are unlikely to pay down debt.  It must be remembered that we are still running a deficit.  We are experiencing economic growth.  If we continue to spend more and cut taxes, it will not reduce our debt; it will increase it.  We are just deciding to borrow more.  The deficit this year will still be more than &euro;5 billion, and even by next year, according to the current projections, it will not be much below that.  The issue is not necessarily about reducing the debt.  I do not think we will repay it.  We will use growth to reduce the debt ratio.  The issue is how to stop borrowing money.  Our deficit opened up in 2008 and the current projections are that it will not be closed until 2019.  That is a 12-year span in which we have borrowed money to run the country on a year-to-year basis.  Our objective should be to reduce the debt.  In the midst of the crisis, there were a lot of references to counter-cyclical policy.  When the crash came the one thing the Government should have done was to spend more money and reduce taxes.  Now we are going through a growth phase in which the economy is expanding.  If we are to stick by the logic of counter-cyclical policy, this is when the Government should step back.  We do not need to undermine the tax base or increase Government expenditure excessively.  Changes should be made so that if wages are rising and inflation is present we should adjust income tax.  If there is inflation, one should adjust welfare payments and public sector pay, but not excessively.  I would argue that we should use the benefits of the growth to reduce the deficit that exists rather than reducing the debt.  That will happen naturally.  I think we should stop borrowing money.</p><p> The lone parent allowance is a complex issue, and when one makes changes there will always be losers.  The allowance is a payment based on status.  We have lots of payment based on status &ndash; disability, illness, and payments for those who are widowed, among others - but the lone parent allowance is a bit different in the sense that it is one of the few statuses that to a certain extent is under the control of the individual.  One does not make one's self widowed, sick or disabled.  There are issues in terms of the selection of people into the payment.  Clearly, there will be losers in the change in terms of moving people across to work-related payments, but the overall system needs to be reformed, not just tinkering around the edges in terms of eligibility.  I am in favour of payments for everybody and I feel that we should scrap the broad range of payments that exist and merge them into one payment.  Then one would not have a debate about winners and losers.</p><p> On debt, which was raised by the Chairman, I do not think we will repay it.  We will bring down the debt ratio through growth.  The economy is growing at the moment and we should use the benefits of that to reduce the deficit rather than trying to push the EU rules to the extreme, as seems to be the case at the moment, to find how much we can cut tax and increase expenditure to the maximum.  At the moment it does not look as though we will meet the EU budgetary rules, but we should try to meet them, bring our deficit down and put ourselves on a stable footing.  We have undermined the tax base before and it looks as though we might do it again.  The universal social charge is a very unpopular tax, but it is one of our best taxes because one cannot get out of it.  If we take people out of the universal social charge and reduce it at the top, we would be pushing people back into income tax, and there is a broad range of ways of getting out of income tax, whether it is for wealthy people using particular schemes or through pension contributions.  For those at the bottom of the income distribution, the effective rates are quite low.  For this reason, I would favour holding on to the universal social charge and perhaps changing the name of it, as it seems to be such a high-profile issue, but I do not think we should undermine the tax base, given that we expanded it during the crisis.  We should use the benefits of it as we go forward, and if it does bring in extra revenue we could provide extra services across the community.</p><p> On Senator Burke&rsquo;s point on health care, I do not know why our pharmaceutical costs are so high.  Reference was made to baskets across EU countries that we can use to price ourselves against, but one must remember we are also in the baskets for other countries that are far larger than us, so if the Irish price is one ninth of the price that is set in Germany, it suits the pharmaceutical companies that the price is higher in Ireland, and that can be the same for the UK, France and other countries.  There might be some issues in terms of the smallness of the Irish market.  If companies can get away with it they will push the price up as high as they can, because that will make one ninth of a difference in Germany, so they will not make much money in Ireland, but getting the price up by 11% or 12% in Germany is clearly a big issue.  The question is how far we push it.  Do we go to the companies and say we should not be charged such a high price on patent-protected products when the sector has 40,000 or 45,000 direct jobs and perhaps as many indirect jobs again, bringing a couple of billion euro into the country every year?  We see the visibility of high prices for those products, but in the background there are huge inflows from the sector itself.  It may be the case that there are some trade-offs going on there.  It has never been proven but it has been suggested from time to time.</p></speech>

I welcome our guests from the diplomatic service who are here, and my colleagues in the Oireachtas.  I am very happy to be here in advance of the General Affairs Council, which takes place next week.  The General Affairs Council, in preparation for the European Council on Thursday and Friday of next week, will consider five issues: the European semester 2015, specifically the approval of the country-specific recommendations; the better regulation agenda; the situation in the Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia; and a new action plan on strategic communications to counter misinformation campaigns in the European Union&rsquo;s eastern neighbourhood.</p> <p>  Preparations for the European Council will build on our discussions at the May General Affairs Council, during which we had an initial exchange on the annotated agenda.  We also discussed in some detail at that meeting a follow-up to the special European Council of 23 April in relation to migration.  Finally, there was a brief exchange about the forthcoming report by the five Presidents on improving economic governance in the euro area.</p> <p>  The committee has asked me to focus my statement today on a limited number of issues, namely Ireland&rsquo;s country-specific recommendations, migration, EMU governance and, finally, the question of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the EU.  All of these issues will be considered by the GAC in the context of preparations for the June European Council.</p><p> The other issues which will feature on the European Council's agenda are broadly as I outlined during our meeting last month.  They include security challenges, covering the development of the Common Security and Defence Policy, CSDP; the review of the European security strategy and counter-terrorism; and also the broad topic of economic issues, including steps to progress the digital single market and VAT strategy.  </p><p> With respect to our country specific recommendations, CSRs, and the European semester process, the June European Council will conclude semester 2015 by endorsing this year&rsquo;s CSRs.  With a period of prolonged weakness in the wider euro area representing what is probably the key risk to the Irish economic outlook, we all stand to benefit from a well-functioning European semester process that guides our collective polices in the right direction and supports the right mix of monetary, fiscal and structural policies.  On 13 May the Commission presented its proposals for the 2015 CSRs.  In the case of Ireland, there are four proposed CSRs.  They cover continuing to restore balance to the public finances, including through the measures that will be reflected in the October budget; further improving the cost-effectiveness of health care spending in line with the Future Health reform programme adopted in 2012; continuing to improve the arrangements we have developed for addressing the risks of intergenerational transmission of poverty through so-called low work intensity households, including through strengthened child care provision; and completing the work under way to deal with the very difficult post-crisis legacy of non-performing loans in the financial sector.  The proposed CSRs can be seen as reflecting continuity from last year's process, while building on the comprehensive country report already produced by the Commission at the end of February and consistent with the "no surprises" principle.  They align well with policy directions that are already firmly established at national level through the Government.  </p><p> It can be noted that Ireland remains fully on track to exit the excessive deficit procedure in the year ahead.  Our stability programme update in April was forecasting a general Government balance of -2.3% in 2015 and -1.7% in 2016 below the required 3% deficit threshold.  We should all welcome this.  We have over-performed on deficit reduction every year to date and expect to see the deficit completely eliminated before 2019.  Our debt-to-GDP ratio is also on a firm downward trajectory.</p><p> One of the most important lessons of the European semester process as it has evolved in recent years concerns the need for it to become more open and inclusive, including through more meaningful engagement by national parliaments and other key stakeholders.  The process the committee has adopted today and at previous meetings and which is ongoing at the finance committee can continue to be improved.  We continue to aim for a better balance, at both national and EU level, between more effective economic governance arrangements, on the one hand, and increased democratic participation and legitimacy, on the other.  That is why the Government produced its new spring economic statement at the end of April, setting out a clear framework within which all stakeholders could contribute to the political dialogue that would inform further decisions to be taken in the October budget, including having regard to Ireland&rsquo;s CSRs.  This will be a key focus of the national economic dialogue to be hosted by the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Brendan Howlin, in Dublin Castle on 16 and 17 July.</p><p> Returning to developments at EU level, proposals to strengthen economic governance in the euro area will be brought forward in a report to be published in the coming days by European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker, euro summit president Donald Tusk, European Central Bank President Mario Draghi, Eurogroup president Jeroen Dijsselbloem and European Parliament President Martin Schulz &ndash; the so-called &ldquo;five presidents&rdquo; report.  The drafting of this report responds to a task from the Heads of State and Government in the euro area at a euro summit meeting last October.</p><p> Important policy and legislative changes introduced in recent years have served to strengthen European Monetary Union, EMU, in many cases responding to hard lessons learned as a result of the economic and financial crisis.  An extensive economic governance framework has been put in place, including the European semester and the macro-economic imbalance procedure, while significant progress has been made in the implementation of banking union.  As a result, we have an economic governance and financial system that is more robust, better able to identify and manage risk and that seeks to take account of the interdependencies between economies.  Notwithstanding the positive measures adopted in recent years, some analysts and policy-makers argue that EMU is not yet complete and that more far-reaching changes are required.  There is an expectation that the report of the five presidents will be reasonably ambitious in setting out a vision for the long term, while also considering what can realistically be achieved in the short to medium term.</p><p> Ireland, together with other member states, has had the opportunity to offer its views on EMU reform through specially convened meetings of the sherpa network, which comprises senior representatives of the Heads of State and Government.  However, I underline that, while member states have been canvassed for their views, the final report will be presented solely on the authority of the five presidents.  The more ambitious, longer term proposals brought forward during discussions included fiscal capacity for the euro area; a common eurozone finance Minister; and binding reform contracts whereby member states would agree to implement structural reforms in return for support from a solidarity fund.</p><p> Ireland, together with many other member states, has argued that our focus at this point should be on full implementation of existing economic and financial governance instruments.  Implementation of these instruments is not yet optimal.  For example, we see scope for a greater focus on the aggregate economic and fiscal position of the euro area as a whole, recognising that excessive current account surpluses and deficits both need to be tackled.  Ireland also argues strongly that measures which can contribute to sustainable and job-rich growth across the European Union must be prioritised and driven forward.  This includes completion of the Single Market, including the digital Single Market, roll-out of the investment plan and giving further impetus to trade negotiations.  We believe it is towards these tangible objectives, rather than protracted introspective negotiations on new instruments, that we should channel our efforts and energies.  Given that the report of the five presidents has not yet been published and, as a result, there is little time for analysis by member states in advance of the European Council, my expectation is that discussion by the Heads of State and Government will be very limited.  </p><p> One of the most challenging and pressing issues for consideration by the forthcoming European Council is the migration crisis in the Mediterranean.  The committee has also been actively engaged on the issue and corresponded with the Taoiseach on it.  I have seen the Chairman's letter and the Taoiseach's response.  To address the crisis, the special European Council in April set out clear priorities focusing on strengthening the European Union&rsquo;s presence at sea, fighting traffickers in accordance with international law, preventing illegal migration flows and reinforcing internal solidarity and responsibility.</p><p>The Latvian Presidency, which comes to the end of its term at the end of this month, and the European Commission have translated this vision into what is termed a roadmap, which will form the basis for discussions at the June 2015 European Council next week.  The Commission has also brought forward a new strategy, the European Agenda on Migration<i>,</i>which puts forward a range of short and longer term proposals. <br/><br/>On the question of the immediate actions necessary, I wish to comment briefly on some elements of Ireland&rsquo;s approach.  In response to the Commission&rsquo;s recommendations on resettlement, Ireland has offered to take 300 refugees in addition to our existing commitments for the 2015 and 2016 period.  That will bring our resettlement commitment over the period to 520, which is almost double the share proposed for us by the Commission in the European Agenda on Migration.  <br/><br/>In addition, the Government last month dispatched the <i>LE Eithne</i>, a Naval Service vessel, to assist in humanitarian search and rescue tasks in the Mediterranean.  Thus far, the <i>LE Eithne</i>has conducted nine rescue operations, resulting in the rescue of more than 1,600 migrants.  I am sure the committee will join me in thanking the crew of the <i>LE Eithne</i>for its courageous work in the Mediterranean to date, and to wish it continued success in its life-saving endeavours.  I had the pleasure of being at Haulbowline on the morning the Naval Service vessel departed.  We are all very proud of the great work being done in the Mediterranean in very difficult circumstances.<br/><br/>There is no quick fix to the migration crisis.  I expect there will be a robust debate at the General Affairs Council and, subsequently, at the European Council as to how the European Union can most effectively respond.  A key sticking point is the Commission proposal to introduce a mandatory emergency relocation mechanism, whereby 40,000 people in need of international protection in Italy and Greece could be redistributed among other member states.  There is concern among some EU partners, in particular, about the mandatory nature of the mechanism.  A number also have issues with the allocation key for distributing the proposed cases among the member states.<br/><br/>Ireland&rsquo;s opt-in protocol under the treaties would apply to this proposal and so the Commission has not allocated Ireland a relocation quota.  However, we are examining the proposals very carefully with no final decision yet taken. <br/><br/>As a final comment on migration, I note that this discussion can be a little lopsided at times because of the understandable urgency of the humanitarian situation.  It is excessively focused on the consequences of Europe&rsquo;s pull factor, whereas we also need to engage more effectively with external partners in relation to the push factors that cause the migrants to take such perilous risks.  Ireland has a positive story in regard to our record of working with African countries, in particular to stimulate their economies to provide better livelihoods for their young people.  In addition to the steps I outlined previously, we will also continue, in co-operation with our international and United Nations partners, to provide humanitarian assistance in regions from which many migrants originate.  This has included support totalling &euro;41 million to those affected by the brutal conflict in Syria. <br/><br/>I  turn to the EU-UK relationship.  The committee is fully aware of where the Government stands on this issue of fundamental national interest.  I am aware it has engaged and has visited the UK.  As I have said, we want the UK to remain a full, integral member of the European Union.  As the committee may be aware, the Taoiseach is in London today for a meeting with Prime Minister Cameron.The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade, Deputy Charles Flanagan, will meet the Foreign Secretary, Mr. Philip Hammond, MP, tomorrow in Dublin.  Their discussions will no doubt cover a number of issues but the question of Britain&rsquo;s future in Europe will, I expect, figure very prominently.  The fact is that British membership of the EU matters hugely to Ireland's advantage and I expect the Taoiseach will avail of the opportunity to explain directly to the Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, why that is the case.  The hearings the committee held this spring provided a rich seam of evidence as to why British membership of the EU should be considered so important to Ireland.  I very much look forward to reading its report on the issue which I understand is to be published next week.  I thank the committee for its invitation to the publication but as it coincides with the General Affairs Council meeting I am unable to attend.  <br/><br/>We are entering a more decisive phase of the UK&rsquo;s relationship with the European Union.  The Prime Minister, Mr. Cameron, was re-elected in May on the back of a manifesto that promised to reform the workings of the European Union, and to hold an in-out referendum before the end of 2017.  Ireland respects the democratic mandate the Prime Minister has to pursue that agenda.  What we now await is the substance of the UK proposals in regard to how the functioning of the European Union can be improved.  This is the kernel of the matter.  These proposals may be sketched out at the European Council, although it is not yet clear what level of detail Prime Minister Cameron is ready to provide.  We already have a sense of some of the reforms the UK might seek to prioritise in the time ahead.  I had the opportunity to explore some of these when I met my British counterpart, Mr. David Lidington MP, in Dublin on 26 May. They include issues such as an increased focus on competitiveness within the European Union, a greater role for national parliaments, and new provisions regarding welfare entitlements.<br/><br/>No matter what the UK actually puts on the table, the challenge is the same, namely, arriving at a consensual basis for continued British membership of the European Union.  Given what is at stake, we will be playing a constructive and active role when it comes to any negotiations.  Our instinct is also to be supportive and sympathetic on the substance.  Let me repeat however what I have said before.  As important as British membership of the European Union is to Ireland, we will not support any proposals with which we fundamentally disagree.  Nor will we subscribe to any course of action that could significantly undermine or weaken fundamental principles of the European Union, such as freedom of movement of people.  Next week&rsquo;s European Council represents a first engagement at the level of Heads of State or Government on this issue.  Much works lies ahead and Ireland is ready to play its part.</p></speech>

The committee will be aware that as we speak the Eurogroup meeting, at which the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, is present, is taking place.  Amid lack of progress, the IMF has withdrawn its negotiating team from Brussels.  Even at this late stage it is still very much in everybody's interest that agreement is reached.  The situation of Greek finances is very challenging and its immediate financing needs need to be addressed.  Deposit outflows from the banking system have continued.  There is an urgent need for agreement on the necessary structural reforms.  It is imperative to conclude the fifth review and to release these disbursements.  The Irish position has always been to be supportive of Greece and of the Greek people but we have very serious timelines which need to be adhered to.</p><p>The Greek Government has a responsibility to deliver for the Greek people.  The meeting is ongoing as we speak and we will get a report on it within the next couple of hours.  It will be the main topic at the European Council meeting next week.  That is the current position.</p></speech>

Perhaps colleagues have specific questions, but I will begin with two questions.  The first relates to the EMU.  The Minister of State said we want to see a greater focus on aggregate economic and fiscal positions within the eurozone and that we need to recognise that while some countries have excessive deficits, some have current account surpluses.  One of those with a surplus is one of the main countries in the euro area, Germany.  What direct pressure is applied at these meetings to countries like Germany to do something about the situation?  It is in the interest of the rest of the eurozone that something is done, and to do that we need to focus on countries with a surplus.</p> <p>  My second question relates to migration.  The Minister is probably aware that before a previous General Affairs Council meeting we had the Italian ambassador and Peter Sutherland, the UN special representative on migration, at our committee to talk about their views on the Mediterranean crisis.  One proposal made by Mr. Sutherland was that we should explore the option for the European Commission to process migrants in a remote area outside of the European Union.  The committee took this suggestion on board and brought it to the COSAC meeting in Riga where we had a debate at the plenary session on the issue.  The proposal was not passed by sufficient numbers at Riga.  However, what is the Taoiseach's and the Minister of State's position on this proposal.  Is it something they would support and, if so, is it something they would push at the next General Affairs Council meeting?</p></speech>

I apologise that I may not be able to remain to hear the Minister of State's response, but I will read them afterwards in the Official Report.</p> <p>  I applaud the role of the Government in bringing about a situation where the country is now in a wonderful situation economically, where our debt-to-GDP ratio has improved considerably, our public finances are under control and significant employment is being created.  This is a huge achievement economically.  This leads us to recommendation No. 4, that we should deal with the issue of arrears and mortgages.  This is the last leg of the programme.  We have achieved a lot with establishing the pillar banks and getting people back to work, but dealing with the residual debt of arrears and mortgages is the last leg in recreating a normal functioning society and economy.  This is crucial.  What other steps do the Government and the Minister of State propose to take to ensure we get our historic debt, such as distressed mortgages and SME debt, dealt with?  We need restructuring of debt rather than sales of assets and repossessions because these do not contribute to a good functioning economy.</p> <p>  Yesterday, I was disturbed to hear the anecdotal evidence of colleagues in the D&aacute;il in regard to vulture funds which now propose to sell properties which are increasing in value to recover the debt.  Will the Minister of State assure me this will not be allowed happen and that we will not see properties sold unnecessarily?  Will he assure us that the first option will be to restructure and reorganise debt to create a better economic climate that will allow people recover from debt?  This is particularly important for householders, but also for SMEs.  How does the Minister of State propose to see that the Central Bank monitoring arrangements are carried out?  These are timely and apt recommendations.  What improvements does he propose to make on these?  We have all heard stories as public representatives in our clinics of people not getting settlements.  Will the Minister of State assure us the monitoring process will work and how it will do so?  Will he assure us properties will not be sold simply because they are getting more valuable?  That is a lazy option for the debt holders.</p></speech>

In regard to the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland, SBCI - a wonderful development - will the Minister of State assure us that people who were in distress previously, especially those with difficulties in the construction sector and particularly in Cavan-Monaghan, will not be the victim of those historic difficulties?  Will he assure us there will be flexibility in regard to how the SBCI will work in order that it will allow these people get up and going again?  If their business case and plan stands up, this should be the issue rather than their history, because it was through no fault of their own that a number of them had difficulties.  I got a disturbing report that this might not be the case, so would like assurance from the Minister of State that the report was wrong.</p> <p>  Will the Minister of State specify why we are going for the 0.3% rather than the 0.6% reduction in our structural deficit?  I assume that is to stimulate the economy and to generate more revenue, but I would like to hear an explanation.</p> <p> The Minister of State said we have great relations with the United Kingdom and we want to keep that.  We want to use our diplomacy to try to keep the UK within the European Union.  I represent a Border constituency and it would be remiss of me not to raise an issue of concern.   This is not something that should prejudice the good relations between two states that respect each other.  Will the Minister of State use his good offices with his counterparts in the United Kingdom to secure a situation where the reports of the dreadful and horrific collusion during the conflict in Northern Ireland - reports we got this week from RTE and previously from the BBC "Panorama" programme - are dealt with?  Will he ensure the reports are addressed and that the British Government sets up the necessary inquiries and provides the evidence to get a resolution and closure?  I do not believe it would prejudice the Minister of State's good work to raise that.</p></speech>

The Minister of State is welcome and I wish him luck in the meeting of the General Affairs Council.  We heard there are five issues to be addressed, one of which is the country-specific recommendations.  This committee had an excellent presentation from Dr. Seamus Coffey and I now have a question for the Minister of State.  Why has the Commission dropped the country-specific recommendations from seven to four?  Dr. Coffey explained to us in plain language that the legal services issue is the biggest rip-off in this country and the biggest financial drain on Exchequer resources <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>others such as lone parent's allowance.</p><p>Will the Minister of State give a commitment to this committee that he will resurrect this issue in Europe and demand that it be put back in for our analysis and action in the future?  One of the items the Minister of State will deal with is a new action plan on strategic communications to counter misinformation campaigns in the union&rsquo;s eastern neighbourhood.  That is short for saying we lost the propaganda war with the Russians.  Russian radio and television stations have bombarded Ukraine.  Moldova is having serious trouble with the corruption exposed in the socialist party there, it being the most pro-Russian party.  Georgia is very worried about the activities in this field.  How does the Minister of State think Europe or Ireland will play a role and in what capacity to counter the black propaganda that comes from the Russians <i>vis-&agrave;-vis </i>the eastern partnership? <br/><br/>Greece is chaotic.  It is deemed to be ultra-leftist, which is the majority but there is also an extremely right-wing constituency in that government.  How does the Minister of State see the chaos that will result if the threats of a particular right-wing Minister in that government open the floodgates of immigration into Europe?  It is speaking as a member of the EU.</p></speech>

Greece has to be the overarching concern in respect of the five presidents&rsquo; report on strengthening economic governance in the euro area.</p> <p>  The Minister of State spoke about the country specific recommendations and the European semester becoming more open and inclusive, including through more meaningful engagement from national parliaments and other stakeholders.  The recommendations were published in June, there is a budget in October.  Is the Minister of State advocating a post-budget debate to see that the recommendations are implemented? </p> <p>  On immigration, I commend the action of the Government, the Minister for Defence and others in this area.  Ireland plans to take more migrants than the quota recommended.  If the quota system is adopted there are certain countries migrants would wish to go to.  Even if a certain country took in its quota, how can the migrants be stopped from going to the UK or Germany?  While we cannot blame anyone for seeking a better life, the more migrants who reach and settle in Europe, the more are encouraged to make the same journey.  This is the problem.  There is no stop to the movement.  I do not blame them seeking a better life.  What can be done to stop them leaving?  I distinguish between economic migrants and refugees.</p> <p>  Is there a timeframe for discussion on UK-EU relations?  Will the UK continue with bilateral meetings?  Is there any discussion on when it might put forward proposals on the changes it wishes to see in the EU? </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2626" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/957" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="13:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/EUJ2015061800002#H00500"><p>I compliment the Minister of State on his address.  One hopes all our influence will concentrate on encouraging our UK neighbours to remain within the EU.  Exit will have disastrous consequences for the Union itself, for Northern Ireland and for this country.  No matter what structure is put in place it cannot improve the situation.  We hope the Minister of State and his colleagues will use every opportunity to convey that view at the meeting.  The thinking people in the UK Government and the country will agree with that.</p> <p>  In respect of the meetings, competitiveness remains an issue and we hope work continues on that.  I am worried by the reference to a greater role for national parliaments.  I have raised this question on numerous occasions.  I cannot see how a greater role for national parliaments is of any benefit to the European Union unless the national parliaments are similarly disposed towards the union.  If they are not, how will the greater role for each parliament improve the cohesiveness and effectiveness of the Union?  It cannot.  I hope a greater emphasis will be put on the need to ensure the membership of national parliaments recognises the European project and whatever debate takes place does not take place in a divisive fashion, and that when we express our views in the European arena we have (a) our interests at heart and (b) the EU&rsquo;s interests at heart and try to make the two converge.</p> <p>  There is a grave danger that the credibility of the institutions of the EU will suffer as a result of the Greek situation.  For the past six months there has been continued speculation on what the resolution will be.  If the member states want it one way, let them do it.  If it is the agreed decision of each member state of the union that they come together to bail out the Greeks they should do so but let us not play around with it forever.  If the member states intend to bail out a colleague in the Union then by all means do so.  Let us remember, however, that we had to bail ourselves out with huge sacrifices on the part of the people, Government and Members of the Parliament.  We all had to take a lot of abuse and criticism in order to do what needed to be done but we did it.  We had the resolve, the conviction and dedication to do that.  There are lessons to be learned from that.  If it is the intention of the Union to come together with the opinion that we, the EU states, will bail out Greece then do it, but continued speculation and procrastination will not help the situation and will undermine, with disastrous consequences, the whole concept of the Union. </p></speech>

Does the Minister of State agree with those comments?</p> <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the sticking point of the mandatory relocation mechanism on immigration.  I am worried by comments from the Hungarian Government that it is building a 4 m high fence on its border with Serbia to keep out migrants.  That can be seen as part of a wider anti-immigrant campaign by the prime minister.</p><p>He described the efforts to resettle migrants around the EU as insane and said all migrants were terrorists.  Has this situation been discussed with the Minister of State's counterparts in Hungary and Europe?</p><p> Finally, I return to the country-specific recommendation on strengthened child care provision.  That was also a country-specific recommendation in 2014 and in the summary assessment then it said that no progress had been made to improve access to more affordable and full-time child care.  It is now one of the recommendations for this year.  Mr. Seamus Coffey was here before the Minister of State and he mentioned that some of these recommendations do not really include proposals on what to do or concrete figures.  What action will be taken by the Government to address the issue of affordable full-time child care?  There is a danger that it might be left there and that we will keep seeing every year that no or limited progress has been made.</p></speech>

That is our position.  Generally speaking, our focus has been on addressing the root causes of immigration and working with countries in the region.  As the committee knows from COSAC, that is not a position that is universally accepted.  Understandably, our discussions are focused on very short-term solutions.  However, we must continue to encourage that the parallel root cause solution takes place, otherwise we will continue to be in the same position.  With respect to the five presidents question, proposals for implementation in the shorter term will include greater attention to the aggregate fiscal and economic stance of the eurozone, which will include a better implementation of the macro-economic imbalance procedure.  We will then see increased momentum in structural reforms that will follow on from those.</p> <p>  I take Deputy Byrne's point, but as Deputy O'Reilly will be reading the Official Report, we will cover his question as quickly as we can.  Deputy O'Reilly asked about arrears and our fourth country-specific recommendation.  We are fully aware of the requirement to reduce the difficulty for businesses and individuals.  Clearly, we have to re-emphasise the importance of early engagement, steering as many cases as possible to the strengthened insolvency service.  We are also looking at improving the court process.  A particular question was asked about the Strategic Banking Corporation of Ireland.  While there is, of course, an emphasis on - and we have the Credit Review Office in place for - people who have legacy issues when it comes to applications, it is still the case that any lending institution will have to look at a broad range, including the proposal itself, and history will always remain part of that.  We are very eager to encourage that across a broad sector of Irish life we allow businesses, business people and individuals to rehabilitate themselves and move on from legacies that, in many instances, were not of their own making.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly asked specifically whether the Taoiseach will raise the issue of collusion with Prime Minister, David Cameron.  I am not aware that the issue is specifically on the agenda.  The Taoiseach may well raise it.  There will be other discussions, but given the European Council next week, the main item for discussion today is the proposals the British will bring forward with respect to the referendum they are going to have.</p> <p>  Deputy Eric Byrne mentioned legal services not being part of the country-specific recommendations this year.  There are two elements to the answer in this regard.  There have been fewer country-specific recommendations for everybody.  There has been a specific push to simplify them.  Equally, we have had very significant progress with respect to the Legal Services Regulation Bill which is now nearly through the Houses of the Oireachtas and there is a strong sense that progress has been made in this regard.  The Deputy will remember that when the troika was leaving, legal services reform was identified as one of the few areas where we had not made progress.  We can now say that the Minister for Justice and Equality has made good progress.  I took one of the debates in the D&aacute;il and Seanad and Committee Stage in the Seanad is scheduled very soon.  The Minister and her Department are confident that the Bill will conclude shortly.  Rather than request them to reintroduce it, we should focus on doing the job that was requested of us last year to ensure that it does not reappear as a country-specific recommendation.</p> <p>  We will all agree that the comments of the Greek Minister for Defence were very unfortunate.  They were not supported by the Greek Prime Minister and others in subsequent commentary.  Greece has participated constructively in EU discussions on migration and, to be fair, we must look at the fact that it is one of the countries with a very significant number of migrants seeking access or located there.  The Commission's proposals aim to deal with the difficulties faced in particular by Italy and Greece.  Deputy Kyne is correct that we must look at the push factors when it comes to migration such as conflict resolution and working with external partners to help their economies to progress.</p> <p>  I point out to Deputy Eric Byrne that the semester process is, first, a matter for each parliament.  The agreements on the European semester allow the time and space for countries to engage with internal CSRs.  In particular, this has been done at the finance committee although it is the second time we have discussed them here.  A couple of years ago, the time between publication of CSRs and their adoption was very short but we now have a much longer period.  Deputy Durkan made the accurate point that it is up to the Houses of the Oireachtas to engage to a greater extent with the European semester.  I have been struck that we have not really evolved in the Houses in terms of looking at other countries' CSRs, which is part of the benefit of the semester process.  Given the inter-related nature of all of our economies, we should have regard to and concern for what is happening in other countries.</p> <p>  That segues into the other question of when the surplus countries are going to play their role.  Perhaps understandably, there has been an overemphasis on the deficit countries but the surplus countries also have a responsibility.  That is why, within some of the discussions around EMU, there is an increasing focus on the aggregation of the European economy.</p><p>In some of the discussions concerning EMU there is now an ever greater focus on the aggregation of the European economy.  One country in particular clearly has a greater surplus than everybody else.  </p><p> How am I doing for time, Chairman?</p></speech>

Everything we do is to try to encourage greater employment, giving people a greater opportunity to earn a living, and therefore allow the country through our social protection, education and health regimes to have funding available to support people in difficult situations, including long-term unemployment and child poverty.</p> <p>  The Senator's two-part question covered the fiscal space and the latitude we have to correct it, or by how much we should correct it.  Both of those CSRs contradict each other in many ways.  We have taken the view that within the fiscal space available to us, in order to have as much funding as possible to support out social welfare system, including for vulnerable young people, we will continue to achieve our targets.  Where fiscal space is available, however, we will continue to reduce the amount of tax on work as well as increasing spending on public services.</p> <p>  While both CSRs are understandable, that is where the Government's political judgment must come into place as to how we can strike that balance.  In some regards, the fiscal advisory council has a view as to how that should happen.  I recently met with Commissioner Moscovici at a public forum attended by Social Justice Ireland, the Society of St. Vincent de Paul and other groups.  It is clear that such groups would strongly encourage the Government to use the fiscal space it has, which was achieved with difficulty in recent years, to improve the situation for our citizens.</p> <p>  To be fair to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, and his Government colleagues, that balance has been struck while managing to achieve job creation and economic growth.  As the economy recovers, this is the area where we need to work hardest to ensure that our young people are now looked after as best we can.  The economic downturn has conferred a cost on some people, which has been very difficult.</p></speech>

This is important as they cause serious problems for the broadcasting, editorial and sound recording staff.  Today, the Joint Committee on Health and Children is holding its third hearing on affordable and quality child care.  The child care sector faces a range of challenges, including the significant cost of child care faced by families, conditions, training for child care workers, increased regulation, the lack of regulation of childminders and funding issues for the sector.</p><p>I welcome our witnesses: Ms Rose Bradley, social worker, Central Remedial Clinic, Waterford; Ms Mary Lacey-Crowe, clinical nurse manager, Sacred Heart Centre, Lady Lane, Waterford; Ms Denise McCormilla, chief executive officer, CEO, and Ms Michelle Hart, development officer, National Childhood Network; and Ms Marian Quinn, chairperson, Association of Childhood Professionals.</p><p>I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  </p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I ask each contributor to limit her time to five minutes.  I will then call members and take the questions in groups of three.</p></speech>

The CRC provides a range of services to children and young people with a range of disabilities from birth to 18 years.  The CRC is the primary service provider for children from the Waterford community care area who have a primary physical disability.</p> <p>  Working as a social worker I am aware of the emotional impact on families when a child has significant disability and of the adjustments and adaptations that families have to make.  One of the recurring issues I have to advocate for on behalf of families who attend CRC services is the lack of adequate supports within the mainstream preschool environment for children with disabilities and my focus here today is on this lack. </p> <p>  The early childhood care and education scheme, ECCE, commonly known as the free preschool year was introduced five years ago and gives all children an entitlement to a free preschool year.  In my experience children who need physical assistance are sometimes unable to avail of their entitlement in its entirety due to lack of supports and are effectively discriminated against.</p> <p>  Supports are needed for children with disabilities to avail of the ECCE scheme.  These supports can include access to the appropriate equipment, technology, skilled staff, environment and transport.  I believe all children need equal access to the ECCE scheme.  I have known parents who they have had to pay privately for a support worker so that their child can access the free ECCE entitlement.  There is no system in place nationally which caters for the special needs assistant, SNA, support needs of children with disabilities in preschool.  The current system is inequitable for those children who are most vulnerable. </p> <p>  Every child is an individual and support needs vary from one child and family to the next.  For some children, placement in a special preschool is the right option due to the particular needs and services required.  Where special needs preschools coexist with special schools this has ensured that those children have access to equipment and to the teaching staff supported by the multidisciplinary services.  The CRC service in Dublin has two preschool services integrated into the two special schools of CRC Clontarf special school and Scoil Mochua, Clondalkin.  For other children, however, this is not always the most appropriate placement.  Children for whom the plan is mainstream primary school require a supported mainstream preschool placement beforehand.  Many children can benefit from one to two years in a special needs preschool and can then be successfully moved to a local mainstream school.  Some of the children documented in the appendix of my written submissions have had such an experience.</p> <p>  The preschool experience is vital in helping all children to be school ready and also to have the opportunity to move on with their peers.  For the child with special needs, this experience requires adequate support, most especially that of a well-trained SNA.  Provision of a supported and supervised SNA is critical to supporting children in the mainstream preschool environment.  This service could be supported and-or provided by agencies, such as the CRC to ensure staff are adequately trained and supervised.</p> <p>  I have a few recommendations, including that the Department of Education and Skills extend the SNA support structure to children with disabilities in the preschool sector in the same way that it is offered to this group in primary and secondary schools currently; the ECCE year be extended to two full years for all children which would benefit all children; that consideration be given to increasing the numbers of community preschools as this would go some way to addressing the issue of distance to services and providing more choice to families; and that innovative ways are considered for the provision, support, training and supervision of SNAs.  In conclusion, a range of options needs to be provided from accessible mainstream preschools to special needs preschools, which may be attached to specialist services or special schools.</p></speech>

While we at the Sacred Heart Centre are mostly considered a centre of excellence, we need to be continually mindful of our limitations and be ever cognisant of the child.  A child is first and foremost a child, not a disability and for this reason I prefer to use the phrase "child with additional needs".  With continued advances in research, training and education and policy development it is widely accepted that the child with additional needs is best facilitated in an inclusive setting.  Segregation or isolation of children with additional needs is restrictive, discriminatory and is a barrier to social inclusion.  The United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child clearly assigns responsibility to Government for "render appropriate assistance to parents" and ensuring that "children of working parents have the right to benefit from child-care services and facilities".</p><p>While the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child was the first international human rights treaty to clearly include disability, the 2006 UN Convention on Persons with Disabilities has given us a new understanding of disability and what is needed to ensure the rights of the child with a disability are being realised in progressive ways.  We can deduce from this that a child with additional needs has the same right as all children to be included in the same early childhood education setting and should not be deprived of this opportunity.</p><p> However, this is not the reality of the situation or my experience to date.  The permanent exclusion of children from their local mainstream early childhood setting is extremely difficult and heart breaking for families.  It should not be happening in 2015.  Quality childhood care and education provides a vital opportunity for children with additional needs to be integrated into their local communities with their peer groups and avoids alienation of the child and family.  On reviewing past referrals to our service, particularly toddler-playgroup services, we frequently see that children with additional needs cannot be catered for in a mainstream setting for several reasons.  These include resource challenges, non-engagement of parents, the need for further training engagement between the Health Service Executive and service providers, challenging and disruptive behaviours, continence issues, health and safety concerns, reputation, fear, and tolerance.</p><p> When it comes to future planning for the individual child, we have had to be creative to ensure the child is afforded the opportunity of inclusion.  While individual child care providers have excelled at inclusion, the whole system needs to be standardised nationally.</p><p> From a local perspective, I want to acknowledge the investment by the speech and language therapy department in Waterford in providing continuous training to child care providers to assist with the inclusion process and to the various early intervention teams for other initiatives.  However, there is a long way to go and it is difficult when there are so many stakeholders involved, all with a different focus.  It is vital we retain a child-centred approach and that all changes that challenge us will be in the best interest of the child.  The lack of a co-ordinated structure that plans, funds and provides regulated child care and education makes full inclusion difficult and even sometimes impossible.  Going forward, it is vital that early childhood educators are trained in a framework that assumes that children with additional needs will be in their early years services and will not need to be isolated from their peers in formative years.</p></speech>

The National Childhood Network is conscious that many organisations interested in early childhood education and care have already presented on the issues in the sector and the need for investment in it.  We have submitted six proposals that we believe would make a significant difference in this area for the committee to consider.</p> <p>  Working in an area close to Northern Ireland, we have observed developments there and in the Republic and learned from them.  One particular project stands out as being a model that could be replicated successfully throughout Ireland.  This project in the southern Border counties and Northern Ireland was funded by the International Fund for Ireland and worked in delivering high-quality services.  It is from that project that we are taking many of our recommendations.</p> <p>  Our first recommendation is on improving the ECCE, early childhood care and education, free preschool scheme.  It has been a wonderful scheme with many benefits gained from it.  It has been revolutionary but there are many issues in it that need to be addressed.  The committee will be familiar with other schemes such as the childcare education and training support, CETS, programme, and the subvention schemes.  Our proposal is that all current funding for schemes would actually be deactivated by September 2016.  They are cumbersome and take up much administration, not just on behalf of providers but also for Pobal, the Department and the county child care committees.  Much of the administrative paperwork could be got rid of if the schemes were changed completely.</p> <p>  We suggest the funding is alternatively put into a central pot for either staff salaries going directly to the services or actual payment of salaries to services in the same way that our primary and secondary schools are funded.  While the committee might be more familiar with the term &ldquo;private providers&rdquo;, we refer to them as independently managed services.  Funding should be made available to both independently managed and committee-managed services.  They have to comply with the same regulations, meet the same quality standards and employ the same staff.  Community services are more likely to be in more disadvantaged areas so they have additional needs.  The system is the same, however.</p> <p>  I am sure the committee has heard much about payment for non-contact time and that the payment to the ECCE scheme is just for direct contact with children.  There is so much more non-contact work required to be done from planning to evaluation of work to working with parents.  Now, the education-focused inspections will require much more work on behalf of the services.  While we are pleased with the involvement of the Department of Education and Skills in this, much work must be done to ensure all services are able to cope with their responsibilities.</p> <p>  We suggest funding should be for a 42-week period rather than a 38-week period.  This would allow more continuing professional development, CPD, to take place and pay staff holiday pay, meaning they would not find themselves having to go on the dole during holiday time.  We also suggest a small annual capitation grant should be made available in the same way it is to primary schools.  Another key measure that needs to be in place is the development of new supports system, particularly for committee-managed services, to alleviate the pressure on volunteers.  In the main, committee-managed services are managed voluntarily by parents.  There is a phenomenal amount of legislative responsibilities, never mind other responsibilities, involved in this.  Governance in the committee-managed sector is poor and needs to be supported and improved.  In considering this model, we were influenced by the introduction of free secondary school education in the 1960s by Donogh O&rsquo;Malley and how community and private schools became managed by committees.</p> <p>  In return for the provision of salaries, the services must commit to achieving quality standards required by Aistear, the early childhood curriculum framework, and S&iacute;olta, the national quality framework for early childhood education.  Certain requirements should be in place to ensure all early childhood services meet these frameworks by 2020.  To do this, the sector must be willing to engage in a national quality development training programme.  Some providers have already done so and achieved those standards.  The reality is, however, very few have and are not in a position to do so.  There is a significant amount of workforce capacity building to be done.  It needs to be borne in mind that accessing qualifications and having the bit of paper does not guarantee a service meets the requirements of a quality service.  A graduate having level seven or eight qualifications does not necessarily guarantee delivery a service that will meet national quality standards.  A programme of CPD is what worked within the International Fund for Ireland project I referred to earlier and would work in the future.</p> <p>  There has been much talk about the provision of a second preschool year with the recent announcement that there is no funding for it.</p><p>We suggest that it be introduced step by step, and it does not have to be introduced to every child who might be eligible for it within the next year or two or three if the funding is not there for it.  At least if funding was made available for staff salaries to deliver a second preschool year in the existing services, which can accommodate children who would be aged two years and ten months by September of the year they would be in the service, there would be the possibility of reducing the high cost of child care for many parents who are struggling with the cost of that service at the moment.  The staff working within the services would be obliged through service level agreements to meet the criteria that would need to be laid down to ensure measurable progress over a period.</p><p> With proposal No. 3, we recommend a registration system for childminders similar to that which has operated for many years in Northern Ireland.  That was introduced on a phased basis and it is working very well.  We cannot see why that could not operate within the Republic of Ireland.  Regulation of childminders has always been avoided, and it is time to stop that and see what can be done.  We only have to look up the road across the Border to see how this system is working really well.  In that way, one would be able to ensure greater access to good quality and affordable services for parents where there is no cr&egrave;che facility or where parents choose not to use the facility.</p><p> There should be development of a school-age child care strategy with appropriate legislation on policy development, investment and quality standards, similar to the S&iacute;olta and Aistear frameworks.  That really needs to happen.  There is much focus on school-age child care at the moment, and we need after-school services.  Some parents need breakfast clubs and some need summer play schemes, but there is no overall strategy for this to take place.  Over the past few years, through Government funding, so much work has been done in this area by voluntary child care organisations, partnership companies and county child care committees that could be used to build a foundation for a really good school-age child care system within the country.</p><p> There should be development of a comprehensive support system for services provided for children with additional needs.  We agree with everything the previous speakers have said on this.  A new strategy needs to be devised in order to ensure that children with a variety of additional needs have their needs met.  It is not just about those with a disability, as services see children with all kinds of additional needs.  They come from homes with problems due to the recession or marital problems.  There are children coming from war-torn countries into many services.  It is not just the community services that are taking these children, as the early childhood care and education programme means all children in an area can access this service.  It could be provided by an independent provider as opposed to something managed by committee.  I reiterate what my colleagues have stated in this regard, and the submission sent to the committee has more specific recommendations.</p><p> Funding has to be made available for the delivery of affordable services that meet our national quality standards.  These are our brilliant standards, and we know that where services meet them, the needs of children are being met.  They support health, well-being, learning and development.  The bottom line is that the taxpayer must pay.  There is a widespread lack of awareness within the public, among parents and certainly in the media about the value of high-quality early years and after-school services.  We advocate that the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, in conjunction with the Departments of Health and Education and Skills,  take responsibility on an annual basis for having a public awareness campaign.  In the US there is the Week of the Young Child, and in the UK they have Sure Start weeks; why would we not have something similar on an annual basis, led by the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, so that parents, grandparents, the sector and the public can recognise why it is important for Ireland to have a really good early years and after-school service?</p><p> I have mentioned that we see the Department of Children and Youth Affairs as needing to take the lead on this and we absolutely welcome the involvement of the Department of Education and Skills, which is responsible for many elements, including S&iacute;olta, Aistear and the Quality and Qualifications Ireland system within which trainers deliver training.  That is not working well and needs to be improved, and we could speak for another five minutes about that, although we will not do it today.  All of this is essential.  I ask the committee to do whatever it can to influence our civil servants to re-establish the national child care co-ordination committee, which was established in 2000 by Ms Sylda Langford.  It worked for many years but, unfortunately, it was deactivated last year.  That was the only place where civil servants met those of us working on the ground, through the voluntary child care organisations, the city and county child care committees and education and training boards - all the different people and players who have an impact on the sector.  It provided support for the new groups that have been established, such as the interdepartmental group, to improve co-ordination.  People on the ground could help that process.</p></speech>

I reiterate what Ms McCormilla has said, and having read all the presentations made to the committee, I agree with the majority of them.  We will not get into it now, but one can assume that if we had longer than five minutes to speak, we would address those issues.<br/><br/>The Association of Childhood Professionals is a body representing practitioners in early years and school-age care and education.  We are a voluntary organisation and all our council members give freely of their time so we can fight for the profession that we value so much, but that is at the bottom of the pile when it comes to recognition, respect and remuneration.  The landscape for child care has changed greatly in Ireland over the past 20 years and the practitioner is now expected to be a professional whose role extends beyond care work with children.  Professional responsibilities include supporting the family and children during the critical stages of development.  As such, child care has expanded, so a professional's role includes being an early childhood educator, an administrator, a curriculum planner, a researcher, a cleaner, a counsellor, a communicator, a parent coach, a nurse, a facilitator, etc.  The list goes on.<br/><br/>The CoRe report, or Competence Requirements in Early Childhood Education and Care, from 2011 found that early childhood education and care is increasingly expected to fulfil &quot;societal expectations<i></i>regarding active citizenship and democracy, offering a strong foundation for lifelong learning, contributing to reducing child poverty, realising equal opportunities and strengthening creativity and innovation in young children.&quot;  It is amazing that all these professional services and societal contributions are provided with very few, if any, State support by very capable multi-taskers who earn little more than minimum wage, or sometimes less than minimum wage in the case of employers.<br/><br/>The early childhood workforce is at breaking point and can no longer afford to deliver this level of service for the pay these people receive.  This and successive Governments are taking advantage of good people who are committed to supporting the young children and families of this country.  It is exploitation, pure and simple, and it has to stop.  The young children of this county have a right to high-quality early childhood education and care.  Their families have the right to societal support in rearing these children and the professionals providing this care and support have the right to be recognised, respected and remunerated for their professional role.  These are fairly basic rights.<br/><br/>When the Workforce Development Plan for the Early Childhood Care and Education Sector in Ireland was published in 2010, the then Minister of State with responsibility for children and youth affairs, Barry Andrews, stated: &quot;The development of the early childhood care and education work force has been identified as a key pillar of quality.&quot;  The report also indicated that national and international research had established that the skills and qualifications of adults working with young children are a critical factor in determining the quality of young children's early childhood care and education experiences.  Unfortunately, this was followed by a statement that &quot;While issues such as the status and the terms and conditions of employment of people working in the sector are very much to the fore, they are outside the scope of this policy document,&quot; which was to develop the workforce.  It was another policy document with no teeth, in line with the finding of the CoRe report that found that in the Republic of Ireland, &quot;the history of early childhood provision and professionalisation reads like a collection of unfinished stories, of fragmented and un-coordinated initiatives.&rdquo;<br/><br/>There are approximately 25,000 people in the early childhood workforce, and this excludes childminders.  In 2013, Early Childhood Ireland found that practitioners earned an average of &euro;10 per hour, equating to an annual salary of &euro;18,200.  That is an unsustainable income, and matters are made worse when we consider that a sizable portion of the workforce are seasonal, sessional workers who are only paid for their contact time with the children and not for many other elements of their job description, such as planning, documenting, meeting parents, engaging with external professionals, etc.</p><p>The reality is that this average figure of &euro;10 hides the fact that many are on little more than the minimum wage and certainly earn far beneath the living wage of &euro;11.45.  I did an economics degree in a previous life, and I remember our lecturer saying that average figures are dangerous to work off because if one's feet are in the freezer and one's head is in the oven, one's average temperature is normal.  This is essentially what is happening with the figure of &euro;10.  Many people, when they hear that the average is &euro;10, point out that they are nowhere near &euro;10.  Indeed, they would aspire to &euro;10, and, unfortunately, might consider themselves happy were they to get that.  Employers struggle to take a minimum wage or any wage at all.  This really brings down the &euro;10 if we factor it in.  The fact that people are on the minimum wage, or less than the minimum wage, is despite the fact that wage bills are between 60% and 80% of the cost of running services.  There is no money for pensions, health insurance, car loans, mortgages, supporting the family, etc.<br/><br/>There is a requirement to upskill but no possibility of increased pay.  Workers are excluded from the learner fund if they are trying to gain a level 6 qualification or higher, despite the report recommendation that we should have a 60% graduate-led force by 2020.  In most cases there is no possibility of paid time to engage in mandatory continuous professional development.  There is no time for team meetings, supervision, on-the-job supports, development of community practice, etc.  There is a requirement to use S&iacute;olta and Aistear despite the lack of a national roll-out.  The inspection system is not fit for purpose and demonstrates little or no respect for the profession.  There is a funding and policy divide between care and education, resulting in a two-tier system for the professionals in terms of pay and conditions.  There is a lack of support for the inclusion of all children, regardless of additional needs.  Professionals are experiencing increased workloads and stress, due to the lack of sufficient personnel and resources, in trying to provide an inclusive environment for the children.  Professionals are working in a vacuum while waiting for the long-overdue national early years strategy, regulations and standards, a registration system and yet another layer of inspection.  Indeed, we do not know what else we are waiting for while we are waiting for that to hit us on the head.  There is a lack of job security as a result of the refusal by various Departments to develop and implement policies that prevent new services from opening at will and displacing or putting at a disadvantage existing high-quality services.  There is uncertainty due to shifting deadlines.  A recent example of this is the postponement of the minimum qualification deadline.  There was no consultation with the profession, although those involved are keen for there to be at least a minimum qualification for working in our profession.  Childminders are excluded from regulatory frameworks and most funding schemes.  The impact of this on the profession includes low morale, increased stress and burnout.<br/><br/>OECD research has pointed out that the ability of staff to attend to the needs of children is influenced not only by their level of education and training but also by external factors such as their work environment, salary and work benefits.  There will continue to be an increased difficulty in terms of attracting, training and retaining a suitably qualified workforce.  There is beginning to be a pull-back in the profession because of either reduced interest or reduced ability - due to low morale - to engage in continuous professional development and extracurricular activities, despite the fact that these have been taken at the personal and financial cost of those involved for the past 20 years, if not more.<br/><br/>We recommend a review of the quality agenda.  In our opinion it was not fit for purpose in the first place.  It should put the focus on the things that really count.  These include higher wages and better working conditions.  These are the things that affect people's job satisfaction, work motivation and, indirectly, the quality of teaching, caring and interactions with the children.<br/><br/>There needs to be a recognition and acceptance of early childhood education and care from birth to six years rather than only from three years upwards.  It should be seen as a public service and it needs to be publicly funded.  Investment needs to be incrementally increased in order that the provision is heavily subsidised for parents.  There needs to be an increase in the salaries of the workforce to enhance the status and quality of early childhood work.  Governments may wish to consider introducing equal working conditions, such as salaries, benefits and professional development opportunities, for equivalent qualifications across early childhood and primary education fields.  Care should be taken to ensure that in-service training is linked to career progression and to obtaining further qualifications.  This OECD recommendation dates from 2006.  There is a need to negotiate sectorally agreed pay scales linked to capitation payments and to increase investment to facilitate contracts that cover all aspects of the job, such as non-contact time.  For example, for every three or four hours a person is working with children, sufficient time should be given for documentation, planning, parent meetings, staff meetings, practice etc.  Again, the OECD has recommended time for staff to plan, develop, analyse and reflect, individually and collectively, on their work with children, as this is seen to improve quality.  That is a key measure.<br/><br/>There should be a minimum of five CPD days per year.  We are in favour of introducing the early childhood care and education scheme contract to cover 52 weeks of the year - we are upping it on other people.  This should include not only a 52-week year but also time for CPD, training and all the various aspects, including engagement with parents and so on.<br/><br/>There should be increased investment to facilitate lower child-staff ratios where services are supporting inclusion of children with additional needs, including those who are diagnosed and undiagnosed.  Again, this is somewhat different from the idea of looking for a special needs assistant.  If we had qualified, experienced people working within the sector and they had lower ratios, it would help in terms of inclusion.  If additional support over and above that is needed, then perhaps a special needs assistant may be necessary.  Under the current system a SNA does not have to be qualified beyond junior certificate level.  That needs to be looked at.<br/><br/>We are in favour of extending the learner fund to provide access to level 7 and level 8 training.  We favour an increase in investment to roll out the Aistear and S&iacute;olta programmes.  This should include training and resources.  As a stopgap measure, there should be significantly reduced levels of PRSI and all centres should be exempt from rates.  This would ensure additional funds to increase wages or improve working conditions.<br/><br/>We should recognise professional childminders providing a home-based equivalent, support moves to centre-based provision and regulate accordingly.  We should develop standards and regulations for out-of-school care and recreation.  We should carry out a detailed cost analysis of provision and ring-fence an appropriate budget to allow for professional pay and conditions.  In this way we can ensure this sector will not find itself in the same mess that we currently have in early childhood care and education.  We need to learn from past mistakes.  We need to engage in real consultation with our profession in terms of the policies being developed in an <i>ad hoc</i>fashion.  We hope the committee will work with us to prevent the further exploitation of this generous, caring and dedicated workforce.</p></speech>

They are welcome to our third session on the challenges facing this critical sector.  I congratulate the Association of Childhood Professionals on the fantastic work done in recent months in bringing this issue to the fore, including the public rally outside Leinster House in February as well as the regional rallies some weeks ago.  This has certainly helped our cause in highlighting the issues facing this critical sector.</p> <p>  I am pleased that a large portion of this morning's contributions focused on children with educational or additional needs.  Unfortunately, although there have been many positive developments in the sector in recent years, not least the free preschool year, the current situation is that children with special educational needs can be left out or refused a service because the required supports are not available.  There is an inconsistent approach throughout the country.</p> <p>  Before our meeting last week we got a memorandum from the Minister for Children and Youth Affairs, Deputy Reilly, with information on yet another interdepartmental group to examine how best to support early school years.  I am somewhat cynical at this stage.  We are four and half years in and here we have another group sitting down to talk about how to support the needs of the sector.  There seems to be almost a battle between the various Departments over which will actually take control of the issue.  The question is whether it will be the Department of Education and Skills, the Department of Health or the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  I thought the Department of Children and Youth Affairs was established to take the lead and be the main co-ordinator on issues such as this.</p> <p>  We have a report already.  In 2010, the Department of Education and Skills launched the framework for action for the inclusion of children with special educational needs in early education.  For the life of me, I cannot understand the need for a further report.  I welcome the fact that the deputation spoke at length on this issue and highlighted it.</p><p>This is a crucial area which, unfortunately, has been neglected for some years. </p><p> On improving the free preschool year scheme, while everyone acknowledges that this is a very good programme, some issues remain, not least the recent reduction in the capitation payment, the requirement for independent and community service providers to pay staff for 42 weeks when the State only pays them for 38 weeks each year to provide the scheme, and the lack of recognition for non-contact time, staff who are off sick and so forth.  The scheme must be improved with a view to introducing a second preschool year.  However, only when the first preschool year is operating properly should a second preschool year be introduced.</p><p> I was pleased to hear Ms McCormilla express the view that community-managed services need additional help and support.  I sit on the board of Ballynacargy community child care committee.  Many parents and others who join the boards of child care committees do not realise that this entails meeting a series of requirements and responsibilities.  Ms McCormilla is correct that training should be provided on governance issues and the types of support that the boards of community child care groups must provide.  </p><p> Community groups in general are facing a major challenge as a result of the abolition of community employment schemes.  Perhaps the witnesses know better than I do how community employment workers will be replaced in the community sector, of which their organisations are a critical component.  Without workers from community employment schemes, many community groups will close.</p><p> I have highlighted previously the issue of registration for childminders.  When legislation was being discussed in the D&aacute;il and Seanad, the Fianna F&aacute;il Party tabled amendments seeking to ensure that all childminders are required to obtain Garda clearance.  Unfortunately, the amendments were not accepted.  I am interested in hearing the witnesses' opinions on registration for childminders.  The position in Northern Ireland was noted.  While I am aware of differences of opinion on the introduction of tax credits for parents, I understand their introduction in Northern Ireland provided an incentive for many people to register as childminders, because parents could not avail of the credit unless the childminder was tax-compliant and registered with the Northern Ireland equivalent of Tusla.  I would welcome the witnesses' opinion on that matter. </p><p> The workforce development plan has been in place since 2010 but has not been implemented, which is unfortunate.  The current inspection system is not fit for purpose, as I have stated previously, owing to the duplication of inspections and the number of inspections required.  A new inspection system should be established, with one inspector inspecting all aspects of a child care service, rather than having several inspectors visit the same facility.</p><p> The new registration process was placed on a legislative footing in January 2014.  I am not sure whether it or the new regulations on registration have been rolled out.  The regulations were promised in the aftermath of the Prime Time expos&eacute; "A Breach of Trust".  </p><p> On commercial rates, if it is a requirement that inspectors from the Department of Education and Skills inspect a facility to have it designated as an educational premises, it follows that it must also be designated an educational facility in respect of commercial rates.  The Department cannot have it both ways.  These facilities provide early childhood care and education and should be exempted from a requirement to pay rates.  Such an exemption would help them to remain sustainable.</p></speech>

I was in the D&aacute;il asking questions of the Minister for Arts, Heritage and the Gaeltacht.</p> <p>  I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their contributions.  While I did not hear all of the presentations, I assure our guests that I read all the submissions yesterday and went through them with a fine toothcomb.  I compliment the witnesses on the quality of their submissions, which are detailed and well thought out.  Most people would find little in them with which they would disagree.  The issue is to figure out what our priorities should be, given that it will not be possible to achieve everything immediately.  A number of speakers referred to a timeframe up to 2020, which indicates that this is a long-term project.  We all know that affordable, accessible and high-quality child care services are required, and this will require substantial investment in the sector.</p> <p>  I will ask a few questions rather than making a long speech.  I will not ask questions on pay, although I recognise that professional child care workers are underpaid and many of them cannot secure mortgages or car loans and must take second jobs.  It is unacceptable that child care workers are paid more in many second jobs, such as bar or takeaway work.  The submissions provide great detail on the issue of pay. </p> <p>  The submission received from the Association of Childhood Professionals refers to the requirement to work with the S&iacute;olta and Aistear programmes "despite the lack of a national roll-out".  What training must be provided?  What types of module are required and within what timeframe must they be provided?</p> <p>  The National Childhood Network's submission states that the delivery of the programme should be of a high standard and rolled out in a co-ordinated, standardised manner.  The implication of this statement is that this is not currently the position.  Is that correct?</p> <p>  The joint committee discussed the issue of tax credits at previous hearings.  What are the witnesses' views on proposals to introduce child care tax credits for parents?</p> <p>  The National Childhood Network also proposes that "access to funding to subsidise the cost of childminding should also be made, possibly subject to childminders meeting agreed criteria".  How does it propose to achieve this outcome?</p> <p>  In light of recent strikes by child care workers in Germany, will the witnesses comment on the manner in which the German Government is addressing this issue?  What responses or solutions are being provided in Germany and can we learn from the experience there? </p> <p>  The need to increase capitation grants has been raised.  Will the witnesses provide precise figures on capitation grants in primary education?  Do the rates vary?  Unfortunately, I did not have time to check the figures on this, but I am aware that the witnesses made some comparisons.  </p> <p>  The issue of subventions has been raised on several occasions at my outreach meetings.  Should all providers, both in the private and community sectors, avail of the subvention?  Some communities do not have a community child care service.  This issue has arisen in my meetings and I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on it.  </p> <p>  How do our guests respond to the Minister's recent announcement that the Department does not have sufficient money to fund a second free preschool year?  Would capacity be a problem if a second preschool year were introduced immediately?</p> <p>  The Association of Childhood Professionals calls for increased investment to facilitate lower staff-child ratios where services are supporting children with special needs.  How would this be done?  Is the ACP suggesting that the capitation rate for children with special needs be increased, perhaps doubled?  Does this include support for special needs assistants?  What training is provided for staff to deal with children with complex additional needs?  I am sure some children have uncommon needs.  How are they dealt with?</p><p>How can participants on community employment, CE, schemes be used fairly and in a way which will ensure that they do not replace regular employees?</p><p> The issue of a degree-led workforce in the area of child care has arisen.  Some people have expressed the view that quality of care is often only gained with practical experience.  It has also been noted that a person with a level 8 degree may not be good on the practical side.  What kind of balance can be struck in this regard?</p><p> How can the position with regard to grant applications be improved and how can the process be made more accessible to providers?  In the current year an issue has arisen in respect of the community and private sectors and the way in which grants can be applied for.  Those in the private sector can only apply for a &euro;500 grant and this has been flagged as a matter of concern.</p><p> I am sure our guests will agree that two full years of access to preschool provision should be a right for children with special needs, regardless of how this time is divided up for use.  How can special equipment be better provided for these children?  It has also been brought to the attention of the committee that even though there is a system whereby children with special needs can divide up their preschool time over the two years on the basis of two days per week in the first year and three per week in the second, some children with these needs remain undiagnosed so they cannot avail of this.  If children are diagnosed during the year and if it is found that they are not fit to attend mainstream schools, they will be obliged to remain at home for the year if their parents cannot afford to pay.  How can we counteract this?  That to which I refer strengthens further the argument to the effect that if children have additional needs, they should be entitled to two years of free preschool provision.  Another issue that arises relates to the facts that children who may only be attending preschool for two or three days per week are obliged to attend for five days per week when they move to primary school.</p></speech>

These hearings have been very helpful to the members of the committee.  I wish to declare an interest in that I am chair of Early Childhood Ireland.  However, my role in that regard is one of governance.</p> <p>  A point that has arisen at each of our hearings relates to staff and professional qualifications.  Each of our guests touched on this point, but Ms Quinn, in particular, commented in more detail in respect of it.  When the level of costs involved in providing child care are discussed in the media, it seems as if some people are pocketing big bucks.  However, I do not know the location of those big bucks.  Ms Quinn referred to the number of staff being on the brink.  I have spoken to many child care providers who are on the brink and to others who have actually gone out of business.  In the past year, all too many child care facilities have closed down.  Ms Quinn also referred to the importance of non-contact hours.  The committee has been repeatedly informed of the need for staff to sign on for 14 weeks.  In what other profession would this be acceptable?  No one stated at the beginning of the recession that in respect of primary and second school teachers the State could no longer afford to pay their wages during the summer months.  However, it appears that it is acceptable to do this to professionals.  What Ms Quinn stated about bringing continuing professional development, CPD, days into the mix would be quite a useful way to proceed.  The situation here is similar to that which applies when one is playing the game Buckaroo.  We are piling so many things on top each of each other and everyone is just waiting for the whole thing to fall.  The committee is very conscious of that fact.</p> <p>  One of the other issues about which the committee is concerned is that relating to the family resource element being provided by child care professionals and for which they are not being given time.  The committee may need to take this matter into consideration when compiling its report.  These professionals play a vital role in the context of dealing with parents.  They may only engage in brief conversations at the front door to the facility but this constitutes a huge family resource at community level at a time when parents need it.</p> <p>  The issue of inspections has arisen on several occasions, as has the fact that there are multiple layers involved and that these are almost suffocating.  It is ridiculous that public health nurse positions at assistant director level are being advertised.  There appears to be no problem spending money on very senior inspectors but public health nurses - whom I absolutely admire - are not qualified to inspect early child care settings.  Who do our guests believe should be leading the inspections?  Obviously, I am of the view that there is a particular model there for education but our guests' views on the matter might be different and I would welcome hearing them.</p> <p>  There is a need for us to remain conscious of the issue relating to childminders.  Deputy Troy is correct: when the vetting legislation was introduced, a number of us tabled amendments in respect of vetting and Childminding Ireland supported our efforts in that regard.  There is a reticence to become involved in the family home and in respect of the role of parents.  There is a need to be conscious of the increasing use of au pairs.  This is also a matter which must be acknowledged in the committee's report.  The more we continue to push people one way or another, the more these issues will arise.</p> <p>  The committee must deal with a big issue and I am still trying to work out how I feel about it.  For that reason, I very much welcome Ms Bradley's and Ms McCormilla's presentation on special and additional needs and how we deal with them.  At the outset I was of the view that we should simply transfer what is done in primary schools to preschool level.  I am becoming more informed, however, and I believe that the latter should absolutely not be the case.  It is great that parents of children with such needs can have them in preschool for two days per week in the first year and three per week in the second.  However, this does not work for providers because they must obviously have staff on the premises each day.  I do not know how they are supposed to pay people's wages when they themselves are only paid on the basis of the number of days each child spends in their facilities.  If a child stops attending for any reason - be it medical or whatever - the fee is taken back from the provider, which makes absolutely no sense.  Deputy McLellan highlighted the transition to primary school and how this should be dealt with in the case of children with special needs.  I support what was said in respect of ratios, particularly as this issue does not relate to a single geographical area but is, rather, national in nature.  The question that arises in this regard relates to how we draw on specialised supports fairly and in a way that will increase the outcomes for the children involved.  I am almost but not quite there in terms of identifying how we might proceed in this regard.</p> <p>  I welcome Ms McCormilla's distinction in terms of using the word "independent" as opposed to those of "private" or "community".  I have not heard the matter described thus before.  It is too easy to try to split the two sectors.  The only difference I can see between them relates to rates.  Otherwise, they are equally faced with different challenges.  There can be great quality child care provisions in both sectors and also care that is appalling in quality.</p> <p>  It is obvious that we have all the answers but the difficulty is that the interdepartmental group is going to be obliged to make some critical choices.  On the higher level choice as to whether it is about investment or tax credits, I am a proponent of investment.  In terms of the choices to which I refer, we have discussed children with special and additional needs, improving the position regarding both the first and second year of provision, S&iacute;olta, Aistear and various different proposals.  We can all agree that these are all things which need to be done.  Will our guests indicate what they would do first?  We must make choices and, in that context, what should be given priority and done first?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2664" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marian Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061800002#H00400"><p>In the context of investment, where should we start and what single issue should we prioritise, I wish to begin by stating that I am extremely upset in the context of how matters are given priority.  I have worked in early childhood care provision for just over 20 years.  Sometimes I signed on but on other occasions I just could not bring myself to do it, so I used to max out my credit card during the summer months.  I now work in the public sector - I am a lecturer in early childhood in Cork IT and I am awfully conflicted because I am valued and I am in receipt of a wage about which I have no issue and to which, I believe, people should be entitled.  I have no intention of taking away from the work I currently do.  However, I would have thought that the work I did for 18 years prior to taking up my position in Cork IT was equally if not more valuable than that in which I am currently involved.  However, that work attracted neither recognition nor value.  Now I work a particular number of hours each week, I receive holiday pay during the summer months, etc.  That is absolutely brilliant and I think I am entitled to it but I think early childhood professionals are equally entitled to such conditions.  It is so wrong that people's conditions improve as they move from primary to secondary to third level but that the contribution of those who provide the foundation for all those students with whom I now work is not valued and so on.  We must ask questions as to the vision we have for our children and the type of society in which we want them to live.</p><p>I do not like the society we are in at the moment.  The challenge for the Cabinet, Government backbenchers and the Opposition is that we cannot work within the narrow frame we are in now.  I was at the interdepartmental group and they asked what things should be prioritised.  I was very cross and stated that I objected to being at a table where it was considered what one would do with the money that is there now with no increase in investment.  I thought that was a conversation we cannot be having.  When something in society is valued, money is found for it.  Now that there is more money in the economy, we can see that money is being found for the public sector.  I am not saying that should be taken away, but one might question where the priorities lie.</p><p> Qualifications and experience are equal and I would not value one over the other.  Each one adds to the next thing and we have to start somewhere.  Some people may have fantastic experience having gone for various training courses over time, which must be recognised and valued.  We are in a narrow period of transition, moving towards what will be a qualified workforce because those coming into it now will get qualifications before they enter.  We need the support because the people in it who have that experience can be retained, valued and supported.  </p><p> The workforce development plan examined the recognition of prior learning to see what could be done so that people can put together a portfolio of all their experience and all the CPD qualifications they have gained.  Work had been done on a model but it got dumped in the background.  </p><p> As regards regulations and registration we do not know because we have not seen them.  We asked for a consultation on the regulations and were told that they were not changing very much from the last ones.  We were told that we were consulted on that years ago and did not need to input into it again.  In reality, however, that is not true.  One would hope the regulations will be significantly different, otherwise why is it taking so long to develop them?  </p><p> Ms Hart and Ms McCormilla will give more information on the roll-out requirements for Aistear and S&iacute;olta.  People have to be supported with the required training and resources.  Some of it is for existing practitioners who can fully engage with it, but it also relates to the colleges.  We have had Aistear since 2006 and S&iacute;olta since 2010.  If comprehensive training was given to colleges and people delivering those programmes, we would have a whole workforce coming out now who are completely up to date with Aistear and S&iacute;olta.  It would have a cascade effect instead of trying to put intensive supports in place.  </p><p> During the strike in Germany, the poor devils were out for four or five weeks and then the unions pulled the rug from under them.  Apparently it has now gone to mediation.  When it comes to mediation and discussion, that is where we have been for years, yet we have advanced nowhere, so I am not very hopeful in that regard.</p><p> I agree that the scheme should be accessible for all and money should follow the children.  If a child with disadvantage does not have a community setting, then that child should obviously be able to access it.  It is not about who is providing it, it is about the child getting the absolute best.  As Ms McCormilla said earlier, it relates to that kind of quality.  </p><p> The Minister stated that a second ECCE scheme year could not be afforded, but if it was a priority it would be affordable.  The fact is, however, that it is not a priority.  The Minister also said that the employers choose what to pay, but that is rubbish because they do not.  If the Government provides x amount of money to pay all of the expenses, then the Government is limiting what can actually be paid to practitioners.  </p><p> A previous Minister told us that the Government could not interfere with the regulation of childminders because it is a private arrangement between the family and the childminder.  Other than the ECCE scheme, what is happening in a centre base is a private relationship between a family and a provider.  They are able to regulate that, however, so they cannot have it both ways.  The authorities need to engage on this matter.</p><p> I have a lot more to say but I will leave it open to other speakers. </p></speech>

There seems to be an argument for direct investment in services or tax credits.  In Northern Ireland we have both, so it is not an either-or situation.  We would advocate that direct investment should go to services.  We do see a need for lower income families to be able to come out of the poverty trap.  That is one thing the tax credits would support families in Northern Ireland to be able to do.  People did not register with childminders just because of that, however, they also registered because they knew they were signing up to a system whereby they were coming from the black market and would be regulated.  Even though that was minimal at the beginning, they only had to sign up to one page of things.</p> <p>  The following year it increased and that is how we moved the child protection issue on because they had to avail of training.  At the beginning all they had to do was ensure they had safety check lists in place, were moving towards child protection training and could show elements of play within their service.</p> <p>  The year after that it moved on and they are now working towards being in line with a full-day care service as regards legislation.  It can be done, therefore.  I also wish to pick up on what Ms Quinn said about ECCE schemes and things being for the private and public good.  The reason we want a national media campaign is to ensure that people in the wider society and within all strands of early childhood, understand that learning begins from birth and not at the school gate.  That is why it needs to be seen as a public good from birth.  We advocate therefore that it is not an either-or situation.  We can see how childminders can be brought into that.  </p> <p>  We have a lot to learn from Northern Ireland, but it is a two-way process as Ms McCormilla said concerning the IFI project also.  Lowering the ratio within early childhood services would support children with additional needs.  Even if they have difficult additional needs, when children first come it is for a holistic experience of their early childhood place.  They come with a range of needs but should be able to gain a good experience all round, not just because of their particular need.  </p> <p>  When I am working with services, when a child comes, we support him or her by seeing how we can make the environment fit the child.  How will the practice be inclusive so that the child gets the best experience alongside its peers?  It takes time and effort to be able to do that, which is why we need the additional non-contact time and the capitation that goes with it.</p></speech>

It strikes me that so much has been written and said, and there are many people with different opinions.  Some of them agree, while others are totally opposed, so we need to keep things as simple as possible.  That is why I went back to the IFI project, which was funded in the late 1990s.  It gave an example of services in Northern Ireland and the southern Border counties.  They were poor services, but were given the opportunity with three years' funding for measurable improvement to take place.  At the time, they were committee-managed services but governance was poor.  There were no proper governance structures in place, so the first thing was to establish such a structure.</p> <p>  Management of responsibilities for pay and HR were carried out by national organisations, rather than local parents having to do so.  Parents did a certain amount, however, and the parents' committee was re-established.  Staff were given a contract, proper job descriptions according to their roles, and were paid for a three-year period.  If they were delivering a service for three hours a day, 15 hours, they were paid for 25 hours.  That might be a jump too far at this point in time, but if it was even a case of one hour a day extra it would allow them to do the additional work that is absolutely necessary.  Either it does not get done or it is done in people's own time.  As the burden increases, it is impossible for people to do all that work in their own time, especially with education-focused inspections and all the requirements involved.</p><p> Considerable work remains to be done to meet the 16 S&iacute;olta standards.  We have to meet all of them, starting with standard No. 15 on legislation and regulations because a significant number of services are not in full compliance with the regulations.  The services with which I was involved had to meet the standards and regulations.  S&iacute;olta and Aistear were not in place at that stage, but they had to meet the standards of the high scope curriculum training programme, which supports children's learning and development in partnership with parents.  Staff had to participate in continuing professional development on a monthly basis for their first year, attend cluster group training with an appropriately inspirational trained instructor and show measurable practice.  A service evaluation system was devised to show them how they had progressed and could improve.  They also had external support.  Now we have inspections, the better start mentoring system and support staff employed through voluntary and community organisations and county child care committees.  The county child care committees can also help on governance issues.  An external evaluation was conducted at the end of the three year programme.  As adviser to the service during this period, I saw demonstrable progress from an originally poor quality of service, albeit delivered with great heart, once the necessary conditions and ingredients were in place.</p><p> On the complexity of funding schemes and the question of subventing independent and private providers, there is, for example, only one committee managed service in Letterkenny.  Parents in one of the fastest growing towns in the country need access to affordable child care.  I would be inclined to suggest we should get rid of the separation between private, community and independent services.  They are governed by the same legislation and the same standards and have to pay their staff.  There should not be a divide between private and community child care services.  Community and independent providers should not have to pay rates if they are working within the system.  We know how much money is required to pay staff and meet the additional costs involved.  A capitation system might be an alternative way of funding services.  I do not know the level of capitation paid to schools, but that system appears to work.  The capitation system revolutionised secondary education in the 1960s.</p><p> It is time for radical change in the child care sector.  Those of us who have been involved in it for many years believe we are chasing our tails in trying to make the best of bad policies, inadequate training, poor pay and limited understanding.  We get tired of all the external reports on the poor quality of child care services in Ireland.  We can do better, but we must start small and make it simple by identifying where the money should be spent and how much in total is available through the various schemes.  We know from the Pobal reports how many work in the sector, their qualifications and the positions in which they work.  We should begin by considering what salaries ought to be paid based on a national salary scale which we have prepared.  That would allow us to estimate the cost of paying staff who work in the sector and decide how we could make better use of existing funding.  I would investigate how we could make better use of what we have before looking for additional funding.  We could make better use of what we have by working in a more integrated way.  We are all inclined to work in silos.  How could we take a nationally co-ordinated, integrated and strategic approach involving all of the various players involved?  When I started 30 years, nothing was in place.</p></speech>

L&aacute;mh provides ongoing specialist training in this area and we try to anticipate where children will access services in order that we can plan training for providers in advance.  The same applies to the picture exchange communication system, PECS, and early intervention teams in the case of sensory processing difficulties.  All staff receive floor time training, as well as training in the management of epilepsy and administering buccal midazolam and percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy, PEG, feeding.  These needs should not be a barrier to inclusion.</p></speech>

We should not be providing a separate special needs module.  It should be part and parcel of the training programme.  Sometimes there is initial enthusiasm, but when one returns, the staff have gone back to their old habits.  That is why it should be standardised as part of the curriculum.  I am not much of an advocate for special needs services because the trainer should be a facilitator with the courage and strength to avoid being a barrier to inclusion.  Sometimes the simple fact of a child's presence can alter the relationship.  I have seen children with additional needs in mainstream settings.  It brings out the best in small children when they look after their classmate.  That is quality care.</p></speech>

When children are included in such a setting, we can examine the additional support needs, whether PEG feeding or epilepsy management.</p><p>That is where one then considers what supports are needed for an individual education plan to support the particular needs of a child and in a high quality setting that promotes holistic development for all children.</p></speech>

In that service it was not so much finding out what was wrong with a child before he or she came but of a child coming into a setting and seeing what additional supports were needed.  It was a question which was asked as to how it could be done.  If we are valued and recognised as professionals who have received training - this is why training is hugely important to enable us to be professional when it comes to inclusion and the question of how to include - regardless of whether a child has an additional need as a result of a disability or condition or being part of an ethnic minority or from a disadvantaged area, it is all about inclusion.  If I am sufficiently professional to know it when such a child comes into my service, I will know whether I can include him or her very well by myself without needing anything.  Perhaps I might need resources to buy things to make the child be more visual in the setting in order that he or she can see himself or herself within it and develop his or her identity as a result.  At other times, however, I will be able to acknowledge that I am obliged to spend a lot of additional time with the child in question, which is time I will be unable to spend with the other children and perhaps the person who is in the room with me essentially will be left with 20 other children.  I will then know that I need additional personnel.  That is where the community employment scheme was particularly beneficial in community services - I worked in a community service in the afternoon while at the same time working in the independent service - and it was evident that by having these additional personnel, they were able to continue the work, under supervision, with everybody else.  For us, however, they were supernumerary; therefore, we had our core staff and were then able to employ additional assistants.  It may now be necessary to provide this through a fund in order that we will be in a position to include the child or call on this support as needed.</p> <p>  On opting for the special needs assistant, SNA, model, I carried out research with a colleague into SNAs in primary schools and the finding - looking across the board - was that children who needed the most support were being supported by the least qualified personnel and that this was not helping the children particularly.  When one considers the position in Ireland in terms of the qualifications required to be an SNA, essentially, it is junior certificate.  SNAs have to undertake some training, which I acknowledge is good.  I had colleagues apply for an SNA job only to be told they were overqualified, despite having had received significant training on how to deal with children with additional needs.  However, because they had FETAC level 6 qualifications at the time - some of them now have degrees - they were told they were overqualified for the post because they did not need such qualifications.  They were told a SNA needed to be present to keep a child from running away, to help him or her go to the toilet or to help him or her with feeding.  That is not a great model.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2679" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rose Bradley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061800002#L00800"><p>While I am not here to talk specifically about SNA training, this point actually brings it up quite nicely.  We must acknowledge there are huge training issues when it comes to special needs assistants, even as noted for children in primary and secondary school.  In addition, while the therapists I know who work with children with particular disabilities are not there to formally train the staff who may be working in a preschool, they are very much there to provide support.  Therefore, as the others have noted, where one is able to include a child, staff and services will know that there are other services available with which they can collaborate and on which they can draw, whether it be the Central Remedial Clinic, CRC, Enable Ireland or the Health Service Executive, HSE, and that there are therapists who are involved with a particular child.  As I stated previously, each child is an individual; therefore, one is considering the needs of a particular child, drawing on the supports available in that child's life and finding out about his or her needs.  While that is not formal training, it very much encompasses support and guidance specifically for that child.<br/><br/>To revert to the comment about the split preschool year, I agree completely.  As I stated in my submission, parents have told me the entire provision for taking the time <i>pro rata</i>over two years where a child has particular needs works very well for families in the first year.  This is because where a child has particular additional needs and may be undergoing many medical procedures, very unwell and missing a lot of days, families have stated only having two days per week works perfectly in the first year.  When it comes to the second year, however, the year before school, the child really needs to be attending from Monday to Friday, inclusive.  I am speaking from the perspective of working as a social worker with children with disabilities and if one were giving consideration to prioritising where the funding was spent, one might consider prioritising children with disabilities or additional needs to have access to a full second year.  <br/><br/>There was also a question about necessary equipment and how children could access it.  My experience of and opinion on that question is that where a child has equipment needs owing to his or her disability, one has the relevant therapist making the prescription which is then sanctioned by the HSE.  <br/><br/>There is one other point on which I wish to conclude.  Even if, in an ideal world, all children with additional needs were given a second full year, without the necessary support, that is, the actual body in the preschool room, they would still be unable to attend preschool.  Consequently, as was noted, it is really important either to consider extending SNA provision to children in preschools or, as my colleagues were suggesting, look at increasing the ratio of staff in preschools.  It is about having access to actually go the school.  To be able to participate actively in a real way, one needs the additional bodies.</p></speech>

As an educationist, I am really interested in how they have their staff trained in the picture exchange communication system, PECS.  Ms Lacey-Crowe then spoke about the delivery of speech therapy services, which is wonderful.  We have never managed to do this in a primary school setting in which special needs assistants would provide that service or in which teachers would be trained by the therapists she mentioned.  As this is something really new about which members have never heard, I am delighted to hear it.  Am I correct in stating both public and private services are being delivered?</p></speech>

While the comparison is being made with primary schools, they were set up in 1831 and I can tell the delegates that there are still problems in primary school education.  Three years ago, on foot of the results from PISA, it was a huge wake-up call.  We are at a watershed, in that early childhood provision is under consideration.  It was examined previously in the middle of the huge Celtic tiger period in which money was flung left, right and centre and wasted.  It was thrown at buildings; buildings that probably were not needed were built in villages and towns.  Now, however, this is the important part and where everyone must work together to make sure the best model is acquired for children in the first instance, as they are the most important people in this debate.</p> <p>  Ms Quinn mentioned a figure of 25,000 teachers or educationists involved in delivery.  Perhaps she might not have the statistics to hand, but one issue is whether we will have a graduate force.  Out of the aforementioned 25,000 people, how many have qualifications to FETAC levels 5, 6, 7 and 8 in order that we can raise standards for everyone?  I am aware of the work done in St. Nicholas Montessori College Ireland in the training of Montessori teachers.  I am also aware that many of the teachers who qualify wish to go back into the primary system because it is better paid and there are better terms and conditions.  Consequently, it is difficult to hold qualified graduates in the early childhood sector.</p><p>I want the numbers.  The ladies have given a fantastic vision today and Ms McCormilla said she was looking at some figures.  What kind of figures is she looking at?  We have to manage what is delivered but we also have to manage expectation.  It is very easy for some people to promise the world but it does not work like that any more.  There have to be budgets and someone has to pay.  We have to know if there is value for money so I want to know what moneys the witnesses are thinking about.</p><p> We in Government want the best and we are at a watershed but the witnesses should not be taken in by people who will promise them the world.  We are trying to do what is best for children and for the sector, to make sure we attract people and maintain a really good workforce who can get mortgages.  I know plenty of preschool teachers who cannot get mortgages and that is not good enough.</p></speech>

I no longer hold the responsibility of children's spokesperson as my colleague, Deputy Sandra McLellan, recently took over that role very competently.</p> <p>  I will take each of the presentations in turn.  A number called for a second ECCE year, with Ms Bradley the first to do so.  I absolutely endorse that as it is most certainly very important.  It was also suggested that consideration be given to increasing the number of community preschools and I would also endorse that view but can the witnesses expand on how that might be promulgated, encouraged and facilitated?  Ms Bradley's closing recommendation was that innovative ways be looked at for the provision of support training and supervision of SNAs.  Has she any particular suggestions as to innovation that would lead to the provision of support training and the supervision of SNAs?</p> <p>  I welcome Ms Lacey-Crowe again.  She spoke about changing language and it is welcome to hear about additional needs.  Ms McCormilla used the word "independent" and this kind of language was not applied in all the engagements I had as spokesperson on children for 13 years.  I welcome this more thoughtful use of language.  Ms Lacey-Crowe and Ms McCormilla both made a point about the difficulty there is with so many stakeholders being involved, all with a different focus.  Can Ms Lacey-Crowe expand on that?  How does it manifest itself?  How can we move towards a more cohesive, streamlined or even a single service across the board?  Would that be an objective?</p> <p>  I welcome Ms McCormilla and thank her for all her many years of service in this area.  I also recognise her guidance and support during her time with the Border counties child care network.  I had the opportunity to visit her in direct service provision many years ago and remember it very well.  She talked about streamlining the free preschool year scheme, the community child care subvention scheme and the child care education and training programme into a single body, with centrally-funded salaries across the board, as part of the move towards greater simplification.  Regardless of whether the service is independent or committee-managed, what difficulties does she see with this?  Does she envisage any issues?  She spoke about the differences in dealing with the differential between the independent provider and the community-based, committee-managed system and whether rates should impact.  The rates should not impact as this is about children rather than the provider so there should be no rates across the board.  We were talking about simplification but that is the simple answer.</p> <p>  In her earlier responses Ms McCormilla spoke about capitation and making allowances for other costs.  How does she deal with all of that?  Our rapporteur and my close friend and party colleague is beside me and I want to say in her presence that it should be moved from 38 to 42 weeks and should be across the year, and that is only a starting point.  She also called for a second ECCE preschool year and I absolutely agree.  Her observation that qualifications do not guarantee the achievement of quality standards and services applies across the board and in everything.</p> <p>  Proposal 3 was for a registration system for childminders similar to that north of the Border.  Under whose oversight and inspection would this be and who would be the registering authority?  Would it be the Department of Children and Youth Affairs?  A call was made for the reconvening of an enhanced national childcare co-ordinating committee and this is very important and something which needs to be restated.  I have nothing to add to the points made but I emphasis it because I do not want it to slip aside.</p> <p>  I thank Ms Quinn for a very spirited delivery.  She made a number of points that hit me.  It is very interesting and very welcome to note the statistics giving the number involved as 25,000, which does not take on board the 19,000 childminders.  I was deputising for my colleague recently on one of the children's Bills and I made the case for the regulation of childminders but the Minister stoically refused.  I do not know if any of the witnesses saw the exchange.  Deputy McLellan was in the Chamber but Senator van Turnhout was here.  Point 8 in Ms Quinn's recommendation was to recognise professional childminders as providing a home-based equivalent to central-based provision and to regulate and support accordingly.  I absolutely agree and I sadly have to share with her that, in recent weeks, the Minister sat where she is and said "No".  That needs to be picked up on and to be pressed.  Why does it take us a lifetime to get to the right place?</p></speech>

They all went to community playschool, which at the time was run by local people who had dedication not only to education, but to dealing with children's needs.  I was very proud of it and I thought that playschool was a significant part of my children's lives.  I will continue to say that.</p><p> The delegates have been comprehensive in their contributions and offered very interesting views.  I like Ms McCormilla's emphasis on keeping things simple.  Too many issues are made unnecessarily uncomplicated, and we might need to turn the clock back in some instances.  The delegates are here today because this committee has prioritised the issue of child care provision in its work programme.  In the time I have been a member of the committee, we have had many hearings on various issue and produced a number of reports.  One such engagement that comes immediately to mind is our discussion on the provisions contained in the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013.  As a result of the intensive work done in this committee on that legislation, proposals were progressed which will have a major impact on many people's lives.  Other reports the committee has produced have likewise assisted in the process of enacting useful legislation.  We will continue to engage in that type of work.</p><p> In that context, I am very pleased to have the delegates here this morning to discuss these important matters.  Even if we each had half an hour to speak, we would not have time to address all the interesting points that were raised.  What particularly struck me from Ms Lacey-Crowe's presentation was her indication of the number of stakeholders involved.  That is a key issue and relates to Ms McCormilla's point about the importance of keeping it simple.  How can we reduce the number of people with their hands in the pot in the context of what should be a simple process?  It is an important consideration when it comes to improving child care provision, whether in community cr&egrave;ches, private cr&egrave;ches or for children with intellectual disabilities.</p><p> I was very impressed by Ms Bradley's presentation, which was easy to read and understand.  What is most impressive, however, is the work she does, including with one of the schools in Clondalkin, through the Central Remedial Clinic.  I know several people who are involved in working with the children concerned and am aware of the great work the CRC does.</p><p> I do not wish to start an argument with Deputy Troy that might come to blows.  I will not seek to rebut some of the points he made because there is not time to do so, but I might point him in the direction of some facts he should look up after the meeting.  However, we will not go into that now.</p><p> I thank the delegates for their inspiring contributions.  Our work begins when they leave.  We must carefully go through all the points that were raised with a view to agreeing on simple steps that can be taken to make child care services in this country better for every child.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2689" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1150" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061800002#N00200"><p>I welcome the witnesses and thank them for their comprehensive presentations.  I apologise for having to leave for a time to participate in a Commencement debate in the Seanad.  One of the points that struck me when listening to the presentations is that what is lacking in this area is long-term planning.  We need to set out a five-year and ten-year programme showing where we are at and where we need to be in the coming years.  We need, too, to initiate a process of careful planning in respect of the cost issues and what is the best way of providing a high-quality service that also represents a good deal for taxpayers.  After all, it is taxpayers who must pay for that service.  Have any of the groups examined the cost issue and the type of investment that is required on a year-by-year basis in the next five to ten years?</p> <p>  The lack of co-ordination of services for people with disabilities is a major concern.  I recently helped two families to file complaints with the Ombudsman relating to housing issues.  While a comprehensive service is being provided to people with disabilities from a health care point of view, there is no co-ordination of other services such as housing.  One sees much more of that type of co-ordinated approach in other countries.  Health, education and housing are three key areas of concern to people with disabilities, but the services are not working together.  From the delegates' experience, how do they see that type of co-ordination developing?  Reference was made to people in lower socio-economic groups not getting the same type of health service as that afforded to other groups.  The same applies in respect of housing and it is something we need to address.  The question is how to ensure people have access to all services.  In the two cases to which I referred, even though the persons concerned have severe disabilities, the local authority is treating them as simply a number on a list, with no priority given to them over people with very minor disabilities.  I was very surprised to discover this was the case.  Will the delegates comment on that?</p> <p>  I thank the witnesses for the work they are doing and for their comprehensive presentations.  Their contribution will feed into our efforts to ensure there is a greater focus on long-term planning in this area.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2691" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Rose Bradley" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061800002#N00400"><p>Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in asked about the comment in my submission about increasing the numbers of community preschools.  The thinking behind it is that as it stands, as my colleagues have noted, independent preschool providers do not have access to all available subventions.  This is relevant for families living in particular locations - I am thinking of certain families I know and the issues they encounter - whose child has a physical disability, say, which requires his or attendance at a preschool that is physically accessible.  The independently-owned facility down the road may be very welcoming to such a child but might not physically be able to accommodate him or her.  The rationale for increasing the number of community preschools is that it would mean people have access to a greater selection of facilities that have access to subventions.  Having listened to other speakers' comments this morning, however, I agree that another option might be to extend the subvention to all preschools, both private and community facilities.</p> <p>  The Deputy also asked about my reference to innovative ways of addressing the training issue.  This touches on Senator Colm Burke's point about how important it is to draw on the services we already have.  Although we are focusing this morning on what is missing from the service, it is important, too, to keep in mind what is in place.  There is a significant amount of experience within the Central Remedial Clinic.  In my job as a social worker, I am constantly collaborating with lots of other agencies and professionals.  It is a question of how we can draw on the experience and wealth of knowledge that is there.  Some type of structure for channelling all that information and experience into addressing the training issue would be helpful.  I hope that answers the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

Sometimes it happens that a case may fall between different stools, with different people saying it is not their responsibility.  That makes the whole process very difficult and can lead to a situation where we lose sight of the child.  The child must be priority in all of this; everything else is below that.</p> <p>  I like Ms McCormilla's idea of keeping things simple.  Certainly, there should be streamlined documentation process so that people are not filling out the same information over and over again.  That type of repetition creates a large paper exercise.</p><p>A person may have ticked all the boxes but has he or she delivered?  That is the big thing.  </p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2694" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Denise McCormilla" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061800002#O00200"><p>It is absolutely right that we must begin with the child.  However, we really need to take a little time out.  I know the Government would like reports to be done by the end of June.  It would be brilliant if everything that was required to be done was done but I do now know if that could happen.  We have to study where we are at this point in time.  We need a baseline of what is out there.  Much more information is gathered now than we would have gathered in years gone by.  For instance, Pobal has been doing reports on the child care sector for the past number of years.  The report for 2014 should be ready, or is almost ready.  That gives specific information which could be worked on in planning for the future.  On issues and problems, reports were compiled last year on compliance with regulations and the specific difficulties from a compliance with legislation perspective.<br/><br/>We should be familiar with what we have and know who has qualifications from levels 5, 6, 7, and 8.  The reality is very few have level 8 and few have level 7, but the majority all have level 5 qualifications now.  That might seem very little.  However, when we think back to a few years ago, the majority of people had nothing other than possibly the old Irish Preschool Play Association, IPPA, 20 hour introductory course.  That is not that long ago.  There has been a huge increase in access to qualifications.  The difficulty is that every time people do a programme and obtain a qualification, there are always gaps.  That is just the way it is.  In particular, in relation to S&iacute;olta and Aistear, there are a lot of people who obtained their level 5 qualification before 2012 when there was a complete revision of the Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, programmes.  They would, therefore, never have heard anything about S&iacute;olta or Aistear in the FETAC level 5 programmes, which is why we say there is a huge need for continuing professional development.  Level 6 is really for people in supervisory positions and people may not be ready to move onto level 7 or level 8, or it may not be available.  <br/><br/>The Competence Requirements in Early Childhood Education and Care, CoRe, report, recommends that 60% be degree-led.  We are a long way from achieving that target.  Ireland needs to agree what it wants from a graduate-led sector.  However, we have to start from where we are now.  It is not possible to get rid of all the people who are working in services, with their current level of qualification.  However, we have to try to do the best we can to ensure they are the right people.  It is like a crossroads for people working within the sector.  They need to know what is ahead of them next year.  We already know there are huge changes.  September 2016 is a real crossroads.  People will need to examine and determine if they want to continue to work within this sector.  If they do, they will have to raise the bar and know what it is they need to do.  If they do not want to do it or are not able to do it, they can leave the sector.  There are lots of younger people coming in through the degree programmes who would like to work in the sector but who cannot because they need to work full-time unlike me a number of years ago when it suited me to work a few hours every week as a preschool leader.<br/><br/>We have to see where we are at, what has happened, what are the numbers and who has the different level qualifications.  If they were linked into the national salary scale we are proposing, then we would know that so many people at level 5 should be on one particular scale, so many at level 6 should be on another and so many at level 7 and 8 should be on another one.  We would then need an economist or someone who is good at maths - I am not - to quantify what that would cost.  I do not think that would be hard to do with the level of information we currently have.  <br/><br/>The other issue concerns community preschools.  Our attitude is that every service should be a service that is at the heart of the community.  What the management structure is does not matter.  We have seen this over the years.  These are the most brilliant independently managed services.  They put families and children at the heart of their communities and at the centre of their practices.  Equally, we have seen very mediocre and very poor providers.  <br/><br/>People have had access to funding.  We have a legacy of past Government policies, some of which have helped but some of which have created additional problems.  Why have we got 70% of services in this country delivered by private providers?  It is because of the Government schemes of grant aid that were available in the past.  We have what we have because of what happened in the past, so how do we change it?  We need to say to all services, regardless of their management structure, that they must comply with legislation, put the child first, adhere to services whereby the rights of the child are at the forefront of what they do and then they meet their S&iacute;olta standards and within that is Aistear.  We have seen that happen with about 120 services which, in the past year or so, have met that higher standard level.  They are really good services.  We can aspire to that but we know we need more in order to be able to do it.  <br/><br/>In response to an earlier question about childminders, many parents use childminders but there are many childminders who are not delivering services within their own home.  They are going to the home of the child.  They need to fall within this registration system.  Many people use <i>au pairs</i>- sometimes it is richer people who are using <i>au pairs</i>- but is that in the best interests of the child?  Everything we do has got to be influenced by our five national goals or outcomes, which are coming through the Better Outcomes, Brighter Futures policy document.  We do not have our early years strategy yet but there is much which will guide us in the future.  <br/><br/>Someone asked a question about who should do the inspections.  Given her experience in Northern Ireland, Ms Hart might respond to that question. </p></speech>

It is a very gentle way, but they are still registered with social services, which would be the equivalent of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs.  In terms of the leads going forward, because we believe children's learning begins from birth, we believe it should be the responsibility of the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

We consider that really important but it is not interdepartmental.  It is brilliant to have committees like this, where there are politicians from different parties, but the other plea we would make is for cross-party support for what happens for our children in the future.  This would be so useful, especially with an election coming up.  Parties need to strive to work together, just as we all need to do.  There is competition between us and we work in our own silos but, in the best interests of children and this country, we really have to be trying to do the right thing.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-06-18a.2697" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Ms Marian Quinn" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015061800002#O00500"><p>When talking about early childhood care and education, we are talking about the way it is delivered.  We are saying there are three ways to deliver it.  I would say it is a public service and is delivered in three different ways because it is contracted.  The Government, since it became involved in early childhood care and education, has not taken the ball and opened centres itself.  It has contracted and paid money for other people to do it on its behalf.  Even when we talk about the ECCE scheme, we speak about how the Government subsidises early childhood care and education but it does not subsidise it.  It contracts people to deliver it on its behalf and it gets fierce value for money because it does it on the cheap and through the exploitation of the people working in those services.  That issue needs to be examined.</p> <p>  Prioritising where we spend the money is difficult because it is almost like pitting children against each other.  What does one do?  Some children have additional needs but there are all the other children in the country as well who have their childhood.  They deserve to have that childhood now and for it to be a really good one.  They also deserve it now given the contribution they will make in future society.  This is where the Department of Children and Youth Affairs-Department of Education and Skills debate comes in.  By remaining within the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, children in crisis are being pitted against all the children in the population.  As the Minister said to us, if he can pay for an extra social worker as opposed to investing money into mainstream services he will have to give it to the social worker.  This is a short-term gain because the child has a crisis need now and it needs to be met but, in terms of the future, the prevention of some of those crisis needs could be done by investing now.  That is the thinking on this issue.</p> <p>  On the issue of a legacy, the unfortunate thing in this country is that we seem to work from political cycle to political cycle.  It seems to be a case of what politicians can say or do to get themselves across the line in terms of an election.  Everyone wants to leave a legacy and a legacy can be left here.  This group and the Government can feed into the idea of this being where they make the change.</p><p>It keeps coming back to where the Minister, Deputy James Reilly, is going to find the money.  It is a matter of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform deciding that this area will now have to get a significant amount of money so that within the pot of the Department of Children and Youth Affairs, it will not be taken from a child with additional needs and placed in the mainstream fund.  It needs to be absolute funding.  There is an argument for involving the Department of Education and Skills because then one does not have that crisis.  One has education at various levels, but the real worry is that it will just be from age three up and that it will be said anyone can do it for children from birth to three, despite the fact that so much learning happens at that stage, and highly qualified staff are not needed.  I acknowledge that we will get the reassurance that it will not happen, but if one has six years going into a Department, the budget has to cover it.  Whether the money be put in for that whole six years to guarantee equal treatment is questionable despite that fact that in primary schools, junior infants and sixth class do not get different capitation.  It is about looking at that.</p><p> People were talking about all the influences and how everyone is impacting on early childhood and the child in early years.  The committee saw at one of the first meetings the document that Thomas Walsh from Maynooth provided in terms of all of these organisations that are impacting on what is going on.  Even the few that we have mentioned today are a drop in the ocean in overall terms.  The list barely fit on a page and even when I looked at it afterwards I was thinking that certain ones had been left out.  The list did not encompass everyone, which is how crazy this is.</p><p> It was mentioned that the taxpayer will be the person who pays because this is a substantial investment.  We are looking at going from 0.2% to 0.8% as an OECD average figure.  That is approximately &euro;1 billion that we need in investment.  If one increases the investment incrementally over the next number of years, one is working on at least &euro;200 million per year to get it up to that OECD average which is a significant amount of money.  There are no two ways about it; the taxpayer will pay, as taxpayers pay for primary school, secondary school, third level and lifelong learning.  There has not been a question over how we should do that, be it by direct investment or some others means.  The money is found and it is provided.  However, the taxpayer will gain because the children now as well as the children and grandchildren of taxpayers will benefit from a childhood we should be proud to provide in this State.  We should be proud to have qualified, experienced professionals meeting their every need in a child-friendly, play-based way that follows and supports the child.  That is what we should want.  I cannot imagine there is a taxpayer in the country who would not want that for his or her children, grandchildren, nieces, nephews and neighbours.  It cannot come down to a question of why people who do not have children should have to pay for it.  We do not adopt that approach in any other area of care and education and we should not be doing it for this.  Taxpayers will also benefit from the returns to society.  These children will grow up to be the adults who will be lifted out of the poverty trap and who will be engaged in employment, pay taxes and contribute in terms of being entrepreneurs because they have had a creative start and support to do it.  They will be the doctors, nurses, solicitors, politicians, early childhood professionals and support personnel.  They will give back to the community.  Whether I have children or not, they will give to me later because I will need a public service that they will be providing for.  It is about investing now.  Umpteen top-quality economists nationally and internationally have shown the return.  Anyone who got a guaranteed return on investment of one to seven or one to ten would jump at it.  It is about the spending of money now.</p><p> In relation to the figures on a graduate-led workforce, the last Pobal report showed that 86% of people were at level 5.  That was before the learner fund kicked in properly.  The majority got it themselves when there was not even a minimum requirement to get it.  They paid for it themselves and gave up their own personal and family time to get it.  At level 6 the figure was 46%, which definitely does not go into the millions.  Again, that was before the learner fund and it has got higher.  People were told they needed a minimum requirement for this September and they went and really neglected their own families to get this but it has now been postponed because decisions are made at the click of a finger.  At level 7 and above, the figure in the last Pobal report was 13%.  I do not know where that 13% is because there are still those who are currently within the workforce who have gone back and got their level 7 and higher.  One also has more students coming through college, although my experience from the students I work with is that they are asking how they can get their qualification and get out - out of the country or out to work directly within services - because they know they are not going to be able to earn an income.  They have got such a fright over the last two years and have asked why they are getting their degrees when they are going to get minimum wage.  They might decide to stay on with the jobs they have to support themselves through college but they certainly will not be able to earn an income.  </p><p> While more people are graduating, quite a number of the 13% have gone to Better Start.  The department of inspection is looking at another inspection that is going to be tied into the contract despite the fact that it is inspecting something that has not been rolled out.  It is the cart before the horse.  The inspectorate will be taken from the early childhood degreed workforce, which is more people going along with those who are needed for tutoring, lecturing and filling all the gaps and spots.  We do not know where the 13% is and whether there has been enough replacement of it.</p><p> One has the accredited training but one also has the CPD people do in the early childhood profession.  The following is a disgrace.  I could engage with S&iacute;olta or Aistear training, my centre might get the QAP validation because we have all engaged in it and I might get some work out of the training, but when a primary school teacher does the Aistear training, he or she can get CPD credits.  It is the exact same training.  The Department of Education and Skills has put money into training, albeit it was not particularly great training, for junior and senior infants teachers to get Aistear training.  We are still waiting for it.  There is a new practice guide that links S&iacute;olta and Aistear to help us put things together, but it must be done in our own time unless we look at the 30 mentors that have been put in place for 25,000 people.  It will have to be the professionals taking that up themselves.  We are struggling even to get a printed document.  While it is available to print off the website, there is a massive cost in that.  So much is happening.  We had one person who documented how much it cost her to engage with the S&iacute;olta QAP.  It cost her &euro;5,000 to get the free QAP in terms of the whole process as she had to pay her staff something for going as it was on their time and for all the document printing.  She has a small centre and the cost would be higher at a bigger one.  Free training which is hit and miss in terms of the comprehensiveness of its roll out is still costing centres money.  In her accounts, which she presented to one of the previous Ministers, she was getting &euro;4.85 an hour.  She is a provider, entrepreneur and employer and she was getting &euro;4.85 while trying to achieve maximum quality.</p><p> We are supposed to be trying to help the children to move out of the poverty trap.  If children get this great start, it will pay dividends in later years.  What tends to happen with the Government is that money is put into crisis management time after time with the effect that the hole is dug deeper and deeper for the children, parents and practitioners and providers who are working with children.  People cannot continue to do what they have done.  In Germany, there was a strike for six weeks.  In Ireland, people say they cannot go out on a Tuesday because they need to be there for the families.  That can only happen for so long because they are shutting their doors.  Quality centres are shutting their doors and their quality staff are going on the dole.  It is crazy.  In terms of priorities, it is about targeting the Department of Public Expenditure and the other Departments in terms of justice, social welfare and all of those other issues.  Given the savings that will happen, part of the funding should come out of those departmental budgets also.  It will ultimately benefit them.</p></speech>

Ms Quinn just mentioned the return.  There are studies going back to the 1970s including the Perry pre-school project in the USA which showed that for every $1 invested, there was a return of $16.  Ms Quinn is right that it takes someone with a bit of vision.  It is not something that will be achieved in the cycle of a government.  It is long-term.  It is something that we, as committee members, will absolutely take away to put towards our final report.</p><p> It is important to state that this issue is not the responsibility of only one Department.  All the studies in this area have shown that if we invest in children at an early enough stage, they are much less likely to ever need the services of the Department of Justice and Equality or the Department of Social Protection.  Major savings are incurred from such investment, but it requires vision and long-term planning.  Having worked in this area as a social worker and in the early years services prior to my election to the D&aacute;il, I sense that a change is coming.  It it a great testimony to the workers in this area, who are very busy all the time looking after, engaging and educating our young children, that they have taken it upon themselves in recent years to come together not only to put their case but the case of the children to us, the policy-makers.  I thank all those people who are doing that.  It is an area about which I and the committee are very passionate and in which we are very interested.  </p><p> I look forward to working and engaging with our guests further.  I found this morning's session very engaging.  Throughout all these hearings we have often had all-female panels, which does not happen very often in the Houses of the Oireachtas.  I thank all our guests for giving of their time today.  I also thank all committee members.  A number of very interesting issues have been raised which will be considered as part of the committee's report.</p></speech>
