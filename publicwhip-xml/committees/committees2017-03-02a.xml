I have received apologies from Deputy Alan Kelly, who was a Minister in the Department of the Environment, Community and Local Government until quite recently.  He has asked for his apologies to be recorded here today rather than participating directly in the meeting.</p> <p>  Are the minutes of the meetings of 22 and 23 February agreed?  Agreed.  There are no matters arising that will not come up in the correspondence.  </p> <p>  We will move on to correspondence.  No. 315A is a briefing document from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for today's meeting.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  No. 319A is an opening statement from Mr. John McCarthy, Secretary General at the Department of Housing, Planning and Local Government.  We will note and publish it.</p> <p>  The next items are category B correspondence.  The first item is correspondence dated 16 February 2017 from Mr. Tony O'Brien, director general of the HSE.  The letter recommends that, before the Department and the HSE appear before the committee on 9 March 2017 to discuss the fair deal scheme, the committee visit a public residential community hospital.  We discussed this last week and I do not think a visit is feasible before 9 March.  However, following the Easter recess I propose that the secretary identifies a Tuesday morning to visit to a public residential community hospital and liaises with the members regarding their availability.  We will make some preliminary inquiries but we will hold over a definite decision.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 300B, 1 to 3, inclusive, is correspondence dated 17 February 2017 from Mr. Maurice Quinn, Secretary General of the Department of Defence.  This is a follow-up to an appearance by the Department before the committee on 26 January and a subsequent information request.  This was held over from last week and I propose that we hold it over again.  There is quite a lot of documentation, some of which deals with the sale of the Government jet and the health and safety issues in Baldonnel.  I have received some correspondence directly, and perhaps other members have also, in the past day or so from people who do not fully accept what they understand the Secretary General to be saying so I would like another week to consider the matter.  Can we hold that over and give people an opportunity to look at it?  Is that agreed?  Agreed.</p> <p>  Further correspondence, dated 20 February, is from the HSE with a briefing note for the committee on the High Court case relating to consultants pay.  We will note it.</p> <p>  No. 313B is correspondence dated 22 February from Noel Waters, Secretary General of the Department of Justice and Equality, in follow-up to his appearance before the committee on 2 February.  We can note and publish it, but perhaps it would be better to hold it over as we have been very busy with Project Eagle in recent weeks.  Will we hold it over as it is a voluminous document with 13 pages.  The reason we are holding some of these items over is that we have been having meetings on Project Eagle in private session and we did not get an opportunity to review them.  We will hold it over for another short period.  </p> <p>  Further correspondence, dated 22 February, is from the Central Bank correcting information that was sent to the committee regarding retention payments.  It is a minor correction of &euro;730.  That is in relation to the retention of staff.  We dealt with this issue at some point last summer.</p></speech>

They had sent a fairly light reply.</p></speech>

We asked for a more comprehensive reply about two weeks ago, so we will follow this up again today.</p> <p>   Category C correspondence relates to private individuals and other correspondence.  No. 309C, dated 21 February 2017, was received from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, regarding the building of a new school in Rathnew, County Wicklow.  Is it agreed to forward this to the regional correspondent and note it?  Agreed.</p> <p>  No. 310C is correspondence, dated 20 February, from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine informing the committee that the Department will not be in a position to lay the accounts for the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority within the agreed timetable.  Perhaps the Comptroller and Auditor General would say a word about this.  We made contact with organisations regarding late filing of accounts with the Department.</p></speech>

He is telling us that the accounts are late, which is actually what is required under the circular.</p></speech>

Others have not been as upfront.  We will note that.</p> <p>  Correspondence dated 24 February from Sage, which is the support and advocacy service for older people, relates to fees and charges associated with nursing homes.  This will certainly be a useful piece of information for our forthcoming meeting with the HSE.  We will note and carry that forward to our committee meeting when we are dealing with that particular issue in the coming weeks.</p> <p>  No. 317C, dated 24 February, is from an individual on behalf of staff of a 24-hour suicide helpline formerly run by the Console charity.  The correspondence states that the staff have been unpaid and seeks information on what the HSE plans to do about this.  I suggest we write to the HSE and ask that the question raised in the correspondence be dealt with.  We should seek a reply within seven days because, if there is a question of people going unpaid for their work, we will not let that run to the normal timescale for reply.</p></speech>

We need a response.  In fairness to the people who have gone through a difficult period, they are entitled to a response within seven days at this point.  We are not going to keep adjourning it.  We will tell them that there is a seven day turnaround and we will be raising it here next week and asking where the response is if we have not received one by then.</p> <p>  No. 318C, dated 24 February, is from Ms Mary Higgins, CEO of Caranua, by way of information note to the committee on policy, processes and standards in Caranua.  We will note this, but the Comptroller and Auditor General has completed a report and it is with the Minister.</p></speech>

I looked back over the report of the hearing and think we might need to receive further clarification because there was a context.  The context was that there was a spin-out company, FeedHenry, which had been sold for &euro;64 million and the president was asked if he was a director.  He said, first, that he was not but then corrected the record to say he was.  My understanding is he was also a shareholder.  I think we need to receive clarification, but that is not to say there was anything wrong because he was head of research at the time in the institute and researchers can have an association with spin-out companies.  However, for the record, it is important to have the matter clarified.</p></speech>

We asked for a detailed response on the assumptions used in the costs.  I am conscious that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health has also called them to appear before that committee in the next couple of weeks.  We will have a very specific examination of their accounts.  We will probably have to wait for at least a month until they appear before the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health.  We do not want to duplicate its work in a fortnight.  They are on our list, but the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Health will deal with them first.  That committee will probably ask broader questions, but we will have very specific questions.</p> <p>  On 23 March, we will have the Department of Education and Skills and the Higher Education Authority in the afternoon.  The reason for this is we have said we want to have a series of meetings with the third level institutions and we are pencilling in 30 March and 6 April.  We will try to get through a number of universities on one day and the institutes of technology on the other day.  I want to confine it to three meetings because if we go to four or five meetings on third level education we will never get the others up.  We have to condense it into a maximum of three meetings even though it is a big area.  Members can see what we are trying to do.  The secretariat is trying to line up the slots for the different groups.</p></speech>

They can contact the secretariat.  Nobody else has come forward yet.  Members might want to judge it based on the dates particular institutions will be represented here.  The secretariat is working on the detailed timescale in that regard.</p> <p>  We have a gap on 13 April which we will fill next week.  We have not confirmed attendance.  On 4 May, we are dealing with the Revenue Commissioners as we do each year.  On Thursday, 11 May, we will have the Department of Finance on everything to do with the national accounts.  We then come back to other topics to be considered.  The section 38 and 39 issue is ongoing.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has done some work on the procurement issues.  Third level institutions are on our list and we will deal with the national paediatric hospital development board as soon as practicable thereafter.</p> <p>  As we just mentioned, next Thursday a report on Caranua and the redress scheme will be published.  We might factor that in for 13 April.  We will consider that.  We will try to deal with that report as soon as possible.</p></speech>

In 2015, the Vote recorded gross expenditure totalling &euro;1.2 billion, while the fund recorded expenditure totalling &euro;1.8 billion.</p><p>There are some transfers between the Vote and the fund but a consolidated statement of the Department's receipts and payments is not prepared.  While the Vote is mainly Exchequer-funded, the local government fund is mainly financed by motor tax receipts, approximately &euro;1.1 billion in 2015, and local property tax receipts, which amounted to &euro;469 million in 2015.</p><p> The breakdown of the Vote 34 expenditure in 2015 is indicated in the figure on screen.  This uses the programme structure as defined in the Vote.  The housing programme accounted for over half of the Vote expenditure in 2015.  Expenditure on this programme was &euro;646 million, which represented an increase of &euro;52 million year on year.  Almost all of this increase related to additional provision for local authority housing programmes.  The most significant increase in the Vote year on year was in respect of the local government programme.  Total expenditure in 2015 was &euro;275 million, compared with &euro;36 million in 2014.  The 2015 expenditure included a payment of &euro;241 million to the local government fund to provide a contribution towards the transfers from the fund to local authorities and a subvention of &euro;92 million paid to Irish Water.  Vote expenditure on the water services programme 2015 totalled &euro;131 million, an increase of &euro;94 million year on year.  The increase was due to the payment of household water conservation grants in 2015.  The grant scheme was administered on an agency basis by the Department of Social Protection but the related grants and agency administration costs were borne on Vote 34.  After appropriations-in-aid totalling &euro;46 million, the net surplus on the Vote at the end of 2015 amounted to &euro;84 million.  With the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, capital funding of &euro;41 million not spent in 2015 was carried over to 2016.  The remaining &euro;43 million was surrendered to the Exchequer.</p><p> Chapter 4 of my report aims to present an overview of the level of funding provided by central Government to local authorities and the purposes for which that funding is provided.  Relevant information is drawn together from a number of accounts to get a full picture of the complex financial transfers and of trends over time.  Central Government transfers to local authorities of almost &euro;2 billion in 2015 represented just over 34% of the 2008 level of those transfers when they peaked at around &euro;5.8 billion.  The decline reflects the general reductions in public expenditure since 2008 and the transfer of certain responsibilities away from local authorities.  As evident from the figure which can now be shown on screen, the reduction in transfers has impacted most on local authority capital spending.  This impacted especially in the areas of social housing and roads.  In 2014 the Department provided general purpose grant funding to local authorities mainly for their day-to-day activities.  General purpose grants were discontinued in 2015 and were replaced by annual local property tax allocations.  This resulted in adjustments of funding for some local authorities.  Under the 80% retention rule provided for in the local property tax regime, 19 local authorities would have been allocated less funding in 2015 than in 2014.  However, equalisation funding of &euro;102 million from the residual 20% of the tax was utilised to bring those local authorities to the same level of funding that they received in 2014.  The retention based allocations for 12 authorities and these were mainly large urban authorities in commuter belt counties were some &euro;177 million higher than the amounts they received in 2014.  Total funding of &euro;239 million was provided to those local authorities in 2015 but they were directed to allocate &euro;131 million for housing services and &euro;22 million for road services, with the balance of &euro;86 million available for general or discretionary purposes within those local authorities.  In addition to the &euro;2 billion funding provided by Departments and agencies in 2015, an amount of &euro;427 million was transferred directly from the Exchequer in the form of once-off payments to local authorities.  This was to allow the local authorities to repay borrowing from the Housing Finance Agency that had been used in the past to fund local authority water supply and treatment infrastructure that had since transferred to Irish Water.</p><p> Chapter 4 also provides a brief overview of the key structures in place for the oversight of local authority finances.  These are the local government audit service and the National Oversight and Audit Commission.  I previously reported on the Department's implementation of the land aggregation scheme and this was examined by the committee on 5 February 2015.  Under the land aggregation scheme, local authorities could transfer to the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, referred to as the Housing Agency, surplus residential development land on which there were outstanding loans.  The loans were due for repayment to the Housing Finance Agency.  Between 2010 and 2013, the Department approved 73 sites for transfer with a total land area of 247 ha.  My previous report, which was completed in mid-2014, found that there were very significant delays in effecting the transfers of many sites to the Housing Agency.  By July 2016, however, we found that all but six of the approved sites had transferred.</p><p> The focus has consequently now shifted to a strategy for the management, utilisation and ultimate development of these and other sites.  Progress in developing and utilising the sites as at mid-2016 can be summarised as follows: no housing units had yet been completed but development had been approved in respect of 185 homes on seven sites and proposals were being worked up in the context of another 180 homes across five sites; and 1.6 ha of land on two sites had been transferred to the Department of Education and Skills for a school and to a community organisation for a children's recreational facility to promote sustainable communities.  However, 93% of the sites had either no proposed development in place or had not yet been transferred to the Housing Agency.  The Accounting Officer will be able to update the committee on developments in regard to the acquired land since the reporting date.</p><p> The key agencies in respect of 2015 would have been the Environmental Protection Agency, Pobal, An Bord Plean&aacute;la, the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency, the Western Development Commission and the Residential Tenancies Board.  There are a couple of other non-commercial State bodies which do not fall within my remit, namely, the Housing Finance Agency and the Local Government Management Agency.  I thought that might be useful to the committee in its deliberations.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.128" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017030200002#E00200"><p>I am pleased to be here this morning as Accounting Officer to assist the committee in its examination of Vote 34 and Chapters 4 and 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2015 dealing with central Government funding and local authorities and progress on the land aggregation scheme, respectively.  As requested, I have provided some advance briefing for the meeting and will keep these opening comments short.</p> <p>  The State's public finances moved further along the pathway to sustainability in 2015 and, in that context, the Department's gross expenditure for the year totalled &euro;1.24 billion, some 36% higher than the outturn for 2014.  The Department had significant achievements in 2015 in delivering on key policies and programmes.  Our overall objectives were to improve the quality of life of citizens and communities to foster economic and social development and to enhance environmental protection.  In overall terms, the Department was assigned over 13% of the total Exchequer capital allocation in 2015 towards implementing major housing, water, rural development and other programs.  In 2015 several critical areas benefited from increased funding, most notably housing where spend increased by 9% over 2014.  Total spending from the vote on the various housing programmes, including the provision of social housing and improvement in regeneration measures amounted to almost &euro;646 million in 2015.  Local authorities also self-funded housing programmes from local property tax receipts in the amount of &euro;119 million, bringing the gross spend on housing programmes to &euro;765 million.</p><p>This was used to meet housing needs through a range of programmes, including the local authority construction and acquisition programme, the approved housing body programme, leasing and the rental accommodation scheme.  In total, the housing needs of 13,375 households were met under our housing programmes in 2015.</p><p> As members will be aware, responsibility for the provision of water services transferred from local authorities to Irish Water on 1 January 2014.  A sum of &euro;222 million was provided by the Government via the Central Fund for Irish Water to meet its capital expenditure in 2015.  This funding helped to progress capital projects set out in the Irish Water capital plan, including key water and wastewater infrastructural projects.  In addition, &euro;399 million was provided for Irish Water from the local government fund in 2015 by way of an operational subvention.  It funded the allowance of 21,000 litres of free water provided for all children in the State, the cost of capital and domestic water charges at the levels set out in the Water Services Act 2014 and the cost of providing a general subsidy to meet the cost of services to reduce the level of unit charge in line with the provisions of the Act.  The water programme expenditure figure in 2015 for the Department also included &euro;94 million for the water conservation grant introduced in that year.  As at 30 June 2015, a total of 1.308 million households had registered with Irish Water and were, therefore, eligible to apply for the grant in 2015.  The Department of Social Protection which administered the water conservation grant on behalf of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government made grant payments totalling just over &euro;89 million in respect of 890,104 applications under the scheme.  A small number of residual payments continue to be made to householders who have an entitlement to the 2015 water conservation grant.  Capital funding of &euro;16.88 million was also provided under the rural water programme, which included support for the group water scheme sector.  In addition, &euro;18.88 million was provided for the sector from the local government fund by way of operational subsidies.</p><p> The chapter in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report on the funding of local authorities by central government provides an overview of local authority expenditure and income figures since 2006.  It details the range of programmes for which local authorities are responsible and the range of funding sources.  Transfers of funding from central government sources to local authorities in 2015 totalled almost &euro;2 billion.  The local government fund accounted for 43% of this amount.  There was continued change in the operation of the fund in 2015, with the ending of the general purpose grant payments and the introduction of the local property tax, LPT, paid to local authorities through the fund.  Some 80% of LPT revenue was retained locally to fund vital public services, while the remaining 20% was redistributed to provide top-up funding for local authorities with a lower local property tax base due to variances in property values across the State.  These measures were necessary to create a balanced system of funding across local authorities.  Income into the local government fund in 2015 totalled over &euro;1.8 billion, made up of motor tax receipts of &euro;1.1 billion, local property tax revenue of &euro;469 million and a payment from the Exchequer of &euro;241 million.  The main payments from the local government fund in 2015 included LPT payments to local authorities of &euro;459 million, a payment of &euro;355 million for the maintenance of non-national roads and public transport to the Department of Transport, Tourism and Sport and a payment to the Exchequer of &euro;481 million, as well as a payment of &euro;399 million as a subvention to Irish Water.</p><p> On accountability, as the committee will be aware, under the existing policy and legislative framework, the Local Government Audit Service provides for independent scrutiny of the financial stewardship of local authorities and other local bodies.  It audits local government bodies in accordance with a statutory code of audit practice, thereby fostering the highest standards of financial management and public accountability.  Where the annual audit has been completed by the local government auditor, the local authority is required to furnish a copy of the audited financial statement and any associated statutory auditor's report to every member of the local authority for his or her consideration at the next practicable council meeting.  Scrutiny arrangements for local government were also enhanced in recent years, with the establishment of the National Oversight and Audit Commission, NOAC.  The NOAC scrutinises local government performance in fulfilling national, regional and local mandates and value for money where State funds are channelled through local government and supports the development of best practice and enhanced efficiency in the performance of local government functions.  </p><p> The most significant aspect of the Department's community programme in 2015 involved the commencement of the new social inclusion and community activation programme, SICAP, which was rolled out in April that year and will run until the end of this year.  Its aim is to tackle poverty, social exclusion and long-term unemployment through local engagement and partnership between disadvantaged individuals, community organisations, public sector agencies and other stakeholders.  SICAP expenditure in the nine month period April to December 2015 was &euro;26.8 million.  A total of 36,854 disadvantaged individuals were engaged under SICAP on a one-to-one basis, while 2,506 local community groups were assisted.</p><p> Chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's annual report for 2015 deals with progress under the land aggregation scheme.  The scheme was established in 2010 to support local authorities by alleviating the financial burden in servicing land loans that had been taken out from the Housing Finance Agency for the purpose of acquiring land for social and affordable housing developments.  It closed in December 2013.  At the time the Department had approved 73 sites, with a total area of 247 ha, for inclusion in the scheme.  At the time of the Comptroller and Auditor General's report 67 sites accepted into the scheme had been transferred to the housing agency.  As of February 2017, this figure has increased to 71.  In 2013, as a consequence of continuing pressure on Exchequer resources at the time and following a review of the scheme carried out in consultation with the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, it became evident that further expenditure on the scheme in accepting new applications was not sustainable.  Accordingly, in December that year local authorities were notified of the ending of the scheme.</p><p> The matters to which I have referred illustrate the broad range of programmes and activities for which my Department had responsibility in 2015.  I should point out that, with the reconfiguration of Departments when the new Government took office in May 2016, the bulk of the Department's environmental functions transferred to the new Department of Communications, Climate Action and Environment, while a range of rural development functions were transferred to the Department of Arts, Heritage, Regional, Rural and Gaeltacht Affairs.  </p><p> My colleagues and I will be happy to respond to questions or deal with issues that will emerge in the course of the committee's work today.</p></speech>

On the figures for Irish Water in 2015, the Comptroller and Auditor General made a separate reference to funding for Irish Water which Mr. McCarthy did not mention.  Are the figures for 2015 correct?  Mr. McCarthy has said &euro;222 million was provided for capital expenditure, &euro;399 million for operations and by way of a subvention, while &euro;89 million was paid out in conservation grants.  That gives a total figure of &euro;710 million.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General has a paragraph in his report stating that in 2015 an amount of &euro;427 million was transferred directly from the Exchequer in the form of a once-off grant payment to local authorities.  It was to allow them to repay borrowings from the Housing Finance Agency that had been used to fund local authority water supply and treatment infrastructure that had since been transferred to Irish Water.  In addition to the &euro;700 million or so that went through the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in respect of that issue, &euro;427 million was transferred directly by the Exchequer from the Central Fund to local authorities to meet liabilities associated with the assets Irish Water took over, which liabilities were met by the taxpayer.  Irish Water received these assets, minus the liabilities of &euro;427 million met by the taxpayer from the Central Fund, in addition to the sum of &euro;710 million that went through the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, giving a total payment in 2015 of &euro;1.137 billion.  Is that the correct total?</p></speech>

The final figure relates to debt that was part of the public debt at that stage.  It was, in effect, a reclassification and a move from the local government sector back to central government.</p></speech>

We need to clarify the word "reclassification" in order that the public understands what Mr. McCarthy means.  The assets transferred, but the liabilities remained with the taxpayer.</p></speech>

From the point of view of taxpayers, these moneys primarily went through the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government but also went through central funds that did not go through the Department's Vote.  Thankfully, the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted this issue separately in his remarks this morning.  The transfer in respect of Irish Water in 2015, including the conservation grant, was &euro;1.137 billion.</p></speech>

Okay.  The opening speakers - Deputies Cassells and MacSharry - have 20 and 15 minutes, respectively.  Deputies Catherine Murphy, Cullinane, Connolly and Madigan have also indicated and they will be taken in that order.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.141" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017030200002#G00900"><p>I thank the Chair.  I welcome Mr. John McCarthy and his staff.  Mr. McCarthy covered a huge amount in his opening statement.  He began by talking about housing so I will start there as well if that is okay.  Chapter 5 of the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2015 report relates to progress on land aggregation.  In layman's terms, it sets out the progress that is being made with the construction of homes on 73 sites, across 610 acres, that are now in the ownership of the State centrally as opposed to through the local authority system.  This mini-NAMA scheme is positive because it gets bad land deals off the books of local councils.</p> <p>  A landbank of 28 acres in the Farganstown area of Navan in my own county of Meath, which had been bought for &euro;22 million, did not make it into the scheme.  Meath County Council is now paying interest and principal repayments of &euro;500,000 a year to try to service that debt.  The 28-acre site in question is just lying there with no movement on the social housing for which it was purchased.  The council could be spending &euro;500,000 a year on front-line services, but instead it has to service its debt in respect of this landbank.</p> <p>  It is positive that 73 sites across Ireland have made it into the scheme.  It is pointed out in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report that as of July 2016, no progress had been made with the development of residential housing sites on 84% of the land acquired under the scheme.  In July 2016, there was inaction on 84% of landbanks under a scheme that stopped taking in landbanks in December 2013.  Progress is being made with 12 of the 73 sites that are involved in this scheme.  Some 185 units on seven sites have been approved and a further 180 units on five sites are in train.  How many other specific sites will see ground broken in 2017 on foot of the site visits conducted by departmental officials in 2015 and 2016?  I do not need to tell Mr. McCarthy that this is the biggest issue that arises at the Joint Committee on Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Even though the housing waiting list is the biggest thing that occupies public discourse, there is no movement on 610 acres of land that has been identified for housing.  How many plans are in place to make progress with these lands?  How quickly will these developments happen?  The narrative we hear over and again from county councils is that it is frustrating to make progress with schemes from concept to design to implementation.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to spell out to me, as succinctly as possible, how many of these sites will see progress in the coming year.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.142" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. John McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017030200002#G01000"><p>I thank the Deputy.  As it stands, there are 15 sites, involving just over 25 ha and 479 units of accommodation, at various stages in our construction pipeline.  At another four sites, involving 3.95 ha and approximately 180 units, projects are at an earlier stage of consideration and have not entered the pipeline.  A small number of pieces of other land have been used for education and other purposes.  I will try to put this into context for the Deputy.  This scheme was introduced for the very valid purpose of recognising the difficulties faced by local authorities in the aftermath of the economic collapse.  Now that 73 sites have been transferred into the scheme, and with two land transfers still to be formally effected, the focus has switched from the acceptance of sites to the management and utilisation of sites.  The Housing Agency has been tasked under Rebuilding Ireland with the production of a site management plan for each site, apart from the sites to which I have referred, in conjunction with the relevant local authorities.  Our objective is to try to bring as many as possible of these sites into active use as early as we can.  We intend to use the additional funding that is now available under Rebuilding Ireland.  I hope the number of these sites being used will increase quickly over the coming years.</p></speech>

They would have had conceptual schemes or detailed schemes in place for these landbanks at the time of their acquisition under this scheme.  Given the seriousness of the situation, why has there been a three-year delay with the progress of these sites?</p></speech>

Can I ask a straight question on these sites?  Is the Department reticent to develop council estates again?  Does the Housing Agency have an ideological issue with the construction of State-owned county council estates of approximately 200 houses?  I am asking Mr. McCarthy whether such an ideological barrier exists on the part of the Department or of the Housing Agency.  Some of the finest and best constructed estates that were built in my home town were county council estates.  Is that day gone now, from the Department's point of view?  Is an ideological barrier preventing the development of pure county council housing estates of 200 homes?</p></speech>

If a local authority presents us with a project involving the development of a large number of units in a single development, we are more likely to look on it more favourably if there is no existing social housing in the area.  There is a very positive disposition towards moving forward with social housing projects.  The social housing project pipeline between local authorities and approved housing bodies has more than 500 projects in it.  We have to deal with them case by case.  There are schemes of 30, 40, 50 or even more units in the pipeline, depending on the circumstances in the individual location.</p></speech>

Some larger sites might come forward for mixed tenure, with both public and private housing, in line with the policy objective under Rebuilding Ireland.  The key objective is to use them for housing purposes and primarily for social housing purposes.</p></speech>

Moving on to chapter four on the funding of local government, one of the things that really frustrates people is how their money is spent.  It is not the payment of tax, rather how it is spent.  Ask any resident in this country who pays property tax their view on what they expected to get, what they thought they would get and what they actually got.  I know the value of the service of local government.  I spent 17 years on a council.  The reason I ask is because when the precursor to the LPT, the household charge, was introduced, every single house in this country received a glossy leaflet through the door encouraging them to pay the &euro;100, as it was at that time.  In bulletpoint form, it set out where that money was going.  There were references to parks, community facilities and estate maintenance.  Those were the bulletpoints highlighted to encourage people to pay this charge when the county councils were collecting it.  Of course, we saw what happened.  They did not collect it.</p> <p>  People in most towns have no parks and have to pay another &euro;100 on top of their LPT to their local residents' association to pay for the cutting of grass in their estate.  Ask those people what their memory is of the promise on that leaflet.  When the LPT comes in and the collection is the guts of 100% - we had Mr. Cody before the committee from Revenue, which is doing a fine job in that respect as it brings in nearly &euro;500 million a year - one would think that local government would be enhanced rather than impoverished.  One would think that it would be able to provide the services that were mentioned in that leaflet some years ago.  One would think it would make the critical difference in providing the type of community facilities on the ground level that would actually make a difference, as opposed to maintaining the nuts, bolts and wages of just keeping the county councils on the go.</p> <p>  Low and behold, when we looked at those budgets the year the LPT was introduced, most councils were no better off.  They were no worse off, but they were no better off.  The general purpose grant, as the witness outlined, disappeared.  The LPT, which the households were paying themselves, just subbed in for it.  Residents were wondering where their LPT is going.  We could only say that it was going into the income side of things.  There was no scenario in which county councils actually had more money because what was given with one hand was taken away with another.</p> <p>  As we can see in the figures, funding to councils in this country went down by 70% in that period from 2007 to 2014.  Even leaving aside the transfer of powers in some aspects, it is massively underfunded.  Can the witness understand people's frustration and can he explain that little movement to me?  When the LPT came in, we were no better off in providing the services that people expect and require in this country.</p></speech>

I absolutely understand that.  With regard to the move from the old general purpose grants to the LPT, the policy position adopted was that no local authority should end up being worse off in the transition.  The approach taken in order to achieve that was that each local authority would retain 80% of the LPT collected in its area locally and the balance of 20% would be used in order to achieve that equalisation function to ensure that no local authority would be worse off.  What that has meant is that some local authorities made the transition on an equal basis.  They lost nothing and gained nothing.  There were a number of local authorities, from memory it may have been nine or ten, that had strong LPT bases and made significant gains in income.  The policy position that-----</p></speech>

There were certain local authorities that did end up in a surplus situation even after the self-funding of certain programmes.  There is the other dimension that is available to all local authorities and is used in varying ways.  Even the evolution of houses used is interesting over the last few years, in that the capacity to either increase or decrease the LPT by 15% is available to individual councils as well.</p></speech>

We had central funding for county councils to provide services.  The people are now effectively paying the funding for that aspect and the general purpose grant was taken away.  I ask the witness to address that point for me.  If that sleight of hand had not taken place, we would have had local surplus.  Most of the things we discuss here are in terms of policy direction, but at the ground level, county councils provide services that make differences to people's lives.  Had that funding strand stayed in place, those county councils would have been enriched to really make a difference.</p> <p>  On top of that, the abolition of the town council system by which there were specific urban funds has left a growing scenario in which the focus on urban Ireland is being taken away.  The funds being directed into the major towns are no longer there because of the fact that we do not have dedicated budgets for towns.  There is a diminution of the democratic system in this country.</p><p>We have gone from 114 councils in this country to 31 and the special focus on towns has been taken away.  I know it is something we will address but can we get back to the point of central funding being substituted with the local property tax?</p></speech>

In a large measure, although not fully, the introduction of LPT was public funding that was previously funded through general central taxation being replaced by a new form of taxation called LPT with greater connectivity between where money was raised and how it was spent and with a capacity for local councils to make some variations.  Those amounted to a 15% increase or decrease and allowed greater local discretion.</p></speech>

If the general purpose grant had stayed in place, county councils across the country would have been able to achieve a higher level of services and made a meaningful difference to people's lives as they would have had those strands of funding available to do what people expect.  That is as opposed to the nuts and bolts of paying wages.</p></speech>

In one hand he had a bill for &euro;5,000 for his business rates, which he received in January, while in the other hand he had a court order for an appearance in approximately three weeks.  It was served on him by the county council because of his rates arrears.  It is an archaic system.  This man operates a business that helps children with autism and youth federations.  It is a good business but he is getting screwed because of the physical size of the premises from which he operates.  We have people operating information technology businesses from their attic who make big money but this archaic system is penalising people like this.</p><p>In 2017, the commercial rates system will bring in &euro;1.5 billion to local government, which is 34% of the budget and a 10% increase in the value collected since 2010.  In my time on the council, we got to a system where if there was a shortfall, the council increased rates.  Councils get into the mindset of seeing expenditure as X with income as Y, leading to a shortfall, so they put up the rates.  It is an archaic system that is screwing small businesses in this country.  Valuation is being discussed currently and I saw on the front of the <i>Westmeath Examiner</i>some weeks ago that 40% of businesses were seeing a rates hike as a result of valuation.  Will the witness address that for me?  How will this be dealt with in a substantial way by the Department?  This simply cannot continue as there is pressure and expectation being put on businesses in this country to fund local government.</p></speech>

The first is an element of economic buoyance and the second is better collection on the part of local authorities.  The performance of local authorities in collecting rates was discussed by this committee previously.  The major contributing factors for increased revenue arose from better collection and economic buoyance rather than increases in the annual rate on valuation, ARV.</p> <p>  The Deputy raised the issue of revaluation.  The purpose of a revaluation exercise is to try to ensure the valuation system is as up to date as possible and the rates revenue collected by local authorities is spread across businesses in the way it should be.  It is important to note the standard practice that, as part of any revaluation exercise, a local authority does not gain financially.</p></speech>

We are placing this pressure on small businesses in this country and councillors are forced into a position because of the terrible lack of central funding.  The small businesses are picking up the bill for the provision of services in this country.  Ordinary householders have paid a local property tax and thought they would get a better service but the general purpose grant was taken away.  Nobody is ending up any better and in many instances, people are worse off.</p> <p>  My final questions relate to staff numbers.  Since 2008, we have seen staff numbers across councils fall by approximately 25%, from 37,500 to 28,000.  In my own county, with 180,000 living there, we have one of the lowest staff to population ratios in the country.  How will this be addressed in coming years?  How will the required staff be recruited for the provision of services?  If we ask any county council member or member of the general public about the provision of community facilities, we know the staff are simply not there.  Could I have a general comment on that?</p></speech>

I can put the figures in context and the Deputy knows them well in his own area.  In the middle of 2008, when the economy started to decline, the whole-time equivalent numbers across the local authority system were just over 37,000.  At their lowest point, the figure was at 26,500, so it was a huge reduction in staff numbers.  I suppose the system delivered considerable efficiency through a range of initiatives in order to be able to try to continue to deliver the range of services despite all of that.  Staff numbers have now started to increase in local authorities and particularly in the housing area we have sanctioned a very significant number of posts in order to allow authorities support the delivery of their housing programmes.  We have also made provision within the housing capital programme for certain staff costs to be funded through the capital programme as a means of trying to assist them financially.</p></speech>

We did considerable work in the early part of 2016 and we reduced the process to four stages.  We also introduced a one stage approval process for social housing projects up to &euro;2 million in value or 15 units in order to try to ensure we are absolutely delivering as efficiently as we can.  We have reviewed it again in the past couple of months and identified a number of further measures that we will look to take, particularly over the second quarter of this year.  One of these measures considers whether we can de-risk further the one stage process for local authorities so they can avail of it in the coming months and get on with it.  With regard to the projects that still need to come through the four stage process, we are looking at how we can between ourselves and the local government system agree target timeframes for each of us in playing our part in moving on the process.</p><p>Just to conclude on that, I will go back to the pipeline maybe.  If the Deputy looks at how the social housing project pipeline has evolved over the course of 2016, I think he will see in terms of the 500 projects that are now in it, with 8,500 units, there has been very significant progress in terms of progressing projects through the system.</p></speech>

The Housing Finance Agency, in turn, largely utilises the NTMA as its borrowing vehicle.  The bulk of that funding would be available at very competitive rates.  For example, the typical interest rate that is charged on HFA borrowings at the moment - the sort of standard non-mortgage variable rate - is about 1.5%.</p></speech>

If there was a situation where a local authority had borrowed for a particular purpose and was paying a particular rate and there were more competitive and attractive rates available through the HFA, or otherwise, certainly the expectation would be that borrowing would be undertaken at the most competitive rates depending on the term of the borrowing that might be required, etc.</p></speech>

There have been some efforts to look at a more centralised system of that borrowing within the local government sector.  It is complicated by the fact that when it comes to pooling resources, and pooling cash balances and borrowings, it can become quite complex in terms of almost getting to the point of needing to have a bank-lending licence.  This was looked at some time ago.  However, the primary objective should always be to ensure that the best possible rate is obtained.  If the local government sector has a way of achieving that which can be achieved better through a more central arrangement, we would happily engage with the system in relation to that.</p></speech>

That ultimately eats into the amount discretionary funds available for local authorities.  I ask that the Department would do that.  Obviously, some local authorities would be affected more than others by funds they had borrowed for matters other than housing finance.</p> <p>  Regarding section 106 of the Local Government Act, what level of scrutiny and oversight is applied if, for example, Waterford City and County Council wanted to borrow &euro;10 million?  Whom does it contact?  What is the process?</p></speech>

When it receives an application for a land borrowing loan, there would be a number of things the Department would look for.  The first is: do we have the capacity to sanction it from the point of view of the general Government balance?  What I mean by that is that there is a slice of overall sort of borrowing or capital movements generally within the public system that the local authority is allowed to avail of.  That requires us to have a system in place to know what capital repayments are happening by local authorities or what other run-down of capital balances is taking place so that we then know what capacity we have to approve additional borrowing and stay within the parameters that have been set for us by the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  That is one of the first things we would look at.</p> <p>  The second issue that we would look at is to understand the capacity of the local authority to be able to fund the loan.  There would be consultation with our local government finance people as part of that exercise.</p> <p>  In relation to a land acquisition loan for housing, in those cases ultimately the State would pay the interest because the way the system worked ten years ago when this was operating was that the interest was in effect rolled up for a period of time and was then recouped to the local authority at the end of the day.</p> <p>  The third issue that the Department would absolutely insist on, in accordance with section 106, is that there would need to be evidence that the borrowing had been authorised by the elected members and that evidence of the resolution passed by the council would have been submitted to us.</p></speech>

If a local authority bought land for housing after the Department sanctioned the loan and it used it for football fields or recreation, is there any follow-up procedure?</p></speech>

In the case of land loans the State is ultimately recouping the cost to the local authority as part of the housing project.  If the local authority used it for another purpose, there would not be a housing proposal coming to us and the local authority would not have the vehicle for recouping the cost.</p></speech>

If the Department sanctioned a local authority to borrow money to buy land for housing and it was not used for that, is there any follow-up or oversight?  Are there any penalties, for example, if a local authority borrowed &euro;10 million, bought land for housing and then used it for recreation?</p></speech>

If a proposal had not come forward in five to seven years, the local authority would need to contact the Department because the rolled up interest aspect would have expired and it would have needed to agree either to bring forward a project or to agree a new funding arrangement.  If the local authority used it for community purposes for playing fields, the only way in which it could do that is if it had another vehicle for financing it because the vehicle that was in place for it was purely a housing vehicle that would only recoup its costs if a housing project was brought forward on it.</p></speech>

It does not specify criteria that need to be taken into account, and that is something that needs to be addressed.  We would have relied significantly on the approval by the elected members and confirmation of that from the local authority as satisfying us that the process had gone to the elected members who are responsible in law for approving the borrowing.  The valuation issues would have been undertaken as part of that process.</p></speech>

There are two things at play.  One is that the purchase of land is an executive function under one provision of the Local Government Act and the raising of borrowing is an elected member function under section 106.  In regard to the purchase of the particular site in Galway, while a contract was signed prior to the borrowing approval being secured from the elected members, my understanding is that a specific condition was included in the contract that provided that if the elected members' approval was not achieved within a six-week period, the contract would not be enforceable.</p></speech>

Would the Secretary General be aware, surprised or concerned that the valuations that informed this purchase were prepared by the vendor?</p></speech>

The initial valuation was prepared by a firm of professional auctioneers and valuers which it seems was also engaged by the vendor.  Certainly, at minimum from a perception point of view, that is not something that looks particularly well, but it is important that there was also an internal valuation done by the council's own professional valuer before the contract to purchase was signed.</p></speech>

While the first valuers were apparently also engaged by the vendor, they were engaged by the local authority for the purpose of providing the initial valuation and they provided a range of valuations on the basis of three different scenarios of what the site could be used for.</p></speech>

That internal valuation was &euro;2 million higher than the valuation provided by Rooney Auctioneers and Chartered Surveyors, which is a very reputable and well-known valuer in Galway that does good work.  They provided a valuation for the vendor who, presumably seeking to maximise his own personal return for his investment, had a valuation done, let us call it valuation "x".  The council's internal valuation - and it was a matter of months before the most recent transaction on those lands - was &euro;2 million higher.  Would this be a matter of concern for the Department?</p></speech>

I will try to explain this because it is about different valuations.  Ultimately the final valuation that was done by the internal valuer in Galway City Council, and the basis upon which the borrowing approval was put to the city council, was on the basis that the site would accommodate 97 units.  If we look at the range of valuations that were provided initially, at the outset of the process it would have equated to about &euro;9.7 million.  It would have been between the second and the third highest valuations.  The valuation then done by the internal valuer was on the basis of a figure in excess of &euro;11.1 million, so there was a gap of &euro;1.4 million.  From the papers I have seen. it appears to me that before the contract was finalised, and before a price was agreed, there was an updated assessment done around similar transactions in the area and the price was brought back to &euro;10.5 million.</p></speech>

We have received a proposal from the city council to use it for a combination and to use a portion of the site to provide a social housing project and a Traveller accommodation project.  We have gone back to the city council on that with regard to the proposal not satisfying value for money criteria.  This is largely because it seems the entirety of the land cost was being assigned to the use of only a particular part of the site and that was not appropriate.  I believe there is a proposal now from the city council to use the site temporarily for Traveller accommodation purposes and obviously we will engage with the council on that.</p> <p>  Deputies MacSharry and Cassells raised an important point around the land approval process.  Over the past three or four years or more, there have been no drawdowns of new land loans, which is no surprise given the landbank that was built up.  Our priority over recent years has been to try bringing land into active use through the land aggregation scheme and through other local authority lands once we had the capital resources available to allow us to do that.  In 12 months or more, some local authorities, to be able to work ahead and build up their pipeline of future projects, may well need to get into the space in certain types of places of looking at land acquisitions.  In the second half of this year the Department will be looking at section 106 and at a broad land borrowing framework for local authorities in order that there is absolute clarity around the responsibilities of the local authority and what criteria need to be specified in legislation.  There is a framework that needs to be put in place for the future.</p></speech>

I believe that was ring-fenced in 1997 for the local government fund.  In fact, many things were bundled together at that point, including the abolition of water charges and property tax at the same time.  This was being made into the local government fund and ring-fenced for that.  Funds were collected online and at local government offices acting as agents for the motor tax office, the money was transferred to the Department with responsibility for the environment and a general purpose grant was paid out to local authorities.  The general purpose grant is gone and the local property tax has been introduced.  The money continues to be paid to the Department and some of it goes to Irish Water.

It was established at a time when our Department had responsibility for roads.  There was a sort of connection between motor tax going into a fund and roads expenditure going out the other side.  That has changed since then, and a lot else has changed.</p> <p>  I will turn to local property tax first.  It comes into the fund and goes out to-----</p></speech>

That water related funding moved from local authorities in 2013 to 2014, if I have my years correct.  In effect, money that had been going to local authorities for water related purposes was redirected to Irish Water when Irish Water took responsibility for water functions.  Subsequently, a balance of the general purpose grant that remained was replaced by the local property tax.</p></speech>

This reflected the move of funding to Irish Water.

The only advantage of a growing population is that the local property tax will bring in some income.  The last time I looked at the staffing ratios across the country, I saw that they varied considerably.  This point has been made.  The lowest staffing ratio is in Meath County Council and the highest is in Kerry County Council.  Kerry County Council has nearly double the staff even though there are 30,000 or 40,000 fewer people living there.  Meath has a higher population.  Kerry has a lower population.  The embargo was a blunt instrument.  It did not redistribute staff in proportion to the population of Meath.  The staffing level is also calculated into the baseline in the funding of services.  It is not an equal situation.  Is the staffing level factored into the 80% at a point in time or does that deviate?</p></speech>

Areas that are growing in population are worse off.  Such an area might not be worse off at a point in time, but it will be worse off as its population grows if its baseline was poor to begin with.  An area with an inadequacy of services and an inadequacy of staff was always going to be disadvantaged by virtue of this particular scenario.</p></speech>

I understand there has to be a social transfer.  I understand all of that.  It is not true to say no area is worse off, as some counties are worse off because they are growing.  I would also like to ask about the development contributions that were capped.  Councils could only spend what they brought in over a given year because it was part of the general government deficit.  Is that still the same situation?  Are there funds in hand that cannot be spent?</p></speech>

There is a slice of the general Government balance that is assigned to the local government sector and has to remain broadly in a neutral space.</p><p>That means that the local government system can only undertake new borrowing or spend down capital balances to the extent that it is matched on the other side.  That does not necessarily operate within each local authority.  We would go through a process to try to establish the plans of all local authorities and then try to apportion the available space, prioritising matters such as capital investment and housing.</p></speech>

I can recall at the time some commentaries around suggestions that large blocks of accommodation might have to be knocked because there would never be anybody to occupy them.  There was a massive shrink in resources and we had to try to match the shrunken pool of resources with the availability of resources and that is how leasing and arrangements of that kind came into effect.  HAP is a structured programme to reflect the fact that rent supplement turned into something it was never designed to be.  This brings responsibility for all long-term housing needs under the roof of the local authority in a single place.</p></speech>

They were allowed to retain a part of that gain, entirely at their own discretion but they must assign a slice of that gain to housing and roads.  That is not part of the 80%.</p></speech>

I would like a detailed note on this.  HAP is substantially a transfer of people from rent supplement.  The 13,000 are not new people and they are not in new houses.  When the rent supplement payments were being moved from the Department of Social Protection to the local authorities, county by county, landlords increased the rent for a person in receipt of rent supplement and that was deemed a new application by the Department of Social Protection because it had to reassess the situation.  The Department handed that over to the local authority under HAP.  Many of the people who went onto HAP are the same who received rent supplement remaining in the same houses but because the rent increased, it was recategorised as HAP.  Is Mr. McCarthy with me on this?</p></speech>

Some might have been people who were on rent supplement changing address.  The person was in a house on rent supplement, the rent went up, the person left and got a new house and that same person now comes in under HAP.  Mr. McCarthy is calling that a new application but it is the same person.  Does Mr. McCarthy have information on how many of the 13,375 were not in receipt of rent supplement?  How many new people are there and how many new properties are involved?  Mr. McCarthy says he has the information and will send it.  Does it answer the specific question?  A new person is not just the person who changes address, who was on rent supplement and comes in under HAP for the first time.  Do Mr. McCarthy's figures capture that?</p></speech>

One related to an environmental impact assessment directive and the other related to septic tanks.  The amounts involved were relatively small.  They were in the low single digits of millions of euro by virtue of the fact that in both cases we were nearly in compliance by the time the judgment had been arrived at.</p> <p>  The Deputy's question was whether we have looked at the potential for what fines might be.  There is a mechanism set out in the European framework.  It takes into account a number of factors.  To give an example of other fines with regard to the urban wastewater treatment space, in October 2013, Belgium was ordered to pay a lump sum fine of &euro;10 million and a daily fine of nearly &euro;5,000.  In November 2013, Luxembourg was ordered to pay &euro;2 million plus a daily fine of &euro;2,800.  In October 2015, Greece was ordered to pay a fixed lump sum of &euro;10 million and a daily fine of &euro;20,000, which is the equivalent of &euro;7.3 million per annum.  In June 2016, Portugal was ordered to pay &euro;3 million and a daily payment of &euro;8,000.  Each fine is determined by reference to the facts of the individual case, but we have consistently prioritised funding-----</p></speech>

I want to move on to the second question regarding housing.  The witness responded to a question from an Teachta Cassells about the four-stage process in which a local authority applies for funding for social housing and the time it takes for the cheque finally to arrive.  My understanding is that the average wait time is about 18 months.  That has been a difficulty because there has been some tension between local authorities, CEOs and councils and the Department in terms of money being available, the local authority saying "yes", but the process being very difficult, cumbersome and it taking an awfully long time to draw down the funding.</p> <p>  The witness told us there was a review, which there was.  This is the important part.  What we need to do is shorten that timeframe down from 18 months.  I heard the witness speaking about the changes to a one-stage process for proposals below 15 units and costing less than &euro;2 million or &euro;3 million.  The witness might comment on the de-risk element of that.  My understanding from local authority CEOs is that the risk is all on the side of the local authority.  To stick with the broader issue of the four-stage process, what proposals are in the pipeline at the moment to reduce that timeframe?  That is the critical issue here.  That is one question on housing.</p> <p>  The second question relates to the acquisition of vacant properties.  Does the Department have an analysis of how many vacant properties there are?  I understand there are two schemes.  One is the repair and leasing scheme.  What percentage of vacant properties overall is the Department targeting under that scheme?  There is also the Housing Agency acquisition programme.  The witness might talk us through what measures are in place.  I do not know whether the witness has seen a report from the Simon Community today in which it states the need to make greater use of vacant properties, which I support.  There are two issues here: the four-stage process for acquisitions or new builds for local authorities and why it takes so long, and the issue of vacant properties.  I ask the witness to address both issues.</p></speech>

There is probably a small number that go back that far.  When we put the four-stage general approval framework process in place, it was a reduction from nine stages.  We certainly cut a lot out of it and we received Department of Public Expenditure and Reform approval for it.  As I said, we introduced the one-stage process.  One of the practical issues that arise in the four-stage process is that when project costs move on to the pre-tender stage, they can change.  We have to go through a process to understand why they have changed and whether value for money is still being delivered.  There can be legitimate reasons they change.  However, we have to go through that process in order that they do not-----</p></speech>

Further action may now be put in place.  I am trying to establish whether the Department has set targets or whether it is going to set targets to reduce the average timeframe.  If it is 18 months and is causing a problem, the solution is obviously to find ways to reduce it on average.  What specifically is being proposed?</p></speech>

One is the setting of targets for the completion of the various stages.  We have to be very clear.  This is what we have to engage with local authorities about.  There is no point in us setting a target and saying that if we get a stage three application in, we will deal with it in two weeks.  If the stage three application that comes in is not up to scratch, we are not going to be able to deal with it in two weeks.  There has to be an understanding that we will set targets and do everything we can to honour those targets.  However, it has to be on the basis of proper documentation.</p></speech>

Let me state what they are, because I attempted to get them from the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and it was extremely difficult.

There were 4,720 households, not people, on the waiting list.  That means that somewhere between 10,000 and 15,000 people are on the waiting list for a home in Galway city.  To give a very practical example of that, I know one particular applicant who is waiting since 2002.  In that space of time - 15 years - the city council has never been in a position to offer him a house.  I have the up-to-date figures for empty houses for Galway.  There are 40 empty houses.  With the exception of specific Traveller accommodation, which I will come back to, no reason has been given why three-bedroom, two-bedroom and one-bedroom units are empty.</p><p>The Department has come back to us with facts.  It has said that units are turned over very quickly and that empty units are a tiny percentage of the total.  I acknowledge that the 40 houses are a tiny percentage of the more than 2,000 houses owned by the council in Galway city.  Nevertheless, the perception associated with homes being empty is very bad.  Will Mr. McCarthy explain why these houses are not turned over in a matter of weeks?  They are deemed to be suitable for people to live in, but when residents die or move on, they are suddenly deemed to be unsuitable for allocation.  That is my first question.  My second question relates to the housing allocation payment.  Mr. McCarthy has given a breakdown of the 13,000 figure.  Can he confirm that this payment is really the only game in town for the provision of what he has been calling social housing?  I do not blame him for using that term because it is Government policy to do so.  Is it the case that the housing assistance payment scheme is really the only game in town?</p></speech>

Our targets for 2017 are to build approximately 2,400 units; to bring 760 void units, possibly including some of the units mentioned by the Deputy, back into use; to make 1,250 acquisitions; to provide 600 leased units; to make 1,000 units available under the rental accommodation scheme; and to provide 15,000 units under the housing assistance payment scheme.

I am not trying to catch him out.  I am trying to use plain and simple English to elucidate the nature of the housing emergency.  For a long time, the land aggregation scheme under which 247 ha of land have been transferred remained the third secret of Fatima.  Nobody seemed to know about the land aggregation scheme after the decision to transfer land was made.  Is it not the case that even though we are in a housing crisis, this land has remained absolutely unused?  It has been confirmed today that even though proposals are in train, not one single public house has been built on the land in question.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

We will not build any houses this year.  If we are lucky, we will complete 14, but I do not think we will.  Two thirds of a parcel of land that is zoned residential is frozen and cannot be touched.  This increases the intensity of the problem.  I understand there are difficulties between the Department and the local authority, which wanted 69 houses to go ahead but was not given permission for them.  I will not use the few minutes available to me to get into that.  I am highlighting what I have been told.  If we use the problems in Galway as an illustration of what is happening in the rest of the country, it is not clear that there is a national housing crisis?</p></speech>

In 2016, a pot of resources was made available to us for housing purposes.  While there was some small carry-over from 2015 into 2016, we used every single euro that was available to us in 2016 to respond to housing issues.  The extent to which those issues play out in different local authority areas varies.  I am talking from a national perspective.  The Deputy talked about transferring what is happening in a local context in Galway into the national context.  My point is that the national context sees a pot of resources made available to us.  We put a range of schemes in place.  We engage proactively with local authorities and approved housing bodies.  We use wisely every resource that is available to us.</p></speech>

A great deal of money is going to approved housing bodies.  As far as I can see, no money is going to the city council in Galway.  Mr. McCarthy can clarify this for me.  I said earlier that the housing assistance payment is the only game in town.  Am I correct when I say that a single adult in Galway, and presumably in other parts of the country, is given a housing assistance payment of &euro;575, with a discretion of 20%?</p></speech>

In addition, the tenant will pay the differential rent to the council.  He or she will pay the difference between the sum of &euro;575 and the market rent into the landlord's pocket.  In fact, the housing assistance payment actively condones cash payments to the landlord or landlady.  Does the Secretary General agree?  </p></speech>

That was on foot of analysis done by the Department of Social Protection and approved by Government.</p></speech>

I am arguing about the effect of the limits and what it actively and legally condones.  The &euro;575 plus 20% goes straight into the landlord's bank account.  The person must pay the differential rent to the council, and rightly so.  In addition, he or she must pay the extra to bring the figure up to the market rent, which is anything between &euro;1,000 and &euro;1,500 in Galway city.  Does the Secretary General understand?</p></speech>

Huge segments of land were bought by councillors with the best of will in the world to forward plan.  The fact it was not used is an indictment on each Government that provided no funding.  The term "value for money" is an unfortunate choice of words and the Secretary General might have a word in someone's ear about it.  When this matter came to the attention of the Department why did the Secretary General not consider it proactively in terms of value for money?  Did that not happen?   </p></speech>

We do not know and now we have more screaming headlines as a result of an inquiry or an issue raised by a Senator in the Seanad.</p> <p>  I support city councils, local authorities and public service as they are absolutely necessary.

Following on from what Deputy Connolly said, the essence of what Mr. McCarthy said was that if there is a difference between what is allowed and the extra discretion and if somebody has to pay extra money to get that house, it is a matter between the tenant and the landlord.  Is that legal?  Does the scheme allow for it?</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy calls it flexibility or the exercise of choice, but the possibility of the person having to come up with funding is available under HAP but was not available under rent supplement.  Does Mr. McCarthy not then see the point that the Deputy was referring to which was that Mr. McCarthy did not give a clear answer?  He is clarifying it now.</p></speech>

Can the Department spell out whether it is aware of that and the circumstances surrounding it?</p></speech>

This issue relates to a housing development being undertaken as part of the Ballymun regeneration project.  It was a situation where pyrite was found.  It goes back to 2007 and 2008.  When presented with the situation that arose at the time, we engaged with Ballymun Regeneration Limited on the appropriate response.  There were two options which were considered.  One was to continue with the existing contract and ask the existing contractor to complete the work and pay for it without any determination of legal liability which would be determined at a later stage.  The other was to terminate the contractor's employment and secure someone else to come in and do it.  Both of those options were considered from risk and legal perspectives and the choice was ultimately made that the best outcome from the taxpayers' perspective would be to continue the employment of the existing contractor, remedy the work and bring the project to a conclusion.  The project was very significantly advanced at that stage.  All of the financial, legal and risk factors were taken into account.</p> <p>  Where the issue of a loan came into play was that in wanting to progress the project to completion, we were faced with a situation where there was no legal certainty around where the ultimate liability for the defective material would be placed.  We wanted an avenue through which to provide space for the additional public funds that were going to be provided to be recovered in due course, including if the contractor who was engaging in legal proceedings was to get a successful outcome.  Even though it is ten years on, those legal proceedings have not yet concluded.  There are a whole range of other legal proceedings, and I want to be careful about what I say, ongoing on a similar issue but Dublin City Council or BRL are not involved in those.  This was a vehicle with the taxpayers' interests in mind to try to provide an avenue through which moneys could be recovered at a stage down the road, including if the outcome of legal proceedings which are still going on went in a particular direction.</p></speech>

I do not want to mention any company or legal issue.  In principle, is it good practice to loan a company &euro;6.6 million without any recourse to the directors of the company?  In other words, if one has a company or a vehicle to which the Department or a local authority decides to loan money on an interest-free basis, what happens if that company goes into liquidation or ceases to trade?  What guarantees are there?  Is the Department aware of any personal guarantees as security for its money?  If this company ceased to exist, how would the Department propose to get its money back?</p></speech>

Over 100 houses were involved which had been very significantly developed and we were potentially looking at a situation where this development could have lain there for God knows how long had it gone down the legal route.  As I said, legal proceedings are still going on ten years down the road.  There were two dimensions to it.  One was to get the project completed.  The options for dealing with that were looked at and risk assessed and the particular option that was chosen was determined arising out of that.  The other was a parallel vehicle to try to deal with the reality of the uncertainties, legal and otherwise, that existed and at least keep open the options for the State down the road.</p></speech>

That is not a space that local authorities should ordinarily be in.  However, I suppose these were very peculiar and difficult circumstances, shrouded by all sorts of legal uncertainty.  Ten years down the road and it is still not resolved.  It was a tailored solution taken on the basis of the best legal advice at the time.</p></speech>

We need to be very careful when spending taxpayers' money.  Allowing any local authority to enter into agreements and advance interest free loans of the magnitude that is suggested in this report in <i>The Irish Times</i>to any company without any recourse or any guarantee is very bad practice on behalf of the Department.  What guarantees do we have that this will be repaid?</p></speech>

I suppose ultimately what will happen will be dependent on the circumstances that exist at the point in time, including whether legal proceedings have been resolved and what the outcome of those legal proceedings are.</p></speech>

Does Mr. McCarthy accept that?</p></speech>

I suppose the agreement was entered into at the time on the basis of legal advice available to Ballymun Regeneration Limited, BRL, as the best available option taking account of what might have happened in other circumstances.</p></speech>

I think it is very serious.  In addition there is an issue relating to tendering.  That is also raised in this article which is now public.  No tender process was entered into for this expenditure.  That would concern me.  Does it concern Mr. McCarthy?</p></speech>

Tendering needs to be the norm in order to deliver value for money.  That was one of the factors that was considered in the risk assessment that was done.  As between the various options and weighing up all the risks associated with different options, continuing the existing contract was the vehicle that was chosen.  We got legal advice to establish that was a permissible option in the circumstances.</p></speech>

That is a very poor move by the Department.</p></speech>

This is a legacy issue and may not be an issue for the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government.  Some people have still not paid non-principal private residence tax.  The answer to a recent parliamentary question indicated that &euro;30 million was collected last year.  With fines included it comes to about &euro;7,000 for people who never paid it.  That would indicate about 4,000 people paid last year.  Where does that &euro;30 million collected last year go?  Some people never registered and because they are doing something with property had to regularise their situation.</p></speech>

Given that &euro;35 million is coming in per annum, has anyone in the Department calculated what is out there.  It is probably a contingent asset.  This phrase has come up about contingent asset - the Social Insurance Fund - but it is now clear to me that there is a stream of income of &euro;30 million to &euro;35 million per annum.  That indicated that there is an uncollected amount of money out there.  Has the Department done anything to try to estimate how much money might be out there, or does it just sit back with the view that if it lands through the door, it lands through the door?  What proactive steps is the Department taking given that &euro;30 million is coming through with no effort from the Department?</p></speech>

I think Mr. McCarthy understands what I am looking for here.  There was money coming through and we both know that some of it was never in the Department's system.  Some of what was coming through possibly was in the Department's system but the Department should know how many of the 5,000 people who paid last year were people about whom the Department knew nothing.  It should know many of them were not on the Department's books in 2013 and how many of the people who were on the books at that time have paid their liabilities in full.  That will give us an indication of the outstanding liabilities.  The Department is collecting &euro;35 million per year with zero effort on the part of the State.  All of the money is coming from conveyancing and solicitors telling people that they have to pay up.  It is good that such a mechanism exists but it is not good enough to wait for 40 years for some of that to work through the system.  I want to see how the Department can proactively deal with money that is there to be collected but which no effort is being made to collect it.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to provide a detailed report on that.  I expect that such a report will take a little bit of time but-----</p></speech>

I ask that the Department sends us the information it has and we will have a look at it.  My next question is on the tenant purchase scheme.  Can local authorities unilaterally, through a valuer, set the value, about which there can be no further discussion or can the tenant get an approved valuer, recognised by the local authority, to provide an alternative valuation?  Can negotiations or discussions then take place between the professional valuers?  Does the scheme allow for an independent verification of the valuation carried out by the local authority?</p></speech>

As the relevant housing authority, it is for the local authority to determine the purchase price, to calculate, in effect, what the tenant purchaser would have to pay.  That said, if there was a dispute, I am sure that the local authority would engage with the prospective purchaser.  If there were different valuations, they could be examined, but ultimately the housing authority makes the call.</p></speech>

I believe that this is not good public administration.  We will test it; that is all I will say.  I thank Mr. McCarthy for clarifying that it is decided by the local authority and not by another valuer.</p> <p>  Mr. McCarthy said that the housing assistance payment, HAP, scheme is costing &euro;152 million out of the &euro;1.3 billion budget for social housing this year.  I ask him to send us a note detailing the breakdown of the balance, how much is for approved housing bodies and so forth.  I ask him to provide information on the make-up of that &euro;1.3 billion budget.  I am sure Mr. McCarthy has it in front of him now but I ask him to send it on to the committee.</p> <p>  My next question is about staffless libraries.  The Department ran a number of pilot schemes.  Was the staffless libraries initiative rolled out in other areas before the pilot schemes were fully assessed and completed?  If a local authority wants to refurbish a library or build a new one, is funding only provided on condition that it enables the library to be staffless?  The authority may not proceed with the staffless library option, but is it a requirement that the technology be installed to allow for this, with 25% of the funding for the technology to be provided by the local authority?  Is that part of the Department's library scheme?  Is it requiring that all refurbished or new libraries must be staffless library enabled?</p></speech>

Mr. John McCarthy is the Accounting Officer and I want him to provide a detailed note of the situation with regard to the assets and liabilities of the Housing and Sustainable Communities Agency.  I ask him to send us on a note because five years after the agency was established, it is extraordinary that we are having such a discussion at this point.  Leaving aside the Comptroller and Auditor General, the primary responsibility to produce the accounts lies with the company.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is only the auditor.</p><p>There is a board of directors and it is its responsibility to know those things in the first place.  The Comptroller and Auditor General will audit it after they have signed off their accounts.  I ask for a note on that and on the uncollected non-principal private residence issue we mentioned.</p><p> I have a last topic to mention.  I apologise, but these are all specific issues that have crossed my desk as a Deputy.  I put down a parliamentary question on this last year and Mr. McCarthy might have seen correspondence from me on it.  It relates to the local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme.  In my constituency - and this is reflected everywhere - the cost of the local authority mortgage protection insurance scheme, which every person with a housing loan must join, is three or four times more expensive than what is available in the private market to people who do not have their loans with a local authority.  It is not 2% or even 30% more expensive, it is 300% to 400% more expensive.  In the private market, it was made illegal years ago for the mortgage provider to force the mortgage holder to take out mortgage protection insurance with that company.  Customers are free to shop around.  Seemingly, what is good for 85% of the population does not seem to be good enough for those who have loans from the local authority.  They are still being obliged legally to have mortgage protection insurance with the scheme.</p><p> That is a point but the real point is that it is several hundred percent dearer than what is available in the private sector.  When people run into arrears and one seeks to negotiate with a finance officer, one sees what looks like a phenomenal amount of mortgage protection insurance compared to what one deals with where a person owes money to a bank.  It is utterly unfair.  I know Mr. McCarthy will tell me there is extra coverage, that it covers a person until he or she is 65 and that if he or she dies, he or she gets &euro;3,000 extra.  I know what the benefits are from the reply to the parliamentary question and correspondence from the Housing Finance Agency.  The most recent reply I received from the Minister last year stated that as part of the upcoming retendering process, the relevant committee would seek to secure with effect from 1 January 2017 the most appropriate insurance cover at the best value for money for local authority borrowers.  I ask Mr. McCarthy to provide the committee with a detailed assessment of the improvements made to the scheme which were achieved on 1 January 2017.</p><p> I have asked the Department to give me the detail of how much money has been collected in the scheme and how much has been paid out.  That has not been provided.  The Department said it was not its affair.  I have written to the Housing Finance Agency which says it does not have the information either.  I have written to the local government managers' association or whatever the group involved is and it said it did not have the information.  I am told the mortgage protection insurance scheme protection committee cannot provide it.  It is a sub-committee of the City and County Management Association which cannot provide me with the information.  The local authorities obviously do not have it and the Housing Finance Agency has not been able to provide that information.  The Department is on that also.  Despite PQs, the Department cannot provide this information.  What is the total amount paid by local authority mortgage holders for mortgage protection insurance for each of the last couple of years and what payouts have been made?  They are being severely penalised because they have nowhere to go.  If they get a loan from the agency, they are forced to get this insurance.  It is not fair.</p><p> The Department says the current underwriter is Generali PanEurope with Marsh Ireland acting as its insurance administrator.  The PQ reply says that financial information specific to the operation of the local authority MPI project is commercially sensitive.  We want to lift that veil of commercial sensitivity.  The Department knows what I am looking for.  I do not accept the answer I was given.  How many people have local authority mortgages in the country under regular mortgages and shared-ownership mortgages schemes, approximately?  Somebody across from me must know.  How many local authority mortgages are out there?</p></speech>

Earlier he was speaking with a colleague, Deputy Peter Burke, about the case where Dublin City Council gave a &euro;6.6 million interest free loan to James Elliott Construction in respect of Ballymun Regeneration Limited in addition to the contract for &euro;10 million of building repair works which were not put out to tender.  Mr. McCarthy defined this in his contribution as bad practice, which is correct in my opinion.  Is he aware of any other cases like this under local authorities?  Does he think this is completely unique in a national context?</p></speech>

Is the feeling that, financially, the modular home project was something of a learning experience?  Would Mr. McCarthy say that, based on the figure per unit he gave?</p></speech>

There was certainly a learning attached to it and that is why we did it on a pilot basis first, in order to be able to learn.  In terms of the procurement process, because much of the product that is ultimately delivered is actually manufactured off-site, one of the most significant learnings that came out of it was that being involved in the processes in the factory is every bit as important as when it actually comes onto the site and is being constructed.  That was something that certainly came across very clearly in terms of major learnings from the pilot project.</p></speech>

Would it have been the case that it would have been better to simply build regular houses?</p></speech>

If one thinks back to September 2015, which was the first time there was a display of modular type housing units, various parties, including ourselves, went to inspect them.  From memory, it was late October before the procurement process for the Ballymun project was started.  The contract was awarded before the end of November.  That was a very tight period and the units were ultimately available in April.  In comparison with a 22-unit housing project, to deliver it in five months is still considerably shorter than my experience of a comparable traditional-build project.</p></speech>

Is the Department developing any policy responses to deal with that?</p></speech>

More detailed analysis on housing will be made available from the census on 20 April.  That will help.  We have not been waiting for that.  There is the Housing Agency acquisition programme, the repair and leasing scheme and the buy and renew scheme as well as mainstream acquisition, all designed to tap into vacant property.  One issue raised consistently is the extent to which there may be vacant property associated with older people availing of the fair deal scheme and being in nursing home accommodation.  Since last month we started to work with the Department of Health to see if there is a significant quantum of housing vacant for those reasons and, if so, whether we can incentivise it back into use.</p></speech>

We will write to all local authorities.  Some of the Dublin local authorities have been advertising ahead of the scheme for expressions of interest from people with vacant properties.  Our first step is to try to make sure we use the available money to get to the 800, learn from that and then we can consider targets for local authorities.</p></speech>

When the county councils were operating the water services, was &euro;399 million being put into the operational costs across all the 130 odd local authorities at the time?  Is that money being used for the same purposes?  In his opening statement Mr. McCarthy said the &euro;399 million in 2015 funded the allowance of 21,000 litres of free water provided in respect of all children, the cost of capping the domestic water charges and the cost of providing a general subsidy for the cost of services reduced to level of unit charge.  They were all subsidies as opposed to operational costs.  Although Mr. McCarthy said the &euro;399 million was being moved from the cost of what local authorities were doing to Irish Water, they are very specific items.</p> <p>  My understanding is that if there is a problem with water, a person should ring Irish Water which confirms that with the local authority, and under the service level agreement there is a billing arrangement.  Who is paying the staff in the county councils?  Is the money coming through the service level agreement or are they paid by the council?  If so, where is the cost to the State?</p></speech>

It meets those operating costs through charges, when they were in place, through non-domestic charges and the subvention by the public purse, which is described in my opening statement.</p> <p>  I will ask my colleague, Ms Graham, to say a few words on that and on the issue of the staff employment situation through the service level agreements.</p></speech>

In 2014 there was no economic regulation and there were no domestic charges.  That &euro;439 million came out of the general purpose grant and went to Irish Water, which would have got a capital grant.  We then moved into a different phase.</p></speech>

In parallel with that, Irish Water would have set budgets because the service level agreements would have been signed off and individual budgets would have been agreed with local authorities which would have covered staff and other costs.  Some of the costs have moved gradually, for example, the chemicals and energy costs that would have been borne by local authorities have moved centrally into Irish Water.  The headcount in the local authorities is agreed year by year and they are reimbursed.  The Irish Water accounts and operating costs show the payroll of Irish Water, the local authority services agreements and all the other components.  There were design, build and operate costs as well.  That is the range of costs that local authorities would have applied.</p></speech>

My recollection is there are three broad terms: the DBO contracts; the payroll costs; and energy and chemicals, which are the other two big factors within it.  We had an analysis at one stage of that breakdown.  It was in the PwC report, which we can get and pass on to the committee.</p></speech>

We are staying with local authorities for the group water sector.  Overtime rates have remained within that.  There are loans that have remained with local authorities.  We mentioned earlier that there are many HFA loans which latterly were part of Government debt and a payment was given to local authorities.  At the outset of the meeting, the Comptroller and Auditor General mentioned the money was going in and was then used to pay off.  That was a two-way transaction, with one crossing out the other, but until that point there were interest charges that had to be borne by local authorities.  It continued to go to them from the local government fund.  That funding was not transferred to Irish Water.  That is how the &euro;439 million becomes a much reduced figure.</p></speech>

Mr. McCarthy mentioned that in 2017 the Department hopes to progress land acquisition and land banks for councils.  What are the criteria of suitability?  I refer again to the 28 acres that Meath County Council owns, which is land locked.  The council bought 28 acres for &euro;22 million and it is landlocked.  In terms of accessing that land, a capital fund will be needed for road access which will traverse private land, and also for water and sewerage.  In terms of the Department working with county councils on land suitability, what are the criteria the Department is going through?</p></speech>

There are issues around value for money which is tied into usability, suitability from a zoning point of view and from a sustainable communities point of view.  We need to articulate that in the legislation and associated guidance.  We need much more clarity between the local authority and the Department.  I do not know the specifics of the site the Deputy is talking about.  I do not know if it is one that the council put forward for consideration as part of a wider land development under the local infrastructure housing activation fund.

What help is available from the Department directly to local authorities in respect of implementing that as a reality for sustainable communities?  There is an area in my town of Navan called Johnstown where there are 3,000 homes and no facilities.  It is a result of planners and councillors zoning land banks 20 years ago with no facilities whatsoever.  That area of the town has a bigger population than the town of Trim.  What help is there?  It is a massive issue at the moment and it has been covered by local media.  What help is there from the Department to help the local authority provide community facilities?  I am sure it has happened in Galway and elsewhere that county development plans are signed off and there is more building going on.  What help is available because that community is crying out for the provision of a community facility?</p></speech>

The first is cost issues, namely, making sure we are getting value for money, and the other is sustainable communities.  While we need to make sure the process works more efficiently, we are trying to avoid the type of situation the Deputy is talking about, which is a function of decisions that were made 20 years ago.  We do not want to end up building large swathes of monotenure housing in one location.</p> <p>  On the community facilities issue, there has not been funding available to the Department over the past number of years in that space for a capital scheme but small funding is now provided.  I can get the Deputy a note on new community facilities funds if he wants.  The terms of the scheme are just being worked out but we can get the Deputy a note on the way it will operate and the type of projects it will be designed to cover.</p></speech>

On the funding side, we have made two things available to local authorities to support them.  They receive a payment for every new HAP case they take on.  That is for HAP but there is a separate capacity for local authorities to take on staff and fund them out of the capital programme to support the roll out of the capital programme.

The Tribunal to Inquire into Certain Planning Matters and Payments has cost &euro;116 million so far.  Money is still due, though, so it looks like the total figure will be &euro;159 million.  The tribunal stated that the majority of public officials performed their functions with the utmost integrity.  I wish to place that positive comment on the record first, as I am moving on to a more damning part.  I will ask the witnesses for the figures.  It is clear from the inquiry's fifth and final report that, during the period in question, corruption in Irish political life was "both endemic and systemic".  This is a damning finding, notwithstanding the qualification about the integrity of most staff, but what was the cost of finding that?</p></speech>

Before the State Claims Agency came onto the pitch, this was handled by cost accountants.  The State Claims Agency was then established, so costs moved into that space.  To date, the agency has managed files with claims amounting to &euro;24.3 million, which were settled for &euro;11.9 million, a saving of just over 50%.  Without getting into specifics, I am aware of one settlement in which the settled amount was 70% less than what had been claimed.  It is a rigorous claims settlement process.</p> <p>  The bulk of the remaining costs have to do with the settling of claims that are on hand but have not been closed.  However, there are still third party cost claims that have not yet been submitted.  My understanding is there is no way of bringing down the shutters and compelling people to submit their claims.  The tribunal is working on this matter with a view to wrapping the tribunal up towards the end of 2018, but we will have to see how that pans out.  The important aspect is to ensure that claims are being settled on the basis of a very rigorous assessment.</p></speech>

While it is yet to be initiated, it is causing considerable concern among the communities affected.  Mr. McCarthy discussed sustainable communities and community development with Deputy Cassells but we must also discuss the social mix.  I spent my time as a councillor promoting the idea of a social mix and the inclusion of rent allowance in Ballymun, so it would be incongruous to claim that a 100% social housing development in a neighbouring community is a good thing.  What is the rationale?  Most studies accept that a social mix is a social good.  As such, why is the project proceeding in this way?</p></speech>

Deputy Cassells and I were discussing a development of 2,000 or 3,000 units, all of which would be for social housing.  Quite a few projects in our mainstream social housing pipeline are in the order of 50 to 60 units.  We generally do not have an issue with a social housing block of that scale.  In larger sites, for example, O'Devaney Gardens where 600 housing units might be built, one would seek to get a mixed tenure on the site.  In other cases, a smaller social housing development in the wider context can achieve the broader mixed tenure.  These sites were proposed by the local authorities in the first instance.  Under the process, the broader housing tenure mix in the wider areas was examined and the sites were considered suitable to be taken forward as part of that project.</p></speech>

Rather than waiting until the we fully bottomed out on sites to contribute 1,500 units, we have broken it into three different phases.  The site to which Deputy Rock refers is in bundle 1, as we call it.  We have also identified the sites for bundle 2 and we are in the process of identifying the sites the bundle 3.  The National Development Finance Agency is acting as financial adviser to the Department on the project.  There is a little bit of further work to do on bundle 1, but it is likely that the tendering process for bundle 1 will kick off soon, if not this side of Easter then very quickly after Easter.</p></speech>

We also welcome the opportunity to engage with the committee on the issue of tracker mortgages.</p> <p>  First, I will give a brief outline of our strategy.  It is important to begin by letting the committee know we have just commenced the second year of an ambitious three-year programme.  In 2017 we will continue to adapt our processes in response to feedback received from service users.  The three-year change programme was devised following the completion of an independent strategic and operational review into the operation of the offices of the Financial Services Ombudsman and the Pensions Ombudsman.  This review was commissioned jointly by the then Pensions Ombudsman, Paul Kenny, and I.  The review report, which is available on our website, recommended that we should adopt a more proportionate, informal and preventative approach to dispute resolution.  Having consulted widely with stakeholders including those who had made complaints against financial service providers, the review delivered a number of key recommendations at the end of 2015 which we commenced implementing in February 2016.  This involved a major change programme, which commenced in February 2016.  This has delivered significant change in how we manage complaints.  As a result of these changes, we now undertake considerably more direct interaction with both consumers and providers to deliver a faster, more effective and efficient service.</p><p>Our 2017 strategy will continue to raise the bar on consumer protection and complaint handling through the use of mediation techniques and, where disputes are not resolved by agreement between the parties, through fair and impartial investigation and adjudication.  I am happy to report high levels of satisfaction from those using the new service.  A structured survey of both complainants and providers who use the new dispute resolution service has provided a positive endorsement of the effectiveness of the service.  The results prove that the newly implemented processes are working well and that the changes have had a positive impact.  The feedback shows us that we have laid a strong foundation on which we will continue to develop our services and improve how we interact with our stakeholders.  Our strategy for 2017 seeks to build on that firm foundation as we continue to improve our services into the future.</p><p> As the committee will be aware, the Government has decided to amalgamate the offices of the Financial Service Ombudsman and Pensions Ombudsman.  We engaged with the committee in October last year as part of the pre-legislative scrutiny of the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill which, when enacted, will provide the legislative basis for the merger.  We also engaged on that occasion with the committee on Deputy Doherty's Private Members' Bill relating to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p> I was appointed Financial Services Ombudsman in April 2015 and I was appointed Pensions Ombudsman in May 2016 under the Social Welfare and Pensions Act.  I currently hold both of those offices in separate capacities under the relevant legislation.  My colleague, Ms Cassidy, was appointed deputy Financial Services Ombudsman in January 2016.  She is the deputy ombudsman-designate for pensions.  As the current legislation does not provide for a deputy Pensions Ombudsman, she will not assume that element of her role until the necessary legislation is enacted.  We look forward to amalgamating fully both offices when the legislation is enacted and look forward to the enactment of other legislative measures that would bring greater protection for consumers.  In advance of the enactment of the legislation necessary for the merger, our 2017 strategy commits us to doing everything we can to make the amalgamation a success.  Both offices are now co-located and work in close co-operation, albeit under separate legislative provisions.  We are actively working with the Department of Finance and the Department of Social Protection to ensure a smooth amalgamation and successful and seamless delivery of the services.</p><p> Our core objectives, as set out in our strategic plan, are to operate an efficient, effective and fair dispute resolution process that mediates, investigates and adjudicates on consumer complaints; to provide an excellent customer service; to raise awareness of our work among the public and our stakeholders; to promote compliance by financial service providers with best practice in the provision of products and services; to support and develop the skills and competences of our staff in order to offer the best service to our users; to support the Financial Services Ombudsman council in its work; and to liaise with the Central Bank of Ireland, the Department of Finance, Oireachtas committees and other relevant bodies in order to improve the financial services market for consumers.  For each of these objectives, our 2017 strategy sets out key performance indicators and identifies the timeline and critical success factors.  The 2017 strategic plan has been developed by focusing on 2017, while also bearing in mind future years.</p><p> We will be happy to engage with the committee and answer any questions members have on the strategic plan, but before that I will use the remaining time to provide the committee with some information on tracker mortgages. </p><p> The long and well established role of an Ombudsman is to seek redress, to redress the difference in power and resources between the individual or the citizen and large institutions when resolving disputes.  This is particularly important when dealing with the inequality of arms that exists between a consumer and a financial service provider.  A time limit of six years for making complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman is set out in the current legislation.  Both the Financial Services and Pensions Ombudsman Bill and Deputy Doherty's Private Members' Bill, which were considered by the committee last October, proposed an extension to the time limits for complaints.  We would very much welcome such an extension as it could be particularly beneficial in respect of complaints relating to mortgages or financial products with a medium to long-term life span.</p><p> Where I uphold a complaint, I have a wide range of powers available to me.  I can direct a financial service provider to pay compensation of up to &euro;250,000.  I can also direct rectification.  Such rectification can be very significant as it can involve putting a person back in a position that they were in before the complaint arose.  In some instances, such as where a person was denied a tracker mortgage or the incorrect interest rate was applied, this may potentially be more important than any compensation offered.   The office of the Financial Services Ombudsman has played an important role in tracker issues to date.  I assure the committee that I will use the extensive powers available to me to ensure that customers of financial service providers who do not receive their entitlement and who are treated unfairly will have access to redress through our office.  I will not be found wanting in using these powers as they were intended by the Oireachtas where I find the conduct of the financial service provider to be contrary to law, unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory.</p><p> I consider it beneficial to provide the committee with a brief background to the key events and timelines relating to tracker mortgages.  The Financial Services Ombudsman first began to receive complaints regarding tracker mortgages in 2009.  In fact, it might be more correct to say the end of 2008.  We first started dealing with them in 2009 but we received a small number of complaints in 2008.  The 2009 annual report of the then Financial Services Ombudsman included a case study involving a borrower who had been wrongly given the entitlement to return to a tracker rate following a period of fixed interest rate.</p><p> In 2009, 2010 and 2011, the Financial Services Ombudsman upheld a number of complaints and directed financial institutions to put complainants back on tracker mortgages.  Some of these findings were challenged in the High Court.  Of particular note, PTSB appealed four findings of the Financial Services Ombudsman to the High Court in 2011.  All four of these findings, issued by the Financial Services Ombudsman in July and August 2011, had directed the bank to reinstate the complainants' tracker mortgages.  In August 2012, the High Court delivered judgment in all four cases.  Two of the complaints were remitted back to the Financial Services Ombudsman for further consideration, while the bank was unsuccessful in the remaining two appeals.  In October 2012, the High Court gave PTSB leave to appeal to the Supreme Court against those two findings.  These two appeals were listed for hearing by the Supreme Court on 16 February 2015.  However, when they were listed for mention by the Court on 5 February 2015, they were withdrawn by the bank.  It was around this time that the Central Bank had commenced an enforcement investigation of PTSB, which resulted in some customers being returned to tracker mortgages and receiving redress.</p><p> Shortly after I was appointed in 2015, I commenced a comprehensive analysis of tracker mortgage complaints which had been decided by the Financial Services Ombudsman between 2009 and July 2015.  The aim of this analysis, which covered almost 500 findings over that period, was to inform the Central Bank of the various issues relating to tracker mortgages that the Financial Services Ombudsman had encountered.  We worked in co-operation with the Central Bank in line with the memorandum of understanding in place between the organisations and I presented the analysis to the Central Bank in November 2015.  I understand that this information was of assistance to the Central Bank in scoping the examination currently under way in all the banks.  As the committee is aware, the objective of the examination is to ensure that lenders conduct a complete review of their mortgage loan books to assess compliance with both contractual and regulatory requirements relating to tracker mortgages and, in situations where customer detriment is identified from the examination, to provide appropriate redress and compensation so as to ensure fair outcomes for customers of those lenders.  I support fully this objective of the Central Bank and my office has worked in close co-operation with it to ensure any information we hold that is useful in achieving this objective is made available to the bank.</p><p> I became aware in early 2016 from correspondence sent to a complainant who had received a finding from the Financial Services Ombudsman by her bank that at least one bank proposed to exclude customers who had brought complaints to the Financial Services Ombudsman from the examination.  On becoming aware of this, I wrote to the CEOs of all the banks informing them that I was firmly of the view - which is shared by the Central Bank - that no mortgage holder who has made a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman should be treated any differently with regard to the examination by virtue of the fact of having made such a complaint, irrespective of the outcome.  I secured confirmation from each bank that no mortgage account holder coming within the scope of the examination will be treated any differently by the bank because a complaint has been made to the Financial Services Ombudsman.</p><p> Prior to and throughout the examination process, we have worked closely with the Central Bank and are in ongoing communication with complainants who have complaints with our office regarding their bank relating to tracker mortgages.  We are currently dealing with approximately 400 complaints relating to tracker mortgages.  In the vast majority of these, the mediation or investigation and adjudication of the complaint has been put on hold pending the outcome of the Central Bank examination.  The reason for this is twofold.  First, it will ensure that the Financial Services Ombudsman will have the fullest information available in arriving our decisions following an investigation and adjudication of the complaints because we will be able to take into account that additional information.  Second, it will ensure that complainants will remain and continue to have the right to have their complaint considered by the Financial Services Ombudsman if they are unhappy with the examination as it relates to them, which is very important.</p><p>If, having had his or her complaint on hold with the Financial Services Ombudsman, FSO, a complainant receives a proposal from their bank and the complainant advises the FSO that he or she is satisfied with that offer we will note that the matter has been settled and our file will be closed.  If, on the other hand, having put the complaint on hold with the FSO a complainant receives a proposal from his or her bank that is not acceptable or no proposal is offered, we then can progress the complaint.  There are a number of potential complaints we believe may arise following the completion of the examination process which the FSO may have to deal with.  These could include complaints that a person was not returned to his or her tracker mortgage at all or that they were not returned to a tracker mortgage at the correct time or at the correct margin.  Further, a complainant may well be returned to his or her tracker mortgage at the right rate and right time but may not be satisfied with the level of compensation offered.  Indeed, there may also be complaints about the process itself, for instance, the manner in which the claim for redress was dealt with as part of the examination.  I remind the committee of the assurances I gave here last October, that I am, along with the deputy ombudsman and our entire team, fully committed to using any powers afforded to the proposed financial services and pensions ombudsman, our existing powers and any enhanced powers given by the Oireachtas to the fullest possible extent.  </p><p> I can assure the committee that together with my team, I will play my part in providing redress for complainants to the FSO where I am of the view that the conduct of their financial service provider was contrary to law, unreasonable, unjust, oppressive or improperly discriminatory.  I thank the Chairman and members for the opportunity and we are happy to take any questions. </p></speech>

We think it is to the benefit of the complainant.  The reason for that is a significant amount of extra information may become available to us as part of the examination.  We will require of the provider whatever information is given to the Central Bank on foot of the examination.  It will have to provide us with that same information, which will enhance our investigation role into it.  The other reason is that with the Financial Services Ombudsman, as indeed with any body such as ours, there is only one bite of the cherry.  If people got an adjudication from us now, they could not have the same complaint dealt with later.  From our experience, there is no guarantee that even if people get something from the redress, they will get the correct redress.  Someone might get a tracker back but it might be at an interest rate that is not the correct one or it might not come back from the time that it ought to have.  What we are trying to do is preserve complainants' ability and rights in this regard.  It is not often or always appreciated that when they have gone through the full examination process and used the appeal system of the banks themselves, we can still deal with that complaint and will deal with that complaint.</p></speech>

That process goes back as far as that time the Deputy mentioned when the court cases were going on.  If one looks at the duration of time, that is, from 2011 to 2015, there were about 100 people who had complaints in our office at that time with PTSB.  We wrote to those on an ongoing basis, initially because the High Court case was pending and then the Supreme Court case was pending.  We had no option but to put them on hold but after that, they were put on hold voluntarily in agreement with the people themselves.  Similar processes applied over the last year.  A small number of people have asked to go ahead with their complaint due to the frustration, which we understand.  We are communicating with them at the moment.  If we have to go ahead, we will but we do not think that it is in people's best interest to do that just now.  In the next two weeks, all those 400 people will be receiving an update and further communication from us.</p></speech>

Most of those were awarded in the early stages and there was not actually a lot of compensation.  I am not commenting on whether that should have happened but at that stage they were putting people back pretty quickly.  Compensation today for something that happened in 2008 or 2009 would have to be of a very different order to somebody who was receiving compensation in 2010 or 2011 for something which happened the previous year.

We consulted with the people who had used and had taken complaints through the service.  I think more than 400 people were engaged in that survey.  We consulted with representatives of consumer groups and of industry.  Every one of them came back and said we needed a simpler, faster, more effective and efficient way of dealing with complaints.  For a whole variety of reasons the process had become very legalistic and very burdensome and it really was not accessible.  Interestingly, it is very early days yet but in a survey we did recently of people who had brought complaints through the office during the first six months, they were asked what word they would associate with the service.  We were very pleased that the top word which came back was "accessible" because that was the problem that we had.</p><p>We acknowledge that the office had developed in a way that was not as friendly to complainants.  As I mentioned at the outset, the role of an ombudsman is to level the playing pitch and to reinstate an equality of arms between the complainant and the provider, and if the system is very legalistic and heavy that does not suit the consumer in the vast majority of cases.</p></speech>

We would respond immediately, usually within a day or so, to acknowledge the complaint, and then our dispute resolution service would take on the complaint immediately after that and make contact within that week.  That process of engagement would start, and sometimes it would be quick.  It might be over in a few days and on other occasions it might go on for months, depending on the complexity.

The next phase, which is the adjudication phase, has only started.  It is a three year programme, and it is important to say that it will roll out.  This year the focus will be on adjudication.  We hope we will be able to come back to the committee and say we have met those targets, but it is too soon at the moment.</p> <p>  The Senator has reminded me of an important issue.  We are running a legacy system.  If we had set up a new organisation on 1 February last year, we would be in a great position and life would be simpler for everybody.  We had 2,200 legacy complaints in the system when we started.  We had to draw a line somewhere, so we said that from 1 February, any complaint coming in would go through the new process.  The complaints already there are going through the old process.  Sadly, I have to say that there are complaints in the old process which are still taking a considerable length of time, but if we did not set up the new process, everybody would still be in that situation.</p></speech>

The figure provided does not fully reflect the achievement in that some of that 1,500 identified were very difficult legacy cases.  That is why they were there.  In some cases - one in particular - there had been the exchange of documentation with legal representatives for a number of years.

How does that communication take place and how frequent is it?  Can people look at their complaints online or are updates by phone, e-mail or letters provided?</p></speech>

When we set up the service at first, we thought there would be more demand for face-to-face mediation.  Our staff are mainly qualified mediators and they are very comfortable with setting up face-to-face mediation.  We found that complainants preferred phone mediation primarily.  They liked the opportunity to think about things between the calls and to take their time and consider the matter carefully.  It is primarily phone-based mediation.  We do exchange a certain amount of documentation via e-mail.  The level of communication with the complainant would depend on the complexity of the issue.  Some things like permanent health insurance, for example, can go on for months, but some small accounts matters can be dealt with very quickly.  The mediator would contact both parties and put the consumer side to the financial institution and explain to it the impact it has had on the consumer.  The mediator would tease out with the bank whether it had followed the correct process and considered the consumer codes and would discuss what rectification the bank is prepared to put to the consumer.</p></speech>

Does that result in efficiencies within the process?  One can deal with many more complaints per hour on the phone that one can if arranging meetings and scheduling them every half an hour or hour or so.</p></speech>

It is more efficient in some ways.  There is a certain cohort that it would probably be more efficient to mediate with face to face.  The ombudsman mentioned the case that spent five years at the document exchange phase which was sorted out in one day of mediation.  We are still finding our way on this.  There are some cases that would be better off with face-to-face mediation, but we followed the demand for phone in the first instance.  We will learn as we go and perhaps change the model a bit.</p></speech>

We have done it occasionally for oral hearings.  There is another side to that in that sometimes people do not actually want the mediation in their own area, because if it is known that a financial ombudsman gig ended up in a local hotel, people do not necessarily like that.  Sometimes people prefer it, but it is something we will look at in the long term.  Senator Horkan was going through some figures earlier, and perhaps the most unbelievable change is that up until 2016, 99.9% of service providers refused to engage in mediation.  We resolved 70 complaints in 2015 through mediation and eight in 2014.  We have resolved approximately 2,270 complaints through the new process in 2016.</p></speech>

We had to work with them to get them to change that culture.  We reminded them that the people affected are customers of the banks.  In the past there was a handing over of complaints and an attitude that the ombudsman would deal with it.  We had to remind them that the people complaining were the customers of the banks who had complaints and problems with the banks.  We told the financial institutions not to get hung up on jurisdictions, because sometimes a financial service provider will say there is no jurisdiction because a complaint is two days beyond the six year rule.  This is about trying to resolve the complaint.  Whether it is in or out of jurisdiction, the institution has a problem if the customer has a complaint.  We have to look at jurisdiction very carefully when we move on to adjudication because the law would require it.</p> <p>  Senator Horkan asked if people are happy with the communication from the office.  That was one of the very interesting things to come out of our survey.  Perhaps Ms Cassidy can provide the figures.</p></speech>

We asked a number of questions around consumer satisfaction and whether they were happy with the length of time taken, the level of communication and the level of knowledge and politeness of our staff, and they were generally above 80%.  Some of those metrics went up into the high 90% mark in terms of satisfaction ratings.  In every single case bar none, they were considerably up - by 20% in most cases - on the old system from 2015.</p></speech>

She is saying that in the old days it was them using phrases such as "The rule says", "We can get away with that because it is six years and a day", "We do not have to deal" or "Write to us and we'll consider it in the fullness of time".  Obviously, the bureau has gone from resolving eight complaints in 2014 to resolving 2,270 in 2016.  This represents an enormous improvement in the context matters being resolved.  Is there a noticeable change within the banks and other institutions as to how they are dealing with people?</p></speech>

What will happen there is that people get an automatic message.  On our complaint form, there is a box one can tick if one is willing to give feedback.

Is that where counterparts in other countries are moving?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.919" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017030200002#K01900"><p>It was a mix of all of the above, but the most important thing was that the Oireachtas in drafting and enacting the legislation 12 years ago put mediation as the primary reason.  Our legislation was ahead of its time.  Mediation was not quite as well known or popular then but our legislation is very clear that the financial services ombudsman shall resolve disputes by mediation and, where necessary, by investigation and adjudication.  As such, it was the preferred option.  There are about three more statements within the legislation providing that it should be informal, without regard to technical or legal form and all of that.  Yet, we developed in a different way.  I gather that there is a Second Reading in the House today of the Mediation Bill.  At both European and national level, mediation is a preferred option.  During mediation week a couple of months ago, Ms Cassidy and I visited the Four Courts and heard the President of the High Court, the President of the Circuit Court and the President of the District Court all pushing for mediation.  There are many reasons it is the best solution.  We discovered in our research that providers misunderstood mediation and did not actually understand how it operates.  It was about overcoming some of those misunderstandings and fears.</p> <p>  Internationally, I note our counterparts in the UK.  We have a staff of 34, including an ombudsman and deputy ombudsman.  In the UK, they have an ombudsman, 300 ombudsmen and a staff of 4,000.  It is a very different scale but they are hugely into mediation.  We looked as part of our research at New Zealand and Australia where we saw telephone mediation in place.  I had experienced telephone mediation through the labour relations agencies in Northern Ireland which do a lot of it.  It was by looking at other organisations, including organisations similar to ourselves, that we saw that it seemed to be working everywhere else.</p></speech>

The research says that small parties are advantaged by mediation.  If one has a qualified mediator in the room, he or she can rebalance the power between the parties and refuse to allow the bigger party to take over and intimidate and enforce its will on the small party.</p></speech>

Certainly, we publish case studies.  We did not publish many in the last while because of the changing process.  We will by 31 March 2017 publish an annual review of 2016.

For example, one of the powers I have is to direct a bank to change a practice.  If we see a particular practice, I can report it to the Central Bank and we can use our case studies.  We publish the number of banks and insurance companies which have had more than three complaints partly upheld or upheld.  Case studies and reports to the Central Bank are prepared in either of two cases.  We do it if we think something is systemic and an issue across the bank or the sector generally.  We do it if we think it is so egregious that, even if it happened in a small number of cases, something should be done about it.</p></speech>

I am not saying all institutions are doing it or that it is widespread, but the committee, in its discussions with chief executives, has heard of complaints being made to some of the institutions to the effect that people who are in financial difficulties are being absolutely hounded into a state of bad mental health and, potentially, worse.

I am substituting for Deputy Pearse Doherty who was unable to make it to the meeting.  I am sure the office will need more resources and will be making a request in that regard to the Minister.</p> <p>  I note the work of the office thus far on the tracker mortgage issue.  While, without doubt, it has been valuable to consumers and so on, some of the contacts we received recently were not exactly universal praise for its actions in that regard.  Mr. Deering said that from 2009, the office upheld complaints on the tracker issue.  Was there a trickle or a stream of complaints at that stage in 2009 and does Mr. Deering believe his office escalated the issue quickly enough once a pattern emerged or does he believe in retrospect that it should have rang the alarm bells sooner?  In regard to Mr. Deering's statement that following his appointment he commenced a comprehensive analysis, should that process have been commenced earlier by the office?</p></speech>

On the issue of complaints, at that stage the office was getting approximately 8,500 complaints, which was double the amount it had been receiving up to then.  It probably would have been easy enough to view that as part of the overall collapse in the economy.  I cannot comment on whether that should have been done earlier.  When I was appointed I saw it as a priority.  The exercise has been a very valuable one.  The Central Bank has acknowledged that it has been useful to it.</p> <p>  Since taking up office my aim has been to ensure that anybody who makes a complaint to the office, whether before or since my time, gets exactly what they are entitled to and the maximum back, particularly from this redress programme.</p></speech>

How many of those were from people who were denied a tracker mortgage?  Was that the issue in terms of the bulk of the complaints received?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.949" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017030200002#L01900"><p>There could be other issues also.  Sometimes there are a number of elements to a complaint.  Of the figure I gave earlier, the vast majority would be, I think, related to tracker mortgages.  To be clear, the tracker mortgage complaints data include communications from people who would have liked to have been offered a tracker mortgage but were not.  If a tracker mortgage was not an offering at the time, then a complaint of not being offered one is unlikely to be upheld.  Within the cohort mentioned are a significant number of people who thought they should have been given a tracker mortgage but who did not have a contractual entitlement to it.</p></speech>

The only way that can be determined is to investigate each complaint and adjudicate on it.  It is not known until the end of the process whether a complaint will be upheld.  We are careful to ensure that all complaints go through the system.  I have heard the tracker issue described as a simple one but that is not the case.  I know this having examined over 500 complaints that came through the office in respect of which the terms and conditions were different.  The committee may recall that in one case a High Court judge commented on the complexity of the terms of conditions of a contract.</p></speech>

Does the office have the power to search the banks in such cases and is Mr. Deering aware of any pattern around missing documentation?</p> <p>  In another case, when a complainant accessed her own data, it revealed gaps in what the bank had provided and also that the ombudsman's office had done no calculations on what might be due.  Is that common practice?  What would be the response of the office if a bank offers as an excuse the loss of a crucial document?  Would that hinder the power of the office to find against it?</p></speech>

For example, I am aware of complaints to the effect that a record of a particular telephone call was not available in evidence.  If evidence of a telephone call or correspondence is not available, the word of both people comes into play.  The word of the bank official is worth no more than that of the complainant.  In my view, it is incumbent on financial service providers to keep proper records and to retain them.  I have been very strong in making that point to service providers.  On occasion, where they have not provided information, I have reminded them of the office's powers to enter and search the institution for them.</p></speech>

I am not happy with how the banks have always reacted to the office.  As I mentioned earlier, I met the banks, collectively, in January 2016.  I also met them again later that year.  I have made it absolutely clear to them that it is not satisfactory for them not to provide us with sufficient evidence.  I have gone back to them on several occasions on the issue of evidence.  I will use whatever powers are available to me to get that evidence.</p> <p>  I referred earlier to correspondence I received, which is in the public arena, from which it was obvious what the bank was doing.  An element of this is that the banks were looking at the ombudsman's decisions and rather than admitting that they got something wrong, they appeared to be looking to what was the least they could do to not to have another ombudsman's finding against them.  That is not what the role of the ombudsman is about.  We expect banks and financial institutions against which we make a finding on behalf of a complainant to put right that wrong for all customers and not only for the complainant.  In other words, if there are ten other customers in the same situation they should also rectify the position for them.</p> <p>  I know the committee is aware of the distinction between the regulator and the ombudsman's office but it is important for me to point out that we can only deal with the individual complaint before us.  In regard to the Deputy's question on the powers of the office to enter an institution, we can only do so to look for evidence in respect of a particular complaint.  </p></speech>

In that case, we do not have to stop the investigation.  We are subject to a High Court appeal.  Once somebody takes a High Court appeal there is nothing we can do in that scenario.</p><p>Obviously, when it goes on to the Supreme Court, we are still caught in the same space.</p></speech>

The Sinn F&eacute;in legislation is on Committee Stage.  The proposed Government legislation went through pre-legislative scrutiny but we have heard nothing about it since.  There are differences in the two approaches.  The Government legislation is broader in that it merges the Financial Services Ombudsman with the Pensions Ombudsman.  Deputy Pearse Doherty's legislation is simply to remove the six-year rule.  My view is that the committee should deal with it as soon as possible.  Would the Financial Services Ombudsman welcome this change being made as soon as possible, in other words, that the six-year rule would be removed?  Mr. Deering has spoken about upholding tracker cases from 2009 onwards.  Every day, more and more cases are falling from the remit of the Financial Services Ombudsman because of the six-year rule.  Is that the case?</p></speech>

Tracker mortgages were at their height in 2007 and 2008.  Depending on the length of time a person went on a fixed rate, the time he or she came off the fixed rate could be critical.  Deputy Quinlivan is correct.  As time goes on, fewer tracker mortgage complaints will be able to come through our office.  The real complexity around the removal of the six-year rule is the extent of retrospection.  I am unsure of the extent at this stage.  It is a complex area.  The answer to the question in simple terms is that we would welcome the removal of the six-year rule.</p></speech>

I wish to clarify matters relating to individual cases.  However, I will speak in general terms and I will not mention any details.  In dealing with Ulster Bank, How would our guests characterise the dealings of the Financial Services Ombudsman with Ulster Bank?  Is one bank more awkward than another?</p></speech>

This makes it difficult for me to discuss.  If I answered the second half of that question, it might help the committee.</p> <p>  There have been problems across almost all banks.  I come back to the comment I made earlier, namely, that the approach certainly has improved.  I have looked back and carried out the analysis of the approach and the response to tracker mortgages.  The approach seemed to be a question of the least the bank could get away with to keep the ombudsman off its back.  To me, that is not in any way within the spirit or to the letter of the role of the ombudsman.  Far more could have been done by banks at an earlier stage in terms of dealing with the ombudsman's office.  The findings from the bureau should have alerted the banks to the fact that there was a problem that they needed to rectify.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.965" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017030200002#M00800"><p>Were any tracker cases settled earlier?  For example, were there cases where the client was active and engaging with the bank and demanding a settlement?  Has the Financial Services Ombudsman discovered how settlements were calculated in the early part of this saga?  Is there some calculation used by the Financial Services Ombudsman?  Is there some calculation used by the bank?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.966" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Ger Deering" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2017030200002#M00900"><p>Well the calculation we use is based on putting the borrower back on the correct rate and back in the space where he or she should have been.  As I mentioned, if cases were rectified quickly or at the early stages, the compensation would not have been as great an issue as it might be today.  If a borrower has been on the wrong rate for a year, it is bad, but not nearly as bad as the implications of being on it for a long time.  Let us suppose we were examining a case today.  Several questions arise.  What is the correct rate the borrower should have been on?  When should that have been applied?  How much has the person lost?  This is what I call the rectification aspect of our work.  Rectification involves putting a borrower back in the position that he should have been in.  The compensation element is completely separate.  What hardship has the change caused to the person?  That area will take a great deal of work because it differs for different people.</p> <p>  Sometimes we only hear about the people in arrears.  It is awful that people got into arrears and lost their houses.  However, other people may have made significant choices.  They may have avoided mortgage arrears but many other things might have had to go by the wayside.  This is a complex area.</p></speech>

However, that solution fell short and the borrower subsequently made a complaint to the Financial Services Ombudsman.  Can the ombudsman take on that complaint, even though it is historical, if satisfaction was not gained by the client?  Can the Financial Services Ombudsman reopen such a case and argue for a better resolution?</p></speech>

It is possible that, if we have not made a finding in the area already, it is something we could look at.  We would have to determine whether any settlement was full and final and whether such a settlement would stand up.  We are especially mindful now, in the context of our dispute resolution process, that people can go into mediation and get a suitable outcome without having to worry about the legislative and contract aspects of it.</p> <p>  The Chairman raised an important point which, perhaps, did not emerge earlier.  It is our view that many cases were settled in the earlier stage on the basis that the bank had got a finding from the ombudsman and that if someone was heading towards the ombudsman, then the bank would have settled.  However, that begs a further question.  The banks should not have had to wait for a complaint to be made for that to happen.</p></speech>

The question I am asking is relevant for such individuals.  These cases have stretched over a long period.  Borrowers did not get answers or had to wait six months for an answer.  Then, then had to try to engage with the ombudsman before going back to the bank.  Issues remain to be resolved in some of the cases I have seen.  If individuals go back to the Financial Services Ombudsman in respect of these cases, will the ombudsman look at them?</p></speech>

I do not intend to go into the detail of it.

In other words, if a bank sells a loan on to any organisation, we can still consider a complaint in that regard.  Indeed we have dealt with some complaints in such situations and we have ended up with two separate complaints.  There might be a complaint about the conduct of the bank before it sold the debt or in respect of how it sold the debt.  For example, I have come across situations where banks have sold loans without even telling the consumer.  The first the consumer knew of it was when someone new turned up.  That behaviour is completely unacceptable.  We can also examine the entity that takes on the loan because all the same codes and protections apply.  Whatever the contract states, the arrangements continue to apply.  The new owner of the debt cannot unilaterally change the contract.  Second, all the consumer codes apply because of the Consumer Protection (Regulation of Credit Servicing Firms) Act.</p></speech>

If the Central Bank finds a problem, it conducts an enforcement activity across the entire organisation or the entire industry, whereas we deal with individual complaints.  We cannot act unless we have a complainant.  Whereas the Central Bank could go in and conduct a broad sweep about something, I suppose we are more responsive.  It is only where we have an individual who has a complaint against an institution that we can act.</p></speech>

We cannot interfere with the commercial discretion of a company.  What we would say in those situations to people is to look around to see whether there is a company from which they can get their insurance and for which they can pay in instalments.  I would not see us saying to a company that it must put a credit arrangement in place.</p> <p>  No more than politicians, I am sure, we have received a huge amount of calls about the increase in insurance premiums in recent times.  I am not saying that we cannot deal with them.  We could deal with certain aspects.  Sometimes it is because the person's no claims bonus has not been correctly dealt with, but we cannot help on the actual rate that an insurance company charges.</p></speech>

I accept that increases are evident but the customer will have been with the company for a while.  If there is a change in the policy - regardless of how big or how small - is the insurance company obliged to tell the customer?  I have received a number of complaints regarding insurance policies that are not necessarily the policies originally taken out.  There are certain subtle differences in how each section is worded or presented, which mean that a person is no longer covered for something for which he or she was covered in the beginning.  Has Mr. Deering come across anything like that?</p></speech>

The answer to the Chairman's question is that the insurance company is obliged to draw the attention of the consumer to it, on renewal or at any time it makes such a change, under the consumer protection code.  The information that insurance companies give is, probably, in terms of insurance, one of the biggest difficulties that we deal with.  The issue is around it being clear.  We had a discussion in our office yesterday.  Something on which I will be engaging with the insurance companies, for example, is when people take out health insurance or travel insurance and they are asked do they have pre-existing conditions.  Any of us here could have a conversation about pre-existing conditions.  What I think a pre-existing condition is may be different to what somebody else deems it.  That is okay.  The person states he or she does not have and he or she travels.  Then, in six months or a year, something happens, one makes a claim and one is told, "You had an X-ray five months before you travelled which has now shown up that you have a condition."  We believe, particularly in phone calls and in written correspondence, there is an onus on insurance companies to explain in detail.</p></speech>

I can make a direction that they should not present this information in such a way.  Coming back to the point I made earlier, I can only look at the individual complaint and the behaviour there.  The Central Bank, as the regulator, would set out the parameters and what they are required to give in terms of information.  We then would check to see have they abided by that code.</p></speech>

I can only make a finding or a direction.  For example, last year, I dealt with an insurance claim where there were certain provisions in the policy which stated what it would do in the event of something happening.  The person had to claim on the policy and was told that the company did not do that anymore.  I directed the company to take that out of its future documentation but I also reported that to the Central Bank for fear it would be something that is happening more broadly.  The distinction I am trying to make is that I cannot make a broad sweeping regulation that applies across the board.</p></speech>

However, I can direct an individual company.  In many respects, our relationship with the Central Bank is good.  Us feeding that information back there can have a broader effect because we can only direct it to the company that we are dealing with on that particular complaint.  In insurance, information is critical.</p></speech>

The banks administer European funding to small businesses at a special rate.  When an application for that type of funding is refused, it is referred back to another State agency for its view on the reasons it was refused.  Where that State agency indicates that the small business should get that loan but the bank continues to refuse, is that an issue for the Financial Services Ombudsman?</p></speech>

We certainly would not be able to state that a person should have been given a loan.  We are not in the space of assessing people's repayment capacity.  The Chairman is referring to the Credit Review Office.</p><p>As I understand it, it makes a recommendation that the bank should pay that money.  The significant difference is that our findings are legally binding and can only be appealed to the High Court but we do not second-guess the commercial discretion of the bank.  In other words, we do not decide that somebody should have been given a loan but we could look at the process to see if everything was considered and whether the way they were dealt with by the bank was reasonable.</p></speech>

The banks are doing what they are doing and I would hope we will start to see the results of that in the coming months.  It is only when I get the documentary evidence of what they have actually done in each individual case that I will be able to say whether I was happy with how they dealt with that.  I appreciate there are two issues going on here because the Central Bank is also overlooking all of that but we are completely independent and separate and will be looking at that process separately.  Currently, we have no visibility inside that process.  It will not be until we start to see the outcome, and we will be dealing with the fallout of that in terms of individual customers.</p></speech>

Has the ombudsman any role in cases in which a loan was taken out with a sub-prime lender?</p></speech>

I would be surprised if it was not.  Anybody in that space now should be regulated, so the answer is "Yes".  Once the lender is regulated, we can accept a complaint.</p></speech>

One of the most important parts of our evidence is actually listening to those telephone calls.  We listen to the recorded calls and we can glean a lot of information about and understanding of the position the complainant was in and how they were treated.</p></speech>

I am not aware of another ombudsman with the same powers as the Irish Financial Services Ombudsman.  Our findings are legally binding.  We have significant powers of investigation and of requiring financial services providers to produce the evidence, and sanctions if they do not.  We are happy to say that the Department of Finance has engaged very well with us.  There are some new provisions in the legislation.  The six-year rule has been discussed a good deal but, for example, there is also a provision in the legislation that our findings would be published.  We would be very happy with that.  We believe that would be the greatest step in terms of transparency.  The idea would be that they would be published anonymised so one would know the financial services provider against which the complaint was made and would see our outcome but the complainant would have confidentiality.</p></speech>

The Financial Services Ombudsman Council sets a levy on the industry so we do not look for money from the Exchequer.  What would be most beneficial to us would be to have enacted the legislation currently being drafted, thereby allowing the merger to move on and the provision of the additional powers.</p></speech>

It is worth mentioning also that the usual representation role here is a little awkward because complainants give us a lot of confidential information.  It might be medical records, their bank accounts or their visa card information.  Sometimes a politician will write to us making representations on their behalf.  We have to be very careful and must ask them to get the person's permission when really all they might want to know is how long the process will take or how it is progressing.  It is something on which we could do some work with the House.  It is slightly different from the normal representation.  We can only communicate with one person so it is either the complainant or their representative.  I notice when politicians write to us, they do not necessarily want to step into that representational role.  They are just wondering how long the process will take.</p></speech>

In the case to which I refer, the person writing the letter is crying out for help and is pointing to the fact that a particular bank made her life hell and it continues to be hell.  She has not made it public because she is embarrassed and does not want her family to know about it.  Obviously, one is dealing with someone who is in difficulty with the bank, has not got the necessary tools to deal with it and believes she is dealing with some sort of superpower, as the banks are described in this letter, and is not getting to where she should.  I never let go those type of representations because I believe that behind them there is a story and an issue that needs to be sorted out to improve the person's life.  In the case I have in mind, the woman is 73 years of age.</p></speech>

Members are asked to switch off their mobile phones or adjust them to airplane mode so that they do not interfere with the recording of this morning's meeting.  Apologies have been received from Deputy Kelleher.  This morning we will consider the 2017 Revised Estimates of the Department of Health.  The D&aacute;il has ordered that the revised Vote 38 - Health - be referred to this committee for our consideration.  I welcome the Minister for Health, Deputy Harris, and his officials.  Briefing material providing details of the Revised Estimates has been circulated to Deputies.  I propose that the committee will proceed to consider the indicative appendix of Vote 38 programme by programme.  If Deputies wish to ask questions or comment on any specific subheads, they can do so after we have considered the indicative appendix programmes.  I ask the Minister to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1040" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#B00400"><p>I am conscious that many issues pertaining to today's Revised Estimates, including how various health-related matters are to be funded and addressed in 2017, were discussed when I had a lengthy engagement with the joint committee last week.  The script I have circulated can be taken as read.  I will make a few brief points at the outset.</p> <p>  I hope the 2017 Revised Estimates can be seen as a practical example of how the Government is endeavouring to put the health service on a more sustainable financial footing and to allow the HSE to set realistic and achievable targets for service areas in the year ahead.  On many occasions over the years, when health Ministers have come to this committee to consider Health Estimates, they have been looking at very different vistas from the vista we are looking at now as we consider how the health service is being funded in 2017.  When the new Government came into office in 2016, it was able to provide additional funding to the health service.  As a result, last year marked the first time in many years that the health sector was able to come in on budget in 2016 without the need for a Supplementary Estimate.  This tells us that when the health service is funded adequately and expenditure in the service is carefully and closely monitored, we can ensure the health service comes in on budget.  Coming in on budget is not just about meeting an accounting target or ticking a box; it means that any additional resources the Oireachtas decides to allocate to the health service can be spent on services that benefit patients.  This allows us to move towards delivering the kind of public health service we all want to deliver.</p> <p>  I am keenly aware that there is significant concern about the waiting times for hospital appointments and procedures that are being experienced by patients.  We had a lengthy discussion about this at the joint committee last week.  I said on that occasion that the HSE was about to submit waiting list plans, including a specific plan for scoliosis, to me.  The Department of Health has now received those plans.  It is considering them and engaging with the HSE on them.  I intend to share the plans with members of this committee very shortly.  The overriding aims - that by the end of October, no patient will have to wait longer than 15 months for a day case or inpatient procedure or an outpatient appointment; and that by the end of this year, no child will have to wait longer than four months for a scoliosis procedure - have not changed.  Those targets have been set by the director general of the HSE.  I am very grateful to him for taking this issue as seriously as it should be taken.  We were all appalled to learn about the lengthy times people are having to wait.  The achievement of the four-month target will bring this country into line with the NHS practice in relation to scoliosis and the NHS timelines.</p> <p>  As Deputies can see from the documentation that has been provided, these Revised Estimates provide for additional investment in acute and emergency services, representing an increase of &euro;90 million on the revised allocation in 2016.  The additional funding that is being provided to the National Treatment Purchase Fund will bring its budget to &euro;20 million this year.  This will increase to &euro;55 million in 2018.  A sum of &euro;40 million is being provided on a recurring basis for the winter initiative.  This is crucial because it means that as we move towards the end of this winter - one would not think it from the weather today -  we will be able to plan at an earlier stage for next winter.  It is my intention that this work will get under way in the Department and the HSE very shortly.  Funding is also being provided for the extension of the medical card to all children in receipt of domiciliary care allowance.  Deputies will have noted that a Bill facilitating this extension was published this morning.  I know the co-operation of all parties will be available to ensure the Bill in question passes all Stages in both Houses by the end of the month.  I think we should all be working towards that target.  Deputies will be aware that reductions in prescription charges for all medical card holders over the age of 70 and their dependants came into effect yesterday.  This measure, which will benefit 390,000 people in this country, is a first step in advancing the key commitment in the programme for Government to reduce the cost of medicines for all our citizens.</p> <p>  In the mental health area, progress is being made in developing services in line with the model set out in A Vision for Change.  Additional funding has been made available for the disability services directorate, encompassing the full year cost of school leavers.  This has been a very thorny issue for a number of years because adequate additional funding has not been provided to deal with the number of new school leavers coming on board every year.  Those full-year costs are being met this year.</p><p>There were additional therapy support costs as well as costs incurred from complying with HIQA standards.  There is a significant commitment to the fair deal nursing home support scheme and I hope there will be progress this year in trying to develop a policy platform to have a similar scheme in place in terms of a statutory home care scheme.  Given the Houses of the Oireachtas provide such significant levels of funding to the HSE to deliver a health service that we all want to see and work towards, it is important that we have a performance and accountability framework in place that can monitor it.  My statement, which I have circulated, outlines how the framework works.  We have secured a significant increase in funding for the health services in recent years, but that does not mean that I, or anyone else, should underestimate the significant challenges involved in the delivery of a safe and efficient health service for the Irish people.  Finally, while many of our discussions tend to be on current expenditure, on Monday I will be ten months in this job and I have seen, as I have travelled around our houses, a real deficit in capital spending.  The Government has a capital review coming up this summer which will see &euro;2.36 billion in additional capital allocated across Government.  Additional capital spending in health will see additional benefits and efficiencies in the interests of our patients.</p></speech>

I will now refer to the individual programmes in the indicative appendix of the Vote, which are linked to performance targets.  Members are advised that I will refer to a document entitled Analysis of Revised Estimate for 2017 as we progress through the programme. This document was prepared by the financial scrutiny section of the committee secretariat.  I will refer to pages in this document as we go through each individual programme.  Under the heading "Introduction" on page 5 of the document, Deputies may wish to take a moment to note the large regional nature of the Vote allocation and the difference between the allocation under the Vote structure and the indicative appendix structures.  Has any of the Deputies any questions or opening remarks relating to that section on page 5?</p></speech>

I found this extremely difficult to go through and wonder if there might be an easier way for this information to be understood.  We got a briefing, which was welcome, but it was still a little like swimming through treacle.  One really feels like one is not making much progress.  I understand that the format of the presentation has changed.  Perhaps the Minister will indicate why.  I might have my view, which I will not express now, but the format changed from last year to this year.  There seems to be a bit of a disconnect between the headings that we are looking at given the money is listed in a separate document.  I found it difficult to link the two and wonder if there is an easier way to do it.</p></speech>

In considering the health Vote, we must accept the elephant in the room, which is that the health Vote is not configured along programme lines.  The Department of Health is working towards the development of programme budgeting and changing the structure of the health Vote to reflect this.  It will take some time though because the financial systems in the HSE will need to be adapted to allow for it in the context of the financial reform programme that is currently under way.  In the interim though, the appendices to the Revised Estimates for the health Vote have been constructed along programme lines.  I do not mean to comment in any way on the committee's briefing, but the way we have tried to present it in our departmental briefing endeavours to show the programme, the target, whether it was hit and where we are going to get to this year.  In some ways, it may be a more useful document to have questions on.  In terms of the changes in the presentation, I am informed that the Department has not changed the way we presented our briefing since last year.</p></speech>

In terms of moving towards matching the programme to the money, how close are we to that?</p></speech>

The HSE needs to be cognisant of the fact that we are going to presumably undertake more structural reform when the Committee on the Future of Health Care reports in April, which may enable us to have more fruitful conversations on structures across the health service.  I looked through the various briefings when preparing for this committee hearing. When we look at section 3 of my Department's briefing, which is the performance information section by section and directorate by directorate, we have a sense of what the HSE did in 2015, what it did in 2016 versus its targets in 2016 and what it intends to do in 2017.  As Minister, from the performance and accountability framework point of view, it is against the delivery of the commitments in the national service plan that the HSE should be judged in 2017.</p></speech>

Working inside the Department, they are looking at it from a different perspective altogether.  Is it all right if I use the old Vote system?  That system gives me an instant bird's eye view of where we were and where we will go.  I believe we should know ourselves where we fell short, if we did.  We can see straight away the increases in the salaries, wages and allowances.  Presumably they relate to the consultants and medical staff.  I hope that the consultants, nurses, GPs and other medical staff, as opposed to administration, take a fair share of the expenditure.  People will say that we must have administrators, which is true, but we also must have the practitioners.  My question is on the extent to which we have made sufficient provision among those specialists, consultants, GPs and nursing and medical staff.</p></speech>

Last week at this committee we had a detailed discussion on the increased numbers of people working for the health service.  A number of Deputies and Senators raised the issue of the growth in administration and management.  The national director of HR has committed to giving a report to the committee showing a more detailed breakdown.  From my initial inquiries, I would make the point that we need to be careful in presuming that everyone in the admin-management section is not carrying out an important role in terms of the delivery of clinical programme.  For example, a clinical nurse manager on a ward is an important piece of our health service infrastructure that is recognised by our trade union movements and nurse representative organisations as a crucial piece relating to patient safety and the operation of wards.  The role may well end up being classified as administration or admin-management, but a patient going through a hospital today will see a benefit from having that person on the ground.  In addition, the delivery of a number of other clinical programmes will require other people in that category.</p> <p>  I could not agree more with the Deputy in terms of his question regarding our desire to increase the number of people working on the front line of the health service.  I am conscious, as we speak at this committee meeting this morning, that the INMO is about to engage with my Department, the HSE and the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform at the Workplace Relations Commission.  I hope it is a fruitful and constructive engagement because it is essential in the interests of all of our patients.  We had detailed and productive discussions with the INMO on a range of issues over the past couple of months on recruitment and retention.  It is fair to say that we made progress on quite a number of them, including having for the first time in a number of years a fully funded workforce plan for nursing at a much earlier time of the cycle.  It is also fair to say, not that I speak for the INMO, that there are some areas where we did not make as much progress.  This relates to how some of the retention measures interact with the process that is going on in terms of the Public Sector Pay Commission and the Lansdowne Road successor talks that will follow.  I hope the Workplace Relations Commission can help make progress in that regard today and over the weekend.  It is not in any of our interests to see industrial unrest in the health service from next week on.  We have already made progress in alleviating two other potential industrial relations disputes in the health sector.</p><p>If we were here just over a week ago, we would have been talking about threatened industrial action from the IMO with regard to non-consultant hospital doctors.  That has now been satisfactorily resolved.  We would also have been talking about action from next Tuesday by SIPTU health care support staff.  I am very pleased that a way forward was found with SIPTU in that regard.  I thank it for its constructive engagement.  We had three disputes about ten days ago.  Two have been resolved or put into a process towards resolution and one remains outstanding, but work is ongoing there.  As the Deputy knows, we intend to hire 1,000 additional nurses this year.  I accept the INMO's point of view that we lost an awful lot of nurses.  Numbers have been growing, but I say that while accepting that there is still a way for them to grow to get back to the levels they were at before the crash.  I do not disagree with the Deputy's assessment.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1050" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#D00200"><p>The Minister mentioned the industrial disputes, two of which have been headed off at the pass and one which I understand is on its way to the Workplace Relations Commission, WRC.  We obviously wish everybody well with that.  The settlement of those disputes is not without cost, since the Estimates were produced and the disputes were settled.  Where did we get the wriggle room from in terms of being able to settle?  The settlement with the doctors is fairly substantial, as I understand it.  It is the living out allowance, which I think is in or around &euro;3,000 per person.  The SIPTU settlement is obviously more complicated because it is a longer-term solution and involves making good commitments that should have been costed.  These commitments were given, but it was regrettable that the staff had to ballot to get it.  However, they got it and that is good news.</p> <p>  I wish to talk about flexibility.  I am in the Chairman's hands if I am jumping around too much between issues.  Since the salaries were mentioned, and in terms of the flexibilities that exist, where would I find that in the mass of paperwork that I was given?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1051" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#D00300"><p>It is a very fair point.  I reiterate that if we have to find additional resources for pay measures above and beyond the Lansdowne Road measures that were agreed by and expected by Government in advance of the preparation of budget 2017, there is no new pot of money to use.  I am conscious of that and I am sure the INMO is conscious of that as well.</p> <p>  The IMO - the doctors - is being dealt with in the process of the anomaly in the Lansdowne Road agreement.  As the Deputy knows, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform has outlined that that will have to be dealt with centrally by Government.  The SIPTU process, if I can call it that, is yet to conclude in that regard.</p> <p>  With regard to the INMO, we had already provided for the recruitment of 1,000 additional nurses in budget 2017.  I do not wish to pre-empt this, but if we have a successful conclusion in the WRC and if there is a cost to that - I do not want to say too much about this or I could get into all sorts of trouble - I would be happy to come back to the committee and talk about how that cost would impact on the current Revised Estimates before the committee today.  If the Deputy's assertion is that there is not funding within this Vote to meet those additional costs, that is an assertion that is correct.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1052" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#D00400"><p>I thank the Minister.  If it is okay, we will now move on to the second programme, which consists of four parts.  It refers to primary care services, which has a total Vote of &euro;3.852 billion.  That is on page 7 of the document.  It is broken down to primary care reimbursement services, which have a Vote of &euro;2.807 billion, social inclusion, which has a Vote of &euro;134 million, primary care, which has a Vote of &euro;834 million, and palliative care, which has a Vote of &euro;77 million.  The first item on page 7 is the total primary care service budget of &euro;3.852 billion.</p> <p>  I might start off with the Minister with regard to palliative care.  It is a topic we have discussed at a number of our committee meetings.  There is not national coverage for community palliative care services.  I note that the Vote has gone up by 0.3%.  Perhaps the Minister will comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1053" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#D00500"><p>This is an area that is extraordinarily important and one in which significant progress has been made over the past ten years or so from a very low base in this country in terms of access to palliative care and in terms of the provision of hospice services in general.  If one looks at a map of Ireland now, as I did recently with the palliative care people in the HSE, there is significant hospice coverage around the country with a number of blackspots, if I may call them that, intended to be filled in within the coming years.  Some of those are Cavan and Monaghan, the midlands and my own county of Wicklow.  There are a couple of obvious places on the map.</p> <p>  With regard to actual palliative care services, let us look at the increased provision and increased targets this year in the document I circulated from the Department.  Some of them are worth putting on the record.  For access to specialist palliative care services in the community provided within seven days in the normal place of residence, a target of 91.5% was set for 2016.  We achieved 95%, with a view to maintaining that 95% target this year.  The number of patients in receipt of specialist palliative care in the community in the reporting month was 3,341 in 2016 and will be 3,620 in 2017.  Access to specialist palliative inpatient beds provided with seven days was achieved at a rate of 96.8%.  Our target for this year is 98%.  The number accessing specialist inpatient beds - this is a new key performance indicator that was not in last year - has a target of 3,555 for each reporting month this year.</p> <p>  The number of children in the care of the children's outreach nursing and specialist palliative care team is a very important and emotive area.  We have set new key performance indicators for this year.  There were 453 last year.  The number of children in the care of the children's outreach nursing team has a new target of 269 for 2017.  The target number of children in the care of the children's specialist palliative care team in Crumlin hospital or in Temple Street for each of the reporting months is 20 for 2017.  That is a new target for this year as well.  This is an area in which substantive progress is being made and that is reflected in the figures I have outlined.  It is also reflected in the great work that the Irish Hospice Foundation has done with the Department over a sustained period and in the evaluation report on children's palliative care, which was published only a matter of months ago.</p></speech>

The difficulty is that they are understaffed and stretched to the limit and beyond in providing the services.  There can be an unavoidable delay in nurses coming to visit people in the community because of the lack of staffing.  Perhaps the Minister will address that issue.  I will then bring in Deputy O'Reilly and Deputy Kelleher.</p></speech>

This is an area in which we are coming from a historically low base.  I am not suggesting in any way that enough is done, but I do genuinely believe in the increased investment this year.  When we look behind the monetary amounts, the number of extra patients expected to benefit this year in the figures I outlined is to be welcomed.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1056" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#D00800"><p>With regard to palliative care, the Minister referenced the map and the blackspots on it, for want of a better word.  It is a much bleaker map if we look at the palliative care available for children.  Paediatric end-of-life care and palliative care is sorely lacking.  I was in Donegal the week before last and I met Ms Ashling Nibbs and Ms Gina Grant from Our Children's Voice.  Ashling very recently lost her son &Oacute;r&aacute;n at the age of seven after a very tough time.  He was brought home to die and only lived for a couple of hours.  She struggled greatly to access services and, in the end, there was only goodwill.  There were no services available.  When the Minister talks about the map, he may want to look at two maps.  We can obviously measure the progress that has been made in terms of adult services, but I do not think that we could say that what is available for children is anything approaching acceptable.</p><p>The only outreach palliative care available in Donegal is provided by charities.  It is not provided by the HSE.</p><p> We need to look for future planning at two maps.  We need to look at the real map for children.  It is stressful enough to travel from Dublin up to Donegal with a sick child but it is different when one is bring that child home to die, knowing that there is no service there for you.  There are a lot of parents in that situation and they watch these proceedings closely.  I am sure they want to hear what is in store for this year.  For Aisling's son, &Oacute;r&aacute;n, it is too late, but Aisling is committed to this cause and she wants to see, as a legacy to her son and others who have passed away since, that they might be able to make progress in that area.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1058" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1229" speakername="Billy Kelleher" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#E00200"><p>I have two questions on palliative care.  The first has been discussed on many occasions, in this committee and elsewhere.  I refer to end-of-life care in nursing homes, the complications that arise when residents die in nursing homes and the impact that can have on public opinion of the nursing home.  If there is a high number of residents dying in a nursing home, it can read badly at times.  In the context of assessing and supporting residents in end of life in a nursing home, it is something we should look at.  There are HIQA inspections and oversight.  Some nursing homes have end-of-life support facilities.  Not enough of them do.  Sometimes - I have tried to get to the bottom of this - there is almost an incentive to transfer residents from nursing home to hospital in end of life for a number of reasons.  It is something that has to be looked at in a clinical fashion to determine why it is happening.  Can the Minister support nursing homes to allow residents die on the premises, without overly complicating it and without it reflecting badly on nursing homes, if there are a high number of residents dying in them, where they are dying in the context of palliative supports, as opposed to keeping the numbers down and transferring them to hospitals?  That certainly is something that we should look at.</p> <p>  We talk about the pressure on acute hospitals.  A busy hospital setting is no place for a family to mourn their loved one.  Has any assessment been made of the number of patients who die in hospital as opposed to elsewhere and whether we have a higher propensity to die in hospital as opposed to either in the home or a nursing home with supports?  It is an area that should be examined, not only in the context of the emotional side of it with hospital being a busy place but, equally, in the context of resources and the pressures on hospitals.</p> <p>  Paediatric palliative care and palliative care have to be looked at separately.  I do not mean to dismiss anybody's mother or father, or natural death, but the trauma on a family in the context of paediatric palliative supports and bereavement is significant.  We all can understand that.  At times, one must look beyond the immediate short term and there has to be greater supports for families of children who die.  Except for a lot of voluntary work and good work being done by communities and groups that rally round, it is an area that is greatly under resourced and understaffed.  There is a lack of understanding of the importance of ensuring that there is enough support, both in the short term but also in the longer term.  That also includes support for siblings who are often forgotten in the context of a child's death in a family.  It can have a profound impact for a long period of time.  That needs to be looked at.  Before we clap each other on the back, it is an area that needs a great deal more support in communities.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1060" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#E00400"><p>I will start with the nursing home matter that Deputy Kelleher raises.  The Deputy is correct.  On the issue of the 'flu this winter, for example, once the HSE started engaging proactively with the nursing homes when we put the additional measures in place in January, we saw that there is a willingness on behalf of nursing homes and their representative bodies to work with the health service to cater and care for the needs of residents within the nursing home without the need to transfer them to the acute hospital.  It became apparent that the nursing homes were willing to work with the health service and if that work can be built on further, that will have two results.  First, it can result in nursing homes no longer feeling compelled to send an older person to an acute hospital when the care could be better provided in a nursing home, particularly if somebody has his or her own room, <i>en suite</i>facility, etc., and infection can be controlled.  Second, an older person can often be provided with more dignity and comfort by being able to remain in the nursing home.  I do not disagree with Deputy Kelleher in regard to that.</p><p>I am glad Deputies Louise O'Reilly and Kelleher raised the general issue of paediatric palliative care.  They are correct.  While I stated we are coming from a low base for palliative care, we are coming from an even lower one for palliative paediatric care.  There is such a significant difference.  When a child dies it is something that is unnatural and traumatic and has a major impact on the whole family, and a whole community.  How we respond to that as a society is important.  Progress has been made and I will outline some of it.</p><p>In 2009, long before the Government or its predecessor was in office, in fairness to previous Governments, Palliative care for children with life-limiting conditions in Ireland - A National Policy, was published.  Arising from that policy, the HSE established the Children's Palliative Care Programme.  I must acknowledge that this was co-funded by the Irish Hospice Foundation.  The programme at that time provided for the appointment of a consultant paediatrician with a special interest in children's palliative care and eight children's outreach nurses to co-ordinate care for children with life-limiting conditions and their families.  Eight were welcome - it was starting from zero - but were clearly not enough to cover the country, as Deputy Louise O'Reilly references.</p><p>I launched, on 21 November, an independent evaluation of the Children's Palliative Care Programme.  It was undertaken by specialists from the UK.  It recommended that additional children's outreach nurses be hired and that a second consultant be appointed.  A further two children's outreach nurses are now being recruited as part of budget 2017.  We have also agreed to the appointment of a second children's palliative care consultant post, which will be funded by the Irish Hospice Foundation for the first year - subsequently, the funding will be taken over by the health service.  I should also point out that there is now a new masters programme in palliative care training for paediatric nurses running between the National University of Ireland Galway and UCD because we need to ensure we continue to provide a skill set for our paediatric nurses.</p><p>I extend my sympathy to Aisling on the loss of her son, &Oacute;r&aacute;n.  I met the group, Our Children's Voice, with some of the Deputy Louise O'Reilly's colleagues and colleagues from all parties when I visited Letterkenny relatively recently.  One of those two children's outreach nurses is for Donegal.  I do not have the note in front of me but from memory, I am almost certain that post is currently advertised.  I will contact the Deputy if I am wrong on that.</p></speech>

It is such a large, sprawling county that to have an outreach nurse will make a big difference.</p> <p>  I also had an excellent conversation with Deputy Louise O'Reilly's colleague and my counterpart, Ms Michelle O'Neill, MLA, the Minister for Health in Northern Ireland, about what we can do on a North-South basis in terms of paediatric palliative care.  LauraLynn has some ideas in that regard.  Both the Minister, Ms O'Neill MLA, and myself have undertaken that our officials will engage.  A bit like Altnagelvin in the case of radiotherapy, there is definitely scope to do something tangible there.  I am also in conversations with LauraLynn, which I visited on 23 December, about its desire to expand services outside of Dublin.  I hope we will have a busy year ahead in this regard.</p></speech>

I am going on the old document again.  To what extent has it been possible to monitor potential hazards before serious difficulties arise with waiting lists or shortages in the delivery of services at any level, either in the primary care area or in the general hospital area?  How are the four regions likely to fare in the course of this year?  At year-end are they likely to compare favourably with each other, given the respective population demographic requirements and staffing levels?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1065" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#F00200"><p>I know Deputy Durkan is a traditionalist in regard to looking back at these figures.  I mean that in a positive sense.  While this is the way the document is laid out, as I said at the start, it is sometimes not terribly reflective of the way the programmes are delivered and that is the bridge we need to try and cross.  I expect all four regions, without fear or favour, to come in on budget and to fulfil their commitments in the performance and accountability framework.  That commitment is not just to come in on budget, it is the three other metrics that I spoke about last week, which do not often get talked about as much.  These are access to services, quality of services and how they are harnessed.</p> <p>  We now have the hospital group structures and we have our community healthcare organisations, CHOs.  While I defer to the Committee on the Future of Health Care as I want to see a cross-party view on this, my personal view is that the CHOs and the hospital groups should be integrated in a more seamless manner.  We talk about home care packages and delayed discharges.  It does not make sense if one section of the health service is responsible for hospital beds, but to free up a bed they need somebody to be provided with a home care package and that is the responsibility of a different organisation within the HSE.  They need to be realigned.  Hopefully some of that work can be done in 2017 once the Committee on the Future of Health Care reports in April.  </p> <p>  The Deputy is correct to say that different regions have different pressures.  If one looks at the country's demographic profile, some of our hospital groups and CHOs have a higher proportion of older people.  There are areas that have a higher level of social deprivation and therefore generally a higher level of health need.  The HSE's job is to try and reflect that in the submissions that it receives from the hospital groups and from the community health organisations.  I expect that they will do that through their operational plans.</p></speech>

Does the Minister feel adequate provision has now been made to ensure that the most urgent cases in terms of overcrowding are unlikely to recur to the same extent?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1067" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#F00400"><p>This year it is no longer acceptable to say that the HSE is not adequately funded.  I say that because the Director General of the HSE, when he launched the service plan with me, said that the service plan was adequately funded for the delivery of the targets within it.  There is recognition from the HSE that the Houses of the Oireachtas have provided adequate funding to deliver on the priorities in the service plan.  In this year's service plan we have tried to prioritise some of the areas that have caused particular difficulty to our patients, our citizens and our staff in recent years.  I spoke about earlier about the situation in previous years where children with disabilities were turning 18 in the summer but there was a lack of funding for an adequate transition place.  This year, costs for school leavers have been factored into the service plan.  There have been significant increases in home care and home care packages.  </p> <p>  In regard to medical cards, where in the past there were significant challenges, in particular during the years of recession, today I will publish the Bill.  I will try and get the legislation through the Houses of the Oireachtas as quickly as possible to ensure that every child with a disability whose parent is in receipt of domiciliary carer's allowance will have an automatic entitlement to a medical card.  That is about 33,000 children in this country.  Of the 33,000, almost 10,000 of them do not have a medical card today.  The others are subject to reviews, which can cause a lot of distress and hassle and inconvenience for a family when the condition, in all likelihood, will not have changed, or certainly will not have improved.</p> <p>  We are now back to investing in waiting list initiatives.  I will not suggest that in one year of doing so we will be able to deal with the totality of the waiting list problem.  However, we will unapologetically target those waiting the longest.  If the Deputy went to the doctor today and needed a hospital procedure or hospital appointment, he would go on a waiting list.  What matters is how long one is on that waiting list.  That we have people waiting 18 months and longer for procedures and that we have children waiting such a long period of time is not acceptable.  That is why all of our efforts in regard to waiting lists will be targeted at the longest waiters.  If waiting times can be reduced this year and that work is built on in following years, it will be possible to get back to the relatively good waiting list times which this country previously had.</p> <p>  Emergency department overcrowding is perhaps the biggest challenge.  It is dependent on a number of factors.  One is bed capacity.  Another is staffing.  A bit like Deputy Kelleher's question, another factor is to what extent we are currently providing services in acute hospitals which can be provided outside that, be it in primary care, through a GP contract, more primary care teams, community intervention teams or supporting our nursing homes to do more.  </p> <p>  Usually the winter initiative comes to an end around now.  I came into office in May.  Discussions started during the summer about a winter initiative which was to take effect in September or October.  This month I intend to begin having conversations about the winter initiative for 2017.  I have asked the HSE and the Department to get together and do a look back and a look forward.  They will examine what went well and what worked.  For example, we had the lowest level of delayed discharges ever recorded.  Some things clearly did not go well.  We will then analyse that data and try to understand, for example, what were the reasons for significant increases on certain days.   If we had GP out-of-hours for a greater length, would that have reduced the attendances?  We must ensure the measures are targeted.  I would welcome a conversation with this committee before the summer in regard to the preparedness for winter next year.  If we follow those steps, we can reasonably take all steps possible.</p></speech>

The automatic medical card for children whose parents are in receipt of domiciliary carer's allowance is especially important for those who face a review every three years or whatever.  Affected parents in my constituency have brought up the hardship of filling up the forms.  They have a lot of other stress in their lives, especially dealing with a disability that obviously is not going to get better.  The Minister will have my full party support in pushing this through quickly.</p> <p>  I am glad that the winter initiative talks are being started early.  Some of it went right, some of it went very wrong.  The earlier aspects regarding the winter start to be discussed, the better.</p></speech>

It is regrettable that it did not happen earlier.  There is a considerable amount of political will.   I said at the time that it was going to cost &euro;17 million.  When the budget allocated &euro;10 million it was clear that there was no intention for this to come in quickly.  Waiting until 1 June is time lost for a lot of people.  That said, the measure is very welcome.</p> <p>  In regard to the winter initiative, he Minister has mentioned reduced attendances.  That will not influence the number of people on trolleys, because a patient is not put on a trolley unless a doctor has made a decision to admit them.</p><p>On the figures before us, how are we to judge whether the winter initiative gives value for money?  How will the winter initiative be analysed?  I fully appreciate that the Minister is dealing with human beings not robots, so he cannot predict what will happen.  One can say the 'flu happens every year, and we can park that, but crises will emerge.  How will we judge whether the money allocated to the winter initiative has been effectively dispersed?  We all see the trolley count.  We see that it is unacceptably high.  The current Minister is not the first to say that the trolley count is unacceptably high, one of predecessors stated it was a national emergency but the figure still did not reduce.  How will we judge that we are getting a good return on the measures that have been pursued?</p></speech>

This is an issue that unifies the House.  The Bill is welcome and we will get it through both Houses as quickly as possible.  The Deputy is correct to highlight the review.  It is very important for the almost 10,000 parents who are in receipt of the domiciliary care allowance for the care of their child, who does not have a medical card.  I meet in my clinics many people who must keep reapplying for the medical card, because the card is reviewed every three years.  Now they will have certainly from the age, the child is granted a domiciliary care allowance until the age of 16 years.  That will save parents a great deal of unnecessary stress due to uncertainty and the bureaucracy.  That is important.</p> <p>  The HSE is working on an online registration system, similar to the free GP care, so that people will log on.  The Department of Social Protection together with the HSE will be able to share information and cross check information.  If one is in receipt of a domiciliary care allowance, the HSE will be able to verify that with the Department of Social Protection.  This will reduce form filling, which  is important.</p> <p>  Let me assure Deputy O'Reilly that the time it has taken to introduce this scheme is not due to monetary consideration.  While I presume the Deputy could be correct about the figure of &euro;17 million-----</p></speech>

As the Deputy also knows, the primary care reimbursement service, PCRS, of the HSE has been showing a surplus because people were granted a card during times of unemployment but as they go back to work, the card is being returned when it comes up for review.  While the Deputy is correct that there was an allocation of &euro;10 million in the budget for this measure, let me point out there is a degree of head room, if I may call it that, in the PCRS Vote.  The arbitrary date of 1 June should not be seen as such.  I have asked the HSE to examine how quickly we can introduce this measure.  It is based on two components, the first being legislative change.  We need to change the law and no matter how straightforward the change is, it still has to go though the process and come out the other side.  We start that process today in terms of the Bill being published.  Second, is the system for people to apply for the medical card without having to go through the rigmarole of significant amounts of paperwork.  I am happy to work together to get the system up and running.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1075" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#G00600"><p>I do not have the up-to-date figure, but the PCRS had a surplus of about &euro;30 million in 2016.  It is a moving figure, but the most recent figures available to me are in that region.</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly is correct that the people on trolleys are people who have been admitted by a clinician.  It is also correct that people turning up in hospital - this is not blaming people because they often have no where else to go - who may have been able to be treated in a primary care centre in an out of hours GP service in a nursing home or in an appropriate setting, takes staff from the emergency department to deal with them.  Reducing hospital attendances through primary care is a component of assisting and alleviating the pressure on our acute hospitals.  I equally accept that bed capacity and staffing are the other two big pieces.  We have to address the issue using a three-pronged approach, namely, primary care, bed capacity and staffing.  When I listen to people on the radio speak of the need to open a certain number of beds in the morning, even if their analysis is correct, they also need to be conscious of the fact that the beds need to be accompanied by staffing.  It is not an either-or in regard to bed capacity or staffing.  It has to be the bed capacity, the staffing and the primary care.  </p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly made a fair point on whether we are achieving value for money.  I have asked myself this question.  It is part of the reason the HSE and the Department are sitting down to provide me with an analysis of the winter initiative.  That is one of metrics I want them to analyse this month.  It is fair to say that it is easy to measure some aspects, for example, if one provides a certain amount of funding for aids and appliances to benefit over 3,000 additional patients.  One can establish whether the 3,000 additional patients get the goods and whether they were procured at a reasonable price.  It is a quick and easy to answer that.  When one gets to the hospital and the numbers on trolleys, then there is a value for money element, because one can measure whether the funding was provided for extra beds and the beds came on stream.  The other elements I have outlined are harder to measure on a value for money basis.  If there was insufficient capacity in the hospital or if there was not adequate staffing in the hospital.  We need to look at the value for money aspect but we also need to look at the blockages are as well.  Some of them are not as easily measured from a value for money analysis point of view.</p> <p>  A 'flu outbreak happens every year in every country.  The advice available to me from our chief medical officer, our deputy chief medical officer, our expert group on influenza was that the type of 'flu this year was a strain that we had not seen in this country since 2009.  I believe the 'flu in 2015-16 largely affected younger people.  The strain of 'flu this winter largely affected older people.  That does result in increased hospital attendance.</p> <p>  I make the practical, not political point, and in recognition of the staff working in the health service, that during the month of February in spite of the fact that we continue to see too many people on hospital trolleys, we need to recognise the fact that we see more and more people attending our hospitals as the population grows and gets older.  We had fewer people on trolley in the month of February this year than last year.  It is not an acceptance of the figure, but it is a recognition of the fact that people working in our hospitals, be it in management roles or front-line roles, are doing their very best to reduce the number.  In spite of the fact that more people turned up in the emergency departments, fewer people were on trolleys.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1076" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#G00700"><p>I thank the Minister.  Before we go off that topic, perhaps I could sow an idea in his head in regard to nursing homes.  I believe each nursing home should have a medical officer which would give consistent medical advice and an overview on how the nursing home deals with people who become acutely ill in their care.  It would be an interesting study if the Minister could compare the number of admissions from nursing homes that have a medical officer to those who do not.  Many of the public nursing homes have a medical officer employed by the HSE whereas most of the private nursing homes do not.  If there were consistency of medical management in nursing homes, fewer people would be sent to acute departments when they become ill in a nursing home.  When patients are admitted to a nursing home, most nursing homes will introduce an end of life discussion on how people wish to view an illness, should it occur.  That is to be encouraged and advance directives in that regard are an item that should be foremost when anybody is admitted to a nursing home.  Obviously one wants to do the best one can for a person in a nursing home but there are illnesses which will not benefit substantially in terms of treatment when the patient lands on a trolley.  The introduction of a medical officer in each nursing home is something the Minister might consider.</p> <p>  We are skipping around a bit, which is fine if that is okay.  The next item on the programme is the Vote of &euro;2,807,000 million for the primary care reimbursement services, PCRS which is referred to in page 8 of the analysis of the revised Estimates.</p><p>On that topic, I noticed that the percentage of properly completed medical card or GP visit card applications processed within 15 days is approximately 90%.  Is that an improvement or a true reflection of what is happening?  It does not seem to be reflected on the ground, where people have great difficulty in having their medical card application approved.</p></speech>

The delay is often caused by missing paperwork.  They are only measuring when all the legwork has been done.  I am sure that the Minister recognises that many of the problems, particularly those referenced by Deputy Murphy O'Mahony with regard to parents filling out the paperwork, are not caused by the paperwork going in but rather because parents feel that they are being made to jump over hurdles.  When it is all done it is measured, but the time taken could be significantly longer than the 15 days.  It could stretch to months in some cases.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1079" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#H00300"><p>That is true.  In 2016 there was a target of 95% of medical cards properly completed - I will deal with that point in a moment - and being processed and turned around within 15 days.  The actual out-turn was 89.6%, so it fell short of the target.  We have set a target of 96% for 2017.  The point that Deputy O'Reilly makes is valid.  We all see it in our work as Deputies, where people feel that they have submitted all of the paperwork only to get another query back.  I visited the primary care reimbursement centre, PCRS, and in fairness to it a number of improvements have been made in recent years after a very difficult birth, if I might call it that, relating to the centralisation of the service, including the application number one receives and the way in which one can track the application online.  Those are improvements.  I do not know whether the committee has been out to the PCRS centre for a meeting with management there, but I would very much welcome its input on how it can improve.  I know that Deputy Durkan has strong views on this.  The quick turnaround is in the interest of everyone.  The size of the operation in terms of the scale of correspondence we are dealing with is very significant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1080" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#H00400"><p>I have been out to the headquarters on several occasions.  I am not a great supporter of the centralised system at all, and I hope that in the not-to-distant future we can see decentralisation, in the four regions perhaps, and with that simplification.  I have brought this up before.  The HSE told us a week ago there is no automatic right for a cancer patient to have a medical card.  I find it hard to explain to the patient or constituent in a situation where everyone is stressed and wondering how quickly they can get their medical card, if at all.</p> <p>  Some of the questions are insensitive.  If one receives a letter from a doctor to the effect that a patient is terminally ill a card will issue.  That is not a great help to the patient, I have to say.  It does not reassure the patient in any sense.  There is a certain inevitability about it that I regard as a bit insensitive.  </p> <p>  I know that spot-checks have to be made.  It is commonly said to patients that there is an awareness of their changed circumstances even though their circumstances have not changed at all.  It takes an inordinate amount of time to process some of those cards, especially if there is a question asked.  I am not blaming the staff, but that system does not work.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1081" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#H00500"><p>There are a couple of points to note.  Let me be clear and say that there is no financial need or incentive to be carrying out spot checks now.  In terms of the surplus that PCRS actually found itself with at the end of 2016, unlike in previous years when previous Ministers for Health found themselves in very difficult situations regarding medical cards, that financial necessity is not there.  What is a necessity is that we ensure that the system is administered in line with the law.  If we do not like the law there is an onus on us to change it.  That is why we are going to change the law, I hope, on the domiciliary care allowance, DCA.  The reviews that the Deputy talks about for that cohort of people, which is 33,000 people - quite a few - will cease.  It is hugely expensive and time consuming for both the resource within the HSE.  One would be better employed turning around more medical card applications for patients to achieve that target.</p> <p>  It is also worth pointing out that the clinical advisory group that was set up by my predecessors to tackle the question that the Deputy is referring to is doing important work.  Its first recommendation, which was adopted by the director general, was that any child under the age of 18 with cancer should be provided with an automatic entitlement to a medical card for five years.  That was a very welcome development.  The next step now, and the director general made this point when he was here last week, is to look at how we can apply that process to all cancer patients.  The clinical advisory group, which includes representatives from Our Children's Health, Patients for Patient Safety Ireland and medics has been looking at this.  My own policy perspective on this is that where people have a clear medical need and a condition that requires access to a medical card the more straightforward we can make that process as legislators the better, because it avoids all the hoops that people have to jump through.  Today we are making good progress on a cohort of 33,000.  The move that we have already made around children with cancer is another cohort of patients who should not have to go through a bureaucratic process.  The next body of work I will be moving on to will concern other conditions, including cancer.</p></speech>

It is important to those people working in PCRS that we provide, as legislators, the legal framework to do some of those things, if that is the view of the House.  As I say, once we move on from the DCA legislation I would be very eager to work with colleagues on further legislative change where required.</p></speech>

This refers mostly to substance misuse and the treatment of those with substance misuse issues.  That is one of the metrics used here.  I did have some input into looking at homelessness and drug addiction and the duel diagnosis of drug addiction and mental illness, and I understand that the allocation of money has gone from &euro;2 million to &euro;6 million in this regard.  Perhaps the Minister could speak about that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1085" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#H00900"><p>This is a very important part of Rebuilding Ireland, and I want to acknowledge the Chairman's excellent work in this regard.  The premise is that people who are homeless have a need for a house and often have a need for other wrap-around services.  The Chairman espoused the housing first principle in the programme for Government talks.  Until relatively recently a view would have been taken in many parts of administrative Ireland that a house would be provided after all of the other social needs, whereas the evidence now suggests that providing people with a stable housing situation and wrapping around the services is often the way to break the difficult cycle of addiction, abuse or various other health needs.  I gave a commitment to significantly increase the funding and that is what we are doing.  I recently visited the Capuchin Day Centre and saw the work done by Brother Kevin Crowley.  I was in a facility for homeless women and children in Mullingar, called Temporary Emergency Accommodation Midlands, TEAM, last Monday week.  The message that we need to take from that is that the job of tackling homelessness and the issues of homeless people is not just something that rests with the Minister for Housing, Community and Local Government, Deputy Coveney.  There are societal issues that interact here that we have to try to provide for.</p><p> I thank the Chairman for his work.  I hope the funding we have provided will make a significant difference.  Some of the metrics are outlined in the performance information note from my Department which was circulated to the committee.  We want to get to 100% of substance misusers over the age of 18, for whom treatment has commenced, within one calendar month following assessment.  Currently, it is 97%.  We want to get to 100% of substance misusers under 18 years of age, for whom treatment has commenced, within one week.  That figure is 81.4% now so it is quite a jump to get to 100% of people under the age of 18 this year.  The percentage of service users admitted to homeless emergency accommodation hostels or facilities whose health needs have been assessed within two weeks of admission is currently 73.9%.  We have funded that to get it to 85% this year.  We can make a real and significant difference.  We can also do other things that seem very logical.  </p><p> When I was in TEAM in Mullingar last Monday week, I spoke to some women and their children who find themselves living there.  They cannot speak highly enough of the facility they are living in but their medical card is attached to a specific GP and that GP may be many miles away.  To use the example of somebody I was talking to from Portlaoise who is now living in this temporary accommodation in Mullingar, if she needs to bring her child to the doctor, she has to get the bus to Portlaoise and back.  It is a huge burden.  Prescription charges and how they are dealt with is another issue.  Can we give a medical card to a centre and waive the prescription charges?  I have given a very clear commitment to try to look at the prescription charge issue and the medical card issue.  Can these temporary accommodation facilities have a medical card attached to the centre which can be used by those living in the centre?  By virtue of it being a transient group of people, those people will change.  I will be happy to come back and update the committee on those points.  They are two small, practical things on the health side that we could do to ease the hassle and inconvenience for some of these people.</p></speech>

There is an increasing cohort of people who suffer from social and economic deprivation and, as a result, find themselves under medical and mental pressure to a huge extent.  Way back in the days of old, we tried to have a programme of identifying families who were at risk for various reasons.  We tried to have a case worker who focused on two or three families in order to provide a safety net for them so they did not become a burden on themselves or become homeless or reliant on drugs or alcohol.  I do not know how feasible that programme might be in the future but it could be very important.  We need to keep that in mind when we consider the issue of homelessness.</p> <p>  There is also an increasing number of people, quite often single men and single women, who are dropping out of society, sleeping rough and coming to the attention of the authorities and all kinds of things.  Have we arrived at the time where there is a need for emergency supervised accommodation in towns and villages throughout the country, which would not have been heard of years ago, with a view to alleviating their problems?  They would have a place where they could go.  They would have a roof over their heads and a place that is supervised.  There could be a manager within their immediate environment in order to encourage and support them.</p> <p>  My last point is about younger women, in particular very young women, with children who find themselves under social or economic pressure and pushed down the list.  They have little knowledge of motherhood or raising a family and do not know where to go.  It is a problem that has come up again and again.  They need support.  We need to invest in the provision of support services, to give them something to lean on at crucial times, so they do not find themselves pushed to the side and ignored.  It is something that does not immediately come into focus at present other than when talking about the future.  In my time in public life, I have seen a huge increase in the number of young people who are sleeping rough, who are in danger of sleeping rough or who are dropping out of society and have become addicts for a variety of reasons and progressed in an area that is not helpful to them at all.</p></speech>

Under the heading of social inclusion, there is substance misuse, opioid substitution and homelessness.  I might be missing it but there is no detailed breakdown of the services.  It is all very well to say social exclusion is a problem.  We could agree on that eight days a week.  The issue is knowing exactly and specifically what services will be provided.  What are the targets and how will they be measured?  How will we know, if we are all sitting here this time next year looking at each other, if it worked or not?  How will we measure whether it was successful?</p> <p>  With regard to the point made by Deputy Durkan, there was a fantastic project in Ballymun known as Young Ballymun which was doing exactly what the Minister is talking about and regrettably the funding for it was cut.  Perhaps the Minister will raise that at his next parliamentary party meeting.</p></speech>

If he lets me in, I will support him.  Deputy Durkan makes a very valid point about early intervention.  It is regrettable that the funding for Young Ballymun was cut.  That is only a statement; I would like an answer specifically to my question.</p></speech>

It is an important point.  I have some detail here that I am happy to share.  Much of the additional funding in 2016 was provided to service providers to improve their own services and meet their own unmet need.  I will get the Deputy more detail.</p> <p>  There are a couple of important points to make on Deputy Durkan's and Deputy O'Reilly's question, which relates to breaking the cycle and what we will do, apart from responding to the current crisis.  There are a couple of pieces to this issue.  The new national drugs strategy, which will be published shortly by my colleague, Minister of State, Deputy Catherine Byrne, is an important part.  Supervised injecting facilities are a very important element.  The Oireachtas will be showing political leadership in tackling this issue.  We will be following on from something that works very well in many other cities if we establish the first pilot supervised injecting facility in our capital city in 2017.  Items such as the Public Health (Alcohol) Bill are very important measures that will require political leadership in the Houses of the Oireachtas which I hope will be forthcoming from all parties, including our own, in addressing that issue.</p> <p>  The powerful message sent from the Oireachtas after the statements in the D&aacute;il last night on recognising Travellers as a distinct ethnic group cannot be the end.  There is now a need to follow on.  The development of the national Traveller and Roma inclusion strategy is being undertaken by the Department of Justice and Equality.  My Department is feeding into that from a health perspective by addressing the unmet health needs and addressing how one can interact with the Traveller community to make sure Travellers access the health services that are available.  Funding was available under the dormant accounts fund for 2016 and 2017 and this is being used to support a number of marginalised service users.</p> <p>  Two projects being funded include a mobile health screening unit and an intercultural health project for refugees.  The objective of the mobile health screening unit is to provide an accessible targeted screening and primary care service to a wide range of marginalised service users in settings such as hostels, prisons, direct provision centres, refugee reception centres and orientation centres.  The intercultural health project for refugees will support the delivery of a range of health services to meet the emerging needs of new residents of the emerging reception and orientation centres established in Clonee and Monasterevin.  A third EROC is due to open shortly.  We have been having discussions on housing and homelessness and there is a need for an intergovernmental approach to that area.</p><p>Rebuilding Ireland, under the leadership of my colleague, the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government, Deputy Simon Coveney, shows the pathway forward, but there is a role for my Department and me to play in that area and I am willing to do it.  I hope the additional funding will help in that regard.</p></speech>

We cannot have a one-size-fits-all approach.  The unit cannot just rock up to one of the reception centres unless it is offering services to the entire community.  There are sections of the community that are already being failed and we will be adding insult to injury if we pretend that we are providing medical services when we are not.</p></speech>

It is not one that affects Dublin, Cork, Limerick and Galway only.  It is important to acknowledge the important work voluntary organisations do in that regard, particularly Simon which does fantastic work and is always crying out for funds.  I am sure its representatives knock on the Minister's door on a regular basis.</p> <p>  We have seven programmes to get through.  The last section of the second programme deals with primary care services, the Vote for which is &euro;834 million.  The relevant information is on page 10 of the analysis document.  Does anyone have comments to make on the section?  I will make one comment while members are looking through it.  I refer to the number of contacts with GP out-of-hours services.  My colour blindness makes it difficult for me to distinguish between line and the other, but the number is rising.  I ask the Minister to comment on out-of-hours GP services and how they are managing.</p></speech>

Without pre-judging the outcome of the negotiations on the GP contract, an obvious point for discussion is the determination of what constitutes an out-of-hours service and a normal operating hours service.  We can see clearly that there is a demand for the former.  Given people's lifestyles, in terms of work and so forth, we need to determine what is best in terms of accessible hours for GP surgeries and figure out what the Department and the Government need to do to enable these hours to be operated.  The output target last year was 964,770 hours, while the target this year is 1,550,388 hours.  As the target in 2016 was exceeded significantly, there is clearly a massive demand for the service.  </p> <p>  Another issue that arises in terms of the sustainability of the service in certain parts of the country is the ageing GP population, of which the Chairman is aware in the case of Shannondoc which operates in his part of the country.  Interestingly, when I attended the OECD Health Ministers meeting, I discovered that while we had an ageing GP population here, we actually compared quite well to other European countries.  However, that is not a reason not to prepare.  We have a lot of GPs who are making retirement plans and need to replace them.  I still believe, although not everyone agrees with me, that if we do not move towards the option of having salaried GPs in rural areas and areas of urban deprivation, there will continue to be an unmet need.  I have an open mind on how that should be done, but it may mean the HSE directly employing GPs or grant-aiding GP surgeries, as it does already in organisations such as SafetyNet.  I am absolutely adamant that this should form part of the discussions on the GP contract because the sustainability question goes to the very core of the issue.</p></speech>

Some areas are reasonably well serviced by GPs and their out-of-hours services can manage.  However, there are many areas where, owing to a lack of GPs and their distribution, out-of-hours services are struggling greatly.</p></speech>

Regarding primary care services in general, we can see that there has been an increase in the number of GP trainees.  I concur with what was said about salaried GPs being directly employed by the HSE.  How many additional staff will be provided in this area?  I can see that there is an increase in the target for the number of attendances, but specifically, how many additional staff will be provided in each of the areas in which activity will increase?  Clearly, we will need more personnel to provide the projected additional services.  I also ask the Minister to tell us whether it is anticipated that the additional activity will be generated by directly employed staff or private sector staff or through some other outsourced or grant-aided mechanism.</p> <p>  On output targets, I ask the Minister to give us a detailed breakdown.  There is no disputing the fact that the figures look good, but without knowing the detail behind them, it is hard to know if they will actually make any difference to people living in the community.</p></speech>

We fund the HSE and ask the executive to set targets and then agree to them.  The HSE has to transpose them and the resources provided into its community health organisations, CHOs.  I will ask the HSE to send a note to the Deputy detailing exactly what the increases mean for each CHO and answering the public versus private question.</p> <p>  The Deputy and I discussed the issue of staffing during the last oral parliamentary questions session.  I think it is fair to say she is of the view that it makes sense for the HSE to directly employ people to deliver primary care centre services, be they nurses or other health care professionals.  Instinctively, I agree with the Deputy.  I have spoken to GPs, the Irish Practice Nurses Association and others about the issue.  There is a view among GPs that while they have significant responsibilities as employers, one should not have to be a great SME-owner to be a great GP.  That is certainly an issue.  Furthermore, traditionally practice nurses have not had access to the same level of support that is available to nurses in acute hospital settings.  While I do not want to get into the industrial relations issues in detail, HSE-employed nurses, for example, have access to postgraduate education and funding for same, but that option is not available to practice nurses.</p></speech>

There is funding available for postgraduate training.  Whether it is enough is a matter for debate, but funding is available for HSE-employed nurses but not for practice nurses.</p><p>At my recent briefing on the general practitioner, GP, contract, I made it clear to the HSE and to the Department that while we are debating and negotiating a GP contract for primary care services, it is essential that other health care professionals, particularly nurses in the community, have an input into that process.</p><p> The Deputy asked about community intervention teams in the context of the winter initiative.  Such teams can have a huge benefit in terms of hospital avoidance and hospital admissions, particularly for our older patients.  If the latter are seen at home by community nurses, etc., they can be kept hydrated and well and prevented from getting sick and needing to be admitted to hospital.  We provided for an increase, to 27,633 hours, in community intervention teams' total activity in 2016 and this is going to rise further to 32,861 hours.  I accept that the Deputy asked me for the geographic breakdown in that regard.  The increase to which I refer is a sign that we believe this model can work and we need to ensure that there will be further increases.</p></speech>

There is a major problem regarding the provision of dental treatment for children.  I have had a few conversations with the Minister regarding University Hospital Galway.  Due to his intervention, we got a machine replaced there that was broken.  The issue of concern to me is that a number of parents have approached me whose children have been on waiting list for a considerable period.  Many of those children are in primary school but they will not get treatment until they have gone into secondary school.  It is very necessary treatment.  The children involved are concerned and upset that this matter will not be sorted out before they go to secondary school.  Is there any light at the end of the tunnel, as there are fairly extensive problems in this area.  The Minister has spoken to me about this matter on occasions when I approached him.  There was a difficulty in University Hospital Galway with having an orthodontist replaced.  I do not know whether that vacancy has been filled.  The Minister might provide an update on that.  If he cannot do so today, I would appreciate if he would contact me next week or whenever.</p></speech>

He also raised it with me on a number of previous occasions in the context of his constituency and region.  We have made some progress in respect of it in the meantime.  Orthodontic waiting lists are a cause of significant concern.  As the Deputy pointed out, for a child or an adolescent at a certain time in his or her life, his or her inability to access this treatment can have quite a significant impact on his or her overall sense of well-being.   I have met parents who are concerned about the impact of this on their child's overall health and mental health well-being.  I am informed that orthodontic waiting lists have been decreasing since quarter 3 of 2016 - that is, since the middle of last year - following a significant period of increase.  The reduction has come about in the aftermath of a procurement initiative undertaken by the HSE.  I will arrange for a detailed note on the HSE's plans in this regard to be forwarded to the Deputy.  We also intend to publish a national oral health policy this year.  It is very important that we have a roadmap for the delivery of dental health policy in Ireland, which we badly need.  Considerable work has been undertaken in my Department and by my colleague, the Minister for Social Protection, Deputy Varadkar, in terms of trying to restore some of the dental benefits.  The health policy for oral health will be published this year.  I will arrange for the Deputy to have a detailed note on this.</p></speech>

Referring back to having salaried or the direct employment of staff in general practice, if we are going to have salaried GPs, the support staff in those practices will have to be salaried and directly employed by the HSE.  One of the strengths of general practice under the old contract - whatever the new contract will bring - has been the ability of those in general practice to be very flexible and to respond to patients' needs in an immediate way.  Having GPs employing and having governance over their own staff is one of the strengths of general practice.  There are pros and cons for having directly employed staff in general practice.</p></speech>

People in this country largely have access to their GPs at relatively short notice.  Such ease of access has been lost in a number of other countries.  While I am conscious of the changes, improvements and modernisation that are required - as are our GP organisations - we do not want to lose all that is good about general practice.</p></speech>

It has an allocation of &euro;1.749 billion.  It is broken down into two sections.  Section A deals with  long-term residential care, which has a vote of &euro;940 million, and section B relates to services for older people, in respect of which there is an allocation of &euro;810 million.  Those sections are in the analysis document on pages 12, 13 and 14.  While people are looking at that, I will ask the Minister a question.  The number of funded beds in our public nursing homes is gradually declining.  It has just fallen to approximately 5,000.  Will the Minister comment on the fact that the HSE seems to be getting out of the business of looking after older people in its own nursing homes and that many of our elderly people are being directed towards private nursing home facilities?</p></speech>

It is the wrong process and the wrong direction at the wrong time.  If anything, we need an increase in that area in the public health sector.  I can think of a number of our public long-stay hospitals where, compared to ten or 15 years ago, the number of patients has halved.  The latter was unnecessary, in my view, because there was no basis for it.  The theory behind it, which was put to me on a number of occasions, was that it was more cost-effective to do it.  I have not seen the evidence for that.  What often happens is that seriously dependent patients end up in the public sector in any event, and understandably so.  The quality of the services and facilities available in the public system in most of our hospitals - I acknowledge that standards have to be kept up at all times - is excellent and unequalled anywhere else.  I do not see the reason for that approach.  We need more of those beds for two reasons: first, to meet the demographic needs; and, second, to alleviate overcrowding in acute hospitals.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1124" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#L01300"><p>Regarding the increase in the number of home-help hours - while increasing, it will not go up by a great deal - can the Minister give a breakdown between the public-private and voluntary providers?  I understand that when the tender process for the provision of those services is concluded, the individual health agencies will have their preferred providers and they will have to select from those.  My sense of this is that the choice available to them is frequently between different private providers and that fewer home-help hours are being provided by the HSE.  I echo what Deputy Durkan said.  It seems the State is getting out of the business of caring for older people, which is to be very much regretted.</p> <p>  Specifically with regard to the single assessment tool for older people, which is extremely important, the output targets for 2016 and 2017 are a little vague.  At what stage of development is the phased implementation of the IT to enable the standardised assessment tool?  It is to be phased in but that could be done over the next 200 years.  The target for 2017 is to work with providers to establish the greater capacity of the single assessment tool assessments.  They should be doing that in any event.  The single assessment tool, the monitoring process and the frail elderly programmes should be integrated.  Many people would consider those to be fairly basic but they are now being listed in the Department's targets and achievements.</p><p>I understand the need to provide information and that information is welcome, but the assertion was that something was to be phased in during 2016.  However, no indication has been given of how far that process got, how many old people have been assessed using the single assessment tool and whether all public health nurses are using it.  Good luck to those nurses who find the time to use it, given that they are overworked.</p><p> The distinct lack of ambition shown in the section on services for older people is reflective of how this and successive Governments have slowly put clear blue water between themselves and care of the elderly.  It is not untrue to say there is a plan, be it one which has been fully worked out and written down or that is in the back of someone's mind, because clearly the Government is trying to get out of the business of looking after older people.  That service has been outsourced to large, global corporations that are making a fortune.  The Minister knows them and I will not name them.  As I had a bad experience after I had named one of them, I will not do so again, but we all know what we are talking about.  These companies are making a great deal of money.  They are often the only providers on the preferred provider lists.</p><p> HSE home helps approach me - I am sure they also attend other members' clinics - to say they are losing their hours and are not being replaced.  They are going to private sector providers.  There have been "Prime Time Investigates" programmes about the private provision of home care services and as I do not want to go back over them, will the Minister provide us with a breakdown of the single assessment tool and hours directly provided by home helps?</p></speech>

The graph shows an increase, but this is probably one of the main issues on which my office works.  People are being held in hospital longer because of it.  They would be fit to come out if they were to receive a little help and it would cost less.  Perhaps the Minister might examine this matter.  I presume it is the same in other constituencies.  I find the upward graphs difficult to believe, given the experience of my constituency office and would appreciate it if the Minister looked into the matter.</p></speech>

Recently, I placed a question with the Department and the HSE on public nursing homes <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>private nursing homes.  In the past five years there has been a drop of 10% in public nursing homes in most regions.  Is there a deliberate policy on the part of the HSE to get out of providing public nursing homes?  There was serious overcrowding in Portiuncula Hospital in Ballinasloe, County Galway after Christmas.  It was so bad that some children were moved from Ballinasloe to Mullingar, which did not make sense.  There are two nursing homes within 20 minutes of Portiuncula Hospital, to which some patients could have been moved to alleviate the overcrowding.  They are reasonably priced and provide good accommodation.  In such instances why not avail of nursing homes at the weekend or whenever else there is overcrowding?  The Minister will probably say that happens in certain circumstances, but at other times it does not.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1128" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#M00500"><p>The Department and I set policy, not the HSE.  It is not my policy or that of the Government to diminish the role of public community hospitals or public nursing homes.  However, it has been the policy of this and successive Governments to ensure these facilities will be brought up to appropriate HIQA standards.  With Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony, I visited the community hospital in Bandon in her constituency.  It is an example of the capital investment work being undertaken to provide state-of-the-art facilities for older people in a public setting in a community hospital.</p> <p>  The reduction in bed numbers is temporary.  Using the Deputy's case as an example, it is a reflection of the fact that in some wards there are beds upon beds and shared bathrooms which must be replaced with single rooms and en suite facilities in order that people will have the dignity we all expect them to have within a public setting.  As the Deputies know, we are making major investments to upgrade these facilities.  As we move towards capital reviews and providing for additional expenditure on building projects in the health sector, I expect us to increase capacity in public settings.  Bed capacity is another factor that will have to be considered.</p> <p>  I have never approached this matter from an ideological view.  People have a right to a choice.  Some will choose private nursing home facilities, while others will prefer to be able to avail of public beds in community hospitals.  It can be either-or, but there is an important role for community hospitals and public nursing homes to play.  This is an issue Deputy Bernard J. Durkan raises with me regularly, which is right and proper, but we have a significant body of work to do to ensure the facilities will be of a standard that people in 21st century Ireland should expect to see.  The care provided is excellent.  I am referring to the infrastructural facilities and not in any way demeaning the care given or the dedication of the staff.  Needing to make this investment should not be an excuse for removing ourselves from this service provision.</p> <p>  Deputy Margaret Murphy O'Mahony mentioned how there were still pressures in seeking access to some services, even though the graph was upwards and investment had increased, but the population of older people has also increased.  A useful example for discussion is how well we have done in mapping demographic pressures in the education system.  The Department of Education and Skills knows this because a certain number of children will turn four, five or six years of age and need school places in September.  It also knows that a certain number of teachers, schools, school buildings, extensions, classrooms and so on will be needed.  We need to undertake that demographic analysis in the health service.  The bed capacity review forms a large part of it, accompanied by the model of care provided.</p> <p>  The figures before the committee show an increase in the numbers of home help hours and packages, including intensive home care packages, in 2017.  However, I will level with the committee.  My view - one that is shared across the House - is that until we do in the home care area what we did in the nursing home area, this will continue to be a challenge.  We need a statutory scheme.  We will probably disagree on what it should look like, given the wide variety of views held, but we cannot say we want people to be able to grow old at home or in their communities if the only statutory scheme available to them is the fair deal scheme.  In fairness to the HSE and its predecessors, they have been providing home help without the service being underpinned by statutory provision or the clear rules, guidelines and budget lines of the fair deal scheme.  If committee members examine the fair deal scheme, they will see the amount of money allocated and the turnaround time, etc.  The metrics are clear.  We need the same in the home help area.</p> <p>  The Government is committed to reverting to the D&aacute;il within six months of debating Deputy Willie O'Dea's Bill.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will launch in May a stakeholder consultation process on future statutory home care schemes.  We cannot transpose the fair deal scheme in the home care area.  Presumably, we do not want HIQA to regulate what happens in people's sitting rooms.  We must be conscious that the setting is someone's home, but we need to consider how to place the schemes on a statutory basis.</p> <p>  The Minister of State is also reviewing the nursing homes support scheme.  There are a number of concerns about how small business owners and farmers are treated in terms of how their assets are considered.</p> <p>  Deputy Louise O'Reilly asked a similar question about public versus private services.  Although it is a valid question, it is an operational one, but I will get her a detailed note from the HSE on the public-private mix, tenders and the roll-out of the single assessment tool.</p><p>I have been in many CHOs where it has been used, but I will get the Deputy a note on it.</p></speech>

The Deputy raised the broader issue of home help provision.  She is probably aware that last year my Department commissioned the Health Research Board to carry out an evidence-based review of all the various international approaches taken to the regulation and financing of home care services.  The Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, will publish the outcome shortly.  We will then undertake a mapping exercise of current service provision nationally taking into account the scale and diversity of the services funded.  This will be used to identify the policy options for the new statutory home care scheme.  The areas we need to consider are regulation, financing, assessment and eligibility.  The issue of public versus private provision is a legitimate one that needs to be considered.  There is a lot of work to be done in this area.  It took several years to set up the fair deal scheme which is generally recognised to be working well, apart from a few anomalies that need to be rectified.  That is the next big thing we must crack.  A total of 1,064 people under the age 65 years are in nursing homes.  Without knowing each story behind these numbers, one of the reasons is we do not have a statutory home care scheme.  I think there is consensus in the D&aacute;il that we need to get this done.  We should, therefore, move on it.</p></speech>

I represented them for years.  They were looking for regulation from the Minister's predecessors.  They are more than willing to put themselves on a more secure footing because it can be a precarious form of employment when it should not be.  It is an area that we can definitely say is going to grow.  How many dementia-specific packages were part of the home care initiative rolled out last year?  How many were targeted last year?  How many were not delivered?  How many have been targeted this year and does the Minister think they will be delivered?  According to my information, the targets were not hit last year.</p></speech>

I understand that in respect of Portiuncula Hospital, there were vacancies in both private and community nursing homes, both of which provide very good services.  I accept that a doctor must sign off on a discharge and ensure a person can be discharged, but the complaint I constantly receive from families is that a son, a daughter, a brother, a husband, a wife or a partner was fit to be discharged on a Friday but because there was no consultant available to sign off on the discharge, he or she remained in hospital unnecessarily until the Monday.  That is three or four bed days in hospital at a time when beds are badly needed.  Better use of the system could be made to alleviate overcrowding when it occurs.  There is chronic overcrowding at times, as the Minister knows well.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1135" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#N00700"><p>That is a fair point.  We can debate the pros and cons of the winter initiative.  There has been significant progress on the issue of delayed discharges, the number of which has been reduced to its lowest level since they were first recorded.  There is a direct correlation with the level of investment in providing additional home care packages and transitional care beds and with the utilisation of capacity in nursing homes, both public and private.  The Deputy is right.  We do not want - neither does a patient - a scenario where a patient finds himself or herself in hospital over a weekend where he or she is medically fit to go home where he or she would much rather be.  Hospitals have a predicted date of discharge, PDD.  Patients are clinically assessed and allocated a PDD.  Clinicians should work towards ensuring somebody who is ready to go home on a Saturday or a Sunday will not be left in hospital until the Monday and that preparations will be made for him or her to be discharged.  The Deputy's point is valid.</p> <p>  In response to Deputy Louise O'Reilly, the figures I have in front of me are for intensive home care packages.  I will need to provide her with a breakdown of dementia-specific packages.  The target in 2015 for intensive home care packages was 190 but 195 were delivered.  The target in 2016 was 130 but 180 were delivered.  The target in 2017 is to provide 190.  I do not have a breakdown of dementia-specific packages, but I will obtain it for the Deputy.</p></speech>

Deputy Louise O'Reilly and I met her prior to the Minister's meeting with her.  Even though it was a short conversation, she had very interesting things to talk about.  One of the ways discharges are dealt with in Scotland involves buying, renting or leasing a certain percentage of beds in private nursing homes for use by public patients as step-down and interim facilities.  It is certainly a very innovative idea which we might sow a seed in the Minister's mind.</p></speech>

The section is broken down into three subsections - acute hospitals and the national clinical strategy programme, for which the Vote is &euro;4,553 million; the national cancer control programme, for which the Vote is &euro;101 million; and the National Ambulance Service, for which the Vote is &euro;176 million.  These items are referenced in the analysis on pages 16 to 18, inclusive.  I note that the Vote for the National Ambulance Service has increased by 6% this year.  The ambulance service is under severe pressure in terms of the available numbers of ambulances and staff.  A critical point is that many ambulances are tied up in transferring patients to overcrowded emergency departments.  On many occasions one will see a queue of ambulances outside hospitals, taking them out of service for a prolonged period.  This adds to the pressures on the ambulance service.  Will the Minister comment on the issue?</p></speech>

The first report I received when I became Minister for Health was produced by Lightfoot Solutions UK on the National Ambulance Service.  In reading the report which was published on my Department's website I was struck by the huge need for extra ambulances and additional paramedics.  However, it is also clear from the report that even when we do this, if we wish to meet HIQA's ambulance response times, there will still be a need to provide the National Ambulance Service with extra ambulances and paramedics because of the demographic layout of the country and the way the population is dispersed.  The report specifically referenced the role of community first responders.  I am very eager to look at how we can further integrate and develop the community first responder network with the National Ambulance Service.  Community first responders are providing a very good service around the country, but there is a lot more to be done.  It is fair to say the National Ambulance Service has undertaken a significant reform programme in recent years that involves reconfiguring the delivery of pre-hospital care services.  The objective is to have a nationally co-ordinated system supported by improved technology.  This has seen the completion of the single national control centre project and all nine regional control centres migrate to a national emergency operations centre which I have had the opportunity to visit.  Improvements in services in the west have been implemented, with the ambulance bases in Tuam and Mulranny now operating on a 24/7 basis and the establishment of a deployment point in Loughglynn, County Roscommon.  We have seen an expansion of the community first responders scheme, with 147 groups now operating nationally.  I genuinely thank them and their volunteers for their incredible dedication.</p><p>The development of an electronic patient care record is under way and that will be rolled out in 2017.  On the point the Deputy made about inter-hospital transfers and making sure we free up our ambulances, our intermediate care service is now carrying out 90% of inter-hospital transfers.  The National Ambulance Service, NAS, now supports neonatal and paediatrics retrieval services through the provision of dedicated resources and staff, and there is the development of an adult retrieval service.  The emergency aeromedical support service has been established on a permanent basis.</p><p> It is important to say that in 2016 the number of ECHO calls received by the National Ambulance Service increased by 42% and DELTA calls increased by 19%.  There has been a significant increase in investment in our ambulance services, but that is appropriate considering the pressure it has been under in recent years.  The next steps are to continue the reform of the ambulance service through the modernisation programme, to implement a clinical hub desk in the national emergency operations centre, to further develop the intermediate care service, and to roll out the electronic patient care record system.  As the Deputy said, the budget for the ambulance service has increased this year.  Approximately &euro;1 million of that increase is for new developments above and beyond dealing with capacity and demographic pressures.  This will obviously include a number of targets in respect of intermediate care service or emergency response times as well.</p></speech>

It related to some reports, one of which the Minister has referenced; I understand there are two reports.  As part of the settlement of that dispute, NAS indicated that it was going to go abroad to try to recruit people and that it had been given a licence to do so - I think that was the term used although I do not know that one would be needed.  NAS said it was embarking on a recruitment programme abroad because there was a recognition that, due to the lead time from starting training to finishing it, domestic recruitment would not have been enough to keep pace with requirements.  In terms of recruitment, will the Minister indicate how many additional NAS staff there will be?  How many of those will be people recruited as part of this international licence?</p> <p>  The Minister will also be aware that in Dublin we are blessed to have our paramedic services provided by both NAS and the Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB.  Members of DFB have balloted for industrial action and that is not something they would do lightly.  I am very familiar with this group from my previous role.  The group actually would be very reluctant to take any form of industrial action but its members have been left with no choice because they feel the service is under threat.  I do not think we could cope in Dublin without DFB.  Its members are, as the Minster will know, trained fire fighters and also paramedics.  They deliver an incredibly efficient service.  Nobody want to see that dispute go ahead and I understand there is a budget conflict between the Minister and local government but, notwithstanding that, Dublin Fire Brigade provides health services.  In terms of the resolution of that dispute, perhaps the Minister could give us his view as to how that will be resolved because the future of DFB does seem to be in some sort of jeopardy.  That would concern us.</p> <p>  With regard to the National Ambulance Service budget and the inter-hospital transfers, my understanding is that transfers are carried out through a range of different sources, including taxis, private ambulances and directly employed personnel.  Will the Minister give the committee a breakdown on that?  He is probably sensing a theme in my questions but perhaps he could give us a breakdown.  The Minister and I have had this conversation many times and I do not believe we get good value for money from the private sector.  I have yet to see any evidence that we do.  I am also very interested to know the budget for taxis.  People spoke about this a number of years ago, and I hope the reason no one is talking about it any more is because it has reduced significantly.  I suspect it has not, but perhaps people have just moved on to talking about something else.  </p> <p>  In respect of the 27 measures that are listed here, obviously there will be more than 27 measures with regard to a budget which, I believe, is 31% of the total Vote.  He may not have it to hand, but perhaps the Minister could provide the committee with more detail in terms of the actions and plans for next year.</p> <p>  With regard to the IT budget, we all agree with the need to improve IT in the acute sector.  That is almost worse because once everybody agrees, one is left wondering when it will happen.  I could be open to question on this but even if we doubled our IT budget, we would still be short of what the average is in the OECD.  It is a bit ridiculous, when one walks into a hospital, to see people walking around with files.  I am sure they would much rather move to a paper-light or paperless system.  Have key targets and areas been identified where actual progress can be made in this area?  It is really not acceptable in this day and age to have people running around with big charts and files under their arms.</p></speech>

That is something that is really of concern.  Obviously, it could be a waste of very valuable time.</p> <p>  We should acknowledge the wonderful work of the National Ambulance Service.  From time to time, when people come to my clinics or speak to me, they refer to the wonderful work those people put in, many of them in very difficult circumstances.  I want to acknowledge the great work that they do.</p> <p>  In respect of our own county of Roscommon and the Roscommon-Galway constituency, I acknowledge what the Minister said about Tuam and Mulranny and the base in Loughglynn.  My understanding in respect of Loughglynn is that the ambulance was actually taken from the base at Roscommon University Hospital and it covers that area.  I do not think it is a new ambulance.  I am asking for clarification as I may be wrong about that, but that would be of concern.  Again I make the point to the Minister that when a county loses its accident and emergency department, it is so critical and important that there is a top class ambulance service.</p> <p>  If an ambulance from the west has done a call to a Dublin hospital and is on its way back, it can then be called to an accident.  That is fair enough.  If it is somewhere in Kildare and there is an accident which it is called to, that is fair enough.  A difficulty is created, however, back in Roscommon, Galway, Sligo and Donegal because the ambulance which should have been back after a certain period of time is not back.  I would be concerned about such situations.  Sometimes ambulances have to come into the county when an accident occurs because the other ambulance is on its way from Dublin and has been called to the scene of another accident.  In that case, an ambulance has to come from, for example, Longford, Offaly or Cavan to the scene of an accident in Roscommon.  I do not know whether the Minister has any comment to make on that but it is of concern to me.</p></speech>

Many points were raised in their comments.  I will get clarification from the National Ambulance Service on Loughglynn but my note just tells me that it is a deployment point.  I take Deputy Murphy's point in respect of the importance of the ambulance service and the great work that it carries out.</p> <p>  This is an area in which we clearly have a lot more work to do.  The Lightfoot report presents a roadmap forward in terms of the investment and the scale of investment needed in terms of both paramedics and vehicles.  I made the point in my opening comment on this section that we will have to grapple with this collectively.  The population dispersal in this country, according to the external consultancy, Lightfoot, poses significant challenges in terms of ambulance response times.  The Lightfoot report is very clear that even if we increase the number of ambulances and paramedics, we will need to do something above and beyond that.  We need to do something innovative here.  Some of the ideas the Deputy has come up with are part of that process.  </p> <p>  People have an absolute right to live in rural Ireland.  We want rural Ireland to thrive and those living there have a right to an ambulance service, just like people in towns and cities, but we have to recognise that the population dispersal means we need to think outside the box in this regard.  Lightfoot suggests community first responders as a starting point.  I met a group from Connemara in Galway when I was in University Hospital Galway recently.</p><p>The group asked whether they could have greater use of the St. John Ambulance and the Order of Malta services.  I believe there is a willingness from those organisations to do more.  In fact, the complaint from the group was that communities had fund-raised for an ambulance, whether a St. John Ambulance or Order of Malta ambulance, only to find that the ambulance could not be fully utilised in all situations.  Obviously, there is a regulator.  It is not me; it is the Pre-Hospital Emergency Care Council.  There is space for the regulator to work with us and engage with those organisations.  That is something I intend to pursue.  I believe such engagement could unleash additional capacity for rural communities and provide them with a far better ambulance service in addition to all of the improvements we intend to make.</p><p> I note the theme from Deputy O'Reilly's questions.  In fairness, it is consistent.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1147" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#P00300"><p>It should make our engagements more predictable.  I will have to ask the HSE to give the Deputy a note on it because these are operational matters.  We have taken note of them.  I urge Deputy O'Reilly to come back to me if she does not get satisfactory information in reply.  That includes the question of recruitment from abroad.</p> <p>  I realise Deputy O'Reilly knows the history of the Dublin Fire Brigade question, but it is important for me to put it on the record of the committee.  In December 2014, HIQA published a review of pre-hospital emergency care.  A series of recommendations were made in respect of Dublin services to address patient safety issues, to reduce risk and to improve co-operation between the National Ambulance Service and Dublin Fire Brigade.  I met representatives of Dublin Fire Brigade through SIPTU.  I acknowledge the exceptional service that DFB provides.  This is not an attempt to suggest anything to the contrary.</p> <p>  HIQA is engaged in a follow-up review to the 2014 report.  HIQA expects to publish a report this month or in April.  While it is fair to say that a good level of co-operation exists between the National Ambulance Service, NAS, and Dublin Fire Brigade, DFB, in providing the service to Dublin city and county, it is also fair to say that some difficulties exist.  I believe that is generally recognised although the way to resolve the matter may not be.  The difficulties might relate to the volume of calls received by the Dublin Fire Brigade.  Some calls have to be stacked when no DFB ambulance resource is available to respond to a call.  When these circumstances arise, Dublin Fire Brigade usually requests support from the National Ambulance Service.</p> <p>  HIQA wrote to Dublin City Council late last year indicating that the current arrangements represent a risk to patients.  HIQA, as the regulator, believes this risk arises from the regular delay in the allocation of ambulance resources to patients, including a high number of potentially life-threatening DELTA calls, due to a combination of the ongoing inability of DFB to see all of the potential resources that it and the NAS have at initial dispatch as well as a reliance on individual contact with NAS over the telephone to enable supplementary resource allocation, where available.  Moreover, HIQA believes there is insufficient collective emergency ambulance capacity, as currently resourced and deployed by DFB and NAS, in the Dublin area.</p> <p>  In light of the correspondence and to mitigate any risk to patients in the area under my remit, that is to say, the NAS, additional resources were deployed to Dublin.  That was an important step.  An issue arises relating to line of sight and how these organisations, both of which undertake incredible work, can co-operate.</p> <p>  I know that the people of Dublin city and county are proud of the track record of exceptional delivery of services by Dublin Fire Brigade in respect of fire and ambulance services.  For want of a better phrase, we need to be careful not to throw the baby out with the bathwater in rectifying the difficulties and challenges.  No one can ignore these challenges in light of what HIQA has said.</p> <p>  As Deputy O'Reilly knows well, Dublin Fire Brigade SIPTU members have voted in favour of industrial action over concerns about ambulance services in Dublin.  It is fair to say that the results of the ballot probably reflect a wider unrest in respect of DFB about future certainty and fire-based emergency medical services.  This dates back as far as the 2014 HIQA report.  I look forward to the next HIQA report.  It will represent a follow-up exercise to point us along the roadmap to try to solve this situation.</p> <p>  My Department is engaging with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in respect of the industrial action vote by SIPTU members.  The issues need to be grappled with in terms of where responsibility lies.  Following my meeting with SIPTU representatives, I believe SIPTU takes the same view.  It is a health service question.  This is an ambulance service under the remit of the city council.  In turn, the city council is under the remit of the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government for certain functions.  I am awaiting the HIQA report and I expect it to be published shortly.</p></speech>

It would be helpful to those people facing the prospect of industrial action - it is not something they would do lightly &ndash; to hear of the willingness to resolve the matter and keep DFB as an integral part of the ambulance and paramedic service provision for the people of Dublin.</p> <p>  The Minister is right.  We are very proud of DFB.  We are proud of the work of members of DFB.  They deliver an incredible and efficient service.  They need to hear from the Minister as well as from the Minister for Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government that their future is secure.</p> <p>  My understanding of where the issue lies relates to the fact that the computers do not talk to each other, but that this is a small rather than a major issue.  However, it has been escalated.  In part, the ballot reflects the uncertainty that the fire and emergency service people in DFB feel about their future.  We should say to them that we see their future as part of the provision of the service in our capital city.  That is nothing less than they deserve.  I do not wish to keep going on about it.</p></speech>

I want to recognise the extraordinary contribution that DFB provides to the delivery of medical services in our capital city and county.  They will understand, as will Deputy O'Reilly, that I have to take on board the HIQA report and review.  However, I want people to understand that my comment on not throwing the baby out with the bathwater gives people an indication of my thinking on the matter.  We need to ensure we keep all that is good and best while addressing the difficulties.</p> <p>  There is a way to go in respect of the industrial action.  I take the point that no one would do that lightly.  I appeal to parties to engage to ensure that does not materialise.  My Department will engage with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government in that regard as well.</p></speech>

Last year, the target was 1.3 million hours and 1.5 million hours were delivered.  This year, the target is 1.4 million hours.  Deputy Dolan questioned the reduction of 100,000 assistance hours for people with disabilities.  Will the Minister comment on that?  There was a mathematical dispute and I am unsure whether it was resolved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1155" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#P01200"><p>I know the Minister of State, Deputy McGrath, is an able and passionate advocate of people with disabilities and I am delighted to work with him.  He was going to come back to Senator Dolan in that regard.  I am keen to reiterate the point made by the Minister of State.  When we consider the provision of disability services, we must consider them in their totality.  I know that Pat Healy, the national director for social care for the HSE, made this point at the time of the publication of the service plan, as did the Minister of State who issued a statement clarifying the situation.  We need to consider the overall provision of services and the fact that some people who in the past may have been availing of personal assistant hours are now availing of a different service or benefiting from different additional investment that we have made in respect of disability services.  That was the thrust of the argument being put forward by the Minister of State.</p> <p>  Let us consider the fact we are going to see home support hours increase and centre-based respite nights for people with disabilities increase on last year's target.  We are seeing a significant increase in facilitating movement from congregated to community settings.  We are seeing the maintenance of all-day service provision.  We are obviously going to see improvements in terms of the reconfiguration of services for children with disabilities in terms of the associated targets.</p><p>Disability services rightly have received a significant increase in investment in budget 2017.  That is for a very good reason.  Considerable work needs to be done in this regard.  My view and that of the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, is that we need to look at how we empower people with disabilities to have a greater say on this budget.  I feel very strongly that the State's responsibility to people with disabilities does not end when the State writes a cheque to the service provider.  The totality of the debate should not be about the size of the budget, but rather the impact of that budget on the lives of people with disabilities.  I think and certainly hope there is cross-party consensus on this.</p><p> The task force on personalised budgets which the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, established last year can unlock huge potential in this sector.  I meet people on an almost daily basis in my interaction with people with disabilities in my constituency office and my departmental office.  I hear from people who ask for a greater say over how the State's funding is spent as it affects their lives.</p><p> Many members will know the group An Saol, which is a group of largely parents and some siblings who have relatives with an acquired brain injury.  The State has provided services for these people.  Their families are very much of the view that if they were allowed a greater say, they could spend the budget much more effectively to deliver a much more meaningful service.  As part of the HSE service plan, we have launched a pilot project allowing An Saol to interact with the HSE.  It is not asking for additional funding but for a greater input because its members know how to spend it better than a bureaucracy does.  It was hard to have this discussion in the years of cuts, but now that we are back in years of increases there is not only an economic but a moral onus on all of us to ensure we can greater empower people with disabilities as regards their services.</p><p> Senator Dolan will hear from the Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, on that.  I suggest the disability budget and service plan should be viewed in terms of the totality of increases which is quite significant.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1157" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1322" speakername="Bernard Durkan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#Q00200"><p>The issue of the delivery of services to the disability sector is getting attention now.  It needs attention urgently.  For example, parents of adults with disabilities worry about what will happen afterwards.  On whom can they rely for a service?  The issue of decongregation is increasing their concerns.  They have become accustomed to living and working in a community with support services available to them - sheltered accommodation effectively.  The needs may vary greatly between one individual and another.  We know this has been provided for.  If two parents are available in the household, it is a huge strain in any event.  If there is only one parent to do the minding it is huge problem and they have great difficulties.  If it is a lone parent, they have to put their lives on hold with obvious consequences later when it comes to pension age etc.  It means they cannot work.  They have no independence.</p> <p>  The degree to which respite is available is a help.  It is not available to the extent that meets all eventualities and we need to look at that.  Most of the parents want to have their child or young adult at home as much as possible but they need to be reassured as to the availability of appropriate residential care in the event of them becoming ill, including something sudden like the 'flu, for example, which can appear without warning.</p> <p>  I have come across cases, as I am sure other members have, where those delivering the service identify a person as suitable for relocation into the community given that he or she is self-sufficient to a certain extent and may be able to travel on the bus, for example.  It does not always happen that way and sometimes those assessments are incorrect and err on the side, to my mind, of reducing the dependence on the service or whatever.  That should not be the case.  It should simply relate to the degree to which the person with disabilities requires support and not the degree to which support is available.</p> <p>  We have all seen cases of people who have dedicated their lives to caring for a loved one with a disability.  It is a great thing to see but it is not exactly fair.  It may not be fair to the person with the disability either in situations where the resources get stretched where the health of the parents or relatives gets stretched or whatever the case may be.  I wish to emphasise those points.</p></speech>

The Minister of State, Deputy Finian McGrath, met people from there.  I ask the Minister to talk to the Minister of State and check it out himself.  They need a major cash injection for respite and for residential care.  Many of the parents of special needs adults are getting very old and are getting concerned about if they get too sick or pass on what will happen to their adult children.  It would be great to put their minds at ease.  I can talk to the Minister another time about that set-up.</p> <p>  The Minister spoke about the personalised budgets.  I agree with including the person with the disability in the decision in how their funding is spent.  If they are not able, perhaps their family members could contribute to it.  One size does not fit all.  There is no point in giving money to a system rather than to them.  I very much support that.</p></speech>

Either he or I will come back to her.  On the task force, it is important that when people hear the term "task force" they do not believe it will run on forever.  When will people see progress on this?  The task force was established on 20 September 2016.  It fulfils a commitment in the programme for Government on how we can provide services and supports to people with disabilities to empower them to live independent lives, but also provide them with greater independence in accessing the services they choose and enhance their ability to tailor the supports they receive.  As the Deputy said, one size does not fit all, and we should not have service providers, good as they are, making all the decisions.  No citizens should settle for that.</p> <p>  The task force has two components to ensure strong representation from all backgrounds.  It has a strategy group and an advisory group.  It also has a reference group being established to assist at key points.  The remit for this task force is that it should make its recommendations on personalised budgets by December of this year so that by 2018 we will have a roadmap on giving greater control to people with disabilities and where appropriate their families and relatives in terms of how to access health-funded personal social services.</p> <p>  Somebody once told me that disability services are very well funded but people with disabilities are not very well funded.  There is a degree of truth in that.  It is a key challenge to ensure that the resources that these Houses allocate to people with disabilities are spent in a way that people with disabilities would like them to be spent.</p></speech>

I seem to understand it every time it is explained to me but I never manage to explain it to somebody else.  The mental health budget had an allocation of &euro;35 million this year over last year.  As much as &euro;20 million is not maintained but kept back because it is allocated to the employment of additional staff, which cannot be sourced.  Therefore, the money does not go into the budget but is brought forward into the following year.  I am sure I did not give the proper explanation but I am sure the Minister can clarify it for me.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1170" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#R00900"><p>The Chairman made a good attempt.  The first thing we must do, and I do not mean this in terms of the Chairman, is stop the debate on mental health funding being a debate on &euro;35 million.  The mental health budget for the delivery of mental health services in 2017 is &euro;851.3 million.  We have talked about the marginal figure for a large number of years.  Last year, &euro;826.6 million was spent on mental health services.  That figure is up from &euro;791 million in 2015, up from &euro;766 million in 2014, up from &euro;737 million in 2013 and up from &euro;711 million in 2012.  It is one of the few areas, and I fully support this policy, that even during very difficult years for the health budget and all budgets in this country, has consistently risen from &euro;711 million 2012 right up to &euro;851.3 million this year.</p> <p>  The Chairman is correct that there has been a policy of ring-fencing an additional &euro;35 million to spend as part of that budget each and every year.  Truthfully, if anyone looked at that figure over the past number of years, in many years it failed to be all spent in one year.  That is not due to a lack of effort on anybody's part.  As the Chairman has said, it was due to the time lags such as from the moment one decides to employ somebody, the recruitment campaign, the interview process and the taking up of the job so often the &euro;35 million was not spent.  In my first budget as Minister for Health, and the first budget for the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, who is responsible for mental health services, we have tried to be much more upfront about this matter.  We have increased the mental health budget significantly.  We will increase the mental health budget, when one considers the capital spending, by a lot more than &euro;35 million.  There is no point pretending that a sum of money will be spent.  One must tell people what one intends to do.  The total mental health budget of &euro;851.3 million will see the ring-fenced &euro;35 million spent but some of that spending will not occur, in a budgetary sense, until 2018.</p> <p>  Crucially, people in these Houses have talked about implementing the Vision for Change policy.  It is so important that we implement Vision for Change.  Every political party agrees with that.  Dealing with this not just about current spending.  There are crucial capital spending parts of the Vision for Change that have been overlooked.  If they are not delivered then one cannot implement the programme.  In addition to the &euro;35 million, of which &euro;15 million will be spent in 2017, the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and the Government will expend at least another &euro;50 million on the National Forensic Mental Health Service, which will deliver a new modern mental health facility in Portrane thus replacing the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum.  The project was granted permission in June 2015 and site preparation works were undertaken by the HSE during 2016.  In the budget discussions we got the green light to deliver the project.  Phase 1 will provide a new 120-bed hospital along with ten new child and adolescent mental health units and a new ten bed mental health intellectual disability unit.  Significant additional capital was provided in budget 2017 to progress the project this year.  A preferred bidder for the construction of the new hospital has been identified and the award of the contract process is expected to be completed very shortly.  Construction will then commence as soon as possible this year.  The new facility will open in 2019.  Phase 2 of the project will see the provision for the mental health sector of a regional intensive care rehabilitation unit.  It is important that we do these things regionally as well.</p> <p>  If the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, was here today she would make the same point as me that the totality of the mental health budget is over &euro;800 million for this year.  There is a lot more than an extra &euro;35 million being spent when people consider the full range of services of which a crucial part is capital.  There have been international reports written on how we need to replace the Central Mental Hospital in Dundrum and we will do it this year.  This is a more upfront and transparent way of telling people how the mental health budget is going to work.</p></speech>

I have been a member of a health board for a long time.  One of the things that I learned was that every crucial decision, that was imminent as of today, usually took about ten years of preparation and another ten years of procrastination when it was approved.  I congratulate the Minister and his ministerial colleagues for bringing things to a head in those areas.  They were not done as quickly as we would have all liked but they needed to be brought to a head.  There is no use talking about what is required unless we provide it because we will waste money if we continue to utilise outdated and unsuitable services in the mental health service or anywhere else for that matter.</p> <p>  There is a huge difference between the co-ordination of efforts between mental health services at community and institutional levels.  I wish to also refer to the degree to which semi-residential or day services in the community must continue to receive the degree of attention that they require, in particular the supervision of patients who require medication.  All of the problems that I have come across in recent times relate to, in some cases, the patient stubbornly refusing to accept the need for medication, refuses to take medication altogether or takes the medication when supervised but refuses to do so when not supervised.  It is a question of trying to ensure the continuity between the level and quality of services available in the residential areas and the community based areas.</p> <p>  I would like time to finish my contribution because I must go elsewhere.  I compliment the Minister and his five colleagues.  I disagree with people who say that there are too many involved in this area.  The health ministry has been identified as a poisoned chalice for some years.  I regard it more as a hot potato in the sense that it tends to burn the fingers of everyone involved.  The Department requires a combined effort under a number of headings with all hands on deck.  With luck, their endeavour will work in the long run.</p> <p>  I wish to discuss the degree to which we do not rely on health and well-being.  The topic gets more attention than heretofore.  There are many things that the children in school and everybody can do that will contribute to better health.  It is quite simple and comes in the form of dietary changes, etc.  Simple changes can save a lot of money at some stage down the road.  Unfortunately, we do not do enough in terms of health and well-being.</p> <p>  I wish to make two final points.  First, I support my colleague, Deputy Louise O'Reilly, in terms of the use of IT in the general hospital services, GP services, and the co-ordination of activity between GPs, the hospitals and consultants, etc. to a far greater extent than happens at present.  I do not know how true is the following anecdote but a man told me the other day that he could save the State billions of euro on IT, according to himself.  He is probably watching this broadcast so I had better not say anything about him.  We need to explore every opportunity as quickly as possible to provide a better service for patients, a more efficient and cost-effective service and a more responsive, quicker service that reduces the waiting lists.</p><p> We need to rely more on the ambulance service, as was referred to.  The air ambulance service must be co-ordinated and integrated with the ambulance service to a greater extent than it has been.  That is a goal we should deal with.  The equipping of ambulances is an urgent issue also.  We all come across ambulances from time to time that have seen better days.  Vintage vehicles are alright at shows but they do not do the job to the same extent.  The technology in the older vehicles cannot be available to the level required now.</p><p>  Incidental to the debate - but with an impact - is the third level education access.  I have come across cases of refugees or asylum seekers, for example, with very high IQs but because they do not have residency status in Ireland they cannot get access to third level education.  This is a sad situation.  It is not a matter for the Minister for Health but it is an issue.  There are many possible students with excellent potential who could be well used, who could make a great contribution to the health services and who would have a natural tendency to want to enter the health services - but they cannot.  I have taken this up with another Minister, as the Chairman knows.</p><p> My last point is around the palliative care residential services.  I know the Minister has visited the facility in Harold's Cross, and others I am sure, and I believe these services should be complimented for the quality of the care they provide and their understanding for the patient in very challenging circumstances.  All that can be done needs to be done in including them in the overall upgrading of services that is required.</p><p> I thank the Chairman and I apologies for speaking at length but I did my best to cover all the points I wished to raise.</p></speech>

If more money was spent on mental health as a preventative measure it would be very cost effective.  More money might be put into the campaign, "It's okay not to feel okay".  If people were to talk earlier and not bottle things up then money could be saved in the long run.  Campaigns could advise people on how diet and exercise can help with mental health.  Many of us think that diet is just for our figure, but it is very important for mental health also.  Sometimes these things need to be spelled out and if money was put into that message an overall saving could be made in the long run.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1176" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#S00300"><p>Turning to an earlier discussion I have just had to leave to take a phone call and I had a quick squint at the newspapers.  It appears that the operation for the young woman who was on "The Late Late Show", Megan Halvey-Ryan, due for 9 March, has now been cancelled as confirmed by her mother Sharon.  I wonder about the extent to which we are in a room listening to figures - and with respect, some of these figures are vague - when real life is what happens outside of here while we are all busy analysing the figures.  No amount of analysis will restore the confidence of that young woman in our health services.  She was packing her bag to come to Dublin, her mum said.  I was reading the article as I came down to the committee room in the lift.  We need to address if there is a disconnect between what is said as an aspiration and what actually happens.  I was very distressed to hear that her operation , which was due on 9 March, has now been cancelled.  This touches on what we spoke of earlier but it is what is actually happening on the aspirations and everything else.</p> <p>  With regard to the child and adolescent mental health services, does the Minster have a figure for how many children are currently in adult units, which are called inappropriate settings, and does he have a plan to get them out from those units to put them where they should be?  If the Minister does have a plan, perhaps he could identify where the costs and money for that have been allocated.  I was in Sligo on Monday and I spoke to some parents who are having first-hand dealings with the child and adolescent mental health services.  Actually, let me put that correctly - they would love to be having first-hand dealings with the child and adolescent mental health services but instead they are on lists.  They tell me also that the list has closed and effectively no new people are being added.  I note that in the report we can see the number of child and adolescent mental health services, CAMHS,  referrals seen by the mental health services where one can see this figure is about to go up or is projected to go up.  The people I spoke with last week are not even on a list.  Does the Minister have figures for how many people try to access the CAMHS service but cannot make it onto a list?  If we look at the figures for psychiatry for old age we can see figures for the percentage of accepted referrals, re-referrals, offers of first appointment, etc.  There is a lot more detail there.  I might have a view as to why there is not much detail about the CAMHS but maybe we could get that same level of detail because it would give us an accurate picture.  I can see the percentages are there in the report but we do not have actual figures for how many children are waiting, how many children are referred and not seen and how many children have not yet managed to get onto a list.</p> <p>  I try not to be, but if I may I will be just a little parochial and ask about my area.  It is my understanding from parliamentary questions I have asked that a business case for a psychologist in the north Dublin area is being put forward and that the business case has been put forward twice.  We have the fastest growing population in the State and the highest number of young people per head of population in the State, yet we cannot access a child psychologist for the CAMHS service.  This seems very wrong to me.  It goes back to the issue of staffing and the crossover with the budget, and from the figures I can see the projected increase in the children using the services.  Does the Minister have a clear sight as to how this correlates to additional staff? Perhaps he could give us a breakdown of the grades, groups and categories of staff involved, and if it is intended to purchase any services from the private sector, for how many hours and for what types of services.</p></speech>

I have the little bit of information that Our Lady's Hospital for Sick Children, Crumlin was allowed to make public by Megan's parents to the media, but I would rather not get into the detail of that other than to say that I believe a second date has been offered for this  month.  I would be happy to discuss it off-----</p></speech>

My priority has to be to put in place the plan from a policy perspective and from a HSE operational perspective that will bring waiting times for scoliosis in line with international norms.  Four months is a huge improvement on where we were at, but it is right to try to make that huge improvement because where we are at currently is not acceptable.  The new theatre will open in April and this will bring additional capacity.  There will be further capacity this summer with the recruitment of the additional consultant.  We are looking at every and any option including the option of using facilities in the UK.  I take the point and will follow up directly on the other issue after this meeting.</p> <p>  On the issue of prevention, Deputy Murphy O'Mahony is right in that we must meet the challenge as it arises, but we must also look at how we can empower people, especially our young people to have the resilience skills that we all need to mind our own mental health.  This is the point.  We all have mental health that we need to protect, just like our physical health and well-being.  My colleague, the Minister of State, Deputy Helen McEntee, is doing good work with the youth mental health task force.</p><p>There are some really good people involved in that group.  It is due to report relatively shortly.  It commenced in September.  It is chaired by the Minister of State, Deputy McEntee, and it is working to develop action plans for the age groups from zero to 12 years, 13 to 18 years and 19 to 25 years, and for parents and what are referred to as "noticers".  It is being supported in its work by a series of youth consultations to ensure that it is a plan, not of politicians telling young people but that is owned by the young people of Ireland.  We see brilliant work being done, both in schools, above and beyond what they are required or asked to do, and by people in their communities as well.  It is about trying to empower all of that.  I agree with the Deputy in that regard.</p><p> In relation to the CAMHS services, on page 25 of my Department's briefing, as distinct from the committee's, there are some figures Deputy Louise O'Reilly is looking for on the number of CAMHS referrals, as opposed to the percentage.</p></speech>

In fairness, I do not have the outturn but that is because it is not available yet.  I will get the Deputy the outturn figure as soon as it is available.  The target for this year, in terms of actual persons as opposed to percentages, is 14,365.  Seventy-two per cent will be seen within 12 weeks or three months of being referred for an appointment.</p> <p>  On the important issue of the psychologist post, I will ask the HSE to update the Deputy directly on the position.  For the breakdown of public versus private grades, and the same breakdown the Deputy is looking for across the other areas, I will update the Deputy directly through the HSE.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1183" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1275" speakername="Michael Harty" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#T00400"><p>Before we conclude, I want to raise two points regarding mental health.  The incidence of suicide in Ireland is frightening.  It is in excess of 500 a year and almost two and half times that of deaths in road traffic accidents.  In relation to what Deputy Louise O'Reilly said, the lack of talk therapy treatments is a issue not only in Dublin but right throughout the country.  In my area, we have not had a psychologist for two and a half years.  There is a significant gap in supplying talk therapy.  Mental health is not merely the prescription of drugs.  It is talking and communicating with people, particularly young men, which group has the highest incidence of suicide in Ireland.  It is important that issue is addressed.  There are many voluntary organisations providing mental health services, particularly in respect of suicide, and they are crying out for funding or for the appointment of psychologists and therapists.</p> <p>  Lastly, on health and well-being, the graphic refers specifically to vaccination and I will concentrate on that.  There is a vaccine which is in serious trouble, that is, the HPV vaccine for the prevention of cervical cancer.  The HPV vaccine could possibly reduce the incidence of cervical cancer, which is associated with the HPV virus that is implicated in 70% of cervical cancers.  The uptake of that vaccination programme has dropped to less than 50%.  There is a lot of adverse publicity regarding the vaccine.  The only way to address this is to address the parents and the young girls who feel they have been affected by the vaccine.  Otherwise, the vaccine uptake will decline further.  The Minister might comment on those two issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-03-02a.1184" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1251" speakername="Simon Harris" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HES2017030200002#T00500"><p>I take the point the Chairman makes in respect of suicide, the huge amount of work that we have to do and his own interest in this issue.  I will continue to work with the Chairman and the committee in this regard.</p> <p>  I am pleased that the Chairman raised the issue of the HPV vaccine, which is something that we have discussed at the committee previously.  The focus for 2017 is to counter misinformation on the safety of this vaccine and to increase the uptake rate in girls, as part of the schools immunisation programme.  The immunisation programme in Ireland is based on the advice of the national immunisation advisory committee, which is a committee of the Royal College of Physicians of Ireland that comprises of experts in a number of specialties, including infectious diseases, paediatrics and public health.  The committee's recommendations are informed by public health advice and by international best practice.  In 2009, that committee recommended the HPV vaccination for all 12 year old girls to reduce their risk of cervical cancer and in September 2010, as the committee members will remember, the HPV vaccination programme was introduced for all girls in first year of second-level schools.</p> <p>  There are two licensed HPV vaccines available in Ireland.  Gardasil is the vaccine used by the HSE in the school immunisation programme and it is provided free of charge for girls in first year of second-level school.  In September 2011, there was a catch-up programme started for all girls in second-level school and the 2013-2014 campaign was the final year of this programme.</p> <p>  The Department is aware of claims of an association between this vaccine and a number of conditions experienced by groups of young women.  More than 100 million people have been vaccinated with HPV vaccines worldwide.  In Ireland, more than 220,000 girls have been vaccinated.  The HPV vaccine safety has been monitored for more than ten years, not only here in Ireland but by many international bodies, including the European Medicines Agency and the World Health Organization.</p> <p>  An illness that occurs around the time the vaccine is given and is already known to be common in adolescence does not imply, according to the medical advice available to me, that the vaccine caused the problem.  As there is no scientific evidence that the vaccine causes any long-term illness, the HPV vaccine cannot be held responsible for such illnesses.  It appears that some girls first suffered symptoms around the time they received the HPV vaccine and, understandably, some parents have connected the vaccine to their daughter's condition but there is no medical or scientific evidence to suggest that available to me, the Department, the European Medicines Agency or the World Health Organization.</p> <p>  Any person suffering ill health is eligible to seek medical attention and access appropriate health services, irrespective of the cause of the person's symptoms, and the families of any girl suffering symptoms following the HPV vaccine are advised to seek medical advice from their family doctor in the normal manner and be referred to consultants familiar with these syndromes for diagnosis and management, if their GP believes that is appropriate.  The individual nature of the needs of some children may require access to specialist services and the HSE is currently working to put in place a clinical care pathway appropriate to the medical needs of this group.</p> <p>  I cannot stress strongly enough that all medical advice available to us is that this vaccine is absolutely safe.  That is international.  Some 100 million people have been vaccinated.  It saves lives from cervical cancers.  Each year 300 women in this country alone are diagnosed with cervical cancer and 100 women die each year in this country from this disease.  All cervical cancers are linked to high-risk HPV types and this is a vaccine that will save women's lives.  In 2017, it is our intention, the HSE's intention and the intention of a number of strong advocacy groups to debunk the myth about this and to try to get the vaccination rate increased.  As I say, families who believe their daughters are experiencing a medical condition that we believe is not in any way linked should seek medical advice from their GP in the first instance and a consultant where appropriate.</p> <p>  Can I raise one other matter, Chairman, if that is appropriate?</p></speech>

I am conscious that there is a lot of information, and, I worry, some misinformation, out there with regard to my function as Minister for Health.  In recent days, I have read information and received messages from people asking that I merely sign an application and make medicinal cannabis available to a named patient.  I am not going to discuss individual cases at this committee.</p> <p>  For the information of the committee, however, which will further consider the issue and has a timetable to do so, no licence has been granted by my Department for the provision of medicinal cannabis to any child without the recommendation or support of a consultant to oversee that.  There is no application currently in my Department with a paediatric consultant recommending medicinal cannabis and the Chief Medical Officer, who unlike me is a doctor, has informed me that I cannot grant a licence without that.  Every child with a condition such as epilepsy is under the care of a consultant and if that consultant or any consultant believes it is appropriate that a child should access any medication, including medicinal cannabis, and the licence is applied for, it will be dealt with as a priority and will be made available.</p> <p>  I believe we should change the law in relation to medicinal cannabis.  That is why I commissioned the Health Products Regulatory Authority, HPRA, report in November.  That is why it reported to us at the end of January.  It is why this committee has it and will consider it.  That is thanks to the work of Vera Twomey and a number of other brave courageous advocates.</p> <p>  However, I need to be clear in relation to the HPRA report.  The HPRA report's recommendations state one could set up a compassionate access programme for three conditions but that the supply of medicinal cannabis would still need to be on the recommendation of a consultant.  I want people to be clear.  On the idea that I have a form that I can merely sign to end somebody's suffering, of course, if that was the case I would do it.</p></speech>

Without breaching confidentiality, the licence was supported by a paediatric neurologist.</p></speech>

I appreciate if it was a case of signing the form it would have been signed and we would not be having this conversation.  I do not ask the questions for anything other than information.  Must the person who signs off on it be in Ireland in the Twenty-six Counties?</p></speech>

The Chairman will know better than any of us that when any drug is provided, how it interacts with the patient's overall condition and other medication and its dosage need to be monitored by somebody caring for the patient.  It is correct to state that in the past people went abroad and received treatment.  The treatment abroad scheme does not cover countries outside Europe but in the past some people by their own manner or means went abroad and obtained treatment and then sought permission to bring the treatment home, but they still required a consultant in this country.  There was a case where a consultant in this country stated a named patient required the medication the person wished to bring here.  This is the point we need to get to.</p> <p>  I hope the establishment of a compassionate access programme, which is not just about changing the law but also about informing and involving clinicians, would increase the number of clinicians with an interest in this area and provide greater monitoring, clarity and data for medicinal cannabis.  I spoke to Deputy O'Reilly's colleague and my ministerial counterpart, Michelle O'Neill, MLA, who is interested in looking at what we have done here with regard to the North.  There is much work to do in the area but it simply is not correct to suggest any politician can sign this when no medical consultant is stating to do so.</p></speech>
