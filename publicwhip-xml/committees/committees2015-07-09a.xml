A key objective for NAMA in its management and ultimate disposal of the assets is to maximise the return to the State.</p> <p>  The financial statements for 2014 received a clear audit report, which issued on 29 April 2015.  Without qualifying my audit opinion, I have drawn attention to note 2.1 in the financial statements.  This describes NAMA&rsquo;s main funding source, which is in the form of short-term borrowing, with a Government guarantee.  The note explains the basis on which the board is satisfied that it was appropriate to prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis.</p> <p>  Some of the key financial highlights for 2014 are that NAMA generated a profit, after impairment, of &euro;458 million; interest on loans recognised in the year amounted to &euro;950 million; around &euro;7.6 billion was raised in 2014 from asset sales, which were divided between sales of loan assets amounting to &euro;3.4 billion and sales of underlying collateral amounting to &euro;4.2 billion; the 2014 impairment charge was &euro;137 million; the total accumulated impairment charge to end 2014 was &euro;3.5 billion, reflecting the deterioration in NAMA&rsquo;s expectation of total loan asset cashflows relative to the value of the remaining loans when they were taken on; the carrying value of loans and receivables at end 2014 was &euro;16.9 billion, before impairment; and by end 2014, NAMA had redeemed &euro;16.6 billion of its initial borrowing.</p> <p>  The largest single disposal of loan assets undertaken by NAMA since its establishment was in relation to a bundle of debtor connection portfolios disposed of in 2014.  The disposal was code named Project Eagle, and involved the bundling of the loans of all 55 debtor connections based in Northern Ireland.  The loans were secured by around 900 property assets and around 68% of the properties were located in Northern Ireland itself, 18% in the rest of Ireland, 12% in Great Britain and 2% elsewhere.</p> <p>  We have drawn up a figure, now on screen, to try to summarise the Project Eagle transaction.  At the time the loan bundle was sold, the par value of the loans, which is the amount the borrowers collectively owed NAMA, amounted to a total of around &euro;5.7 billion.  The carrying value of the loans before impairment was just under &euro;2.2 billion.  The difference of &euro;3.5 billion, or 61% of the par value, is accounted for mainly by the discount in the price paid by NAMA to the relevant banks when it acquired the loans in the bundle.</p> <p>  Much of the Project Eagle borrowing was in sterling and the sale was in sterling.  All the values, as presented in the figures on screen, are in euros, which is how they are accounted for in the NAMA accounts.  When the bundle of loans was sold, and after payment of disposal costs, NAMA received net proceeds from the sale amounting to just under &euro;1.4 billion.  As a result, the total loss on disposal was around &euro;783 million.  This was made up of impairment provisions previously booked amounting to &euro;572 million that crystallised when the sale went through plus a further loss of &euro;211 million incurred on disposal.</p> <p>  Under section 226 of the National Asset Management Agency Act, I am required every three years to carry out a review of the progress NAMA has made towards achieving its overall objectives.  Members will recall that the first report related to the period up to the end of 2012, which the committee examined last May or so.  The next report will cover NAMA&rsquo;s progress up to the end of 2015.  I reported in the first report on loan sales by NAMA up to the end of 2012.  Our analysis indicated that those sales resulted in NAMA securing net proceeds of &euro;1.4 billion.  Unlike Project Eagle, those disposals, taken together, resulted in a gain for NAMA of around &euro;112 million over and above the carrying value of the loans.  </p> <p>  Members may recall that, in the report, I recommended the NAMA board set an overall target rate of return and targets for the overall rates of return on disposals and on property that NAMA decides to hold and-or invest in.  These are the kinds of benchmarks commonly used by investors to guide investment and divestment decisions.  However, NAMA disagreed on the relevance of such measures for its business, on the basis that they would act as an unnecessary constraint on its flexibility, given the imperative that it be open to commercially sensible disposal opportunities when they arise.</p> <p>  I previously indicated to the committee that, when preparing the next section 226 report, I intended to look in detail at a sample of NAMA disposals and a sample of properties held by it for investment.  Given the scale of the loss incurred on the Project Eagle disposal, it was and remains my intention to examine that disposal further in the course of that work.  As I mentioned here a couple of weeks ago, planning work on the section 226 examination has commenced.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.25" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Frank Daly" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015070900002#B01300"><p>I thank the chairman and wish him and the Deputies a good morning.  The committee has invited us today to outline the background to the sale of the loans of Northern Ireland debtors, Project Eagle, and the process which was followed by NAMA in securing the sale.  We welcome the opportunity to put the facts on the record, that is, the fact as they are known to us.  In so far as there may have been some wrongdoing on the part of certain individuals at the periphery of the transaction in Northern Ireland - individuals who acted as advisers to potential purchasers - we are not in a position to comment as we have no knowledge of what may have taken place.  The facts, as they pertain to those individuals and their activities, are a matter for authorities in Northern Ireland to establish.  I note that in the past 24 hours, the PSNI has indicated it would be looking at that aspect of this issue.</p> <p>  However, in view of the very extensive commentary around this issue in recent days, which has conflated alleged wrongdoing involving individuals in Northern Ireland with the sale by NAMA of Project Eagle, I wish at the outset today to make four points very clear.  The NAMA sale process for Project Eagle was robust, competitive, and competitive right to the end, and secured the best outcome for the Irish taxpayer.  When NAMA became aware of a concern surrounding the participation of one of the bidders for Project Eagle, we immediately, and without hesitation, took steps to ensure that bidder withdrew from the process.  The third point is that no pressure from any source, political or otherwise, influenced NAMA in regard to the decision to sell the loans of Northern Ireland debtors or the decision to accept the winning bid from Cerberus.  The fourth point is that if a payment did find its way to an account in the Isle of Man, as has been alleged, then wherever such a payment came from, it most certainly did not come from NAMA or from proceeds due to NAMA under this sale.  In fact, NAMA had no knowledge of this alleged payment to Mr. Coulter by Brown Rudnick until recent days when it was put into the public domain.</p><p>I will outline the sequence of events in this sale.  As chairman both of the NAMA board and, since October 2011, the Northern Ireland advisory committee, I feel I am well placed to outline this sequence of events that led to the sale of the Project Eagle portfolio.  We first became aware of investor interest in purchasing the portfolio after the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, passed to us a letter he had received from the Northern Ireland Minister for Finance and Personnel, Mr. Sammy Wilson, on 24 June 2013.  Mr. Wilson enclosed a copy of a letter, of the same date, that he had received from a law firm, Brown Rudnick, in which Brown Rudnick indicated that clients of the company were interested in acquiring the Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  In his reply on 25 July 2013, and after his Department had consulted with us, the Minister, Deputy Noonan, pointed out to Mr. Wilson that parties interested in acquiring NAMA loans or assets securing NAMA loans should make direct contact with NAMA.  The Minister, Deputy Noonan, also drew attention to NAMA's policy that loan and asset sales should be openly marketed and he furthermore pointed out that NAMA did not favour granting exclusive access to any potential purchaser as that would militate against achieving optimal value for the assets concerned.  I understand that the Department of Finance proposes to circulate copies of the Minister&rsquo;s correspondence with Mr. Wilson.<br/><br/>In September 2013, Brown Rudnick made an unsolicited approach to NAMA and indicated that one of its clients, PIMCO, was interested in acquiring NAMA's Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  In its subsequent engagement with NAMA, PIMCO indicated a preference for a closed transaction, which did not involve open marketing of the portfolio.  The board agreed that senior NAMA staff should engage further with PIMCO but with a view ultimately to completing an openly marketed loan sale in line with board policy.  On 4 December 2013, PIMCO submitted a bid expressed in terms of a price range with the final price to be determined after due diligence.  PIMCO indicated that its preference remained that the sale would be a closed transaction.<br/><br/>At a meeting on 12 December 2013, the NAMA board decided that the portfolio should be openly marketed as part of a competitive process; the board also set a minimum price below which it would not be willing to proceed with a sale.  This minimum price reflected NAMA's valuation of the underlying assets.  At a further meeting on 8 January 2014, the board approved the appointment of Lazard to advise NAMA on the appropriate marketing approach and to oversee the sales process.  It was envisaged that this would involve marketing to suitable targeted bidders who would have the financial wherewithal to submit credible bids on the portfolio.  On 17 January 2014, NAMA received from the principal private secretary to the Northern Ireland First Minister a copy of a &quot;letter of intent&quot; relating to the proposed management of the Northern Ireland portfolio.  The letter appeared to summarise an agreement between PIMCO and the Northern Ireland Executive and its purpose was to require the purchaser of the portfolio to enter into a memorandum of understanding with the government of Northern Ireland, confirming certain fundamental conditions relating to the future management of the portfolio.  NAMA did not engage further in regard to the draft letter.  I understand the draft letter of intent is also being released today.<br/><br/>On 10 March 2014, PIMCO informed NAMA that its compliance staff had discovered that PIMCO&rsquo;s proposed fee arrangement with Brown Rudnick included also the payment of fees to Tughans, a Belfast law firm, and to a former external member of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland advisory committee.  PIMCO named that individual as Mr. Frank Cushnahan.  Our understanding was that PIMCO and Brown Rudnick had been engaging since September 2013, and possibly earlier, but it appears that its compliance staff only became aware of the &quot;fee-sharing&quot; arrangement in early March 2014.  It is not clear to us whether this late discovery arose because of internal communications issues within PIMCO or between PIMCO and Brown Rudnick.<br/><br/>A special meeting of the NAMA board was convened on 11 March 2014, the following day.  The board viewed PIMCO's disclosure as a very serious development and it considered the most appropriate course of action.  Whereas the former Northern Ireland advisory committee member was no longer a member of the committee at the time of the disclosure - he had resigned on 8 November 2013 - and never had access to confidential information, the board considered that the proposed fee arrangement could undermine the integrity of the sales process.  The board decided that if PIMCO did not withdraw, NAMA could not permit it to remain in the sales process.  On 12 March 2014, NAMA indicated its serious concerns to PIMCO about the proposed fee arrangement to the former member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee.  On 13 March 2014, PIMCO informed NAMA that it would withdraw from the Project Eagle process.  I understand that in recent days PIMCO has disputed the facts as outlined above and suggested that its withdrawal from the sales process was voluntary.  I do not propose to enter into a debate with PIMCO as to the meaning of the word &quot;voluntary&quot;.  Suffice it to say that it was left in no doubt that if the withdrawal was not voluntary, it would have to be involuntary.<br/><br/>Lazard engaged with a total of nine potential purchasers, including PIMCO, during the first quarter of 2014 and, at the end of the process, the best bid from the two remaining bidders was received from Cerberus.  I say in response to some insinuation in the past few days that the other remaining bid was not from PIMCO.  The Cerberus bid was accepted by the board on 3 April and announced on 4 April 2014.  The transaction was completed in June 2014.<br/><br/>For the avoidance of doubt, no fee payment was made by NAMA to Brown Rudnick.  NAMA had very limited engagement with Tughans on this sale and did not instruct Tughans to advise it on any aspect of the sale.  Fees totalling &euro;7,839 were paid to Tughans as payment for delivery of title documents and assistance with due diligence queries.  NAMA's legal adviser on Project Eagle was Hogan Lovells.<br/><br/>Cerberus has stated that it made a fee payment to Brown Rudnick and that Brown Rudnick advised that the fee would be shared with Tughans.  Cerberus state that this was payment for strategic advice relating to the sales process and for work that Brown Rudnick and Tughans had already carried out on the portfolio.  From NAMA's perspective, there would have been no reason to question why a purchaser of a loan portfolio would have been making payments to two law firms.  What did concern us, based on PIMCO's disclosure, was the possibility that a payment would have been made to a former member of the Norther Ireland advisory committee.  We sought and received written confirmation from Cerberus at the time that no fees were paid to any party with a connection to NAMA.  Cerberus confirmed the position as follows:</p><blockquote>We confirm that no fee, commission or other remuneration or payment is payable to any current or former member of the board of the National Asset Management Agency (NAMA), any current or former member of the executive of NAMA or any current or former member of an advisory committee of NAMA in connection with any aspect of our participation in the Project Eagle sales process. </blockquote><p>I am confident that the NAMA board acted quickly and decisively and took every measure available to it to protect the integrity of the sales process as soon as the proposed fee arrangement came to light.<br/><br/>Tughans, in its recent statement, indicated &quot;that a former partner diverted to an account of which he was the sole beneficiary professional fees due to the firm without the knowledge of the partners&quot;.  Tughans also confirmed that the individual in question no longer works for the firm and that the company has &quot;reported the circumstances of the departure of the former partner to the Law Society&quot;.  These disclosures by Tughans are a matter for that company and they had no impact on the competitive sales process run on behalf of NAMA.  If there are suggestions that there was wrongdoing by certain parties, it is a matter for the Northern Ireland authorities to investigate them.  Given the facts as outlined above, it would be entirely wrong and dishonest to conflate NAMA's process with the unrelated Tughans issue.<br/><br/>I will outline the role played by the Northern Ireland advisory committee with regard to NAMA's activities in Northern Ireland.  NAMA has four statutory committees &ndash; the audit committee, the credit committee, the finance and operating committee and the risk management committee - established under section 32 of the NAMA Act.  Section 33 of the Act provides that the board may establish such advisory committees as it considers necessary or desirable to advise it in the performance of its functions.</p><p>The NAMA board established two such committees, the planning advisory committee and the Northern Ireland advisory committee, the NIAC.  The latter was established in 2010 at the suggestion of the late Minister for Finance, Mr. Brian Lenihan.  The Minister felt the committee would be useful in advising the board on the strategy for Northern Ireland assets.  Following consultation with the Minister, who in turn I understand had consulted the Northern Ireland Executive, the NAMA board decided in May 2010 to appoint Mr. Brian Rowntree and Mr. Frank Cushnahan to the NIAC.  From 2010 to 2011, the NIAC was chaired by Mr. Peter Stewart, who was a member of the board of NAMA.  After Mr. Stewart's resignation from the board and from the NIAC in October 2011, I became chairman of the committee until its dissolution in September 2014.</p><p> I would like to clarify a few points regarding the role of the NIAC.  Its role was to advise on the broad economic and social context in Northern Ireland in which NAMA was operating and on the overall state of the property market.  The NIAC had no role in relation to NAMA debtors or the assets securing their loans.  No discussion of particular debtors or particular assets was permitted at NIAC meetings.  No specific information relating to debtors or assets was ever provided to external members of the NIAC and the NIAC had no decision-making powers.  I am aware a former member of the NIAC, Mr. Brian Rowntree, has said in recent days that the NIAC was "kept in the dark" about the Project Eagle transaction.  I agree.  While the committee was informed at its meeting on 7 October 2013 that PIMCO had made an unsolicited approach to purchase the portfolio, it was made clear that key information and decisions relating to the portfolio were matters for the board of NAMA only.  For the avoidance of any doubt, therefore, it is important to point out that external members of the NIAC did not have access to any information about the portfolio that would have been of value to a potential bidder.  The board took the view for reasons that Mr. Brendan McDonagh will outline later that the best commercial option was to sell the portfolio on the basis that there was a limited prospect over a medium-term horizon of a significant improvement in values.</p><p> The sale of the Project Eagle portfolio received a broad welcome when it was first announced.  The extent to which the sale has acted and may continue to act as a catalyst to stimulate activity in the Northern Ireland property market and in the economy more generally is to be welcomed.  I am confident that the transaction will ultimately be seen as benefiting Northern Ireland and the taxpayers in the Republic.  We have no difficulty in discussing NAMA's commercial rationale for the sale.  All documents and records relating to the sale of Project Eagle were available to the Comptroller and Auditor General as part of his audit of the 2014 financial statements.  We are aware that, as required by the NAMA Act, he is planning to initiate his second section 226 triennial review of NAMA, covering the 2012-15 period, over the coming months.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has confirmed this plan this morning.  He has also confirmed my assumption that this transaction will be one of those assessed as part of that review.  On behalf of NAMA, I welcome the Comptroller and Auditor General's forthcoming review.  I am confident it will show that we have acted commercially and properly.  Regardless of the commercial aspects of this sale, we take great exception to any suggestion that anyone representing NAMA - a current or former board member, or a current or former member of staff - was engaged in wrongdoing.  I reiterate that if there has been wrongdoing at the periphery of this transaction in Northern Ireland, it has nothing to do with NAMA.  In the absence of any evidence to the contrary, it is wrong and dishonest to claim otherwise.</p><p> I have read my statement as it was submitted to the committee.  Before I conclude, I wish to make three short points about the coverage of this issue over the past 24 hours.  First, there is no PSNI investigation of the sale of these loans by NAMA.  The PSNI is investigating activities relating to the purchase of these assets, rather than their sale.  That is a critical distinction.  Second, there is no truth in the suggestion that &euro;7 million of the sales proceeds of this transaction ended up in an Isle of Man account.  NAMA received the full proceeds from this sale.  The origin of that &euro;7 million is not NAMA.  There has been no suggestion that NAMA is the origin.  Many media outlets are continuing to make this error.  Third, it has been mistakenly claimed in the media that NAMA sold assets that were valued or worth approximately &euro;5 billion for approximately &euro;1.5 billion.  Again, this is simply wrong.  It is a very serious error.  NAMA sold the assets for exactly what they were worth and not a cent less.  The assets may or may not have been worth more years earlier.  We will go into that in more detail later.  The fall in their value resulted from the property crash.  They were not worth anything more than the price achieved by NAMA when it sold them for &euro;1.5 billion.  Such errors are damaging NAMA and are misleading.  I just wanted to put that on the record at the end of my statement.</p></speech>

The board approved the sale because it took the view in early 2014 that it represented the best financial outcome for Irish taxpayers, taking a range of factors into account.  The key point about the Eagle portfolio is the fact that five Irish banks advanced &pound;4.5 billion to Northern Ireland-based debtors for property which subsequently lost over two thirds of its value.</p> <p>  Taking into account the Northern Ireland asset mix securing NAMA loans, we estimate that prices fell by over 50% from peak to the end of 2013.  Lending by Irish banks to Northern Ireland debtors appears to have been particularly risky.  Some 44% of the assets by number in the Eagle portfolio were land and development properties which were severely affected by the collapse in commercial and residential prices.  Another 26% by number were residential assets.  There was also a heavy concentration of lending secured by assets in regional UK which did not benefit from the strong recovery experienced in London after 2009.  That element of the decline in asset values in Northern Ireland and regional locations in Britain which happened prior to November 2009 was reflected in the discounts applied when NAMA acquired the portfolio from the banks.  The further decline in prices which took place after 2009, however, had to be absorbed by NAMA and, as was prudent, it took appropriate impairment provisions against the loans of Northern Ireland debtor connections which were fully reflected in each year&rsquo;s audited financial statements by the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p> <p>  In accordance with international financial reporting standards, NAMA must recognise impairment in its financial statements, to the extent that it arises, in each accounting period.  Cumulatively, the write-down against Northern Ireland debtor connections totalled &euro;800 million between 2010 and 2014 and would mainly have reflected falling collateral values.  The provisions were included in successive financial statements from 2010 onwards.  They included a closing write-down of over &euro;200 million which was recognised in the 2014 financial statements.  Clearly, it was fully understood by the NAMA board and the executive that the impairment taken on this portfolio, while substantial, reflected poor lending decisions by the Irish banks in advancing &pound;4.5 billion for the purchase of assets which were generally of mediocre or poor quality and which were seriously affected by the economic downturn primarily in Northern Ireland and regional UK.</p> <p>  In overall cash terms, taking into account disposal proceeds, non-disposal income, advances and the proceeds of the loan sale, the net cash loss to NAMA, in layman&rsquo;s terms, on the Northern Ireland portfolio was about &euro;280 million.  In January 2014 the board approved the sale of the Northern Ireland portfolio by reference to a minimum sale price of &pound;1.3 billion.  This reflected our valuation of the underlying assets.  For a range of reasons which I will outline, the board&rsquo;s view was that NAMA could struggle to achieve this amount if we were to manage the loans over a seven-year period to 2020, bearing in mind the size of the Northern Ireland economy.  The minimum sale price was adjusted to &pound;1.24 billion by early April 2014 to reflect asset disposals which had taken place in the intervening period between the launch of the loan sale and the closing.  The associated cash proceeds from these sales, however, were received by NAMA.</p> <p>  Lazard, appointed by NAMA in January 2014 to oversee and advise it on the loan sale, confirmed to the board that the sales and marketing process was appropriate, given the nature and scale of the transaction and given NAMA&rsquo;s objective of maximising the recovery to Irish taxpayers.  Lazard also stated in a closing transaction letter to the board that &ldquo;sufficient competitive tension remained in the process&rdquo; following the withdrawal of PIMCO and, having reviewed the remaining two bids, it recommended moving forward solely with Cerberus with a view to executing the loan sale agreement on agreed terms and at the agreed price.</p> <p>  In terms of the rationale for the sale, there were a number of reasons the board took the view that the sale of the portfolio represented the best commercial option for NAMA.  From 2010 to 2013, there had been relatively few sales of properties in the Northern Ireland portfolio and there had been little or no investor interest in acquiring either Northern Ireland assets or the associated loans.  The total volume of investment activity in Northern Ireland is estimated only to have been &euro;75 million in 2012 and &euro;175 million in 2013.  Absorption capacity was a key strategic concern of the NAMA board, given that over 50% of the portfolio was based in Northern Ireland.  The asset portfolio securing NAMA loans was very granular and had few major assets which might have been of interest to purchasers if we had decided to proceed to sell the assets on an asset by asset basis.  That granularity is illustrated by the fact that, as of November 2013, only 2% of the properties had an acquisition value in excess of &pound;20 million and many of these were in regional locations in the United Kingdom.  Some 81% of the properties by number had an acquisition value of less than &pound;2 million.  Some 70% of the properties by number were categorised either as residential or land and development assets and the average acquisition value per asset in this group was about &pound;800,000.</p> <p>  The appendix to the paper provides a breakdown by value of the portfolio as it was at the point of sale.  As mentioned, most of the assets securing the portfolio declined substantially in value between our reference acquisition date in November 2009 and late 2013.  It was clear that realising even the carrying value of a portfolio secured by so many small assets was going to be a long and difficult process.  The medium-term outlook for the Northern Ireland economy was uncertain and it was clear to us, even if there was to be a sustained recovery in the years ahead, that the assets securing our loans would have been slow to benefit from such a recovery.  In other words, in the event of a sustained recovery, the larger commercial income producing assets would be the first to gain and that it would be some time before the impact of recovery would percolate down to smaller assets.  The Project Eagle portfolio included 36 smaller debtor connections that were managed by NAMA&rsquo;s participating institutions.  Many of these connections had little or no property management platform or capability and it was likely, in the board&rsquo;s view, that the work-out process would be protracted and costly and that there was no certainty that it would have yielded a superior commercial outcome to the loan sale.  A loan sale would eliminate the risks, uncertainties and costs associated with a protracted work-out of the Northern Ireland portfolio which had limited capacity to appreciate in value over a medium-term horizon.</p> <p>  The board and the executive also considered the impact of a potential Eagle sale on our ability to manage the rest of our portfolio.  From a risk management perspective, the sale of the Eagle portfolio would help to de-risk the overall portfolio by removing a heavy concentration of assets in markets with significant liquidity challenges and where recovery was likely to lag behind other major markets.  It would also free up our resources to focus more on the portfolio of assets in the Republic of Ireland and London where, in our view, asset management work and effort would yield better results.</p> <p>  For all these reasons, we made a decision that the best return we could generate from the portfolio would be from a loan sale.  This assumed that we could achieve a price that matched our expectations as to what the portfolio should realise, based on the information available to us.  As a commercial entity, decisions to sell or hold assets are ones we are required to make all the time.  All of our decisions are based on the best available information at the time a decision is taken.</p> <p>  In terms of the loan sales process in general adopted by NAMA, the key consideration for NAMA in any loan sale process is that all interested parties are given the opportunity to bid and that all bidders are treated equally and fairly.  We insist on the open marketing of loans through experienced loan sales advisers.  We set clear ground rules at the start of each loan sale.  Everybody knows the rules.  We ensure all bidders are given access to the same information at the same time, including all loan agreements, security and title information, data tapes, lease information and tenancy schedules.  We evaluate all bids on the same basis.  We execute our loan sales to best practice international standards.  This is recognised in the global loan sales market where NAMA enjoys a strong reputation for the quality of information provided in our data rooms and for the transparent and the professional manner in which all loan sale transactions have been completed to date.</p> <p>  To conclude, I reiterate a number of important points.  The commercial decision taken by the NAMA board to dispose of the Northern Ireland loan portfolio was the correct one.  The board took the view that this option would provide the best financial outcome for Irish taxpayers, taking into account the quality of assets in the portfolio, the lack of liquidity in the Northern Ireland property market, the availability of a number of investors to bid competitively on the size of the portfolio and NAMA&rsquo;s need to focus on its assets in the Republic of Ireland and London, which were more likely to benefit from intensive asset management attention.  The sale was conducted in line with best international practice and all bidders had access to the same detailed information on the portfolio.  We took care at all stages to ensure the integrity of the sales process was fully protected and the NAMA board acted quickly and decisively as soon as the proposed fee arrangement to a former NIAC member came to light.</p> <p>  Lazard advised on and recommended the outcome of the Eagle sales process to the board.  I am satisfied, from a commercial perspective, that the transaction would stand up to rigorous scrutiny by any independent assessor.  I am also satisfied that there has been no wrongdoing on the part of any current or former member of the NAMA board or NAMA staff.  It is entirely unfair that there has been an attempt to besmirch NAMA&rsquo;s reputation on the basis of the alleged behaviour of certain individuals in Northern Ireland who were at the periphery of the transaction and advising potential purchasers, not NAMA.</p> <p>  I thank members for their attention.  We can respond on any issue they may wish to address.</p></speech>

The memorandum of understanding originated from a call between Ronnie Hanna, the Minister, Minister Robinson's office and me regarding the sales process.  Minister Robinson indicated that he had concerns about how NAMA, or any owner of the Northern Ireland loans, would manage these loans in the interests of the Northern Ireland economy, which was understandable.  He indicated that he would seek to put such a letter of intent, or MOU, in place with potential bidders.  We advised him that it would be wise to send it to NAMA for its information and identified Ronnie as the appropriate person to send it to.</p></speech>

Out of curiosity I would have been inclined to look at who would benefit.  I understand it was the borrowers, in the first instance, but was there any other reason?  I may just be suspicious that this would have been the case because everyone was being released from their obligations.  Was it put forward for any other reason and did NAMA examine why it was being suggested?  Was it just an honest effort to free everyone or were there individuals who might benefit and would have been well placed insiders, as they are often described?</p></speech>

No one present is alleging what could be called wrongdoing in a criminal or other sense by NAMA.  There is no attempt to pin that on NAMA.  Anyone who has tried to do so is wrong.  However, this may be the most extraordinary sequence of events in a deal that I have ever come across in a State body.  Having read about the unorthodox approach to Mr. Sammy Wilson before the matter was passed on to the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, who then passed it on to NAMA, and the other sequence of events that is peculiar all the way through, with Tughans and Brown Rudnick acting for both parties and the fact that NAMA discovered in the middle of the bidding process that there was a fundamental difficulty, I wonder why NAMA did not call off the sale.</p></speech>

Some of this is extraordinary.  From our point of view, the most important aspect is the action that we took as a consequence of those events.  As to the Deputy's question on why we did not call off the sale, it is not that we did not discuss doing so.  A number of factors were in place.  Lazard was advising us on the sale process.  Once PIMCO was out, that removed from the process the taint of the possibility of something being wrong - I must be careful - in respect of a former member of the Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC.  That was our great concern.</p> <p>  Bidders were still in the process at that stage.</p></speech>

There were two remaining, but there had been nine.  That would not have been unusual.  One might start with eight or nine bidders and whittle them down to the two or three who are really interested.  At that stage, there were still two.  We wanted Lazard to give us an assurance that there was still genuine competitive tension, which it did unequivocally.  There was competitive tension, we were still of the view that we would get the best price possible and we went down that road.  Cerberus emerged on top and we had a disappointed underbidder, which is always good to have in a process.</p></speech>

Its rationale, which it explained to us, was that Brown Rudnick and Tughans had done a great deal of due diligence work for PIMCO, so it made commercial sense for it to avail of that work.  I do not know, but I presume that this may have been reflected in the price or cost that Cerberus eventually paid to Brown Rudnick.</p> <p>  There is another point about why we continued with the sale.  We were still getting from Cerberus a figure that was in excess of our minimum price for Project Eagle.  With Cerberus, there was competitive price tension even during the period after the deal was agreed and the money was paid when it was trying to knock us back for technical reasons, which we resisted.  We got the full price.</p> <p>  There was another reason for continuing.  If one went through a sales process in respect of what was, as Mr. McDonagh outlined, a troubled portfolio that was hard to shift, one might abort it at the last minute for genuine reasons, but one would not want to do so because whatever prospect there was of getting a good price for it would certainly lessen after taking it off the market and starting all over again, as people out there would know that one was having difficulties.</p></speech>

PIMCO approached us on 10 March 2014.  It told us that it was using Brown Rudnick as its adviser, that Brown Rudnick had a subcontractual arrangement with Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan and that it presumed we were aware of that.  We said that we were not aware of it.  For the record, we have no issue with Brown Rudnick or Tughans.  They are reputable law firms.  We had an issue with Mr. Cushnahan regarding the question of perception as much as anything.</p><p>PIMCO indicated to us that, now that it had made us aware of this, it would continue in the process.  We said we would take this away and discuss it and we called a board meeting to discuss it.  The board took the view that it was a very serious development, particularly due to the issue of the involvement of Mr. Cushnahan.  We went back to PIMCO and informed it that the board viewed this as a very serious development and did not think it was tenable for PIMCO to remain in the process.  In fairness, PIMCO gave us the information but the position was not tenable.  PIMCO indicated it would think about this and the following day it stated that, having thought about the issue and taken on board the view of the NAMA board, it had decided to withdraw from the process.  As Mr. Daly outlined in his statement, if PIMCO had not withdrawn from the process, we would have withdrawn it.  Those are the facts.</p></speech>

One third of the bidders had gone and NAMA just ploughed ahead.  Surely the solution would have been to ask Lazards to get another bidder because the process had been fractured and damaged by the withdrawal of the person in question.  Is that not correct?</p></speech>

We took advice from Lazards at the time and asked it whether, following the withdrawal of PIMCO, there was still sufficient competitive tension regarding who could buy the portfolio.  Lazards advised us that there was sufficient competitive tension remaining and both Fortress Capital and Cerberus were very eager to acquire this portfolio and would bid competitively against each other.</p></speech>

All of these funds were approached to see if they were interested in the portfolio.  The number was whittled down to three and one of these three parties withdrew, as happens quite regularly not only in NAMA sales, but in other bank sales.  Sometimes it happens in major property sales that one interested party falls away for its own reasons.  It is just that this was a very particular reason and one for which NAMA would not allow PIMCO to continue.</p></speech>

We certainly looked at the fact that Brown Rudnick and Tughans were, at that stage, coming in on behalf of Cerberus.  However, it should be remembered that we did not have a problem with Brown Rudnick or Tughans as such.  Our problem always was with the Northern Ireland Advisory Committee member or what was reported to us in relation to that NIAC member.  I suppose we were concerned enough.  It was really more a case of "to be sure, to be sure" that when it came to our attention that Brown Rudnick and Tughans were involved with Cerberus, we went back to Cerberus before its bid was considered or accepted and asked for an undertaking in relation to fees, which I outlined in my statement.  As it is in my statement, I will not read it again.  However, Cerberus gave us an unequivocal statement in writing to the fact that no fees were paid to any party with any connection to NAMA.  That was really the issue for us, namely, that fees to any party with any connection to NAMA.  Cerberus provided a very broad confirmation in relation to any board member, executive member or current or former member of the advisory committee.</p> <p>  While that may seem to be a very broad statement, our real target was to know whether there was any fee that in any way might be payable to Mr. Cushnahan at that time.  One cannot go out and ask a particular question about a particular individual without giving oneself a level of exposure to something that NAMA would not want to get into.  For this reason, we asked Cerberus for a very broad statement covering anybody connected with NAMA and it gave us that.</p></speech>

What I am trying to ask is this.  Here we have a massive global transaction, one of the biggest deals ever done in the world of property, I suspect, involving some 850 properties in a bulk sale, and, by complete coincidence, two of the principal bidders are using Brown Rudnick and, by an equally odd coincidence, they are both using Tughans in Belfast.  Did NAMA's antennae not go up when both bidders landed in the same place?  Were alarm bells not ringing about a conflict here?</p></speech>

That was not the issue for us.  The issue for us was the former NIAC member or anybody else in that space.  That was the confirmation we sought.  The rationale for Cerberus involving Tughans, through Brown Rudnick, was that Tughans and Brown Rudnick had been doing a lot of work on this portfolio anyway when PIMCO was in the frame.  Commercially, it made sense for Cerberus to use those firms, rather than starting back at square one.  I am not making a judgment on whether this was a totally rational commercial decision but it did not seem unreasonable to us.</p></speech>

This was quite sensitive politically as is, I suppose, understandable in the context of North-South relations.  At the time, the Minister for Finance, the late Deputy Brian Lenihan, came up with a neat solution that NAMA would be asked to form an advisory committee on Northern Ireland which would have a couple of representatives from Northern Ireland on it.  As I understand it, the selection process was that the Minister or Department consulted the Northern Ireland Executive, in particular, Sammy Wilson, who was then the Minister for Finance and Personnel.  The two names of Frank Cushnahan and Brian Rowntree were furnished to NAMA as a consequence of that consultation and the NAMA board then set up the committee and appointed these two individuals to it, together with several directors of the NAMA board because the Act requires that the majority of members of an advisory committee like the Northern Ireland committee or the planning committee be members of the board of NAMA.  That was the origins of the committee and the two individuals were appointed for two years.</p><p>They were renewed in 2012 and Mr. Cushnahan resigned in November 2013.  We dissolved the committee in September 2014 because there was no longer a need for it after Project Eagle and Mr. Rowntree's term ceased at that stage.</p></speech>

As I have previously indicated to you, family priorities represent my principal reason for such initiative and, not least, I am not getting any younger.  It has been an enormous privilege and honour to have been associated with NAMA and, more especially, to have enjoyed the companionship, friendship and, not least, the contribution made by all colleagues, past or present, during my time as a member.

There were millions sloshing around the system.  There was &pound;15 million, one guy getting &pound;5 million, there were all sorts of potential conflicts of interest happening here, there were political sensitivities, yet NAMA ploughed ahead and said, "Okay, we will take the Cerberus bid."</p></speech>

We went ahead after considering whether we were still getting the best price that was obtainable for the portfolio and whether there was still competitive tension.  There were still two bidders in there - seven of them had dropped out.  There was not huge interest, by the way, in this portfolio, I must say.  I think almost any company that would have had the scale to deal with this and the financial backing to actually deliver on it was invited in.  Of the nine who came into the process, most backed out.  This was not something that a whole lot of people were interested in.</p></speech>

We informed people, through Lazard, that there was a minimum reserve price of &pound;1.3 billion.  We know the cost of due diligence that firms would spend on it and we did not want people wasting their money bidding on a portfolio that they would not pay up for.  At the start of the process in January, the reserve price was &pound;1.3 billion; at the end of the process in April we achieved our &pound;1.3 billion.  There was no question that we did not get the price that we valued the portfolio at.</p></speech>

It was a very small business community - I am sure that a lot of information is shared and a lot of information would be known.  NAMA had someone on the Northern Ireland advisory committee, which was well known and well placed within that jurisdiction.  They also had two firms - Tughans, the local firm, and Brown and Rudnick.  In January 2014, there was a suggestion in terms of the memorandum of understanding.  I know that no one acted on it, that it was not from NAMA, that it was just a piece of paper that went to NAMA.  Bearing in mind the size of the economy and the 55 debtors, I would imagine there was a lot known about everyone within that community and their indebtedness and so on.  The Northern Ireland Executive, or someone from it, suggested this MOU and, without a shadow of a doubt, it protects the debtors and it is the best offer I have seen for debtors in which, for nil payment, they were released.  That is being suggested on one side and we cannot ignore it because there is something going on up here that is unusual and it is certainly unusual that someone of that standing within Northern Ireland would suggest it.  Then there is the involvement of the two firms.  Now, in the correspondence that NAMA has given us this morning, the Brown and Rudnick correspondence of 24 June 2013, the letter from Brown and Rudnick to Mr. Wilson, which is marked "highly confidential", it states: "Two of our clients have each confirmed that they would, independently, be committed to a process of potential outright purchase of the NAMA Northern Irish Borrower Connections Loan Book."</p><p>At that stage, in June 2013, Brown Rudnick was indicating clearly there were two clients.  They had two clients, but thereafter, when PIMCO withdrew in March 2014, it appears the information on the &pound;15 million became clear to you. </p><p> To go back to the point made by Deputy Ross, it seems to me it is quite possible a company was used as a stalking horse and that then the final bidder was there to come in to make the final bid and close the deal.  It seems the information was certainly being shared all around the place with connections in Northern Ireland and that not only was this deal compromised, but there was even an extension of the deal that would accommodate debtors.  I must agree that bearing all of this in mind, the intelligence from the front up there would surely have told you there was something odd, to say the least, about the deal and that something should have been done by NAMA to restructure the process and its approach to that deal.  Perhaps the decision made on that restructuring would have been not to sell in a single property portfolio but to break it down to attract a wider range of bidders.  NAMA should at least have reported to someone the information that was in the public domain from 2013.</p><p> It appears to me that somebody was setting up the purchase.  That is what comes across in the correspondence and in the confidential MOU and it is what seems to come across in the context of the use of Brown Rudnick and Tughans and the involvement of the individual you have just mentioned.  What does NAMA have to say to that, even in the context of the perception.  Can you deal with it that way?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.262" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015070900002#L00200"><p>It is not unusual that firms such as Brown Rudnick would go out and seek deals and try to get in a position to be able to promote that deal to third parties and get a fee.  That happens quite regularly.  Therefore, when Brown Rudnick went out and tried to "source the deal", its fee was only going to be paid if the portfolio was sold.  From our point of view, we want to sell the portfolio for the best price we can get for it.  We were very clear from the outset that we wanted &pound;1.3 billion for the portfolio, as that is what we valued the underlying portfolio at, and we got &pound;1.3 billion for it.</p> <p>  A large portfolio can be broken into small or large parts, but as I outlined in my statement today, this was a very granular, quite poor portfolio in that there was a large number of small value assets, over 50% of it in Northern Ireland and 33% of it in regional United Kingdom areas.  We would be a long time working through that portfolio trying to realise each individual asset, because there is not huge demand for granular portfolios like that.  As can be seen from the case of other banks that are selling granular portfolios, there is a certain type of private equity buyer who buys that sort of portfolio.  PIMCO, obviously, expressed an interest in the portfolio, Cerberus expressed an interest in it and Fortress expressed an interest in it.  They are the type of buyers who buy these granular portfolios.  </p> <p>  Therefore, for such a big deal ticket or big cheque, of &pound;1.3 billion, there are not too many people out there who can do that who are interested in this type of portfolio.  We researched this and discussed it with our loan supervisor, Lazard.  We are satisfied there was competitive tension up to the very end of the process.  This is a big portfolio.  We did everything right.  We did not accommodate any interference or involvement of Mr. Cushnahan.  We sought confirmations from Cerberus and it has confirmed to the media that it sought confirmations from both Tughans and Brown Rudnick.  It is not unusual that companies like Brown Rudnick would go around the place, in terms of people or companies that would approach NAMA or other financial institutions, saying they might have somebody who would be interested in a portfolio and asking whether we had a portfolio that had these characteristics coming to the market. </p> <p>  From our point of view, we must make sure we run a fair process.  We ran a very fair process, with a data room which controlled access to the data, controlled information in that data room, with information provided at the same time to all bidders.  We achieved the price we aimed for in January 2014 when the deal closed in April 2014.</p></speech>

I understand they are reputable firms and understand the reason they, including Brown Rudnick, are in the market in terms of sourcing interest and getting value from their involvement and so on.  However, when we piece together the correspondence NAMA provided to us this morning, the memorandum of understanding, the fact there were 55 debtors and that it is a small market, this would seem to me to have been the wrong approach, based on the information NAMA gleaned as it went through the process.</p> <p>  On 10 March 2014, when it became known to NAMA that this &pound;15 million was to be split three ways, according to PIMCO, surely this should have set alarm bells ringing.  There were other instances that should have set alarm bells ringing before that - going back to 2014 in that letter, going back to Mr. Cushnahan and his termination or resignation from the council and other issues I will come to later.  In my opinion, this should have been a huge concern for NAMA at the time and it should have stood back and questioned the process again.  That is the point I am making.  </p> <p>  In response to my questions, NAMA is outlining the involvement of Brown Rudnick, but I am going beyond that to the knowledge in the local economy and among debtors, the knowledge between Brown Rudnick, Tughans and Mr. Cushnahan and the other interests that were there.  It just does not stack up. </p></speech>

Perhaps the job lot NAMA was selling was too big.  That is the fundamental problem with everything here.  The big issue NAMA has to answer is why it put all that.  I know it has a reason which we will tease out.</p> <p>  Six walked away and we were down to three.  One had a conflict of interest and then NAMA was down to two.  How could it be as competitive with two as with many more?  Having just two is not a highly competitive situation.  It begs the question from our point of view about what was the amount it got.  The answer is approximately &euro;1.4 billion.</p></speech>

I do not know from where that figure came because I have not seen any indices that indicate this.  In fact, in 2014 the commercial real estate market in Northern Ireland grew by 1.4%, not 20% or anything like it.</p></speech>

What we do in relation to a portfolio or an asset we are thinking of selling is carry out an assessment based on our view of the market for these assets.  That is a much more productive exercise than taking broad economic forecasts which, as the Deputy knows as well as I do, are mostly way off the mark.</p></speech>

I looked at the information presented to the committee.  A letter arrived from the Northern Ireland Finance Minister to the Minister for Finance and was sent on to NAMA and suddenly it was selling the whole thing as one job lot.  Had that letter not arrived through the political process, would NAMA have moved at the time to sell the whole thing?  Did this encourage NAMA?  There was a political catalyst for the process and, as such, NAMA cannot really state there was no political involvement.  It does not stack up.  NAMA has showed us two letters.</p> <p>  On the actual sale, there was a memorandum between the Northern Ireland authority and potential purchasers on a memorandum of understanding of how it would work.  If that was to happen here where NAMA was selling a portfolio and there was to be a memorandum between the Department of Finance and potential purchasers of a loan book, it would be called political interference in the process.  Was NAMA happy that it was tyring to make a sale to the only body offering more than the reserve price, while politicians in Northern Ireland wanted an agreement and understanding with the company?  If that was to happen here, would it not be considered political interference?  While NAMA did not involve itself, surely it should have told somebody it was not appropriate to meddle with those to whom NAMA was tyring to sell assets.</p></speech>

The Minister quite properly said, "This is a matter for NAMA."  That was the substance of his reply to Minister Wilson.  Subsequently, there was an approach from Brown Rudnick indicating an interest in our portfolio.  We receive expressions of interest in particular portfolios from time to time.  Let us be clear about what was running through the Brown Rudnick-PIMCO approach - "We want a closed sale.  We do not want you to put it on the market."  We took a very strong view from day one that it did not matter what PIMCO or anybody else wanted, this was going to be an open sale.  We looked at the approach from PIMCO and, as we would with any other approach for a portfolio, asked if this was a possibility and an opportunity for a portfolio that we regarded as really challenging and troubled and that we figured we would still be struggling to dispose of in 2020.  We received an approach and the price was something that interested us, but we were not sure whether it was the right one.  We said we would look at it, engage with PIMCO to see what it might be offering, make our own analysis of the portfolio, decide our minimum reserve price and openly market the portfolio, which is what we did right through the process.</p> <p>  There was political interest.  It would be naive of me to come here and say there was not.  Of course, there was.  There has always been a strong political interest in the North-South dimension here.  There was political interest, but I can tell the Deputy that whatever the interest was, North or South, it never influenced us in the decision to put the portfolio on the market in the first place - that was based purely on our commercial assessment that this could represent a good outcome for the taxpayer - nor was there - I need to say this, notwithstanding the fact that the Deputy is not suggesting it - any interference, pressure or anything else in relation to the decision in the end to accept the highest and winning bid from Cerberus.</p> <p>  In relation to the confidential memorandum, I do not know what it is.  NAMA would never in its wildest dreams have contemplated putting something like that in as a condition of sale of any asset or portfolio.</p></speech>

I am sure Mr. Daly will be aware of it as my colleague Deputy Brendan Smith put a few of these questions specifically on the memorandum.  The Minister said in the D&aacute;il:</p><blockquote>I understand that the purpose of establishing such letters of intent by the Northern Ireland Executive was to help protect and promote the recovery of the Northern Ireland property market and broader economy in the context of the potential concentrated ownership of property across that economy.</blockquote> <p>The Northern Ireland Executive was keen to have an understanding with the purchaser in relation to the broader economy.  While NAMA was not invovled, it is somebody trying to interfere with its purchaser.  NAMA should have asked the Northern Ireland body to let it do its job.  Would NAMA have liked if it was selling a portfolio, some of which happened to be IDA Ireland sites, and IDA Ireland was trying to have a memorandum of understanding with the potential purchaser, while NAMA was trying to negotiate on the open market?  Can the witnesses see that it was not good to have this happening in the background?  Did it not raise questions?</p></speech>

We received this memorandum and decided we would not engage with it but ignore it.  There are several conditions in it that would have been unacceptable to us and, in fact, were quite offensive in terms of the way we dealt with debtors and assets.  Governments will always try to get the best deal.  In the recent Aer Lingus sale the Government worked very hard to get the best possible deal for the Irish taxpayer from IAG.

It was suggested, "It will be a lot of trouble to manage them; let us get rid of them, even if we have to take a loss," to allow NAMA to concentrate on its core activity in dealing with the rest of its portfolio.  That has come through from what has been said.  The expressions "easier to manage" and "concentrate our resources" were used.  It was kind of said it had nuisance value and was trouble and that NAMA wanted to try to get rid of it.  That came through in both opening statements.  However, only 50% of the property was in Northern Ireland.  Did NAMA not consider splitting it between the properties in Northern Ireland and those in regional England?  I note that 6% of it was elsewhere  in the rest of the world and that there was a little bit of it in Dublin and some in commuter belts and urban centres.  Of the portfolio, 3% was in the Republic of Ireland and 4% in London.  I understand what Mr. Daly says about the Northern Ireland economy, but was any consideration given to splitting some of the portfolio on a geographical basis based on the underlying assets?  The prospects for growth in London, Dublin and the rest of the Republic of Ireland might have been higher than in Northern Ireland.  Was it the largest job lot sale to that point?</p></speech>

NAMA was selling groups of assets, or groups of loans, at a particular value, and all of a sudden the Northern Ireland portfolio, a sale that is three times bigger in terms of book value, is put all in one.  It is an enormous jump.  People have difficulty - I have difficulty with how NAMA put the whole thing in one.  It had not done anything like this, of this scale, in any other region.</p> <p>  Normally, when an organisation comes before the committee, figures are quoted by its representatives and by the Comptroller and Auditor General, and they tend to be fairly similar.  I have never seen a conflict like that between the figures presented in Mr. McCarthy's opening statement and those the witnesses read out to us.  If anything is to be achieved by this committee, we must resolve this conflict satisfactorily.</p> <p>  The Comptroller and Auditor General started off by saying that we all know the book value of these loans was &euro;57 billion.  NAMA took them in at &euro;2.2 billion.  Is that correct?  It was a discount of over 60%.  According to the Comptroller and Auditor General's figures, &euro;2.2 billion was the carrying value when NAMA came in.  In his opening statement, Mr. McCarthy said that the proceeds were about &euro;1.4 billion and there was a loss in NAMA's handling this portfolio of approximately &euro;800 million.  He said &euro;211 million of it was made up on the loss at the time of the sale and &euro;572 million with previous provisions NAMA had made against this.  The actual loss by NAMA on the discounted value it took in, according to the Comptroller and Auditor General - his figures are up on the screen - was &euro;783 million.  He started at the &euro;5.7 billion, where I started.  Without getting into a big debate, because my time is tight, am I not right?  That is the figure he gave.</p> <p>  However, Mr. McDonagh then tells me - I am quoting from his opening statement - "In overall cash terms, taking into account disposal proceeds, non-disposal income, advances and the proceeds of the loan sale, the net cash loss to NAMA, in layman&rsquo;s terms, on the NI debtor portfolio was about &euro;280 million."  That was NAMA's loss at the point of sale.  Mr. McDonagh will have to clarify that statement, and both of those figures are going to have to be reconciled.  How can the Comptroller and Auditor General say that NAMA lost &euro;783 million on this portfolio in its time, while Mr. McDonagh can come in and say that in layman's terms - whatever that means - it was &euro;280 million?  Whose figure is right?  I know who is right.</p></speech>

In my statement, I said: "Cumulatively, the write-downs taken against Northern Ireland debtor connections totalled &euro;800 million between 2010 and 2014."  As the Deputy will appreciate - I remember we had a technical discussion about this during my first appearance in respect of NAMA accounts back in 2010 - international financial reporting standards, IFRS, force us to approve an effective interest rate, EIR, at the acquisition date of the portfolio.  Effectively, that is a non-cash accrual, whether we are actually getting the cash or not.  When I looked at the &euro;280 million with my chief financial officer, we looked at it in terms of the cash we paid for the portfolio - the cash received to date.  Nobody really understands IFRS except accountants.  We examined the cash loss for NAMA, taking the ins and outs, and it was &euro;280 million.  Those figures will be made available to the Comptroller and Auditor General.</p></speech>

This is a set of assets that were acquired.  The par value is the estimate in respect of what the debtors owe.  The carrying value before impairment - obviously, there is a lapse of time from the original acquisition - is, broadly speaking, the carrying value that was estimated.  There had been impairment, which in my view was reflecting the deterioration in the asset in the intervening period, as Mr. McDonagh has said.  Even then, when they marketed the thing, they found they did not get the price and had to incur a further loss.  There were also costs incurred on the settlement, and those are reflected in the loss as well.</p></speech>

For example, the Comptroller and Auditor General talked about where the properties are geographically and said that 68% of the properties were located in Northern Ireland.  In Mr. McDonagh's statement, however, and the asset analysis at the end of it, that figure had gone down to 50%.</p></speech>

Okay.</p> <p>  I am more concerned about the &euro;280 million that was lost, and ultimately the cost to the taxpayer, than I am about the process.  I would like to dwell on that for a moment.  Mr. Daly gave reasons as to why he felt it was probably the right thing to do when it came to the disposal of this loan book.  Considering the resources in NAMA, it would make it easier to deal with other things and other properties as a result.  Considering the amounts we are talking about here and the size of this loan book, I would question that.  Surely the only major consideration should have been what we get for this and whether the timing was right to sell.</p><p>That is the issue for me, not whether we can actually free up some of the resources in the organisation to deal with something else.  This was the biggest portfolio that had ever been sold by NAMA and surely that was the main or only consideration by the board.  I know it debated it long and hard.</p><p> If we take a look at appreciation or depreciation in the commercial, retail and even residential markets throughout the geographical locations, Mr. Daly stated some of the comments on Northern Ireland in particular are outlandish.  Somebody spoke about a 20% boost in the commercial sector in Northern Ireland.  However, it did grow a small bit in 2014 and it stopped.  Mr. Daly spoke about getting rid of this loan book in a lagging market.  He felt NAMA would get the best price for this entire loan book at that time.  Everything is very easy in hindsight and everyone is an expert when it comes to property values after the fact.  Everyone is an expert in this country these days.  One must ask the question, considering where the markets have gone in the UK, and even in Northern Ireland and the Republic, and the Comptroller and Auditor Channel quoted the figure of 18% that were numbers of properties-----</p></speech>

I know about commercial property, but even in Northern Ireland in the past year, going back to April 2014, the figure seems to be approximately 9%.  It was 8.8%.  It was the highest growing region in the United Kingdom, with England at 5% and Scotland at 2.2%.</p></speech>

The loan book was sold at the point the market turned.  Somebody could analyse this based on figures and growth in the year beyond when the decision had been made by the board, and this is the key point for me.</p> <p>  We have spoken about this three or four times since 2012 when the two witnesses have come before the committee.  We have spoken about NAMA's analysis when it came to the disposal of properties and whether we should sit on them.  That is the key issue.  When I look at this I must say I would second guess it to a certain extent.  I understand it is always easy with the figures after the fact, but do the witnesses have any responses to this with regard to their timing after the fact?  Somebody could take a good look at this and say NAMA probably should have sat on it for a bit longer.  Who is advising NAMA on the markets?  I know it was a board decision and the witnesses spoke about it being long and hard.  I will not sit here and say if it were me I would have waited, but somebody must ask the question considering the amounts.</p></speech>

Any uplift will be marginal.  A total of 50% buy value is in Northern Ireland.  It is very location specific.  Stuff around Belfast might do well but other stuff might not.  The entire portfolio was heavily concentrated in retail.  Almost 50% of the portfolio is related to retail in Northern Ireland and the north-eastern UK.  When is the right time to sell and what is the best price we can get is a conundrum the whole time for the board.  We look at this very closely.  Part of the board's work is to do sectoral analysis by geography on each of the markets we are in, and part of this consideration was a separate sectoral paper which took input from various sources and external research specifically on Northern Ireland.  We have been operating in this market since 2010.  It was not improving and, to be honest, it was getting worse.  The portfolio was really granular and it was going to take us a very long time to realise the portfolio.  We looked at the cashflows all the way out to 2020 and we conducted a net present value analysis of them-----</p></speech>

Mr. Daly dealt with the misinformation and disinformation in the media with regard to the &euro;5.7 billion.  It is important these errors are corrected.  If this is clarified, we are back to the &euro;1.6 billion paid for acquiring these loans in the first place and the &euro;280 million that was ultimately lost.  All I am saying at this point is the taxpayer will want to know whether this was the best deal at the time.  I believe that is the priority for the taxpayers when they look at this entire saga.  What will interest them is whether NAMA is making the correct decisions on the disposal of these properties, in this case a massive loan book.</p></speech>

I still believe that at the time we sold the portfolio it was the best achievable price.  If I were to be asked whether we would get slightly better if we put it on the market now, I do not know.

That did not just apply to residential property.  Basically, people would know that.  In respect of selling something like this, somebody might second guess NAMA and say that perhaps it should wait because everything had turned with regard to property prices, certainly when it came to residential property.  Commercial values in Dublin at that time were going way up as well.  That was the firm opinion back then when the board made the decision to dispose of this loan book.  I suppose I am second guessing whether or not NAMA should have sat on this.  I do not have the values.  One would need to take it property by property, find out how much somebody would pay for it today, add it up and then analyse whether or not one's methodology was correct.</p></speech>

We are in a continuum.  If we go back to NAMA at the beginning and all of the objectives and the wish list people had for it, one was that we would stimulate the property market in Ireland.  One certainly cannot do that by sitting on every asset one has and hoping that in ten years the market will have begun to move without any intervention from NAMA.  NAMA's sales in the market are in themselves a stimulant.  I believe that the entry of a huge fund like Cerberus into the Northern Ireland market has probably created a stimulus.  It is very hard to take that into account when back in April 2014, NAMA made that decision.  We can debate this wherever the Deputy likes but to say the market had turned might be a bit strong.  If the Deputy said that the market was turning, I would not disagree with him but I do not want to be Jesuitical about it.</p></speech>

I will not attempt to involve him in any kind of political opinion.  I know he said three or four weeks ago that he is planning to do the review.  He has prepared and planned for that and it was in his schedule.  From what NAMA has said document-wise and what the Comptroller and Auditor General has seen so far within the committee, are there issues that are of concern to him?  A Member of this House has intimated that the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General does not have the capacity to deal with this as well as the garda&iacute; and the Committee of Public Accounts.  I do not know which higher investigative power should be doing it if these three bodies do not do it.

We have sought additional assistance regarding whether the questions we are asking are reasonable and the conclusions we would draw stand up.  In effect, the property market and the development market are peculiar.  It is not like any other sale, procurement or tendering process.  We are aware from auditing NAMA over the years that there are these kinds of peculiarities, practices and customs.  The hope would be that a properly functioning market will generate good and reasonable value at a point in time.  This must be tested.</p></speech>

All of that is outside NAMA.  All of that related to the purchasing side of this and certainly not the selling side, so I have been disturbed by the way that has been conflated.  As I said at the beginning of this meeting, wherever that &pound;7 million came from, it did not come from NAMA and it did not come, in any way, from the proceeds of this sale that should have been due to NAMA.  I am firmly of that view.</p> <p>  If a firm of solicitors in Northern Ireland suddenly finds that a fee - a very substantial fee in this case - has apparently been diverted to an account in the name of one individual from that firm and the fact that it managed to get it back seems to indicate that it was not right in the first place, it should be investigated by the Law Society of Northern Ireland in respect of the individual and presumably the firm of solicitors.  The PSNI indicated yesterday that it will look at that.</p><p>NAMA certainly welcomes that, but NAMA is very firmly of the view that this transaction did not relate to NAMA or certainly no source of funding or anything like that related to NAMA.  In fact, we knew nothing about it until it appeared in the media some time ago.  By the way, we have been engaging on this.

I will come back to this in a moment, but I wish to focus on how such a refusal would be perceived.  I accept the statements of Mr. Daly and Mr. McDonagh, but as previous speakers indicated, in particular Deputy Deasy, I believe the loss of &euro;280 million is something on which the taxpayer would expect us to drill down.  I wish to focus on how the matter has been handled, in particular in the fall-out in the past week.  Does NAMA accept that there could be a better way of dealing with the issue in terms of the public perception of how it is carrying out its work?  The allegation that has been made is that NAMA is almost akin to a secret society with a secret handshake and that nobody knows what is going on inside it.  I accept the Comptroller and Auditor General has permanent staff in NAMA.  I also accept that NAMA's work has almost come to a conclusion.  Has NAMA learned anything from its experience in Northern Ireland?  Will NAMA change anything in its approach to the disposal of the remainder of its assets because of the way the issue under discussion has been handled?</p></speech>

That is all on the record.</p> <p>  NAMA has been controversial since the beginning and once the name "NAMA" appears anywhere in connection with a story, it gets the headlines.  One of the most effective ways of dealing with very controversial issues for us in the past has been with this committee.  Coming in is not always comfortable but that is what we are doing today.  I can understand the public might be exercised about NAMA's sales process and whether it got value for money.  We have explained the process in absolute detail.  We have said why we think we got value for money and that we got the right price.  The Comptroller and Auditor General is now going to look at that aspect of it in his triennial review.  It goes without saying that every document and piece of analysis will be made available to him.  That is all we can do.  The conflation in recent days and weeks about this payment in Northern Ireland from a company based in Northern Ireland to an individual in Northern Ireland is not something of which NAMA has any knowledge and with which it has any involvement.  There is nothing we can do except keep explaining that.  One of the points I made in my earlier statement is that I think that point is not getting across.</p></speech>

He wrote that letter to the then Northern Ireland Minister of Finance and Personnel, who on foot of it subsequently contacted the Department here.

I do not have staff permanently in NAMA.  The staff are there for large parts of the year to carry out financial audit work.  Typically, they would be there between approximately September and May and they would not be there over the summer months.  As I said, they would be engaged in financial audit work directed towards giving an opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view.  We only get information for the purposes of the audit.  In case anybody is under a misapprehension, we do not walk around NAMA and just look into whatever files we want; this is specific information requested for particular audit purposes.  We are not involved in any way in the decision-making process-----</p></speech>

The statement, as stated by Deputy O'Donovan, read, "Subsequent to those discussions, I have received the enclosed letter from Brown Rudnick, who will be known to NAMA.  They were instrumental in introducing me to two potential investors in the NAMA loan book."  I thought Mr. McDonagh said that NAMA had no relationship with Brown Rudnick.</p></speech>

He worked for Morgan Stanley and what he said in his letter is true in that he dealt with us with one of our first loan sales back in 2012 with Morgan Stanley.  It is not unusual for people passing through different professional organisations to make out that they are more involved with NAMA than they are.

The letter to Mr. Wilson is quite comprehensive and much work was done at the time.  In the first three paragraphs he is very clear that he seems to understand exactly what is going on in NAMA.  He indicates "We understand and respect that a transaction with Northern Irish real estate concentration would have a fundamental impact" and refers to "loans with a concentration of property located in Northern Ireland".  He also points out that it is understood there are other loans relating to the United Kingdom and references a significant majority of the total value of the loan.  Much background work seems to have been done but how could all of that have been done if there had been no contact with NAMA?</p></speech>

The rest of the presentation is really about getting an exclusive deal for one of the clients.  I presume this is PIMCO.  He has two clients but he is not really representing one client.  He is seeking to get a preferred status for the other client.</p><p>Is there not something strange about that?  </p></speech>

It is quite common, in the market, that people try to get what is called a promote fee for finding a transaction.  Whether he had a second client or not, we will never know.  As I said, I only became aware of this letter yesterday.  Again, given what he said in the rest of the letter, he might be trying to put it out there that he had a bigger portfolio of clients than he actually had.  I do not know, Deputy.</p></speech>

PIMCO is one of the biggest global fund managers in the world.  I think it has about $200 billion worth of assets under management.  We would have met PIMCO, a few times, at the start of NAMA and then they seemed to disappear but they seemed to re-emerge as part of this, subsequently.</p></speech>

That is an interesting comment to make by someone who is trying to sell to one particular partner.  He says there are two but then he concentrates on one and then he talks about the integrity of the transaction as being "our main concern."  He continues:  "Preceding with one party on a limited exclusivity will ensure a focused expedient process with guaranteed confidentiality which we would see as absolutely vital for such a process."</p></speech>

The Minister for Finance, in his reply, said the way NAMA operates is very much to its credit.  He said: "I am advised by NAMA that granting exclusive access to one potential purchaser is not an approach they favour as it militates against achieving optimal value for the assets concerned."</p> <p>  Clearly, it seems that this is the man or company who generated the entire process - the Brown Rudnick company - and that they did this in a somewhat underhand fashion without necessarily anybody else being interested in it, at the time, and not having a second client.  Clearly, this was the base they were operating on.  At that point in time, Cerberus was not on the horizon and NAMA has no-----      </p></speech>

Some of them pulled out straightaway and said it was not for them.  Some of them had a look at the dataroom and said we understand the concentration of assets, and the granular nature of assets, and said we are not going to spend any money on due diligence and this just is not for us because they have funds that they are investing to get a return.  Three remained in the final month of the bid process.  There was a three-month bid process from January to the end of March.  Up until 10 March there were three bidders actively looking at the portfolio - Cerberus, PIMCO and Fortress.</p></speech>

I presume that, as part of their credit approval for making a bid, they have to go through an internal process involving their compliance department.  PIMCO's own compliance team or the compliance department discovered, probably through their checks and balances, that there was going to be a fee payable to third parties.  Fees payable to third party by private equity funds are not unusual at all.</p></speech>

They look for sign off from various departments and their function.  There is sign off by the people promoting the deal, who are the front office people.  Then they look for sign off probably from their legal department.  These funds probably look for a sign off from their compliance department.  We understand that it went to a compliance department, then the compliance department raised - because they do their research - a flag that one of the parties involved, one of the parties getting the fees, could have potential issues for them because they recognise-----</p></speech>

NAMA was established in 2010 and when this sale was made in 2014, the market was still weak in Northern Ireland but NAMA was receiving rental income of between &euro;50 million and &euro;60 per annum.  Why did it not maintain that rental income stream given that the market was at bargain basement levels?</p></speech>

Almost 20% of the portfolio comprised lands from which we had no income.  We had a challenged portfolio with small value assets requiring considerable work.  We had also engaged with debtors over four years in an attempt to maximise the recovery on the portfolio but the situation was not improving.</p></speech>

We get rental income in other portfolios but our objective is to repay our debts.  The only way we can possibly do that is by selling assets.  Simply sitting on assets and taking the rental income would never reduce our debt or allow us to fund the construction 4,500 homes by the end of next year and provide almost 2,000 houses for social housing purposes.  We would not have been able to invest in the docklands if we had not generated income from asset disposals.  Rental income would never be sufficient.</p></speech>

In the US, when a big pay day arrives they say that the eagle has landed.  From the point of view of Cerberus, the eagle certainly landed.</p> <p>  I ask Mr. McDonagh to outline the due diligence carried out in advance of the sale.  It appears that Lazards was appointed at a late stage.  The letter to the Northern Ireland Minister, Mr. Wilson, from Brown Rudnick states that the firm took comfort from the fact that NAMA had completed the necessary due diligence in respect of all loan transactions and could guarantee the validity and enforceability of the security and that over the previous years it had undertaken a significant investment in tidying up the security package.  Given the scale of the deal, it is surprising that the letter also states that the firm planned to commence a four week long due diligence process.  Who carried out the first due diligence for NAMA?</p></speech>

Over the preceding four years, if gaps of security or a lack of cross-collatorisation emerged during our engagement with debtors, we would have remedied the issue.  That is part of the normal operations of NAMA as part of our efforts to maximise cost recovery.  We were not aware that Tughans was involved with Brown Rudnick at that stage but Tughans would have been aware that we were engaged in remediation of securities in respect of Northern Ireland debtors and the portfolio of assets.  I am sure every legal firm in Ireland or Northern Ireland would be fully aware that we are actively involved in managing portfolios.</p></speech>

Lots of people would take issue with that, but that was his view.

Aside from the particulars of this payment, there was an ongoing relationship between Mr. Cushnahan and Tughans solicitors, which, in turn, had a relationship with Brown Rudnick, which, according to its documentation, had previous relationships with NAMA.  Tughans, which was dealing with debtors, also had a relationship with counsel for purchases and bidders.  It is disingenuous of Mr. Daly to reduce it down in the way he is attempting.</p></speech>

That was Brown Rudnick's business.  Our major concern, right to the end, was to ensure there was no taint regarding the involvement of Mr. Cushnahan.  We sought this assurance from Cerberus, which it gave, as it confirms, having also consulted with Brown Rudnick, which consulted with Tughans.  They were two commercial firms.  Again, I reiterate that our concern was Mr. Cushnahan.  Firms such as Cerberus, Brown Rudnick or even Tughans do not lightly give undertakings such as they gave to us.</p></speech>

I am bringing it to his attention in order to illustrate how incestuous all of it was and the web that has been created between the same players in a small system with a tiny professional population.  The net result and the concern for people trying to make sense of it and the taxpayer is that in the first scenario, there was an attempt at payola, NAMA got wind of it and was concerned, not concerned enough to suspend the thing but enough to show PIMCO the road.</p></speech>

We had no relationship with Brown Rudnick or Tughans but with Cerberus.  Our concern, and the concern that people should and do have, is whether we got the best value for the Northern Ireland portfolio at the time, and I honestly believe we did.  I will not go into it; we have rehearsed it here extensively.  The bid from Cerberus was the highest bid.  It met our reserve price.  We took every step we could to ensure there was no involvement of anybody from NAMA in the background with any sort of fee or payment.  We have it in writing.</p></speech>

Perhaps this is the nub of the problem more generally.  It has everything to do with the networks of persons, professional, political and otherwise, in and around the transactions.

We know this turn of events, perhaps because of the scale of it.

Mr. Daly knew about the &pound;15 million, which PIMCO informed him about.  Given that PIMCO knew about it, we can be sure Brown Rudnick also knew about it.  Presumably the parties who were party to the &pound;15 million knew about it.  Mr. Daly dealt with the situation, to his own way of thinking, adequately.  However, in the name of God, when round two came around and the same firms and personalities were on the scene, who presumably knew about the &pound;15 million, it did not sound an alarm bell in Mr. Daly's head.  If he was not prepared to suspend the sale the first time around, and if he did not call a halt the second time around with the same cast of personalities, I do not know what kind of fireproofing or good practice it is.</p></speech>

On the issue of what Cerberus, Brown Rudnick or Tughans did regarding the second one, they are third parties and I cannot control what they did, nor could I be expected to.  I can only talk about the NAMA process and our being concerned and asking Cerberus for undertakings, which it gave and which I do not believe it would have given lightly.</p></speech>

Having listened to what has been said here, I firmly believe the process should have been abandoned.  There is no doubt in my mind about this, although one may say it is with the benefit of hindsight.</p><p>Bearing in mind what has been said in relation to the small economy, the small number of players, the information being shared, the memorandum of understanding and the political system, it does stink a bit.  I am deeply concerned about it.  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General is about to undertake, or is in the process of undertaking, an investigation or an analysis of some of the sales within NAMA, and the sooner this comes into the public domain, the better.  It was ill-judged not to have abandoned the process.  Some way has to be found to co-operate with the investigation in Northern Ireland and to link what happened in the South with what seems to be the construction of a web and the same players, as outlined by Deputy McDonald.  It has to happen.</p><p> We had an example of this when the Committee of Public Accounts met its counterparts in Northern Ireland.  It would serve NAMA and it would serve the system well if there were collaboration and co-operation all round and to have a full-scale investigation with all parties concerned brought to the table.  There is no other way out of this because out of this hearing today, we have to decide what we do with the information.  It is inconclusive because the other players are not here with us, and it is disturbing because of the knowledge that was held by individuals, in particular the PIMCO revelation about the &pound;15 million.</p></speech>

Beyond that, and because there are other players outside of this jurisdiction, it is difficult to deal with it.  A mechanism should be found to deal with it in an all island way, where agencies on both sides of the Border co-operate to present to the public a fuller picture of what happened.</p></speech>

If there was wrongdoing, it should be identified, uncovered and explained.  When one has the Isle of Man and the numbers of companies involved, and when it is explained as it was explained to this committee, the story worsens.  The plot thickens and we have not come to the end of it.  PIMCO disclosed the &pound;15 million to NAMA and one has to ask how a firm the size of PIMCO cannot miss the &pound;7 million.  It is not answered and it cannot be answered here.  We owe it to the political system and the administration to get to the end of this.  It is disturbing for the memorandum of understanding to appear and for it not to have official backing in terms of its origins.  It is disturbing also that it was suggested that there would be a nil balance for the 55 debtors.  Who did this benefit and what was it about? Where is the &pound;7 million and where is it going to go now?  These are the questions that must be answered.</p> <p>  I know the Comptroller and Auditor General will do an investigation into this and it might shine more light on the processes and procedures within NAMA itself.  It may benefit NAMA and our understanding of what went on.  This is an unfinished piece of work that can only be concluded by some agency straddling both jurisdictions to bring it to a head.  I understand the difficulties for NAMA personnel appearing before the committee in Northern Ireland, and the witnesses present said that they would not appear.  The PSNI might expedite a thorough investigation which, depending on the outcome, could be dealt with more appropriately at a committee and the information could be put out there.  It is striking, Mr. Reid, that the committee got the release of these letters and the memorandum of understanding this morning.  Alarm bells should have been ringing loud and clear a long time ago once you had sight of the letters and the correspondence.  That is my view.</p> <p>  We will conclude our business for today but it is very much an unfinished piece of work.  I thank the witnesses who I understand are attending elsewhere.  I appreciate their attendance here.</p></speech>

On 30 September 2013, the figure was &euro;125 million.  The Comptroller and Auditor General has drawn attention to this fact in previous meetings.

Essentially, it arises from a change in the pension arrangements in respect of those five universities as a result of the 2009 Act where an existing pension fund into which the universities were contributing was transferred to the National Pensions Reserve Fund.  However, the Higher Educational Authority, HEA, continued to fund them as if they were still contributing and they were instructed to pay the surplus funds into individual pension fund accounts.  They are recorded in the individual universities but they will be there in the future to meet liabilities that otherwise would fall on the HEA.  It is an anomalous situation, and the fund is growing by about &euro;30 million a year.  I was just drawing attention to it in the circumstances.</p></speech>

On 4.15, financial statements - IDA, it is a clear audit but note 8(e) of the financial statements discloses that non-effective expenditure of &euro;1.28 million was incurred in 2014 on rent and associated costs related to unoccupied office space in two buildings.</p></speech>

As the committee will be aware, County Cork VEC was dissolved with effect from 1 July 2013 and its functions transferred to Cork Education and Training Board.  This committee received a large volume of correspondence over an extended period setting out a range of complaints and allegations about the operations of County Cork VEC, some with reference to incidents dating back to 2000.  These included allegations about the operation of the Youthreach programme in Macroom and a range of legal disputes between the VEC and its employees.  The audit of the financial statements of County Cork VEC for the 2011 and 2012 years of account were extended to examine the various alleged control weaknesses and financial losses.  The focus of the additional work was primarily on establishing whether any of the alleged control weaknesses were evident in the operation of County Cork VEC in 2011 and 2012 and, if so, whether the VEC had suffered financial losses as a result.</p> <p>  Youthreach is a national programme of second chance education and training directed primarily at unemployed early school leavers aged 15 to 20.  County Cork VEC operated seven Youthreach centres.  One of the centres, Macroom Youthreach, had an approved allocation for 30 students.  While the Department of Education and Skills had specified eligibility criteria for Youthreach applicants, local co-ordinators had discretion to allow individuals who did not satisfy the normal criteria to participate in the programme.  In such cases, the applicants&rsquo; files should clearly document the reason for their inclusion on the programme. </p> <p>  Between 2007 and 2012, payments totalling &euro;114,000 were made to eight students participating in Macroom Youthreach who were subsequently deemed by the VEC to have been ineligible.  Examination of the files of the eight students found a lack of documentary evidence for the reasons for their inclusion on the programme.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.878" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2015070900002#HH00100"><p>Although there were some residual control weaknesses and one case where a student continued on Youthreach until determined to be ineligible in 2012, we found that the controls over assessment of eligibility had generally operated as intended at Macroom Youthreach centre in the academic year 2011-2012.  We found no evidence of the weaknesses that had occurred in Macroom being replicated at other Youthreach centres, when further samples of files were examined as part of the audit of County Cork VEC or other VECs.  Nevertheless, I have recommended that the Department should review its guidelines in relation to Youthreach to clarify the limits of discretion available to co-ordinators to admit students to the programme on an exceptional basis, and how such exercise of discretion should be documented.<br/><br/>An internal audit report by the Vocational Support Services Unit, VSSU, completed in August 2010 identified a number of weaknesses regarding payments to staff at the Macroom Youthreach centre.  It was estimated that the VEC paid for 1,070 tuition hours in the academic year 2009-2010, estimated to cost &euro;60,000, where teachers were not timetabled to teach.  The VEC had also paid part-time teachers for an additional 500 non-teaching hours used for administrative work associated with the centre at an estimated cost of approximately &euro;25,000 for the academic year 2009-10.  Payments were made to two part-time staff without deduction of PAYE and PRSI.  In addition, it appeared that two individuals in receipt of a student allowance were not attending training but were in fact employed to provide English language tuition.  The audit of County Cork VEC's financial statements for 2011 and 2012 examined payments to staff, including in Macroom Youthreach, and no continuing issues of concern were noted.<br/><br/>The Vocational Educational Act 1930 requires a VEC to obtain sanction from the Minister prior to entering a lease.  In 2012, an internal audit in the VEC raised concerns about two leases entered into without obtaining the required sanction and recommended that the VEC conduct a review.  This identified six further leases where sanction had not been obtained as required.  The position in relation to seven leased buildings has now been regularised by way of retrospective sanction granted by the Department between November 2012 and May 2014.<br/><br/>One of the unsanctioned leases related to a 15-year lease agreement for a building in Mallow entered into in 1996, with an option to purchase the building in 2011, at the end of the lease, for a nominal sum.  When it was applying for grant funding of &euro;1 million towards the construction cost of a cr&egrave;che in the building in 2008, the VEC entered into a revised lease agreement.  Grants for cr&egrave;che facilities would not have been payable for investment in a building on a short lease.  As a result, the term of the lease was extended to 2031, and the VEC became legally committed to additional lease payments of &euro;431,700 as a result.  Subsequently, further revised arrangements provided for the cessation of lease payments with effect from 1 January 2012 and the transfer of ownership of the building for a nominal sum, as provided for in the original lease.  This removed the obligation on the VEC to make the extended lease payments.<br/><br/>In 2010, the VEC also entered into a 99-year lease, committing itself to costs of &euro;20,000 a year over the term of the lease in the form of four annual scholarships.  In return, the VEC secured the use of a site with an area of 0.9 ha adjacent to a marine outdoor education centre in Schull.  No analysis was undertaken to compare the projected cost of the scholarships with the likely benefits.  The lease arrangement was terminated in August 2013 by mutual agreement with the land owner.  The incurred cost of the scholarships amounted to a total of &euro;40,000, and the VEC had the use of the site for four years.<br/><br/>A number of other issues were also identified in relation to County Cork VEC.  Between 2010 and 2013, legal settlements amounting to &euro;111,600 were made by the VEC from its own funds.  The VEC&rsquo;s insurers made further settlements, amounting to &euro;95,000, in respect of 23 cases and incurred legal costs of &euro;120,000.  In addition, legal costs incurred by the VEC amounted to &euro;442,200 for the four years 2010 to 2013, significantly above the VEC sector average.  A further case was settled by the ETB in 2014 and included compensation of &euro;10,000 and arrears of salary for 11 years amounting to &euro;168,000.<br/><br/>In 2002, the VEC accepted a gift of a boat called the <i>Omar B</i>and used it as part of a sailing training programme.  The boat has been in dry dock storage since 2007, at a total cost of &euro;10,700.<br/><br/>The VEC had a long-standing arrangement with a voluntary body providing services to people with disability whereby the VEC provided funding in lieu of teaching hours.  The arrangement was in breach of departmental guidelines in relation to the operation of such arrangements.  The funding provided was based on a specified number of training hours using VEC pay rates for an unqualified part-time teacher whereas the actual pay rates in operation in the voluntary organisation were significantly lower.  The grant to the voluntary body in 2011 was just under &euro;93,500.  The Vocational Support Services Unit, VSSU, estimated that, if funding had been provided based on the cost of the teaching delivered, as required by the Department&rsquo;s guidelines, the grant would have been lower by &euro;49,000.<br/><br/>Finally, a tax audit of County Cork VEC by the Revenue Commissioners resulted in a settlement of &euro;115,700 in June 2013.  The settlement included a number of tax categories and related to tax periods as far back as 2003.<br/><br/>Some of the control issues outlined in correspondence about County Cork VEC were present in 2011 and 2012, while other matters had been corrected.  The ETB has since taken action to regularise transactions or to terminate arrangements in order to address the remaining issues.  The audit of the final financial statement of the VEC for the period to end June 2013 has been completed and no significant ongoing control lapses were identified.</p></speech>

The education and training board sector has undergone unprecedented change in recent years.  In 2013, the Education and Training Boards Act established 16 ETBs and the 33 vocational education committees were dissolved.  As well as the establishment of the ETBs, major changes have also taken place in the co-ordination and funding of further education and training with the establishment of SOLAS in October 2013.  Change is ongoing and will take a number of years to embed.  The new ETBs continue to develop as single entities, adapting organisational structures and practices accordingly and developing their response to their new responsibility for training.  While County Cork VEC has been dissolved, its functions were transferred to Cork ETB from 1 July 2013.</p> <p>  The Department welcomes the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s special report on internal control in County Cork Vocational Education Committee.  The report sets out what happened in relation to a number of failures of internal control and failures to follow proper procedures.  The report also indicates that various concerns are either not apparent on examination of more recent accounts, the position has been regularised or actions have been taken to address the relevant issues.  The issues in County Cork began to be brought the attention of the Department by the then acting chief executive of the VEC in early 2011.  The Department immediately began engaging with the VEC on the issues.  The VEC kept the Department informed of developments at all stages and this engagement continued throughout the period of transition to the new ETB structure and the succession of the current chief executive in 2013. </p> <p>  The Department had concerns regarding both the overall range of issues coming to light and the individual issues.  In carrying out their duties, all public servants, those involved in front line delivery and those with management and oversight roles, must place a high priority on adherence to regulated procedures and to financial and governance accountability, as appropriate.  While the Department was aware that the VEC was taking steps to identify the problems and, most importantly, to address them, it would have been preferred at times if this happened more quickly, even acknowledging that procedures must be followed carefully and can take some time to work through.</p> <p>  The details of the ETB&rsquo;s response to the issues are more appropriate for Mr. Owens to outline.  However, the Department&rsquo;s view is that the VEC-ETB&rsquo;s management response to the issues has, ultimately, been comprehensive.</p><p>The Department's understanding is that the resolution of matters has been achieved to the extent possible at this time and the Department will continue to work with Cork Education and Training Board, ETB, as necessary.</p><p> While there is only one specific recommendation in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report for the Department, which has been acted on, the scope of the report points to a need to ensure that robust governance and internal control mechanisms are in place in the ETB sector and beyond.  The committee is aware that the Department has been actively strengthening its role in terms of governance and accountability oversight of institutions and bodies across the education sector.  This process is ongoing and is an area to which we are strongly committed.  The briefing document provided to the committee outlines some of the measures taken to emphasise and improve governance and reporting requirements in the ETB area in particular.  These encompass: legislative change relating to the establishment of ETBs and SOLAS; the issuing of a range of departmental regulations that cover areas such as procurement, tax compliance, borrowing and reporting of losses; a revised code of practice for the sector that sets out clearly a framework for codes of conduct for board and staff members, financial controls in terms of risk management, the internal audit function, audit and finance committees and oversight and reporting requirements; revised terms of reference and steering structures relating to the internal audit service for ETBs; and a more cohesive approach to governance across the education sector that includes enhanced networking with key players involved in governance, audit and oversight.</p><p> I will be happy to address these in more detail as well as other queries that the committee might have.</p></speech>

Since its establishment in July 2013, Cork ETB has taken over the functions and operations of County Cork VEC, City of Cork VEC and F&Aacute;S.  Cork ETB is a new organisation with responsibility for the organisation of a wide range of education and training services in Cork.  It is responsible for all assets and liabilities of County Cork VEC.<br/><br/>The report highlights a number of serious control weaknesses and breaches in procedure in County Cork VEC's operations.  Significant control weaknesses were identified in terms of student enrolment practices and payments to students and staff in Youthreach Macroom.  Procedures were not followed when lease agreements were entered into.  The statutory obligation to seek prior ministerial approval for these leases was not fulfilled.  The report also refers to high legal costs and settlements between 2010 and 2013 and weaknesses that led to a Revenue audit and a significant tax settlement.  The Comptroller and Auditor General found that the departmental guidelines were not followed in the allocation of co-operation hours to the St. Joseph&rsquo;s Foundation and the costs incurred in connection with the <i>Omar B</i>sail training programme were also criticised.<br/><br/>As chief executive of Cork ETB, I am committed to ensuring that this new organisation delivers education and training in the Cork region in a compliant, efficient and competent manner.  Cork ETB believes it is important to acknowledge that mistakes were made, rules were not adhered to and proper procedures were not followed in County Cork VEC.  Lessons have been learned and action has been taken on the issues highlighted in the report.  For example, Cork ETB has implemented new procedures for all Youthreach centres, has regularised the position in respect of the leases, has a new service-level agreement in place for the allocation and utilisation of co-operation hours, was one of the first ETBs to undertake a tendering process for legal services and understands that it must be fully compliant with all tax regulations.  Stricter controls have been put in place to ensure that all tax regulations are complied with.<br/><br/>In the past two years, Cork ETB has thoroughly reviewed each of these issues and put systems in place to ensure the efficient, effective and compliant use of public funds.  Cork ETB takes responsibility for addressing these failings and continues to strive to ensure that they do not happen in the new organisation.  As chief executive, I assure the committee of my sincere commitment and that of my board members to maintaining the highest standards of performance and corporate governance in Cork ETB in the future.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General's report lists nine main issues: ineligible students paid to participate in Youthreach; leases entered into without the requisite ministerial sanction; significant sums spent on legal fees; numerous complaints from teachers and others to the Committee of Public Accounts; the money lost by the VEC on a boat; how the VEC did not follow guidelines on granting early retirement; teachers being paid when they were not timetabled; staff payments not being subject to PAYE or PRSI; and the VEC's need to make a large tax settlement.  This is a major indictment of bad management.</p> <p>  Since Mr. Owens took over the running of part of what was County Cork VEC following its amalgamation, one of many that occurred across the country, with the City of Cork VEC, what he has found and what the Comptroller and Auditor General has reported to us is not what one would expect of a VEC.  How many schools operate in County Cork?  Will Mr. Owens comment on the anomalies that he has found in the VEC?  Were they found in any other facility?</p></speech>

We have put that matter right.  We agree that ministerial approval was needed for leases on property.  We have regularised that situation.  As to legal costs, we were one of the first ETBs to tender for legal services and we have a good commercial service in operation.  Regarding the Omar B, there are no storage costs at this stage and the Omar B is not costing the ETB any longer.</p> <p>  As to Revenue settlements, we have tried everything to ensure that we are fully tax compliant.  We have provided training for staff and reviewed our controls and procedures.  I am confident that Cork ETB has taken steps to address the issues that were highlighted in the report.</p></speech>

We have approximately 15,000 full-time post-primary students and 5,000 full-time post-leaving certificate students, with the remainder of the student population comprising people undertaking full-time courses in our training centre and under local training initiatives, what would formerly have been F&Aacute;S operations, and students involved in community education and adult literacy programmes.  Besides further education and training and post-primary, we now have responsibility for some primary schools.  Of our 50,000 students, approximately half are full-time students.</p></speech>

Did the findings of the Comptroller and Auditor General come as a surprise to the Department, particularly the level of correspondence to this committee complaining about the VEC?  This issue had been flagged as far back as 2000.</p></speech>

However, we were surprised by the range of issues when they were brought to our attention.  Their scale and the fact that they crossed various areas of VEC activity were of most concern.</p></speech>

Did the Department at any stage tell these officials to get their house in order?</p></speech>

The major issue identified in the report relates to the Macroom Youth Centre and it was the chief executive officer of Cork Vocational Education Committee, Ms Russell, who drew that to our attention initially.  However, it was only when an internal audit report was put into the public domain as a result of correspondence sent to the Committee of Public Accounts and others that we saw the scale of the issues.  We then sought to follow up on the range of those issues with the VEC.</p></speech>

I note the VEC is tendering for legal services.  When one considers the scale of the legal fees paid, what is the position in this regard?  Has Mr. Owens had an opportunity to deal with these inherited issues and, if so, how did he approach the issues of litigation, tax settlements and so forth?  I will not go through the figures as the Comptroller and Auditor General highlighted the astronomical fees that were paid.  How did the cases develop to the point that such a large retainer was paid to the legal firm in question?</p></speech>

However, what I did when I was appointed was review the cases and engage with people, including people at the rights commissioner, Labour Court, High Court and Supreme Court levels.  I engaged and met people because I believe that fresh perspective can help in these cases and I am glad to say that these cases have now been resolved to everybody's satisfaction.  The legal costs and settlements, as the Deputy noted, were high and approximately 71% of the costs over that period were incurred in defending employment related cases.  I am a great believer in trying to ensure that these cases do not go to court and I have tried to instil that culture in our human resources department.  I am also a great believer in trying to use the State resolution measures to try to ensure disputes do not end up in costly litigation.</p></speech>

The contentious human resource issues these cases raised and to which Mr. Owens referred suggest that not only was there a lack of controls in place in the VEC but there was little harmony in the system.</p></speech>

Does Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; believe the level of observation, due diligence and controls, apart from the role of the Comptroller and Auditor General, will prevent circumstances similar to those that occurred in County Cork Vocational Education Committee arising again?  The role of taxpayers' money and the fact that this issue relates to the education of young people and students on the back-to-education scheme and Youthreach programmes means this is a major responsibility.  The negative publicity surrounding this issue has certainly damaged Youthreach.  Ineligible students benefitted from this scheme, which is beneficial in certain areas.  Is the practice identified occurring anywhere else?</p></speech>

I refer to the issues that emerged in the public domain, the discussions of the Committee of Public Accounts on this matter and in recent years on other issues that arose in former vocational education committees and the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Arising from that, we have put in place a range of departmental regulations to cover areas such as procurement, tax compliance, borrowing and reporting.  This ensures we issue regulations to the sector.</p> <p>  Furthermore and very importantly, a revised code of practice has been drawn up for the sector.  The code has a number of different aspects, including a framework for codes of conduct for board and staff members, financial controls in terms of risk management, new arrangements for the internal audit function which differ significantly from previous arrangements, arrangements for audit and finance committees and general oversight and reporting requirements.  We had a detailed engagement with the sector as a whole on developing this. </p> <p>  In terms of the specific issue of Youthreach, we updated our guidelines, having regard to what we what we have learned and we have ensured that all vocational education committees, now known as education and training boards, are aware of the requirements in place for Youthreach programmes.  </p></speech>

All our teachers are contracted as per Department of Education and Skills regulation.  This has never been an issue at post-primary level.  It is true that an issue arose in Youthreach Macroom.  When I inquired of the former executive of the County Cork VEC what had happened in that particular case where hours in excess of timetabled hours were worked, the co-ordinator responded that part-time teachers in Macroom were paid for attendance at staff meetings, substitution and attendance at in-service courses.  This should not have happened.  Once this was identified, Cork Education and Training Board and County Cork Vocational Education Committee ensured that the payment to teachers is reconciled to the timetables and made only for pre-approved hours.  The co-ordinator submits these hours before the start of the year and our finance department will only pay for the pre-approved contracted hours.</p></speech>

It is very important, however, that these matters are discussed in light of the report produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General.  I note that correspondence members received today is very critical of the former chief executives of County Cork VEC.  While they may not have been entirely to blame, does Mr. Owens accept that their actions made the resolution of problems at the VEC much more difficult?</p></speech>

I may have brought a fresh perspective to these particular instances.  To ensure that legal costs did not continue to rise, I sought to bring about a resolution of these cases.  I do not believe there are any major outstanding cases of staff dissatisfaction, cases for retrospective payments or human resources issues.  While there will always be human resource issues in an organisation which has 3,800 employees, I believe, to use the words of the Deputy, we have a happy camp in Cork Education and Training Board.</p></speech>

Perhaps that is not best practice but the files indicate that the acting CEO acted legal advice as to the best course of action.

That report was provided to us at the same time that it was provided to this committee and put into the public domain.  It was an effective piece of work in terms of identifying the shortcomings in the organisation.  The report was initially requested by the management of the VEC.</p> <p>  The Deputy asked Mr. Owens about two matters in particular, namely, the early retirement and the eligible learners.  At the time when the early retirement occurred, the Department had set out procedures for teachers and special needs assistants employed in VECs but not for the other categories of staff.  The VEC acted in the context of our guidelines and procedures but once we learned about the matter we immediately set out the procedures for other staff.  The staff member who retired was not a teacher.  In our comprehensive update of the Youthreach guidelines, we have addressed many of the issues discussed today, including the way in which Youthreach is managed, funded and staffed, as well as the recruitment and retention of learners and eligibility of non-EU nationals.  We have put in place detailed requirements in respect of each of these areas.</p></speech>

County Cork VEC initially examined its main centres of operation, which included Youthreach.  We now have a register of all properties occupied by Cork ETB for the delivery of our services in order to ensure the assets are managed in a professional, co-ordinated and efficient manner which provides maximum value for money.  We are trying to comply with the new property asset management delivery plan for better management of public property under the Government's public service reform programme.  We have put in place stricter controls regarding the renting and leasing of facilities to ensure compliance with the Act.  We currently occupy 137 properties from which we deliver our services.  We own 81 of these properties and the remaining 56 are held under various lease agreements, including licences and even agreements to rent a local hall for two hours per week.  We have notified the Department about every property we use and we are awaiting sanction for some of these properties.</p></speech>

There are 29 various centres, some of those schools and Youthreach centres would have held local bank accounts.  If teachers were collecting money for a trip abroad, for school books or uniforms, in some instances, there would have been locally held bank accounts.  We have now done a review of all our centres and we are in the process of trying to ensure that there are not any locally held bank accounts.  We are trying to close them down and we are encouraging people to make sure that all payments are made from head office and head office only.  Some of that tax settlement would have resulted from locally held bank accounts where they paid referees.</p></speech>

Our finance officer and our finance staff would be the credit controllers.  The schools which had locally held bank accounts would also have had to report to their boards of management in those particular instances.  The Department is anxious to ensure that no accounts of any sort are held at local level.  We have issued instructions to that effect.  For example, even if a school collects &euro;4,000 or &euro;5,00 for a trip to Spain or Italy, that money must be banked centrally, coded separately and paid out of that account.  We are also introducing an electronic payment system in all our schools and centres.  We are trying to cut out dealings in cash entirely.</p></speech>

In all our schools and colleges, apart from small items, as the Deputy mentioned - for example, going out to the local shop to buy X, Y or Z - everything is done by electronic payment.  We have an electronic payments system; no cheques are used in any of our schools and centres.  Everything is done from head office.  All payments and all procurement must go through head office.  There are very tight guidelines in place to ensure that there is proper authorisation at various levels.  All payments in Cork ETB are done centrally and by electronic means.</p></speech>

It was given to us by a generous donor at the time.  When the boat was received by Cork VEC a due diligence exercise was initially carried out and it put a group in place to consider whether it would be of use to the VEC.  It was used for four years or more for the purpose for which it was given.  However, boats can be expensive to maintain.  That boat had a very strict safety and passenger licence.  It was licensed to carry up to 12 passengers up to 12 miles offshore.  I do not think that is necessary any more.  We hope to use the boat.</p> <p>  We do a lot in this area in west Coast.  We can forget sail training, because that will not be done unless everything can be put in place, but we hope to use the boat for boat maintenance repair courses we run.  In the past F&Aacute;S ran some of those courses as did the VEC.  We can use the boat for teaching deck handling skills.  I can assure the Deputy that the boat will not cost a substantial amount of money.  A cost of &euro;150,000 was mentioned to put it right.  That boat is an iconic vessel and there is awful lot of goodwill towards it.  Between voluntary labour and donations from various groups, that boat might well sail again but not in the immediate future.  As to putting it back in the water, we have been stringent on funding and we spent &euro;2,500 to put it in the water.  That is the type of money that was being paid to keep it in dry storage.</p></speech>

There is no way that I would spend that kind of money on the boat but some work has been carried out on it.  The boat will not go to sea.  That kind of money will not be expended on it.  In terms of any moneys that would be expended, I would be seeking prior approval from the Department.  The boat is being used as a floating classroom.  That is the plan for the moment as well as for the type of activity that I spoke about in terms boat maintenance and seafaring skills.  Those are the type of activities that the VEC did, or the ETB now does, in west Cork.</p></speech>

The history of this boat is that it has been quite a while in dry dock.  It needs a plan of action as, regrettably, as it is not being utilised now and it is of benefit to nobody.</p></speech>

As I said, with minimum expenditure that boat could be put back in the water.  The easiest thing for me to say would be that we are going to scrap the boat.  We were given the boat, which is an extremely valuable possession.  I have no intention spending big money on it, but it can be used for the type of activities that I have described.</p></speech>

I mentioned earlier the potential amalgamation of the technological universities.  We had spoken about this prior to the witnesses coming into the committee rooms.  The publicised cost, between Dublin, Munster and the south east, has come to about &euro;3 million.  I refer to the costs of professional fees and pay associated with these processes.  We have planned to ask Mr. Kelly to attend.  There probably will be a time lag over the summer to allow the report to be issued.  Basically, he will appear before the committee, potentially with the presidents of the Waterford Institute of Technology and Carlow Institute of Technology.</p> <p>  I know why there were some delays even though this was promised to be finalised in April of this year.  It is now almost the middle of July.  I know the Minister has the report but can Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; give us some kind of timeline for the coming weeks?  The delay has become an issue; that is the way I would put it to the witnesses considering what is resting on this.</p></speech>

When I was here four weeks ago, the Deputy asked me a similar question.  The issue has progressed.  Since then, Mr. Kelly has completed his dialogue with the two institutions.  He submitted a report to the Minister and, indeed, met and briefed her.  This Minister's plan is now to consult her Cabinet colleges.  Following that, she plans to meet the presidents and chairmen on the two institutions together.  Following that, she would like to publish the report.  Her plan is to do all of that in the next couple of weeks.  Following the publication of the report, we will be able to talk about the plans for the next steps and so on.  Until she has had the opportunity to have the dialogue with her Cabinet colleagues, I cannot talk in any detail about those.  I am due back here in September with colleagues from the Higher Education Authority for the hearing we were possibly due to have today.  There will be an opportunity at that higher education meeting to talk about the progress.  I am not sure about Mr. Kelly's precise availability but I know he is on leave for the summer.  I hope he will be available for that.</p></speech>

Earlier in this meeting, we decided we would ask in the presidents of the various colleges concerned along with representatives from the Higher Education Authority and the Department.  I want to make particular reference to Carlow Institute of Technology and the fact that we received quite a significant amount of redacted material from the Department and an answer to a parliamentary question I asked on 7 July that I find totally unsatisfactory.  However, I intend to deal with that at the public hearing we have planned when all the players are before us, especially the presidents, Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and the HEA.</p> <p>  During today's meeting, we heard two opening statements, from Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; and Mr. Owens.  They reassure us about the future or about the period from now into the future.  I was taken aback by the fact that neither one dealt in any detail with the past and the horrendous lack of governance in the VEC over a long period under the eye of the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform and the Department of Education and Skills.  I find it shocking, given the number of lives and families that have been destroyed by some of the actions taken by individuals who were involved in some of the controversies in the VEC over those years, that no reference was made to them.  I would like to start from there.</p> <p>  The witness referred to the future system as being a well-organised, well-policed, regulated system.  The past must have been the Wild West from what I can read, and there must have been a complete absence on the part of the two Departments that oversee or should have been overseeing the sector comprising the VECs.</p> <p>  Is it correct that the nameplate on the door was changed from VEC to ETB? </p></speech>

There is no major change.  I see the names on these committees and the names that were on the committees.  For me, the only thing that has changed is the title "VEC", which has been changed to "ETB".  If those who were central to all of this ignored every letter from the Department, every muttering from within the system during these years of the Wild West, how can Mr. Owens expect them to change overnight the culture that they had all grown used to?</p></speech>

I would have pointed out to the audit committee that this was a particularly important function and that they had a huge oversight role, not just in terms of finance but in terms of systems and procedures.  However, this was a reserve function of the committee.  It was for members to decide who was on the committee - it was not my function.  I would have looked for people who had a finance background or knowledge in that area.  I recently advertised for members of the audit committee because, in the new audit committees, there must be three external members.  The Department has taken action in that regard.</p></speech>

Mr. Owens can go back to 2005.  Cases run on for seven years.  One case was settled for &euro;93,000.  I presume that is a single case.  I am sure it involved a cost to that individual and that family.  I am sure the cost of the trauma of facing a court and facing a battle with a State body was not easy.  These are the aspects I get concerned about.  That is why it is important the Department of Finance regulation or instruction be adhered to.  I am glad that Mr. Owens adhered to it.  I am pointing to the fact that this did not happen in the past and that it led to individuals' lives being ruined.  That is a cost that the Comptroller and Auditor General cannot tot up, but it is a cost that I am aware of because I meet these people.  I am absolutely horrified by a State agency doing so much damage to the lives of people.  How many more cases are there that are not settled?</p></speech>

Now we have the same board in place.  I do not cast any doubt over any of the members, but in terms of good governance, is there not a timeframe for length of service?  If I am not mistaken, some of the board members I have looked at are on the board of CIT as well, and have been for a number of years, which means there is cross-over.  Not alone is there cross-over, but there is also a cross-over from the time this was going on within the VEC to a time when there is a new nameplate on the door of the ETB.  As I read good governance and practice, there is a timeframe for service.  What we have seen is long service within the VEC, and when the new entity came in the individuals who had served for years were able to serve again because this is a new entity.</p></speech>

There was a mandatory finance committee and we added this one to it.  The change was enacted in legislation.  We further tried to improve the situation by introducing a code of governance and moving away from it being clearly members of the ETB to at least 50% external people, including the chair.</p></speech>

I am only making the point because of what happened in the past.  I am not saying anything is going on now.

It came from an individual who has had a long-standing battle with County Cork VEC.  He cites various issues in respect of the report of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  We have dealt with some of these, but I glanced down through it to determine if there are any other matters.  On page 11 of the report it states that there were 29 or 26 legal cases between 2010 and 2013.  However, he says that following his inquiries with the Department of Education and Skills on the number of legal cases in 2011, Joan Russell, acting CEO, on 24 February said that it was in the process of dealing with 11 current cases and had recently concluded five cases.  It raises the issue of the difference in the number of cases.  Perhaps you would clarify that for us and report back to the committee.</p></speech>

We have a series of different types of engagement with them.  I lead a meeting of senior officials of the Department with all 16 CEOs and the chief executive officer of the ETBI every three months or so.  We have established a programme board with nominees from the Department, SOLAS, and the ETB sector to manage the programme of change and we have a steering committee of senior officials in the Department to manage the programme of change.</p><p>The programme of change is wide-ranging and includes the establishment of shared services.  We are advancing with a shared service payroll at present.  We are still scoping out the possibility of a shared service for financial services, which would be very important in terms of enhancing the financial services.  We will probably make a call on the business case for that within the next two months or so.  We have also been working through the staffing of the organisations.  In most cases, there is an amalgamation of two units and sometimes three.  There actually are three single standing vocational education committees, VECs, that became education and training boards, ETBs, but, in addition, there is a transfer of training staff from the former F&Aacute;S, so there is a lot of change going on in this regard.  Clearly, there are efficiencies the ETBs can have through being a single organisation rather than a number of former organisations and it is a matter for the chief executive officer to manage this.  We have prioritised the filling of critical vacancies and have allowed for acting up education officers to be put in place.  We are now looking at putting in place a principal officer cadre within them and at having an approach to that.  We are in discussions with the sector about that at present.</p></speech>

The Minister has given a commitment that if, or when, we return to increasing capitation rates, the first call on any increase in capitation rates would be to enable the schools not to be obliged to fund that &euro;330 themselves.  A number of years ago, before the difficult financial circumstances, we actually had offered to pay that directly but the voluntary secondary schools liked the independence of paying some of their teaching staff.  That position has changed and they want us to pay it, so we are looking at that.

There are differences between the sectors.  The State carries the insurance costs of the community and comprehensive schools but, as members heard earlier, it is a charge in the case of the ETBs.  As this still is a live issue, as the Secretary General has stated, there is a first step we have agreed with the voluntary secondary schools that must be taken in regard to that pay disparity piece.  However, in looking at this, I have some reservations about the original analysis on whether it properly divorced out the school piece of the ETBs' business from their adult education and whatever else and that it may have factored in costs, so there is a piece there.  The way in which the moratorium applied probably has been more severe on the ETBs and the community and comprehensive schools in respect of their caretakers and secretaries because they were in posts, whereas the voluntary secondary schools continued to have their grant for that.</p></speech>

Approximately &euro;75 million of capital funds over the next five years has been provided to provide new schools in Cork.  In some cases, one has a situation in which the Department will look after the actual building project but in recent years, it has been the policy of the Department of Education and Skills to try to devolve projects out to schools.  In that particular instance, we are responsible from site purchase to the completion and consequently, there are heavy responsibilities in that regard.</p></speech>

The current five-year capital plan is very focused on demographic growth and the Minister plans a renewed capital plan for the next five years for the autumn, once the Government has in place an overall five-year capital investment programme.  The decisions on what goes on that are a matter for the Department.  I refer to the decisions on the mode of delivery, whether it is by public private partnerships, PPP, or is traditional whereby a design team is engaged by a school board of management, albeit in connection with the Department, whether it is arranged by or devolved to an ETB.  The National Development Finance Agency, NDFA, also has done some traditional buildings for us, as have the local authorities and the Office of Public Works.  There is a difference between the decision to go ahead and the decision on the manner of delivery.  The ETB has no decision-making role with regard to what major school buildings are chosen.</p></speech>

We would provide the direct funding for the second level schooling and, indeed, the small bit of primary schooling in the ETBs.

This is a new service level agreement.  Getting agreement is a contentious issue.  It is a new stream of funding and it is a new mechanism of training and qualification.  It will be a replacement for Youthreach in many ways because it is dealing with the apprenticeship area.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

It will deal with all funding outside of mainstream second level funding.  It is all further education and training funding, with the exception that the Secretary General has mentioned in terms of the remuneration of staff.  All funding for further education and training purposes will now emanate from SOLAS rather than directly from the Department of Education and Skills.</p></speech>

It is a fundamental shift in the level of apprenticeship, given the necessities and the skills demand.  With regard to the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Chairman of the Committee of Public Accounts, it is an entirely new way of operation for the boards.  It is not business as usual.</p></speech>

There are 33 VECs.  There is a shortfall in the number of training centres, so in five ETBs there is no training centre at present.  However, negotiations are ongoing on how the training provision can be provided in those particular ETBs, even though there is no training centre.</p></speech>

The board is determined by the legislation.  The legislation provides for 12 members that come from the county council, two parents, two people elected by the staff of the ETB and then there are five people who are co-opted.  What is new and different in this legislation compared to the previous legislation is that the Minister determines a number of bodies who can nominate to each, such as bodies like IBEC to reflect what the Deputy is talking about fundamentally.  The game change that has to go on here in training, apprenticeship and whatever else is for the board to have that type of input.  That is being provided for in how it can select.  It goes to what the Chairman was saying earlier.  It is a partial change.  It is not a change in the elected members coming from the local county council but it is a different way of doing the co-option.</p></speech>

The meeting today has given a huge vista regarding what not to do in the future.  That is why I am putting down a clear marker in that regard.  I have no doubt that Mr. Owens is doing a comprehensive job taking over that difficult situation in Cork.  Equally, he has an immense responsibility to ensure an example of the best management skills and integration of key management opportunities that the Department is recommending now.  For the Comptroller and Auditor General and the Secretary General of the Department it is important that this change is managed correctly.</p></speech>

I'm happy to be here with you this morning to assist you in whatever way I can in your important endeavour.  You have my written statement, which I'm happy to take as read, but before moving on to questions I'd like to make a brief few points about the nature of my work for the late Brian Lenihan.  </p>  <p>          As you said, Chairman, I was special adviser throughout his time in the Department of Finance.  Committee members may know that the legal definition of the role of special adviser is quite broad, and that the Minister to whom the adviser is accountable essentially writes his or her job spec.  In my case, my main duty was to advise Brian Lenihan on the communication of Government actions and decisions taken during the crisis, most of which were complex and difficult.  Throughout the crisis he was acutely conscious of the need to explain to the citizens the reasons for Government actions and the outcomes they were designed to achieve.  His specific objective was to tell the public what went wrong, what the Government was going to do about it and what the outcome of their actions would be.  To achieve that objective, I worked closely with officials in the Department of Finance, drafting and providing speeches, providing briefing for Oireachtas debates, drafting articles for print media and advising on media strategy.</p> <p> The particular job assigned to me by the then Minister was to work with officials and political colleagues in other Departments on the Government's response to the fiscal crisis.  Between mid-2008 and April 2011, Brian Lenihan introduced six separate sets of budget correction and in his constant battle to stabilise the public finances.  The banking crisis was a separate theatre of battle and initially I had no involvement at all in this area of the Minister's work.  Because of its highly confidential nature, particularly in the months before the guarantee, discussion relating to the banks was necessarily held tightly by a very small group of officials.  I had no role in any banking policy formulation during that period and I have no recollection of receiving any direct information about the banking matters.</p> <p> After the guarantee, my involvement in the banking side revolved around the communication of the actions and decisions that the Government had to take to rescue the banks.  I contributed to the drafting of speeches and I worked closely with colleagues in the press office preparing for media interviews and responding to the very significant number of media queries relating to the financial crisis in Ireland.  The Minister didn't ask me to play any role in the formulation of banking policy or to attend any banking meetings about decisions relating to the banks.  He did ask me, along with his press officer, to go to Government Buildings on the night of the guarantee so that we would be fully briefed for what media announcements might arise from the discussions that were taking place that night.  I played no part in those discussions and spent the night with other colleagues from the Taoiseach's office in adjoining offices.</p> <p> Mr. Chairman, in my written statement I have drawn on all the knowledge and information I have been able to assemble, much of it acquired after the events which the committee has asked me to address.  Seven years on from the onset of the crisis, I can't now definitively distinguish between my real-time knowledge of events and what I subsequently learned about them and I'd ask the committee to bear the possible distorting impact of this in mind when assessing the information contained in that submission.  I'm happy to take your questions.</p></speech>

Did the late Minister Brian Lenihan or any officials or political advisers ever discuss this prospect with you?</p></speech>

I can't remember exactly the date.  And he was worried about it and I was in my office working on something and he came in and asked me what, you know, he should do.

As you know the budget in that year had been brought forward to 14 October so that was where I was focused.  But on that occasion I suggested that he ring Ed Mulhall.</p></speech>

That's not in dispute.  But this idea that he was overruled ... I'm not sure, I'm not clear whether that was the Governor's own language or whether he was quoting the Minister.  </p>  <p>         It doesn't sound right to me, that he would say he was overruled because he had ... he knew how Government decisions were made.  I mean, the business of government is that you ... people get together ... I know there wasn't formally a Government meeting that night but the discussions that would have taken place between himself and the Taoiseach were, in their nature, a Government decision.  And he ... they would discuss matters and they would come to a position.  And Brian Lenihan would have known that once that decision was made, whatever your ... you argue the toss, you make your case and whatever happens, once the decision's made, your job is to go out and defend that decision and execute that decision, and that's what he did.  And, you know, there is no other way that Government can work, that is collective Cabinet responsibility.</p> <p> So I wouldn't ... it sounds strange to me that he would have said he was overruled.  I think I heard the evidence given by Dermot ... the chairman of ... Dermot Gleeson, and it sounds like something he would have said; the other didn't.  Maybe the Governor, in fairness, wasn't saying he was overruled, that might have been his language.  But I don't think that that's how he would-----</p></speech>

I mean, he had actually on the Wednesday morning done an interview when he said ... indicated that discussions were taking place at official level and things, you know, the matter was being explored.  But for reasons the Government didn't wish to narrow their options or weaken their hand, they wanted to keep their powder dry for negotiations which they expected to take place.

He's independent in the exercise of his duty."  He had appointed him as Governor and he got over it.  Now, I mean, it didn't have a serious impact, I think, on the discussions, you know, the possibility of, for instance, our corporate tax rate becoming an issue.  But that was in the days before Governor Honohan made his announcements.

We were operating in a very, very difficult environment because there was briefing in various European capitals, given by unnamed sources from institutions in Europe and it was extraordinarily difficult.

I mean when Olli Rehn was over after all just five days previously, they ... there was discussion around, at a meeting in advance of his press conference, around the idea of a precautionary bailout so that he would, you know, that we had our four-year plan, that it was something that would come from Government and that there would be supervision.

When Minister Lenihan ... you had been with Minister Lenihan through all his Ministries and you provide a unique insight.  He came in as Minister for Finance on 7 May 2008.

But he was surprised and he had been told, obviously.  He had been briefed about it when he entered the Department and the Taoiseach had ... would have told him and the Minister for ... as Minister for Finance he would have also briefed the Ministers about, you know, what was happening in terms of the economic indicators.  But the speed which it gathered pace, I mean, after that mini-budget, it was very clear by the time we came back in September that that wasn't enough.  Then therefore, there was the budget was brought forward to October.  The Department at that stage were indicating that the ... the returns could be down &euro;5 billion.

And the centre of activity, if you like, a lot of it took place in Government Buildings.  Social partnership was a key part of it and the Department was a bit sidelined.  But clearly when the crisis happened and when it really hit, that was front and centre of our minds.  They were back in the driving seat.

Nonetheless, when ... you know, once the crisis happened, the handling of the crisis was very good.  He had to knuckle down very quickly and the Department had to get used to this new Minister.  And I think the level ... the advice that ... you know, there was lots of ... there was for ... the NTMA was advising ... there was excellent advice.  I mean, he was taking advice, obviously, from the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank which proved not to be very good advice.  I think they all had to learn that, you know, that there were lacunae in the advice that was given.  He did seek advice outside.  He ... I know that Governor ... the then ... Professor Honohan - Patrick Honohan - was in on a number of occasions in those months leading up to the guarantee.  There were a number of ...

You say on page 4 of your document - and it echoes some of the discussion you had with Deputy O'Donnell just now - where you talk, in the fourth paragraph of your statement, about your relationship with the departmental officials, "From the knowledge I subsequently acquired it is clear that many of these advisers were hampered in their analysis of the crisis by their unswerving belief that our banks were fundamentally sound, and their failure to consider the possibility that their might be a crash rather than a soft landing in the Irish property market."  As the old examiner question used to be, discuss and expand on that.</p></speech>

I knew, obviously, this soft landing idea, that there wasn't going to be a crash and, that it was ... that had ... that was ... that had become a clich&eacute; of the time.  But I didn't realise the extent to which that had taken root and that it was an obstacle to ... it clearly was an obstacle to the advice that the officials gave, with simple reason that they hadn't allowed themselves to think beyond that it seemed to me.</p></speech>

But it was ... and I suppose the soundness of the banks was completely dependent on the property prices and ... because so much of their exposure was to property, although we didn't know the entire extent of the exposure at that stage.</p></speech>

But I mean the ... actually the media strategy was not to say anything that would undermine the banks and that was very important.  That would shake confidence.  So I mean I suppose, subsequently the ... arose out of that was the deposit guarantee, the change in the amount to be guaranteed by the deposit guarantee.  So that initiative arose out of that.  So the media strategy was actually not to say anything that would frighten the horses about the banks.</p></speech>

I remember actually the morning of ... the decision to increase the amount to be guaranteed and the deposit guarantee was taken on a Saturday morning and, obviously, ... sorry, the decision arose at a meeting the night before and, obviously, it was one of those meetings that all the various advisers had in the Department with the Minister on the Friday night because he rang me on that Friday night and he said, "There's to be an announcement tomorrow about the deposit guarantee.  There's a press release to go out.  Could you come in and make sure that the press release is okay?"  I went in.  I had no hand really in the press release because it was quite a technical matter and it was Kevin Cardiff who was involved in it but the Minister gave some interviews afterwards in Government Buildings and I remember I thought he handled it as well as he could.  And I remember turning to Kevin Cardiff and saying, "Was that okay?"  And he was very, very tense and said, "Any discussion about the banks at this stage in public is really problematic and difficult."  So I began to appreciate and understand the stress that they were operating under.  I mean, the discussions about the banks, as I said, in advance of the guarantee was very small, held very tightly among a very small group of officials - it had to be.  And it really was, I suppose post the guarantee, that people began to talk about it and that, in a way, made it easier, I suppose, for options to be explored.  There was exploration of options but when others were talking about it then and when it was out in the open, you know, I think it widened the range of advice.</p></speech>

Either you're afraid of markets and say, "Don't frighten the horses", or we say, "These are our rules on loans-to-deposits and loans-to-value these are rules of sectoral concentration.  We're putting them there and whether the market likes them or not, tough luck."  Were we afraid of markets more or less in that period?</p></speech>

Now in your witness statement, you say that it was also made clear by the ECB that Ireland and any other eurozone country with banking difficulties should do whatever was required to save their own banks.  When did you become aware of that and did you follow up with the Department of Foreign Affairs to advance our position or, I suppose, try to "re-Europeanise" the banking crisis rather than that "You're on your own" message?</p></speech>

I certainly though I wasn't aware of it before the bank guarantee, I certainly heard from Brian Lenihan afterwards and others that Mr. Trichet had been in contact to say, "You know, whatever you do, you must save your banks, stand by your banks."  And I think I wouldn't have known the detail but it was made clear that you should do that by yourselves, that there wasn't going to be any pan-European approach taken to this and that was the experience in other countries at the time.</p></speech>

They had a huge level of exposure to Ireland and they lent to Ireland at a very crucial time.  And that's true but I think his difficulty was that they didn't want to tell the markets they were lending to Ireland.  </p>  <p>         And that was the problem, that they ... they did so, but it was almost like the love that dare not speak its name.  They were ... they did support our banks but they didn't want to let anybody know about it and they weren't happy about the extent of their exposure.</p></speech>

I mean, clearly then there was huge dependence on ELA but I don't think that was the case before.  I don't know enough about it to say that that was the case before but I think it was when ... when the banks could no longer get money on the wholesale money markets that they had to rely on ELA.  But, I mean, the idea that it was a gateway drug, I mean, it was essential.  We couldn't possibly have taken on ... financed the banks by ourselves, the State.</p></speech>

Wasn't the counter-argument that Anglo had only a couple of hundred customers and, in fact, it was all in property and a lot of the property wasn't even in the country.  So that, you know, was there a case for either nationalisation or just letting it go?</p></speech>

I don't think anybody has suggested that ... well, some people have suggested, obviously, that you could have let Anglo go but I think nobody advising the Government at the time, and I think Governor Honohan, in his report, didn't contemplate the idea of letting Anglo go.  I don't think we could have done that.  And the fact that it was exposed to property to such an extent and that there were ... the number of borrowers was small, that their client base was small, that it was the size of the exposure that was the issue.  We couldn't have taken on that, the State.</p></speech>

I actually ... I didn't brief the Ministers.  I think that it might have been actually the Minister and the Taoiseach, or maybe the Government press secretary, who briefed the Ministers at the time.  Clearly what we were saying was that the Government wasn't in bailout negotiations.  Now, there were discussions going on at official level.  It's obvious that the message that the Ministers should have been given, we should have been nuanced to recognise that, but I think the anxiety not to confirm - because once you confirm, then your options for negotiation are greatly narrowed - blunted that.  It meant that the subtleties weren't gone into and that that was ... if you like, the message was just too blunt and it should have been more nuanced, clearly.</p></speech>

Was there ... and it was a short period as well, but other witnesses have ... you know, have wondered how did an extremely conservative banking system go so broke, as happened to the Irish one.

And, you know, that was, you know, I think it was a feature of the credit bubble, of the economic boom that was there, yes.

Can I just deal with one matter that Senator Barrett was discussing with you, Ms Herbert, and that goes back to the situation in regard to ... in your own statement, you say, "It had also been made clear by the ECB that Ireland, and any other Eurozone country with banking difficulties, should do whatever was required to save their own banks."  I just want to chase one line, actually, on that.  What was actually ... you're not a finance expert and your role before this committee, even though you can offer opinions as to what maybe the Minister Lenihan was thinking at the time, your expertise would be the area of communications.  Maybe if you could discuss what was the communication strategy that was to be developed by the Minister and the Department to counter what was maybe coming out of other quarters in the guarantee period?</p></speech>

Now there were ... I correct myself, there were options being prepared, for instance, the nationalisation, possible nationalisation of an institution.  And certainly there was, as I understand it, this is something I subsequently discovered, there was a communication strategy for, you know, for the possible nationalisation of an institution.  A communications strategy for customers, how you would communicate with customers, how you ... and announce it to the media.  So that was ... on the guarantee, I like ... I don't think that was considered until ... I mean it was considered, but it was ... as a real option that might happen was later on.</p></speech>

And also, then, to put a position in place to communicate how the guarantee was going to be operated?

I mean the ... to develop a communications strategy for, you know ... I mean, the decision that was taken on that night was taken in very stressed circumstances.  It was in emergency circumstances and therefore the communication of that decision directly from the Minister to people like Christine Lagarde, Gordon ... Alistair Darling in his case, that was done directly by him.  The Taoiseach spoke to Gordon Brown, I think.</p></speech>

Good morning, Ms Herbert.  Can I start by asking you about the decision to increase the deposit guarantee from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 on 20 September 2008?  Can you outline your knowledge of the events that led to that decision?</p></speech>

And I did.  The press release was being handled by Kevin Cardiff, he ... it was a short technical press release and then the Minister did some interviews in, as I remember it, in the forecourt of Government Buildings.  I discovered afterwards the background to the decision was concern about Irish Nationwide particularly, the impact and to reassure small depositors or relatively small depositors that their deposits were safe.  There was a general statement, I don't have it to hand, but it was to the effect that the Government would stand behind the banks.  That was also included in that.</p></speech>

Deputy O'Donnell asked you about the decision to guarantee the banks.  Did Minister Lenihan ever indicate any difference of opinion to you between himself and the Taoiseach as regards the approach with Anglo Irish Bank, that it should be nationalised as opposed to guaranteed?</p></speech>

I became aware of it afterwards, mainly through other officials who were there, and obviously ... I mean, it's clear now ... but, it didn't emerge to me as a problem and I think that if it had been a problem, if there had been a serious disagreement, in other words, if he felt he had been overruled in ... and if he was ... had a complaint, I would have known.

The national recovery plan, which was published around the time of the bailout in November 2010, when did the work start on that, Ms Herbert?</p></speech>

I think that the idea of it was mid-September, that we would do this and we talked to Europe and we really began in September.  It was quite an undertaking, he ... Brian Lenihan ... it was a group of officials who took charge of it and did the work, a group of us, a small enough group of us.  And the Minister, you know, oversaw that work regularly in intervals, he was extremely busy obviously on the banking thing but he was very keen that that should be a document that could be read by any citizen and that it would stand up and that people would understand what we had to do.</p></speech>

You say in your witness statement that "many of [the] advisers were hampered in their analysis of the crisis by their unswerving belief that our banks were fundamentally sound".  When it emerged subsequently in 2009, in 2010, when the full scale of the recapitalisation emerged, how ... did the Minister ever express any frustration to you as to the nature of that advice and the difficulty of getting to the bottom of the black hole in the banks?</p></speech>

They ...  I mean they were worried about the ... you know, exactly this whole idea that the banks were sound, they were sceptical of that that was the case.  Kevin Cardiff says that in his advice ... in his evidence, as well.  And they ... that's why they pushed for PwC to be brought in to - and the NTMA were also quite sceptical - to look at the banks.  And of course they came back with advice that was ... that they were actually sound and that ... and this was an ongoing difficulty.  I mean, the whole recapitalisation and getting to the end of what was happening inside the banks was a running sore throughout the crisis.  And it was ... he did express frustration but, I mean ... I think also that the situation was worsening as property prices went down.  Obviously the situation in the banks was getting worse but it was quite remarkable that the banks seemed to have such little handle, themselves, on their own exposures.</p></speech>

Was that ever discussed or considered?</p></speech>

He came in in May.  It may have been something that he was pushing for - I don't know - but very soon after the guarantee decision was taken, we had the ... PwC went into the banks and then the appointment of Jones Lang as well at a later stage to look at what they ... to look again at their analysis.  He was, I now know, concerned ... very concerned about Anglo and the growth in it and it was a big bank and that was the one ... that was the institution ... it and Irish Nationwide were the institutions that were most exposed.  And I think that that might have been why he ... I think ... my understanding from discussions we had - and I can't remember chapter and verse on it - was that that probably was what was behind his idea of nationalising Anglo.  It was to distinguish ... to draw a distinction between this bank and other banks.  I think he wanted to, for the reputation of the financial institutions, to say, "Okay, so these banks are bad and this is how we're going to deal with them but these are okay."  But of course at that stage he didn't have the benefit of knowing exactly how bad the other banks were, all our banks were.</p></speech>

So in terms of the bailout and the lead up to the bailout in November 2010, to what extent was the Minister unhappy with the level of public knowledge which emerged?  And obviously when Governor Honohan made the phone call to RTE and the IMF arrived in town on, I think, 18 November, the whole thing blew up.  But what was the Minister's view?  What ... was he trying to, in a sense, maximise the negotiating position of the Government or why was there an element of not telling the public fully about the preliminary negotiations which were going on?</p></speech>

And I think Brian Lenihan knew that maybe we would need ... we would end up at some stage in a bailout.  But he was anxious, if he could, and he fought for a long time to do it, to see if we could get this idea of a precautionary bailout, that we would implement the decisions ourselves under intense supervision.  We had our plan almost complete at that stage and that's what he wanted to do.  And I don't suppose there's any Minister for Finance that gladly embraces the idea of a bailout, you know, and I think he had fought a hard battle to try and keep the country out of a bailout and then, ultimately, that's what happened.  And naturally there was a reluctance on the part of the Government generally, I would imagine.</p></speech>

He was very concerned about the fact that there was no clarity in what was going ... what the proposal was to deal with our banks.  He was very concerned about that.  He had been listening to the Central ... to the ECB since September talking about urging "greater fiscal appetite", as they called it, and he didn't see the connection between what ... he just didn't see how that was going to end up helping our banks.  He realised that the ... you know, here they were saying that they were very unhappy about the extent of ELA, threatening to withdraw ELA and, at the same time, no plan to provide us with a way of dealing with our banks, and it was essential that we had.  And "greater fiscal appetite" was not going to do that.  He knew that.</p></speech>

In a way, it was like as if ... Europe, generally, the institutions, you know, that they didn't ... they only fitfully took an interest.  And the ECB didn't seem to take an interest.  They weren't particularly interested in our banks and our problems and, obviously, the fact that the ELA had to be approved on a fortnightly basis, I think that inevitably meant that, you know, that they were very conscious of it.  But they weren't looking at our entire banking problem and taking an interest and helping us how to solve it.</p></speech>

Can I just remind members there with regard to phone distortion, because we have a tight, kind of, schedule today and questions have been allocated on a rotation of five, other members may not be asking questions in particular sessions, but there's a lot of phone distortion coming in.  I'm asking members to turn off their phones.  It's not acceptable to have your phone active when another member is actually speaking because it's distorting a communication next to them and it's unfair.  It's bad for the broadcasting and we actually have members of the public complaining this morning, actually, about it.  So turn off the phones and if I see members with their phones I'll just publicly name them from here on out because it's an ongoing cause of annoyance.  So my apologies to Deputy McGrath if there was any distortion in that regard.  Deputy Doherty.</p></speech>

And Minister Lenihan at the time said, as he was confirming the negotiations were beginning - or the discussions were beginning - with the IMF, he said, "The problems we are facing do not relate to our budgetary position ... It is important to understand that the problems we are addressing are of a structural character in the banking system.", i.e., the reason we are having these discussions is because of our banks.  Is that the view ... was that your view and Brian Lenihan's view, personally?</p></speech>

I think it was &euro;14 billion ... &euro;15 billion at that stage.  We had been in negotiations with the ... with the ... supervised by, if you like, the Commission and the ECB on what was ... what was to be done in the next budget.  It was to be &euro;6 billion.  And we had our four-year plan so, you know, we ... we had a handle on what to do about our budgetary position.  We ... we had taken action right throughout the crisis.</p></speech>

And we know the discussions and negotiations went on for a number of days.  The previous day, Minister Batt O'Keeffe said this was about playing a game of poker.  What was the Minister's view in relation to the type of negotiations that the Government or the officials were entering into with the IMF and the troika?

They were very serious negotiations.  I think that the thing that ... I know that what weighed most heavily on him was what was going to be the proposal for the banks.  It became clear pretty quickly that they were happy with our proposals for dealing with the public finances.  But what was going to happen the banks ... and that was a game of poker it was, like, it was very difficult.  We had had the background of the ECB saying that they were going to stop the ELA, that they were unhappy about the extent of the exposure.  But it wasn't clear what solution that they were going to propose.  In the end, of course, they continued with the ELA but, I mean, there was ... the proposals for restructuring, for instance, how quickly that would have to be achieved.  That was their first engagement, really, seriously with our banking crisis.</p></speech>

Was it not the troika that insisted that the Government set aside &euro;35 billion to deal with that hole that the Government were unwilling to face up to up until that time?  That was the actual essence of the troika programme, as Brian Lenihan said, that the structural character, the problems we're having is a banking ... is in the banking system, not budgetary.</p></speech>

And, I mean, the NAMA process obviously was going to crystalise a lot of losses for the banks.  And that situation ... so it was ... it was a rolling situation.  </p>  <p>         And then the proposal for ... from the ... in the bailout to, if you like, stuff the banks with money to shore up ... or to bring back market confidence, that was a proposal that was, you know, it was one way of doing it.  But the Minister would have liked, as you know, and the Government would have liked to ... some burden sharing at that time that would lessen the amount of money that would have to be put into the banks.</p></speech>

But Minister ... or Governor Honohan in his own report says that Anglo Irish Bank and Irish Nationwide were heading towards insolvency at the time of the guarantee.  The Government's sums were saying that they didn't require any money.  How can you say that they ... that you didn't get the sums right?</p></speech>

So with the amount kept under ... I think it started at seven and it came down to ... maybe eight actually and it came down to six.  So there was ... it was general discussion.

But he just said that there ... the banks and there's a meeting tonight and something may come out of it and, you know, would you come over?

Mr. Cardiff, in his witness statement, commented to this inquiry - I think he commented on the Jean-Claude Trichet letter of 19 November 2010, to the late Minister for Finance - and in many ways he, Mr. Cardiff ... Mr. Cardiff's commentary, in many ways "the letter was entirely superfluous since it was already clear by the time of the letter that the Government was going to opt into a programme".  Is that also your understanding at that time, that the Government was going into a programme?</p></speech>

It's just come up there now in a moment, from Olli Rehn that maybe a bailout programme could be avoided, and then Mr. Buti is more or less taking a certainty position that a bailout programme is going to happen.  I just, it says ... it's half way down the page there - this is the visit of the 27th September that we referred to earlier with yourself and Ms Nolan, Mr. Ahearne, Mr. McGrath and yourself:</p> <blockquote> 	Certainly, after spending some time with him alone, Lenihan told me that Commissioner Rehn thought it was still on balance more likely than not that a bailout could be avoided &ndash; though it had to be considered a possibility &ndash; even, according to Lenihan, suggesting that the Portuguese were a more likely candidate for bail-out at that stage than was Ireland. But Marco Buti, who reported directly to Rehn, told me separately that it was his personal view that a bailout would probably on balance be required. He was not advocating it, at this stage, merely giving an opinion on the likely turn of events. </blockquote>  <p>  </p>  <p>               So, does that concur with your own view that we were heading to a bailout programme-----</p></speech>

Brian Lenihan said that afterwards, in that interview that he did in the BBC, that there was always a danger but he had fought hard to avoid it, and he thought, he said, that on balance it might have been in the spring, depending on what the reaction was, the spring of the following ... of 2011.  The situation was, for instance, in Portugal, they didn't enter a bailout until some time later, but I suppose the thing is, it may have been postponing what was inevitable.</p></speech>

I think this was something that developed in September.  I think Kevin Cardiff actually refers to it in his evidence as well, they were becoming more doubtful about the nature of the advice.  They knew that the advice from the Financial Regulator, the Financial Regulator was relying on the banks for advice, so they began to wonder, and that I think was the impetus for the PwC report.</p></speech>

In regard to the corporation tax issue there, I was going to raise it myself with you anyway, was there really anything new with regard to other European partners' concerns with regard to Ireland's corporation tax?  There's plenty of records showing that many governments were ... had their noses out of joint about it.  The Commission had a position on it but we know under EU law that the sovereign position on taxation remained and actually remained right through the restructuring programme and all the rest of it.  So what was it ... was there anything different with regard to what you were hearing from Europe with regard to the corporation tax as we were going into that period?</p></speech>

We were in a difficult ... that was precisely the issue, they were saying "Okay, if we're going to bail you out we want make changes on this."  I mean Olli Rehn, when he came over on 8 November, he said we needed to look at our taxation.</p></speech>

Marco Buti, somebody referred to him earlier ... Marco Buti did mention, in Kevin Cardiff's evidence, he had a discussion on that weekend they were over before the bailout actually happened, where he said he did think it was unrealistic that we could hold on to our corporation tax.

The Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis is now resuming in public session.  Can I ask members and those in the public Gallery to ensure that their mobile devices are switched off.  At our next session we will hear from Mr. Derek Quinlan, former executive chairman and founder of Quinlan Private.  This is the first of several sessions at which the inquiry will focus upon the relationships of the property development companies and their principal financial institutions.</p><p>Derek Quinlan founded the business which was to become known as Quinlan Private in May 1989.  He has been involved in significant investment and development in the United Kingdom, Ireland and several other European locations over a 25-year period.  He acted as both principal and adviser in some of the most significant real estate investments of the last 14 years.  Mr. Quinlan retired as chairman and founding partner of Quinlan Private in May 2009.  Mr. Quinlan, you're welcome before the committee this afternoon.</p><p>Before hearing from the witness, I wish to advise the witness that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If you are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter and you continue to so do, you are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of your evidence.  You are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given.  I would remind members and those present that there are currently criminal proceedings ongoing and further criminal proceedings are scheduled during the lifetime of the inquiry which overlap with the subject matter of the inquiry.  Therefore, the utmost caution should be taken not to prejudice those proceedings.  </p><p>Members of the public are reminded that photography is prohibited in the committee room.  To assist the smooth running of the inquiry, we will display certain documents on the screens here in the committee room.  For those sitting in the Gallery, these documents will be displayed on the screens to your left and right.  Members of the public and journalists are reminded that these documents are confidential and they should not publish any of the documents so displayed.  </p><p>The witness has been directed to attend this meeting of the Joint Committee of Inquiry into the Banking Crisis.  You have been furnished with booklets and core documents.  These are before the committee, will be relied upon in questioning and form part of the evidence of the inquiry.  So with that said, if I can now ask the clerk to administer the oath to Mr. Quinlan please.</p></speech>

Good morning, Chairman, and inquiry members.  I have furnished the committee with a written statement in accordance with a request made to me.  I don't intend to quote from this statement but will welcome the opportunity to make some additional comments to the inquiry.</p>  <p>  It may be of assistance if I begin by providing the committee with a short introduction of myself so that I may outline my financial background and experience.  In 1970 I graduated from University College Dublin with a bachelor of commerce degree.  Subsequently I trained at Cooper Brothers and Co., now known as PricewaterhouseCoopers, where I qualified as a chartered accountant in 1973.  </p>  <p>         While at Cooper Brothers and Co., I worked in their tax department.  In 1975 I successfully applied to the Civil Service Commission and became an inspector of taxes, where I stayed for six years.  In August 1981 I was made a tax partner at John Woods and Co., now known as Grant Thornton.  In May 1986 I formed Quinlan Ryan, a small chartered accountancy firm, with two partners, and the firm remained in existence for three years.  In May 1989 I commenced trading as a chartered accountant under the title &quot;Derek M. Quinlan, Chartered Accountant&quot;.  In 1990 I put together a deal to purchase a number of units in the recently opened Square shopping centre in Tallaght, Dublin.  This was my first significant property deal on behalf of clients.  Other significant investments took place during the 1990s, including an investment of approximately &euro;250 million in the IFSC.<br/><br/>The committee will have noted from my statement that I refer to the ... the activities of Quinlan Private, as I was asked to provide a statement regarding my company.  I believe it is important to note that I would have personally invested in a large number of the investments put together by Quinlan Private.  I would also have invested personally in other investments.  The committee has, I'm sure, at this stage heard from other witnesses that, with hindsight, the growth in the Irish property market from 2001 to 2008 was enormous.  It is now clear, for a number of reasons that were then unknown to me - and, I believe, to the majority of people at that time - that this growth was unsustainable.  I genuinely did not believe that the market was in danger of collapse until I heard of the fall of Lehman Brothers in September 2008.<br/><br/>In my opinion there are three key areas which I feel are important in the context of the inquiry.  During the period 2002 to 2007 there was a huge &quot;feel good&quot; factor in play in Ireland and most people bought into this reality, including myself.  There were very few opposing views.  This was just not an Irish phenomenon, it was actually international.  In his book <i>The Map and the Territory</i>, published in 2014, Alan Greenspan, the former chairman of the American Federal Reserve said:</p><blockquote>	The Federal Reserve['s] ... highly sophisticated forecasting system did not foresee a recession until the crisis hit.  Nor [he continued] did the [...] forecasting model developed by the [...] [IMF], which concluded as late as spring 2007 that [the] &quot;[...] economic risks had declined since September 2006 [and that] [...] signs everywhere were encouraging.&quot; </blockquote> <p>The second point I'd like to make, I did not realise that the long-term bank finance being provided by the Irish banks was being funded on short-term borrowings from international banks and others.  This model was clearly not sustainable.  If I had known this at the time, I certainly would not have invested in Irish property.  Finally, I was not aware - and I believe that most people were not aware - of what was going on internationally with sub-prime lending in the United States.  This had, I believe, a huge impact on both the Irish and international banking sector, as liquidity dried up in a very short period of time.<br/><br/>I believe it's important to note that Quinlan Private invested in quality commercial properties.  These were in prime locations.  I have a fundamental philosophy in relation to property investment which is based on four main tenets: location; timing; liquidity; and confidence.  It is clear, in Ireland, that, at the one time, all of these factors were decimated.  I did not foresee this.  I don't believe it would have been reasonable to do so.  Neither the Irish banks nor the Ministers for Finance nor the Economic and Social Research Institute knew that the banking crisis was imminent.  Rather, all parties envisaged a very bright future for the Irish economy and the Government of the day continued with high expenditure to fit in with that forecast.<br/><br/>I would like to conclude by taking this opportunity to state that I am deeply saddened at the fallout from the banking crisis.  I recognise that, for a very large number of people in Ireland, it has had an unprecedented and devastating impact.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Quinlan.  Mr. Quinlan, the banking inquiry is for the purpose of, and I quote from the terms of reference, "to inquire into the reasons Ireland experienced a systemic banking crisis, including the political, economic, social, cultural, financial and behavioural factors and policies which impacted on or contributed to the crisis".  Now, in your opening statement, Mr. Quinlan, you say it's not accurate to call you a property developer.  But can you give the inquiry any insights into how the activities of people like yourself - however you would describe yourself - and companies and partnerships, like Quinlan Private, impacted on or contributed to the crisis?</p></speech>

I can only ... I can't answer for anybody else, Deputy, but, I mean, we were not aware that ... I say hindsight is 20/20 vision, we were not aware how bad things were in 2008 or 2007, in fact.  And, as I said in my opening statement there, the sub-prime crisis in America, nobody here could spell "sub-prime", you know, there was no sub ... what was known as sub-prime lending that took place in America ... was taking place in Ireland.  And that had a devastating effect on liquidity in the banks and it came very quickly.  And, as I quoted from my opening statement, Alan Greenspan, who was 19 years the chairman of the Federal Reserve, said that their own systems didn't forecast the dreadful happening that was going to happen in the financial world.</p></speech>

Mr. Quinlan, on page 5 of your ... your written statement, you gave us a table showing what seems to be exponential growth of the total property assets under management.  </p>  <p>               And if I just take an example there of...  for example, in 2003, your total assets is &euro;1.6 billion, which is a 43% increase over 2002; 2004 &euro;3 billion, which is 83% over 2003; 2005 is an increase of 41%; and then you say that, I think, your total assets were about &euro;10 billion probably by 2008, which would be another 136%.  So from 2000 to 2008, Quinlan Private went from &euro;602 million to &euro;10 billion - a growth rate of 1,561%.  Looking back on that, is that an astonishing rate of growth of your assets?</p></speech>

We were involved with Deutsche Bank in the refinancing.  They had fixed assets on their ... they had property assets on their balance sheet and, in 2002, Deutsche Bank, for the first time, I believe, in a long time, maybe in their history, lost money and the advice from their advisers to the board of the bank was they have to get rid of their property that was on the balance sheet and also to get rid of their private equity business because Deutsche Bank would have been famous for holding investments in companies like Mercedes-Benz, Siemens and other well known German companies.  So they had to sell this property and we were involved in the refinancing of that.</p></speech>

Now on page 3 of your opening statement, Mr. Quinlan, you say, "Anglo Irish Bank was Quinlan Private's principal financial institution".  And Anglo's assets growth, which we've had evidence about in the course of the inquiry, would kind of mirror to some extent, the rate of growth of Quinlan Private.  For example, in 2004, you don't ... I will just allude quickly to these figures.  In 2004, Anglo's assets grew by 34.5%; 2005, 44.4%; 2006, 32%.  So Anglo was growing exponentially, obviously, with much greater loans outside of Quinlan Private.  Can you see a relationship between what was going on with Quinlan Private and with Anglo Irish at the time?</p></speech>

Oliver Wyman in January 2006 at the World Economic Forum in Davos - Oliver Wyman - I will explain who they are in one moment - described Anglo Irish Bank as "the world's top performing bank" in a report called "State of the World's Financial Services Industry" presented at the World Economic Forum.  Oliver Wyman is a global managing consulting group with 3,700 professionals.  It is part of a bigger group called Marsh and McLennan, which is quoted on the New York Stock Exchange and has a market capitalisation of &euro;31 billion.  In fact, I see a note from Davy Stockbrokers in 2003 quoting, in relation to Anglo Irish Bank, "A phenomenon in the European banking sector, excellent and tightly knit management team, a simple and ruthlessly pursued business model, an entrepreneurial culture which is rare in a bank."  I am just quoting two things in relation to the bank so I can't comment about ... you know, I haven't followed the statistics that you are saying in relation to the bank but I would have said that all the banks were showing exponential growth.</p></speech>

But can I put to you then what Governor Honohan of the Central Bank said in relation to this type of growth:</p> <blockquote> 	A very simple warning sign used by most regulators to identify a bank exposed to increased risk is rapid balance sheet growth.  An annual growth rate of 20% is often taken as a trigger.  Each of the locally controlled banks had at least one year in which this threshold was triggered.  One of them Anglo crossed it eight out of nine years and indeed this average annual growth rate was 36% from 1998 to 2007. </blockquote>  <p>And other witnesses here reference alarm at that level of growth.  Were you alarmed by the level of growth in the banks that you were dealing with, of their lending?  And, indeed, had you any worries about your own amount of exposure?</p></speech>

So if you buy a property for &euro;1 million and you invest &euro;1 million in it so there is no borrowing and the property is producing, we will say, 7%, you're getting a 7% return on your &euro;1 million.  But if, in fact, you can gear that and put in half a million bank debt, which would be comfortable, assuming that the level that the interest rates were at the moment, then you are improving the return on your equity because after 12 months, if you sell the property, we'll say, for &euro;1.1 million, then there is a much higher return on your equity because you have only &euro;500,000 of equity in there.  You're earning 20% on your equity in a year.  So people in, not alone in property companies, publicly quoted companies, everybody uses bank debt to ... They need bank debt.</p></speech>

It is the recipe that the institutions follow which produces the worst losses, is most likely to cause hyperinflated bubbles, is most likely to cause catastrophic individual losses, and is most likely to cause future crises.  I am speaking about the past throughout the world, but my focus is going forward in Ireland with regard to policies the committee might consider recommending.  The recipe has four ingredients: grow like crazy; make terrible quality loans - not kind of bad but absolutely terrible and obvious on their face loans; while employing extreme leverage, which means a whole lot of debt compared to equity; and while setting aside no meaningful loss reserves for the inevitable catastrophic losses which will follow. </blockquote>  <p>And just the next paragraph:</p> <blockquote> 	these four ingredients are followed it is mathematically guaranteed - and let me emphasise it is not hypothetical but mathematically guaranteed given how ... accounting works - there will be three ... things.  The bank will report, almost immediately, record profits.  Under modern executive compensation the senior leadership will promptly be made wealthy but many other people in the food chain will also be made wealthy because the same perverse incentive structures are used to ensure they make those really crappy loans I talked about.  The third sure thing is that down the road there will be catastrophic losses. </blockquote></speech>

What I'm saying, in hindsight, of course one can look back and say, you know ... but a lot of people at the time, Deputy, and I want to just ... just to put this in context, the ... sorry, I apologise, I just need to get my paper out.  A lot of people mistook what was happening in the market place and including those who internationally were extremely well advised.  The chairman of the Federal Reserve, in 2007, felt that $100 million ... billion was going to be the sub-prime losses.  This is the chairman of the Federal Reserve in 2007.  Now, that was around February 2007.  Now, the chairman of the Federal Reserve, they have a wonderful system, as I refer to it back here about Alan Greenspan, they did not see this coming.  Now, that was in March 2007 where, you know, the Federal Reserve, the biggest Government bank, as I understand it, in the world did not see it coming while, within a very short period of time, in May 2008, the Swiss bank UBS announced that they had $37 billion worth of write-downs due to their holdings of the US mortgages.  It's a very short period of time.  It's ... I know it's just ... it's over a year, but there's the chairman saying ... so, it's very difficult to say ... because we're taking this in extract, I'm taking in extract, what I have found international commentators were commenting on the market.  In hindsight, there is no doubt about it that some of the comments that are here are valid for not alone in Ireland but elsewhere.</p></speech>

Do you think that that is morally in the interest of society, that that type of gain could be made on land speculation?</p></speech>

When we bought that site initially, our intention was to put a hospital out there and bringing in an international, US operator to build a hospital that would have student facilities; in other words for students in UCD or College of Surgeons could go there and I travelled to California to meet these people.  And I said, "We want to build a new hospital with new facilities, big accident and emergency, everything there" and we spent a lot of time looking at this before we looked at any alternative.  And what happened was that these people came here ... now, the investment in this hospital and for Ireland would have been huge, hundreds and hundreds of millions, to build a completely new, standalone student hospital that would teach students, the best accident and emergency and American facilities.  And they arrived in Ireland and they went straight to the VHI and the VHI said, "Build the hospital first and then we'll see whether we'll give you accreditation."  So that was our plan-----</p></speech>

But these would be people who worked on a voluntary basis for Fine Gael or whoever and rang up and said, "We're having a golf outing we'd like you to put in a team."  And that's the basis we did it.

And you talk about Quinlan Private clients on page 7 of your statement.  And I'm just wondering, how did that emerge?  Where did the private clients start to come from and what attracted you to that aspect of business, given that your first deal was, if you like, pure property?</p></speech>

I started off in 1989 having had eight years experience in private practice as a chartered account.  So, I wasn't starting afresh and I started off with a small nucleus of clients.  And it was very tough.  And I decided at the time that we would offer our clients a different service.  And what I mean by that is that no firm was building financial models to show clients where they could be giving them any kind of forecast, where they could be in five years time or three years time or whatever.  And I believe we were the first people to do that.  To actually say, "This is a forecast of where you're likely to be."  And as a result of that we attracted, it was purely by word of mouth, more clients.</p></speech>

And I'm just looking at your property portfolio there during that period, and it says 13% in office space and 6% in retail, which is about 20% of the portfolio.

Ireland and the UK are unique in having this concept of upward-only rent reviews.  I mean, when I started in 1990, there were 35-year leases with no breaks and upward-only reviews.  That is completely different on the Continent where the typical lease is three years.  And obviously from the bank's perspective where you have a tenant tied in for 15 or 20 years, the prospect is a much better one because, if you look at what happens on the Continent, a tenant can move after three years; they've no obligation after three years to stay in a particular property.

I think one of the main things, as I said to you, was what happened with sub-prime lending.  If we were sitting here ten years ago, nobody would have heard the words "sub-prime lending".  And this has had a huge impact.  I'm giving you the example about UBS, a sophisticated international bank that ... one minute the chairman of the Federal Reserve is saying, "This is a $100 million problem", and the next thing we see UBS writing off billions, over $30 billion.  Nobody knew the extent of that crisis.  </p>  <p>         The whole world could have imploded in September 2008.  The financial world was in a very bad state at that point in time.</p></speech>

Can I ask: when sourcing finance for a particular deal, from let's say Anglo Irish Bank or Deutsche Bank or whatever bank, somebody is operating with a syndicate at high levels of finance, like your own company, for example, was the relation very personal, was it a case of lifting the phone, or did you fill out an application form?  What way did you approach, for example, Anglo Irish Bank?</p></speech>

I mean, there was no special way of approaching, you know, there was no differential between approaching Deutsche Bank, as you mentioned, or Anglo Irish Bank or AIB, it was all approached in the same way.  So, a business proposition would have been put together in relation to the property, the property having gone through, in our case, an investment committee process before we went to a bank.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. Quinlan.  I just want to ask you, actually, at first, you made reference earlier on to sub-prime and you said it didn't exist in Ireland.  It was a very marginal thing in Ireland but, I mean, there was some sub-prime lending into commercial ... residential property, in particular, in the Irish economy.  </p>  <p>               A number of institutions with a loan value of less than 2% of the overall figure.  I won't name them, but I think it was peripheral but I don't think you were deliberately trying to state something that was untrue.  Can I ask you, in relation to your opening statement, you said that you only had a "high level overview" to quote directly, of Quinlan Private's interaction with financial institutions.  How, seeing as you were the executive chairman, did you only have a high level-----</p></speech>

I mean, we have had tax reliefs in Ireland for a very long period of time.  Remember farmers paid no tax up to 19... up to the middle 1970s which was, you know, you can have your own views on that.  And I believe that the tax reliefs that were introduced I think in the 1987 budget did a huge amount for Ireland.

So as I say, I gave you the example of George's Dock 2, which we paid &euro;24 million for in November 1996.  Nobody would have believed that that was only going to be worth &euro;15 million.  I had the same tenants in there in 2010.  That's what happened and we are unique in Ireland, unfortunately, the drop in prices here is, you know ... was unprecedented anywhere else that I am aware of in Europe.</p></speech>

I have a question.  It's a general NAMA question, not a specific one and I know I don't want to get into your own details but the banks valued loans on an amortised basis as they were originators of the loans and NAMA, on the acquisition of the loans, valued them on a fair or true market value basis.  As a result, the aggregate loans came to be valued at &euro;31.8 billion by NAMA in contrast to &euro;74 billion value estimated by the banks.  From your perspective, do you regard the valuation methodology applied in the pre-crisis period as having been sufficiently robust and representative?</p></speech>

One is the ... and I want to ... concentrating on the business model in general terms.  The Central Bank in the assessment of the valuation processes that were carried out, commented that ''Credit institutions were often negligent and imprudent in the manner in which they requested property valuations."  And they then went on to say "There was often a lack of specificity attaching to requests for valuations or inadequate or inappropriate assumptions provided."  In your own experience and having been a very, very significant person in the construction-development industry in this country, could you maybe comment or give us your insight and I'm not looking for the specific institutions, I'm looking at the operation of the business model?  Did you ever encounter that the valuation processes had weaknesses as identified there by the Central Bank or, if so, how widespread or otherwise was that practice in your experience?</p></speech>

So the bank would have had independent ... would have had, generally, an independent view of the property that was being acquired.  They got somebody independently to value it.  And they put in what they would call a loan-to-value test.  Not in every loan agreement but in most of them.  And, let us say, it was 70% ... just call it a 70% loan-to-value.  If the value of the property fell, the bank would have been on to say, "You need to put some more money in here because the loan-to-value test has been broken."</p></speech>

The other two matters I want to deal with you is that evidence has been provided to this inquiry to the effect that a discount of 5.2% was applied to the long-term value of properties to provide for due diligence, 0.25%, and enforcement costs of 5%, making up the total of the 5.25% of enforcement costs incurred or likely to be incurred by NAMA.

In your dealings with the banks did you notice growing competition between them for business with you?  And was growing market share, in your view, a dominant issue within the lending institutions?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.2374" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Derek Quinlan" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070900002#JJ04100"><p>I think ... not alone with me, Deputy, but I think that the banks, their loan books increased very significantly in the period we're talking about.  And the banks were, as I gave you the story of the executive who parked outside a particular bank on St. Stephen's Green on a Friday, he was there ... he was very proud to tell me he was there to see who was coming in and out of Anglo Irish Bank.</p></speech>

Secondly, Mr. Quinlan, a narrative of some witnesses to the inquiry is that the excessive lending by banks to fund property speculation and dealing created a massive bubble which crashed, that the Irish people were saddled consequently with &euro;64 billion of a burden to bail out the failed banks and developers.  Now, the inquiry has no legal powers to ask you in relation to detailed dealings with NAMA but have you reflected on what Quinlan Private may have cost the taxpayer?  Do you take responsibility for that?  And what do you say to the Irish people who have suffered considerable austerity and suffering as a result of this crash?</p></speech>

Very saddened.  But I, too, have lost a substantial amount of money.  I'm very saddened for those who have been saddled with negative equity.  But, as I explained earlier, we were not in the residential market.</p></speech>

And in ... as you know, Independent Newspapers sponsored annual property awards which they gave out at glittering gala evenings.  In 2007 you were awarded the Irish investor of the year, you were awarded the Irish property personality of the year, and the Irish property deal of the year was the Irish Glass Bottle site.  Are you proud or embarrassed of that range of awards?</p></speech>

Just your earlier comments there, maybe just to kind of to round off Deputy Higgins's question, you said there was a massive feel-good factor back at the time, almost euphoric, I suppose, is the way some people might describe it in lots of ways.

That's fine.  That's fine.  And, finally, again in relation, you've mentioned a couple of times the Four Seasons purchase, the hotel.  And again that was reported as ... because of the tax breaks that surrounded that particular deal, that the tax saved, if you like, or lost by the State, depending on which way you look at it, was estimated at just under &euro;20 million.  And again I know ... perfectly, those tax breaks existed and were there, was that part of the attraction for doing that deal?</p></speech>

But the reality at the time was that the then developers of the hotel in the year 2000 went wallop when the hotel was maybe 75% built.  And the partners and the Four Seasons had to put up more money to get the hotel built.  And I believed, I mean, I don't know, I was very proud of the fact that the Four Seasons, who are recognised as one of the foremost hotel groups in the world, were coming to Ireland and that I was in the lucky position to assist and to facilitate them.  And they definitely raised the standard, Senator, in my opinion, right across the board.</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Chairman, and inquiry members.  In this brief opening statement, you have asked me to address from my perspective as the finance director of the NTMA during 2007 and 2008, the following lines of inquiry: appropriateness of the relationships between Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector; adequacy of the assessment of both solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions and sector; appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision; and appropriateness of any expert advice sought, quality of analysis and how effective this advice was used.<br/><br/>Appropriateness of relationship between Government, the Oireachtas, banking and the property sector and adequacy of assessment of solvency and liquidity risks.  As advised to the inquiry's investigation team in advance of this submission, in my position as NTMA director of finance, I have no particular insights in the nature of relationships between the Government, the wider political system and the banking and property sectors up to 2008 and therefore I do not believe I am qualified to comment on or add to the first-hand testimony on this topic that has already been provided to the inquiry by other witnesses.  I am not that well-positioned to opine on the adequacy of the assessment of solvency and liquidity risks in the banking institutions because I had no roles in assessing that back in 2007 and 2008.  That was ultimately a role for the Financial Regulator and the Central Bank.  The NTMA had no special insight into the banks, domestically or internationally.  All we had were publicly available documents such as credit agency reports, market updates and reports and broker analyst reports.  Not surprisingly, by reference to this published material from somewhat respected and financially literate commentators from 2005 to 2007, one could conclude that, while there were risks, there were no strong warning signals of the financial carnage that would ultimately emerge.  <br/><br/>By late 2007, however, although we at the NTMA had no inside information about any bank domestically or internationally, we began to sense that there were early signs of market dislocation beginning to emerge in the capital and money markets.  The first hedge funds failed in early August 2007, followed by regular market rumours about the fragility of various international banks and the unsettling sight of queues of depositors at Northern Rock branches in September 2007.  This caused us at the NTMA to adopt a conservative view of managing the State&rsquo;s cash assets which were raised in the main to fund the national debt.  We had no idea at that stage of the global reach of the credit crisis or of how long it would last or of how serious it would become.<br/><br/>As I previously advised the inquiry, we were always sceptical of the business models of at least two Irish financial institutions, Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank, particularly their heavy exposure to property lending and the limited distribution access of Anglo Irish Bank which had no branch network.  We had no credit limit for INBS so we did not do business with them and we restricted our credit limit to &euro;40 million for Anglo Irish Bank even before the crisis started to emerge in 2007.  However, from August 2007 we considered it prudent to reduce our counter-party credit limit exposure to the bank deposit market globally until a clearer picture would emerge.  At that time, it was not an easy decision to justify as all we had was an uneasy sense that the whole global banking and capital market system was more fragile than appeared on the surface, but we had little by way of specific evidence.  Ultimately, things got a lot worse as the months passed and our August 2007 decision proved to be the correct one although it would be a year later before major bank difficulties became more generally visible.<br/><br/>Appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision.  In relation to other lines of inquiry, it is my understanding from discussion with your investigation team that you wish me to focus in my remarks on the period from mid-2007 to September 2008.  As I advised the inquiry in April this year, there was no substantive discussion involving myself - and as far as I am aware with my senior NTMA colleagues - about a bank guarantee in the months, weeks or days leading up to 30 September 2008 and the NTMA had no involvement in the actual decision to introduce the blanket guarantee.<br/><br/>Mr. Hurley, in his evidence, referred to a note prepared by the Department of Finance of an 18 September 2008 meeting at which Dr. Somers, Mr. Corrigan and I were recorded as being present at which, Mr. Hurley states, a guarantee was discussed.  My recollection, which is confirmed by the Department&rsquo;s meeting note, is that the discussion was purely about a deposit<i></i>guarantee, not a blanket<i></i>guarantee, and that the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator did not even favour such an approach at that meeting.  The meeting mainly centred on the merits of increasing the deposit guarantee for individuals from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000.  For the record, I believe the meeting was actually held on Friday, 19 September not 18 September but that is incidental.<br/><br/>Whilst my colleague, Mr. Whelan, and I were in Government Buildings on the night of 29 September, we were not, as I have previously advised, made aware as to the reason why we were there .... why we were required or consulted or otherwise asked to input prior to the Government taking the guarantee decision.  Once the Government had decided to introduce a blanket guarantee, my focus and that of Mr. Whelan as public servants was, and you will appreciate, on the implications of that decision and its effect on the NTMA as the State&rsquo;s debt manager and, more immediately, on how the NTMA would deal with the market and credit rating agency reaction to the decision at 7 a.m. that very morning.<br/><br/>As the banking crisis unfolded in the two weeks immediately before 30 September 2008, the NTMA's engagement with the Department of Finance had focused on three main strands.  </p>  <p>         The first strand was the provision of secured lending by the NTMA to the banks, if so directed by the Minister, second, the NTMA input into draft legislation dealing with the possible nationalisation of two financial institutions, a building society draft nationalisation Bill and a bank draft nationalisation Bill and, three, the NTMA&rsquo;s commissioning of Merrill Lynch on 24 September on behalf of the Minister for Finance to provide advice.<br/><br/>On the first issue on discussions and secured lending by the NTMA to the banks, the NTMA had in fact been engaged in discussions with the Department of Finance from April 2008 about the provision of emergency liquidity in circumstances where the Irish banks could not meet their funding requirements from the wholesale markets.  This was separate to the engagement we'd been having with the Department of Finance from the summer of 2007 in relation to the NTMA placement of bank deposits, which I will deal with later.  By September 2008, these discussions had intensified and the NTMA had in place arrangements to allow it, in the event that it was directed by the Minister, to engage in emergency collateralised lending to the Irish banks.  I estimate that we had about &euro;5 billion in liquidity available at that time, across various mandates that could be lent up to one year.  The NTMA had been maintaining a floor to its liquidity and allowed it to supply a certain amount of emergency funding requirements but only if directed by the Minister.  There had also been discussion about the NTMA accumulating a war chest of liquidity to deal with the emerging banking liquidity crisis.  However, while the NTMA was continuing to issue commercial paper of up to &euro;20 billion, which was as long-dated as possible, with a maximum 12-month maturity, it was clear that there was no appetite from longer-term bond market investors to invest on the scale needed to create a cash buffer to deal with even part of the potential fallout from the banks.  This was particularly the case given the pressures the sovereign was already experiencing in terms of funding the national debt during 2008, which was &euro;50 billion approximately. <br/><br/>NTMA&rsquo;s input into the draft bank and building society nationalisation legislation.  Our input into draft legislation being prepared during September 2008 by the Department of Finance to deal with the possible nationalisation of a building society and of a bank related mainly to the role the NTMA could play in providing restructuring assistance post-nationalisation and technical advices on obligations arising under the Companies Act, which could potentially limit the Minister&rsquo;s power to manage a nationalised institution.<br/><br/>The NTMA&rsquo;s commissioning of Merrill Lynch to advise the Minister for Finance.  The NTMA engaged Merrill Lynch on 24 September but we were not prepared to enter into a contract with them without the Minister&rsquo;s approval.  On 26 September 2008 the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, Mr. Cardiff, confirmed in an e-mail to me that the Minister was instructing the NTMA to engage Merrill Lynch to provide corporate finance advice to him.  I understand that Merrill Lynch met the Minister and senior officials within his Department, including Mr. Doyle and Mr. Cardiff, to discuss strategic options that evening.  I will discuss the quality of the expert advice later in my opening comments.<br/><br/>NTMA knowledge of a blanket bank guarantee.  The first and only reference to a blanket bank guarantee throughout all the engagement in September 2008 was an e-mail that I received from Mr. Beausang, assistant secretary at the Department of Finance, at 1.26 p.m. on Friday, 26 September 2008.  The e-mail, issued on the instruction of the Secretary General, sought the NTMA&rsquo;s view on, <i>inter alia</i>, the potential sovereign implications of a blanket bank guarantee.  I responded that afternoon at 2.22 p.m. after receiving a phone call from Mr. Beausang in which he sought an urgent response to the Department&rsquo;s ... for the Department's Secretary General.  Without having much time to consider the matter, I discussed it with my colleague, Mr. Whelan, and in my reply to Mr. Beausang, I pointed out that the real exposures to the Exchequer from the banking system had not yet been independently quantified and that would make any assessment of a bank guarantee extremely difficult.  The Department of Finance&rsquo;s e-mail to me referred to a possible total funding requirement of approximately &euro;100 billion for the two institutions expected to be nationalised, as estimated by Merrill Lynch, and also a wider guarantee for the other institutions.  I pointed out that, in the event of such a major decision being made, the credit ratings agencies would &quot;be taken aback&quot; at the scale of the State involvement that a blanket guarantee would necessitate and that there would be an immediate credit ratings downgrade of Ireland from AAA and a concomitant rise in the cost of funding the national debt.  I also made the observation that, given the potential size of any guarantee relative to the size of the economy, Ireland could &quot;expect to pay a lot more than Greece&quot;<i></i>in the international money markets.  Greece, as you know, was an outlier at that time in terms of bond yield spreads at about 75 basis points in the ten-year maturity over Germany; Ireland was about 45 basis points, I recall.  There was no follow-up from the Department to my e-mail.<br/><br/>NTMA deposit placement.  Prior to September 2008, engagement between the NTMA and the Department of Finance related primarily to the NTMA&rsquo;s placement of bank deposits.  This reflected the view in many quarters that the problem in the banking system domestically was one of liquidity, not solvency.  By August 2007, the NTMA had made the decision firstly to reduce existing counterparty credit lines with a range of global financial institutions and to stop placing deposits with any bank.  The NTMA policy was to move maturing deposits back to the Central Bank of Ireland &ndash; we referred to it internally as safe-harbouring deposits.  The Department of Finance was fully aware of the NTMA&rsquo;s position in this regard.  The Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Doyle, was a member of the NTMA advisory committee, which received updates from me, as finance director, on the NTMA&rsquo;s counterparty credit limit policy and counterparty credit list at its September and December 2007 meetings, and this continued throughout 2008.  I recall at these meetings that Mr. Doyle, as a member of the NTMA advisory committee, did not agree with the NTMA&rsquo;s position on deposit placements and safe-harbouring at the Central Bank but the overall advisory committee agreed with the NTMA senior management&rsquo;s position and consistently advised us to take a conservative and prudent approach to counterparty risk.<br/><br/>In mid-December 2007, the NTMA was invited to the latter stages of a domestic standing group meeting with the Department of Finance and the Central Bank to discuss the placing of deposits within existing credit limits with; Bank of Ireland, &euro;200 million; AIB, &euro;200 million; Irish Life and Permanent, &euro;50 million; and EBS, &euro;50 million.  An existing deposit of &euro;40 million with Anglo Irish Bank, with a maturity of one year, had been in place before the NTMA made its decision to cease placing the deposits with the banks and to place them instead with the Central Bank.  The NTMA&rsquo;s position at this meeting which took place I believe on 12 December 2007, was that in the absence of a written direction from the Minister, we did not intend reversing this policy of placing bank deposits in financial institutions.  We made the point at the meeting that, if anything, the risks attaching to the banking system, internationally as well as domestically, had become even more pronounced since the original August 2007 decision of the NTMA to safe-harbour<i></i>maturing deposits with the Central Bank.  Following that meeting, the Minister for Finance at the time, Mr. Cowen, wrote to the chief executive of the NTMA, Dr. Somers, on 19 December 2007, directing the NTMA to place deposits with the four main banks, namely, Bank of Ireland, AIB, Irish Life and Permanent and EBS.  The Minister also sought proposals for additional NTMA activity within financial markets and the expansion of NTMA credit lines <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>banks.I have already referred to our subsequent engagement in 2008, particularly in September 2008, with the Minister and the Department on these two points.  My colleague, Mr. Whelan, wrote to the second Secretary General of the Department, Mr. Cardiff, also on 19 December 2007, seeking clarification that the Minister&rsquo;s correspondence constituted a direction under section 4(4) of the NTMA Act 1990.  Mr. Cardiff confirmed on behalf of the Minister, in correspondence on 21 December 2007, that this was the case.  As regards maturities, Mr. Cardiff added, &quot;The intention is to leave appropriate discretion to yourselves, but the aim should be to considerably in excess of one month and preferably towards three months.&rdquo;<br/><br/>The NTMA wrote again to the Department of Finance, by e-mail to Mr. Cardiff, on 18 February and 18 April 2008, respectively, seeking clarification as to whether the Minister&rsquo;s direction of 19 December 2007 applied to the roll-over of maturing deposits with Bank of Ireland, AIB, Irish Life and Permanent and EBS. Mr. Cardiff responded on both occasions to confirm that the Minister&rsquo;s direction did so apply and all deposits should be renewed on maturity.  On 17 June 2008, the new Minister for Finance, Mr. Lenihan, in correspondence to Dr. Somers, directed the roll-over of Bank of Ireland and AIB deposits on an unsecured basis and an increase in deposit sizes with Irish Life and Permanent from &euro;50 million to &euro;250 million and EBS from &euro;40 million to &euro;100 million, on a secured collateralised basis.  In correspondence to the Minister on 27 June 2008, Dr. Somers confirmed the placement of deposit funds in the Irish market as follows: Bank of Ireland, &euro;200 million unsecured deposit for two months; AIB, &euro;200 million unsecured deposit for two months; Irish Life and Permanent, &euro;250 million collateralised deposit for 12 months; and EBS, &euro;100 million collateralised deposit for 12 months.  The NTMA chief executive also advised that the NTMA did not intend to renew a one-year unsecured deposit of &euro;40 million with Anglo Irish Bank which fell due on 8 August 2008, as the deposit was not covered by the Minister&rsquo;s December 2007 direction.  On 17 July 2008, I wrote by e-mail to Mr. Cardiff to again advise that an unsecured deposit of &euro;40 million with Anglo Irish Bank would mature on 8 August 2008 and asked whether the Minister intended to direct<i></i>the NTMA to renew the deposit.  As advised in the NTMA chief executive&rsquo;s earlier correspondence to the Minister, it was the NTMA&rsquo;s view that the Anglo Irish deposit was not covered by the Minister&rsquo;s 2007 direction and the NTMA&rsquo;s position is that it did not intend to renew the deposit.  Mr. Cardiff wrote to me on behalf of the Minister directing the NTMA to place a &euro;40 million one-year collateralised deposit with Anglo Irish Bank and to roll over the NTMA&rsquo;s &euro;200 million deposits with Bank of Ireland and AIB on a six-month collateralised basis.  </p>  <p>         On 25 July 2008, I wrote to Mr. Cardiff to advise him that Anglo Irish Bank was not interested in doing a deal on a collateralised basis especially for only &euro;40 million, and had requested instead that the NTMA renew the existing &euro;40 million deposit on an unsecured one-year basis.  Mr. Cardiff advised, on 28 July 2008, that Mr. Cardiff wished the NTMA to renew the existing &euro;40 million deposit on a three-monthly maturity.  There could have been no ambiguity at any time during this period on the part of senior Department of Finance officials or the Minister for Finance as to the NTMA's position on global bank risk from August 2007 and our reluctance, given the increasing dislocation of financial markets, to put at risk any State money under our management by placing it on deposit with domestic or international financial institutions unless we were directed to do so by the Minister for Finance.  <br/><br/>Appropriateness of the expert advice sought, quality of analysis and how effective this advice was used.  From mid-September 2008, when my colleagues, Mr. Corrigan, Mr. Whelan and I were requested to attend meetings which the Department of Finance had scheduled with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator, it was obvious to me and also, I believe, to my colleagues, that there was a dearth of information or analysis available in terms of real insight as to the financial state of the domestic banks and building societies.  It surprised us that there appeared to be only one or, at most, two Financial Regulator staff engaged in close monitoring of each financial institution, even those institutions with balance sheets of up to &euro;200 billion.  At one particular meeting at the outset of the evolving crisis, Mr. Neary, the Financial Regulator, inquired as to the <i>locus standi</i>of NTMA officials at these meetings given banking confidentiality issues.  Mr. Cardiff dealt with this and advised that the NTMA had been requested to attend and provide advice to the Department of Finance by the Minister himself.  Each of the financial institutions in late September 2008 were beginning to retain investment banks as advisers.  A decision was taken by the Minister that the State needed its own investment bank to advise it and the NTMA requested to engage that advice and this was arranged by my colleague, Mr. Corrigan.<br/><br/>During the last two weeks of September 2008, the whole focus was on having legislation ready to nationalise a building society and a bank, if required.  The NTMA provided technical input into that draft legislation.  A separate piece of legislation was also being prepared by the Department of Finance and the Attorney General&rsquo;s office which would enable the NTMA and the Central Bank to provide secured lending to the financial institutions.  <br/><br/>Considerable pressure was being applied at the September 2008 Department of Finance-Central Bank-Financial Regulator meetings on the NTMA to increase the amount of deposits placed with the Irish banking system as Irish institutions rapidly began to lose liquidity.  The NTMA refused and advised it was our view of our chief executive, Dr. Somers, that it was the role of the Central Bank to be the lender of last resort; it was not the role of the NTMA as a debt management agency.  This caused considerable tension but we maintained our position.  <br/><br/>Merrill Lynch was in place for about four days before the guarantee decision was made.  In my view, it was only after that guarantee decision was made and through the work of PwC on behalf of the Financial Regulator, and the work of Merrill Lynch after the guarantee decision, that the real picture began to emerge of what was really going on in the Irish banking system and the scale of property and other lending.  That emerging picture of asset and liability mismatch based on the PwC-Merrill Lynch work from mid-October 2008 onwards was very alarming.  Excessive lending by financial institutions funded by short-term wholesale deposits, which were disappearing rapidly, with the result that liquidity from the Central Bank and the ECB was required and capital injections were inevitable.  The ECB then, unlike today, was not very accommodative in terms of the type of collateral it would accept from the banks.  By then, the damage had been done.  <br/><br/>During the autumn of 2008 and the early part of 2009, I continued to perform my full-time role as NTMA finance director while also attempting, on almost a full-time basis, to assist the Department of Finance and my senior NTMA colleagues in its efforts to deal with the possible collapse of the Irish banking system and the direct effect on Ireland as the sovereign.  <br/><br/>Subsequent to the period that we have just discussed, my professional responsibilities within the NTMA shifted to the establishment of NAMA from May 2009 and, as you know, I've already provided the inquiry with evidence as regards the NAMA experience.  I hope that in these brief opening comments, I have given you a sense of my engagement and that of the NTMA and the Department of Finance and Minister for Finance during 2007 and 2008.  Thank you, Chairman. </p></speech>

I just want to deal with a couple of matters before I bring in the leads.  Mr. Cowen, yesterday, in testimony, as we concluded yesterday's hearings, said he didn't know that members of the NTMA were actually in an ante room outside the room in which the guarantee was being discussed in Government Buildings.

Chairman, as I outlined here last April, I think I arrived home around 7.45 p.m. on Monday, 29 September 2008 and I received a call from Mr. Cardiff and he said to me, "Can you come to Government Buildings, please?"  I said, "What's it about, Kevin?"  He said to me, "I can't talk to you at the moment.  Just come to Government Buildings."  So I contacted my colleague, Mr. Whelan, because, as I outlined, Dr. Somers and Mr. Corrigan were away in the States, and we arrived in Government Buildings, I think, sometime after 9 o'clock.</p></speech>

One of the issues that was being discussed inside in the room that night was the possibility of nationalising Anglo or making it inclusive as one of the banks in the broad guarantee.

It was, effectively, a monoline institution with, effectively, just mainly property lending, and that it had rapid growth and we just couldn't understand the business model.  And, as the liquidity crisis began to hit from 2007 onwards, we could see that there was pressure coming on all banks, but we became aware through our meetings in ... from mid-September 2008 onwards with the Central Bank and Financial Regulator and Department of Finance, that they were ... their funding was probably under the most pressure.</p></speech>

It was ... I suppose, it had spectacular growth and we were always very cautious about the amount of money that we would place on deposit with them and even though our counter-party credit limit policy gives a certain amount of deposits we could place based on the credit rating, their credit rating merited a &euro;75 million deposit and we wouldn't ... we never went above &euro;40 million.</p></speech>

And I think in that period between the guarantee ... I mean, you know this was a very difficult decision for Government; it wasn't a decision of mine and ... and I think, Mr. Cowen referred, that they "only had one shot at it".  And I fully respect in terms of the difficult decision they had to make.  But I think what emerged, once the guarantee was launched, there was no consequence for Anglo.  As corporate governance issues emerged in December, three senior people left and then, ultimately, the decision had to be made in January 2009 to nationalise them.  The result was the same, just the timing was different.</p></speech>

It was one of those four, five or six options that we had seen.  And that was the report that, ultimately, was sent to Mr. Cardiff, I think, by Merrill Lynch at about seven o'clock on the evening of the 29th.  These were all a range of options.  But in any of the meetings that we had up to that point, all the discussion seemed to be pointing that it was inevitable that we were going to nationalise Irish Nationwide and Anglo Irish Bank.  And when the e-mail came to me from Mr. Beausang on the Friday afternoon, the 26th, it seemed to me ... came out of ... you know, almost came out of nowhere saying, "What about a system-wide guarantee?"</p></speech>

But just to answer your question, Senator, it was a range of options.  What I believed, and I believe my colleagues believed, and they'll have to answer it themselves, that it was just one of the range of options.  I certainly believed it was discounted because I didn't believe the State had the wherewithal to do it.</p></speech>

Who was central to them and whose opinion was that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.2482" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070900002#SS02600"><p>Well, I mean, these were meetings involving the senior people in the Central Bank, the senior people in the Financial Regulator, the senior people in the Department of Finance and ourselves.  And all, I suppose, the workflow that was coming out of those meetings.  And the product is there, was that there was two separate Bills to be worked on intensively, which is the building society nationalisation Bill and a bank nationalisation Bill.  And towards the end of that week on 26 September, there was work going on, basically, on a secured lending scheme.  You know so that's ... all I can say to you, Senator, is that the discussions and the workflow seemed to be going a particular direction.   When it came to the night of the guarantee and the Government made the guarantee decision - and I respect that's the Government's decision - it seemed to be out of the hat that, you know, the least probably viable option in my view.  And I mean it's only my view in terms of the options put forward by Merrill Lynch, was suddenly the one that was pulled out of the hat.  So I mean, as I said before, when I was back here in April I said, you know, there could have been other conversations happening which I was not party to, there could be conversations happening where people might have taken the view I didn't need to know about these conversations, and that's absolutely fine.  But all I can tell you is what I know.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.2484" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brendan McDonagh" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070900002#SS02800"><p>Well, in terms of the technical work, it seemed to be very much a common purpose that, you know, in terms of technical input, it seemed to be like, "There's a work stream arising out of this meeting; this has to be produced; let's get it produced the best we can and have the best Bill possible that we can possibly have."  So there was certainly no issue there.</p>  <p>  As I mentioned in my opening remarks here, all the time through September, you know, everybody in the room, the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, including ... and also the Department of Finance, it always seemed to be looking over to the ... what I'd call, the NTMA corner of the meeting which says, " You guys have, you know, loads of liquidity, you're withdrawing it from the banking system, why don't you just put that liquidity, and you'll start earning a great return.  I mean you're not getting a good enough return from the Central Bank, why can't you just put this money on deposit with the banks?"  And we kept saying, "No, listen, this is not going to happen."  Our chief executive, who you'll be meeting ... our former chief executive, Dr. Somers, had a very strong, let's just call it, whip-line type of view to us as senior executives to say, "The NTMA's job is not to provide liquidity to the banking system.  The NTMA's job is to fund the national debt."  That's our statutory and primary responsibility and it's the Central Bank's job to be the lender of last resort if the banks need money.  And I didn't disagree with that.</p></speech>

So just to go back then to William Beausangs e-mail of the 26 September, in which he said he had spoken with the Secretary General that morning, that's the Secretary General of the Department of Finance, and he was now asking for the NTMA "to crystalise the issue that might be expected to arise for our sovereign rating in the event that the State provides a guarantee for all the deposits".  </p>  <p>               So when you got that e-mail, at 13:26 on the 26th, was that the first time you'd been asked specifically for a direct piece of analysis relating to a guarantee?</p></speech>

This is going to have a big impact on the sovereign and furthermore, if you're going to give a guarantee, what can we say when we are talking to people, the credit rating agencies, when they'd turn around and they'll say to us, you know, "What's the problem with the banks and what's the scale of it?" and we'll turn around and we'll say "Well we actually don't know."  And I said this ... In my first line of that response, I said because the scale of it or the impact hasn't been quantified and unfortunately, I've been proved right ... I've been proven right, because the cost has been huge.</p></speech>

You don't have to be ... they're common sense questions in terms of that.  So there was no, I suppose, Senator, coming back to the main point here, the issue here is that there was very little information about the profile of the banks' assets and liabilities in the system.  In September 2008 when I ... the Department of Finance were exploring a range of options to try and see, and every option needed to be challenged, absolutely, and every option needed to be thought about and that's absolutely right.  But I suppose when that came into me on 26 September at half one from Mr. Beausang, who is a guy who worked incredibly hard during the whole financial crisis, I took the view, I said, they're exploring a range of options but this option ... I ... just in my response really was to respond back in, probably, not in a ... just to set out the key points, because he was looking for a quick response, just to say, you know you can ... it was almost like my view and my colleague's view that this was an option that can be dismissed very easily if you're exploring a range of options.</p></speech>

I mean, from what ... I mean, from the evidence I've seen here, it said the meeting started at 6.30 p.m.  I wasn't aware the meeting started at 6.30 p.m.  We arrived there some time after 9 o'clock so all I can say is what Mr. Cardiff and Mr. Doyle told the committee here in their evidence.  Mr. Cardiff said the NTMA's views were fully communicated to the meeting.  Mr. Doyle referred to somebody from the NTMA without name who was in the ante-room who had very strong views.  I believe he might have been talking about myself but he could have been talking about Mr. Whelan as well, I don't know, but I suspect it was myself.</p></speech>

And the way it was put to us was that would we come to a meeting, I remember it was a Saturday morning in<b></b>[and you go on]. </blockquote>  <p>So can you just tell us, what do you think those concerns were that the Department of Finance had, that they then invited you to be more closely involved, perhaps?</p></speech>

I remember Kevin Cardiff ringing and saying &quot;Would you come along to this meeting, we're having these meetings ... we're having these meetings in the Central Bank with the Central Bank, the Financial Regulator, would you come along?&quot; and he said &quot;We in the Department of Finance&quot;, he says &quot;are policy people.  We're not fully <i>au fait</i>with all the, the sort of, I suppose, capital market side and you've experience of that in the NTMA and would you come along and just ... and sit in the meetings and just give us your view in terms of what's being discussed or what's going on.&quot;  So we did.  But as I said then and I say in my statement today, it really was a bit mind-boggling, certainly to me and I think certainly ... and I think the same with my colleagues, is that there seemed to be no real knowledge of the banks.  There's one or two people on each bank.  When I was asking questions we couldn't, we couldn't get the information ... the information couldn't be answered.  We were questioned about ... because we sort of, I suppose, the nature of people in the NTMA, rightly or wrongly, is that we're questioning types of individuals.  And I suppose at the meeting we began to, rather than sitting back and observing what was going on, we decided if we were going to be at the meeting we might start asking questions ourselves and that's why I make reference to the fact that Mr. Neary sort of said ,&quot;Well who are you to be asking questions?  What's your <i>locus standi</i>here?&quot;</p></speech>

But once that issue was over and, I suppose, as we went to more meetings during September 2008 it became, probably, very obvious to myself and my senior colleagues that actually, maybe these guys just don't know.</p></speech>

Clearly we had a huge interest in the money in the post office because that was national debt money and if ... and you know, it would affect us in terms of funding of the national debt.  So there was a meeting convened ... the Department of Finance, I remember ... I think that was my first time actually meeting Governor Hurley, he had just returned from being out on sick leave, I think that might have been his first meeting after which ... after he returned.  And myself and Dr. Somers and Mr. Corrigan went along to that meeting from the NTMA, the Minister chaired that meeting.  There was a discussion about, you know, people are concerned about their deposits and what are we going to do and the view was taken at that meeting that maybe the deposit guarantee limit should be increased from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000, because I think in every country in Europe as far as I can recall at the time had a &euro;100,000 limit, so there was nothing unusual in terms of ... in terms of doing that, in terms of trying to calm the, sort of, personal deposit market.  And to be honest with you Senator I think that was, in fairness, I think that was a very sensible decision.</p></speech>

Can you comment on the Merrill Lynch strategic options paper, the one that was dated 28 September, which was considering all the options, as you've said, including a guarantee?

And Merrill Lynch came along to that meeting and said they were working on this memo and discussing the range of options.  There was lots of, I suppose toing and froing in terms of what was going on.  People left Treasury Building and went off, I thought the people were going home.  I found out subsequently that there might have been another meeting at the Central Bank which we were never told about, from evidence that other people gave.  And Merrill Lynch stayed on our premises and I stayed there with them, along with Mr. Whelan and they started trying to finalise this memo and they circulated it then for ... I suppose comments or ... and I think we supplied comments back on the Monday morning.  Dr. Somers and Mr. Corrigan were already gone to the States so it was up to myself and Mr. Whelan to give what we believed appropriate commentary on it and the next time that memo appeared then was ... I think it was sent directly by Merrill Lynch to Mr. Cardiff at around 7 o'clock on the evening of the 29th.</p></speech>

I think it ... it is telling for the following reason; because both me in the NTMA and my colleague Mr. Whelan and Merrill Lynch - and Merrill Lynch weren't at Government Buildings on the night of 29 September, they were in London - the first line of this e-mail says &quot;Below are ... initial thoughts ... the Government should think about [if it was] to take over an institution&quot;.  So therefore, the view of Merrill Lynch and ourselves the NTMA, was that there ... the meeting that was going on was about nationalising an institution.  It wasn't about a bank guarantee.  I responded to Mr. Matthaeus of Merrill Lynch at 1.32 in the morning and I said;</p> <blockquote> 	The Government is likely to guarantee the debts, other than equity and hybrid and undated debt, of the six financial institutions with immediate effect.  We need your advice on how to deal with rating agencies and institutional corporate investors. </blockquote></speech>

Can I ask you, that last statement that you made that you don't believe that the two banks were solvent.  We've had numerous witnesses come before the committee and tell us that they believe that they were solvent, they've had reassurances from the Financial Regulator, the former Taoiseach says the Financial Regulator tested this here.

The forecast was that they would be &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion ... in Anglo's case it would be &euro;2 billion to &euro;3 billion negative in funding terms within 24 or 48 hours, and INBS was beginning to lose liquidity rapidly.  And I suppose if you profile forward we know now and we know for a long time that these institutions required &euro;34 billion of capital.</p></speech>

I've questioned individuals on this because there's a lot of fixation, in my view, around the word "solvency."  And you've described solvency from an accountancy point of view, that if you can't pay your dues as they fall due, then you're technically insolvent.  Others would argue that that was a bank that was illiquid and not solvent, as in they had assets that could pay them but they just couldn't turn them into hard cash.  Did you ... more than the liquidity pressure that those two banks had, did you have at that time concerns in relation to the assets that the banks had?</p></speech>

They're at a point in time.  Two weeks, later two hours later, things can be completely different.  I suppose, if you want to go into the management accounting world, you need real-time information in terms of what's your asset-liability profile, what assets have you lent against, are they worth what everybody thinks they're worth or not?  And of course, the position was maintained by all the banks in the autumn of 2008 that they were fine, they didn't need capital.  If they did need capital they needed a small amount of capital.  They'd only take capital if another institution took capital - this sort of silly game-playing was going on.  And they'd source capital from third parties if they needed to.  Another line is, "This is a global problem, this is not just in relation to the Irish banks."</p>  <p> I think the issue really was that you might have had assets on your balance sheet.  Nobody knew what those assets were worth or what the banks were saying.  You couldn't go to the ECB and pledge those assets as securities because, as I said in my statement, the ECB wasn't very accommodating at the time - which effectively is a nice way of saying, they were saying to you, "Don't turn up here with those assets because we won't advance you money against them."  I suppose the prevailing view ... and I suppose the hope of everybody ... that it was just a liquidity crisis, that it was ... that there is a liquidity squeeze which was beginning to emerge globally, everybody's withdrawing their deposits in the system, nobody's lending to each other even though people are offering big interest rates for you to lend them money.  People are saying, "It's not worth my job to get 50 basis points if I'm not going to get the money back."  I think the view really is that liquidity ... the view is that all it is is a liquidity problem.  And in my view, liquidity is a contributor to solvency but it's not the only issue in insolvency.</p></speech>

I mean, we won't place any deposit with INBS.  We won't give them any credit line.  They'll look for credit lines from us and we wouldn't give it to them.  I think a couple of years previously we had given them a &euro;6 million credit line and then we decided to cut it because we just couldn't understand the business model.  We took the view that really it's more trouble than it's worth to place &euro;6 million on deposit with this institution when it really was a very opaque structure.</p></speech>

Did the NTMA, did Mr. Somers or Mr. Corrigan talk to you in relation to the outcome of the meeting?

I've seen the minutes of the meeting.  It's a ... I think the view was that, "Let's look at all the options, let's get Merrill Lynch to sit down and look at all the options."  That's my understanding of what I was told came out of that meeting which again feeds into the Merrill Lynch option they produced in the memo over the weekend of the following weekend.</p></speech>

We were attending the meetings with the Central Bank, the Department of Finance and the regulator and everybody, in fairness, was trying their best but there was no structure on it.  And when the view was taken to get Merrill Lynch on board, I think in fairness what they brought, it was very expensive but what they brought was a bit of structure in terms of evaluating the options, the range of options, the pros and cons of the options, and that's set out in that memo.</p></speech>

I mean as I said in my opening statement, there was the nationalisation of a building society Bill, the nationalisation of a bank Bill, and the third thing was the provision of secured lending by the NTMA and the Central Bank.  And we didn't want to be placing our deposits with institutions, and the house view of the NTMA was that we'd place with institutions if we were directed to do so by the Minister.</p></speech>

And on page 44 it talks about the equity and debt investors and this would be in the context of what they called "State protective custody", or nationalisation.  And it says, "At Anglo the majority of equity and debt investors are Irish, UK and US institutional holders, but there are significant retail interests including a major shareholding by Sean Quinn."  If Anglo were to be nationalised on that night, would Se&aacute;n Quinn as a major shareholder have lost out substantially?</p></speech>

And, I suppose, it came back up again as a huge issue that had to be dealt with in a very complex way by the Attorney General's office when the Anglo nationalisation Bill was being prepared in mid-January 2009.</p></speech>

I mean, we sat there ... I described it that there was a portable TV in the corner and the Dow Jones was rapidly going downhill and TARP was being rejected in the US.  And I suppose, one of the things that emerged in Mr. Beausang's evidence, which I wasn't aware of ... it must have happened just before I got into the room that he had got an e-mail from Mr. Doyle, which had been sent to Mr. Doyle from the Central Bank, which effectively was some, sort of, draft press release on a guarantee.  And, I suppose, I didn't know Mr. Beausang very well at the time.  I had only met him a couple of weeks previously but, in fairness, if he was told to keep it to himself, I can confirm to the inquiry, he certainly did.  There was ... he never let on a word because I was ... I'm a curious person by nature and I was sitting in the room for a good few hours and Mr. Whelan and P&aacute;draig O R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and Mr. Beausang and more out of boredom than anything, you're sitting around, you're saying, you know, "I could be at home rather than sitting in here.  If you called me into something and just have me sitting here, why am I sitting here?  What's going on?"  "Do you know what's going on, William?"  "No, I don't know what's going on?"  And that was the way it was and you just had to sit there and wait.</p></speech>

I know.  Listen, I ... the decision-makers here was the politicians, which is the Taoiseach and the Minister for Finance, but I think I would have made my ... if he had asked me, I would have said, "You've got to nationalise these two institutions and to try and deal with the four remaining ones as best as best we can."  It's, you know ... this wasn't an easy decision.  This wasn't ... it's easy to look back at decisions we made and said, "You should have this, you should have done that."  But the decision, you know ... but I think at the time and I have to believe from Mr. Doyle and Mr. Cardiff said to this inquiry.  They said they made our views known.  I take their word that they made their views known and I don't think I would have said anything different other than what I'm saying to you now is that I would have pressed strongly for the nationalisation.  Clearly, they could have been said, "Thank you for your views but we're going a different route."  That's fine.  I'm not the decision-maker.  I'm only ... if I was only asked for my views, that's what I would have said.</p></speech>

Who made that decision within the NTMA?  Not actually, who authorised it eventually, but who said, "I think we shouldn't do this"?  Who was it personally instigated it?</p></speech>

I clearly discussed it with Dr. Somers, who was the chief executive, and I think he had been ... had just gone on holidays to France.  I think I might have rang him and said, "There's something happening here.  Big hedge funds are beginning to fail who are attached to big banks.  I'm just a bit worried, Michael, can we ... I think my view...".  In fairness, Michael would be of the view that if he wasn't there and you were back at base and you were closest to it, he says, "Well, okay, let's do that and we can review it", because I was going on holidays on 10 August and Mr. Whelan was returning from holidays on 13 August, so there was always going to be somebody there.  And he said, "We can review it with Oliver Whelan when you're gone on holidays and he comes back."  And I went on holidays and I was wondering what was happening and then I got an e-mail from my head of risk, who was reporting to me to say that Mr. Whelan had a conversation with Mr. Somers and that, yes, as deposits matured, we would just take them back at the Central Bank until we got a bit more clarity or to see what was happening in the markets because the markets were acting strangely.</p></speech>

I suppose we all had the same view.  We're, sort of, conservative, cautious people that this ... we would do this and we'll see what happens.  We weren't necessarily out of the markets forever but just see what would happen.  But, I suppose, in terms of our dealers who were in the front office, who were dealing with these institutions they were placing deposits with, they were getting a lot of questioning saying, "What are you up to?  Why won't you place the deposits back with me?  I'll pay you more money for that deposit", you know, and they ... of course, they wouldn't be aware ... they would just know the decision was taken.  They wouldn't know the whole rationale or whatever behind it.  And I suppose then, as September 2007, at the time, there was an NTMA advisory committee because there was no board.  And this would have been communicated to the advisory committee about what we're doing.  And then there was another advisory committee in December and I suppose, the view would be, you know, everybody else is placing deposits with the banks, guys, what do you guys know that nobody else knows, you know, and we were, sort of, saying "Well, we're not really sure we know anything but just that we're not comfortable about placing deposits out in the banks and we just want to see, you know, what's going to happen."  And as I said in my statement, it ... things got worse and we were proved correct but we weren't quite sure.  We just knew some ... we just got a sense from the markets that it was becoming more difficult to fund.  We were trying to fund ourselves in the short-term market to build up a war chest and while it was very easy in the first half of 2007 to build up that and you can do it completely under the radar and nobody takes any notice, people were beginning to say, "Well, you know, you're borrowing a lot of money short term, what are you up to?", and you were trying to keep it under the radar.  So, we could see it was harder for us to borrow and we also could see on the other side that people on the other side were becoming very thirsty for us to place deposits back with them.  So we, sort of, said, "Well, what's wrong here?  Is this shortage of liquidity, we're not the only ones doing it, so let's just hold on."</p></speech>

Dr. Somers will tell us later that, in 2009, the discretionary portfolio was making a return of 20.6%.  Have you any indication of what type of return that &euro;20.7 billion that went from the National Pensions Reserve Fund into the banks could have made, in the years subsequent, if it stayed within the pension reserve fund?</p></speech>

I mean, the Dow Jones is up, what is it?  18,000?  It probably would have been down around 13,000 or 12,000 or 13,000 at that stage.  So, that's about a 50% return.</p></speech>

But I believe that, you know, I don't have the figures before me but I'd say 40 ... I'd say it has ... since 2009 it's probably has increased by 40% to 50%.</p></speech>

Mr. McDonagh, the committee has heard evidence with regard to the bail-in strategy developed by the NTMA in March 2011 and I appreciate you weren't with the NTMA at that time.  With regards to your time with the NTMA, was there any discussion around possible bail-ins or hair cuts for senior or subordinate bondholders?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.2598" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/959" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070900002#XX00700"><p>And can you talk to us what ... there was a bail-in then developed later on in 2011.  It was as they ... the justification was we were going into a programme, we were out of the markets for a number of years.  Can you talk to the narrative about that ... if you burned the bondholders, that the markets would be waiting to punish you in the long grass.  Is that not the way that markets work or is it the way that markets work?</p></speech>

In relation to the change of strategy in 2011 ... and, I mean, you would have to ask Mr. Corrigan about that because he was directly involved in those discussions but from ... but from what I have seen and read, the view, I think, might have changed such that if you were out of the markets, people had priced in to the fact that ... that a bail-in may occur.  So, Mr. Corrigan's more appropriate to answer that question than myself.</p></speech>

We were ... you were dealing with Senator O'Keeffe in terms of the e-mail asking your opinion on if they went with the ... one of the options, which wasn't the option they eventually went with, and how much it would cost the State in terms of bond yields rising.  Do you have any estimation as to the cost to the State of actually the decision on the guarantee in terms how much extra it cost per annum in terms of the cost of our national debt?</p></speech>

I mean, at the time, back in September 2008, I sort of estimated that it'd at least lead to a 1% increase in the cost of funding.  I think our cost of funding at that stage would have been probably 5.5% to 6% for ten-year money.  So, I think, you know, the guarantee was put in place to guarantee deposits but, you know, the guarantee I suppose wasn't called because the deposits were paid back.  But the only way ... but, I suppose the big cost to the State has been the State resources that has been used to fill the capital hole in the banks and that has had to be borrowed.  And that was certainly a big hangover on the State for many years until the markets took the view, I suppose, that Ireland had dealt with the problem.  But it had been a very expensive problem to deal with.</p></speech>

At the time there was certain newspapers internationally saying that we shouldn't panic in terms of the yields because there was a very low level of trading on the bond market and that the yields weren't reflective of what was actually really happening.  So can I ask you, in that context, what was the size in terms of the volume of the trade on the Irish sovereign bond market during your time with the NTMA?  </p>  <p>               Was it ... how many trades involving Irish sovereign bonds would occur each day?  In other words, was it, like, thousands, hundreds?  Was it in the single digits?  And if you have any indication beyond ... particularly during that period in the run-up to the troika coming here? </p></speech>

And you had a situation that you had loads of international banks wanting to be primary dealers in Irish Government bonds, because, obviously, we'd a very low debt ratio - it had gone down to 25% - and I suppose there was a scarcity value of Irish bonds, you know, I suppose in the crisis because our debt was very low.  So the volumes of activities in 2010-2011, I just don't have that information.  But I'm sure my colleagues in the NTMA, if the committee wants it, can be ... can be ... they can provide it to it.</p></speech>

This is about the meeting on 18 September which Mr. Hurley gave evidence on.  And this was a meeting about a deposit guarantee, not a blanket guarantee, and you were saying that the "Central Bank and the Financial Regulator did not favour such an approach at that meeting."  Did not favour a deposit guarantee-----</p></speech>

I don't know who ... who raised it, to be honest with you.  And, I was saying, you know, because the deposits were ... the institutions were losing liquidity and they were certainly ... and the wholesale liquidity was the one that was running out the door the fastest, I was saying, is this a way of stimulating it, of having a ... a wholesales deposit guarantee?  And, I think it was ... I think the proposition might have been put forward, maybe, by the Department of Finance, to the meeting, and Mr. Hurley - and I think the minutes show it - said ... said, "No, no, we're not in that space yet, we need to just deal with the personal deposit situation first".</p></speech>

And that meeting, really, was about personal deposits and it came up as an ... as I recall, as an aside of something ... something that was just thrown out there, but it was ... it was ... I think, Mr. Hurley just almost immediately dismissed it and said, "No, we're here to talk about personal deposits, that's what we got to deal with here".</p></speech>

I'll move on from that if I may then.  And, if we could look at page 27 of the booklet ... is this e-mail exchange from William Beausang of 26 September.  And just a quick question ... just to clarify, the third paragraph in, which is combining the take-on of the banks' balance sheets of Anglo and INBS of &euro;110 billion, and guaranteeing the others of over &euro;420 billion.  My understanding was that the ... the liability the State was taking on with the guarantee was around &euro;440 billion.  That's what ... the figure at the time.  So, just to clarify, why ... there's the &euro;110 billion, is that a part of the &euro;420 billion or is it additional to?</p></speech>

So, I think, when you added up the balance sheets of the banks, you know, total assets, total liabilities, I think the gross balance sheet was about &euro;500 billion, so I think that's where the, the two figures-----</p></speech>

And, then just further on in that e-mail, in the next paragraph, at the very end of that, "We expect to pay a lot more than Greece due to the scale relative to our GNP as the market will be unforgiving about our problems."  And you also mention then, on page 4 of your opening ... opening statement, that you were trying to build up a war chest of liquidity to deal with the emerging banking liquidity crisis but you couldn't, "there was no appetite from longer-term bond market investors to invest on the scale needed to create a cash buffer to deal with even part of the potential fallout from the banks [...] [because of] the pressures the sovereign was already experiencing in terms of funding the National Debt which, during 2008, was &euro;50 billion approximately."  So, in that e-mail, are you pointing to a bailout?  Are you saying that this now comes into view as a possibility for the sovereign, if we take on this liability?</p></speech>

So what I was talking about there, really, to be upfront with you, was that if we ended up borrowing &euro;20 billion in the markets and lent that to the banks and suddenly the banks couldn't pay it back or the collateral wasn't worth that and there was a hole in it, then, you know, the markets wouldn't have been very forgiving if we had a shortfall of &euro;5 billion or &euro;10 billion.</p></speech>

I think he said he was exploring it on a personal level, right.  And if he was exploring it on a personal level, he wasn't saying that to me or, I don't believe, to any of my colleagues in the NTMA.  What I was aware of - and the documentation point towards it - is that there was talk about the NTMA going out borrowing maybe potentially up to &euro;20 billion and lending it back to the banks as a secure ... as a secured lender.  And my concern would be that if the banks couldn't pay you back that &euro;20 billion or if the collateral you took wasn't worth &euro;20 billion and you had a hole in it, then that would have to be ... basically the State would be taking the hit and the ... people would see you have a problem.  But, that was a &euro;20 billion problem as opposed to a problem which turned out to be &euro;64 billion.</p></speech>

Just something to clarify for myself though then.  I mean, you had a problem raising the &euro;20 billion.  There was a problem already on the sovereign borrowing rate.

And if it turned out that you did have write-offs ... and just being selfish about it, if we had taken collateral that wasn't worth what the banks said it was worth and it was write-offs for the Exchequer, then the markets ... it's like the markets smell blood and they would say, "You've a problem.  If you want to borrow money from us, you're going to pay much more for it."  There was no question that we couldn't ultimately borrow the money but we were ... I suppose, in September 2008, you know, there was really a ... talk about a budget adjustment having to happen which was ... the Minister was talking about doing his budget in October 2008 - and this was September 2008 - that ... you know, Ireland was in a great position of having a debt-GDP ratio of 25%, suddenly our budget deficit was ballooning, not to do with the banks but on the fiscal side.  But now, you add the banking problem on top of that ... and at that stage I thought maybe if we were forced to borrow &euro;20 billion, even if we could borrow it, and we ... and it was against collateral which wasn't worth what we were given, then this would be a big issue for us.</p></speech>

And we had a certain amount of discretion to operate on that basis and, on that basis, we took our responsibilities seriously.  We placed deposits in institutions when we had surplus money to try and earn an incremental return, which would go against the debt service costs, and I suppose it came ... we took the view from 2007 onwards that we weren't going to pay ... it wasn't worth us, as senior executives in the NTMA, that we regarded this almost as the State's money as being our own money; that we wouldn't place that at risk and that, if we were told to place it at risk, and there was lots of arm-twisting trying to tell us to place it at risk so that it ... and the view was, of the chief executive, Dr. Somers, and the rest of the senior management team, was that, "We don't think it's the right thing to do but if you tell us to do it, then you better direct us to do it so that if something goes wrong, we can say that we wouldn't have done this voluntarily, that we're doing it on the basis of a direction."</p></speech>

What alternative measures are you putting in place to deal with the issues in the banking system?"  You were the experts in terms of rasing funding.  The fact that you had the guardian of the public funds saying, "We're not secure putting those funds into the Irish banking system", did you not make a recommendation to the Minister of Finance both in August 2007 and then in the roll-over in June 2008, this matter needs to be looked into?</p></speech>

Good afternoon, Mr. McDonagh.  Some of my questions have been asked so I'll be brief with the ones that are left.  In relation to page 9 of your statement on the meeting in September ... early September which was organised by the Department of Finance that Mr. Neary inquired as to the <i>locus standi</i>of the NTMA for being present and contributing to those meetings, can you just recap again the circumstances of his concern?</p></speech>

I remember a subsequent meeting that Mr. Corrigan ... this was after the bank guarantee and Mr. Corrigan and I were pressing hard for a real deep dive review of the banks after the bank guarantee because I think there was a fear, certainly amongst myself and John Corrigan that, you know, the guarantee ... the view amongst the system was that the guarantee had worked - "Sure there's a huge flow of liquidity back into the banking system after the guarantee was announced and, you know, sure this proves the guarantee was the right decision."  And we pressed very hard to say "Listen, hold on a second here, we know nothing about the institutions.  It seems to us that you don't know a huge amount about the institutions either.  We need to get a third party in to do some work."</p>  <p>  And I remember it was one time myself and John went to a meeting at Mr. Neary's office in the Central Bank which was attended by himself, Ms Burke and Mr. Horan and we had a discussion about whether this should happen or should not and myself and John were saying. "You've got to do it.  You know, you need to get in there, start this deep dive."  And I remember Mr. Neary turning around at one stage to Mr. Corrigan, who was much more forceful on the issue than I was, and said, "John, you are not the regulator.  I am the regulator.  I will make the decision."  And, of course, we ... myself and John, we weren't the regulators - Mr. Neary was the regulator.  But it was probably the one other occasion I can recall where Mr. Neary got very testy with John and myself.</p></speech>

Oh there was because we didn't give up, because we kept ... we went back to Mr. Cardiff and said, "We've just been in a meeting with the Central Bank.  We don't think they're going to commission PwC to do this extra work."  Because PwC were working on the liquidity position but they weren't working on the assets quality position.  And we said, "We absolutely insist that this has to happen."  </p>  <p>         And it did happen and that's when the reports started after that ... started to be compiled.  And I think also around that time myself and John were getting ... starting to get exposure to Minister Lenihan which we hadn't had before that and I think we ... John and I used the opportunity seeing as we were getting exposure to him to say to him, "You've got to make the regulator to undertake these reviews because you've given a guarantee and you're on the hook you're on risk now."</p></speech>

I was, earlier actually in your statement you referred to the fact that you were surprised that there appeared to be only one or two people from the regulator engaged in close monitoring of each financial institution.

I suppose our main point of contact really because he had invited us along was Mr. Cardiff.

You know, how can you possibly, how can anybody possibly know, to be able to deal with these complex, big financial institutions with one or two people?"</p></speech>

Did you copy Mr. Somers routinely on responses to Mr. Beausang?  Because I noticed that Mr. Whelan, Mr. Cardiff and Mr. Somers are cc'd on the e-mail, or was it because of you attached extra significance to what you were responding to that you included him in the correspondence?</p></speech>

But I suppose ... I don't think we had an opportunity to discuss that with Mr. Somers ... whether he was out that day, or he wasn't available at the time because it was over lunch time.  But myself and Oliver took the view that this was a big question and if we were sending a response back I didn't want Dr. Somers, who was chief executive, who I've full respect for to be blind-sided in case he was rang by Secretary General Doyle about his two guys down in Treasury Building and he was blind-sided by it.  So the view was myself and Oliver took at the time was that we would copy Dr. Somers on it just to make sure he was in the loop.</p></speech>

And William was the technical liaison person with the European Commission and I was, I suppose, asked to help him out in terms of the design of the ... I suppose, the <i>modus operandi </i>of the guarantee, the, sort of, certain consequences for the banks arising out of this.  And myself and William had a lot of engagement with the Central Bank and the Financial Regulator people and Cox's who were involved advising in ... and Merrill Lynch, in terms of working out the issues as they came up, in terms of designing the structure of that guarantee.  And the decision had been taken ... the guarantee, at that stage it included sub debt, it was a two-year guarantee and William had asked me a question, which I think he said himself in his own evidence, that he mightn't have appreciated the complexities or differences between dated subordinated debt and undated subordinated debt and, you know, what happens if you're going to issue and would they be ... like, what the European Commission was always concerned about was competition issues, was ... well, if you were able to do something that some other country couldn't, or another bank couldn't in another country, was that not, you know, raising competition or state aid issues so he asked me that question, I responded, and gave him my view.</p></speech>

If I could maybe bring your attention to the fourth paragraph down because I think you, kind of, refer specifically in that area, where you say "Surely the objective of the guarantee of this dated subordinated debt from our point of view is to give the covered institutions the ability to access at least 2 year term funding to reduce their reliance on short term funding thereby avoiding the liquidity squeeze."  </p>  <p>               So this is, basically, the summary of the action that had taken place two weeks ago, what it was to achieve and so forth.  "If any covered institution was to issue term debt with a maturity longer than 2 years, then the market would want to be compensated for that by an appropriate step up in the interest rate pricing and that would be entirely commercial."  The two years you are talking about there, is the two-year guarantee, is it?</p></speech>

Is it being suggested here that the design or structure of the guarantee, along with its period of duration would have a bearing on the Irish State entering a bailout programme two years and two months after this guarantee was put in place?</p></speech>

I mean that's just the reality.  Merrill Lynch make reference to that in their own report.  I think the issue that came out in the two-year period really was the cap ... was the losses that the banks had built up on their books which were there, which had to be recapitalised and the scale of the recapitalisation basically drove Ireland out of the markets.</p></speech>

I would assume that would have been one of the things that you did?</p></speech>

Irish bond yields September '08, just before the guarantee, how much?  Irish bond yields, November 2010, just before the bailout, how much?  And Irish bond yields now?</p></speech>

In September 2010, a ten-year Irish Government bond yields, I think ... just before NTMA decided to exit the markets, were around 6%.  And Irish bond ... ten-year Irish Government bond yields today ... I think the last I saw them, I'm not as close to it now Deputy as before, but I think they're probably 2.3% or 2.45%, I think.</p></speech>

It was a game of, I suppose, cat and mouse going on really, but we were sort of saying ... it almost was like a mantra at every meeting, "Why won't you increase your deposits?"

So he came in to sell us a story and we listened to that story, and that was it so, that was the only meeting I can recall in terms of, I think it was October 2008.</p></speech>

And I recall you recounting just the length of time that it took you just to deal with the first tranche of loans and the haircut that came from that.  Can you inform the committee again, just in terms of how long did it take, from taking the decision to go in, look under the bonnet, how much did you look at, and how long did it take to get a quantification of what type of haircut?</p></speech>

It was 12,000 loans to 5,000 different borrowing entities with 60,000 underlying properties.  So we started the process ... we got European Commission approval at the end of February 2010, the first loan transfer, tranche one, transferred to us at the end of March 2010, and then we got tranche ... we were constantly waiting for the institutions to give us information so we could do the valuation, they were having difficulty compiling all the information together to give it to us, because it was obviously a huge logistical exercise.  So we couldn't move forward until we got the information institution, then we had to do our work.  We had the tranche two, I think, in August 2010, and at the end of September 2010, we were asked to come up, based on the first two tranches, an estimated valuation for the residual portfolio and that valuation proved to be entirely accurate.</p>  <p>  So by the end of September 2010, even though we hadn't the full due diligence got, we had estimated a quantum of loss related to NAMA loans, which effectively was six and a half months from European Commission approval.</p></speech>

But it would be ... you couldn't do it under the radar, Deputy.  And I think, in fairness, to the people there was a very strong view amongst the Central Bank regulator was that if you're seen to be doing this exercise, then it's going to get out ...it's going to be think that you've got a big problem with your banking system.  And, you know, there was view that you needed to ... whatever you needed to do, you needed to do under the radar.  NAMA was over the radar because the Government had made the decision and had European Commission approval.  But back in 2008 when this exercise could have been done, you probably would have had to start that work probably back in ... probably March-April 2008.  And probably the trigger for it really should have been after the share price fall in March 2008 that there would be more questioning going on of saying, "Are the banks really telling us that their books are sound and the assets are worth what they're worth."  And ... but that didn't happen.</p></speech>

I have been asked to provide a statement to the inquiry covering 24 lines of inquiry relating to my role as chief executive officer of the National Treasury Management Agency.  I was appointed to that position on 3 December 1990, for a period of five years by the Minister for Finance and was re-appointed several times, finally retiring on 3 December 2009.  I had previously been Secretary General, national debt management, in the Department of Finance from April 1987 and before that, I was Secretary General of Department of Defence from February 1985.  I served at various levels in the Department of Finance, initially in the pensions section and later in the finance division.  I also spent a period of just under two years in the Central Bank up to 1970.</p>  <p>  As I was largely responsible for the establishment of the NTMA and its growing range of functions over 19 years, I would like to outline the rationale for its rather unique structure and how it operated.  The reason for the establishment of the NTMA was the very heavy burden of the national debt at the end of the 1980s and the absence of suitably-qualified personnel in the Department of Finance to deal with the complex issue of raising funds on the international capital markets at optimum rates of interest.  The then Minister for Finance, speaking on the NTMA Bill before the D&aacute;il in 1990, said the debt was one of the highest in the OECD at over 120% of GNP at end 1989, while interest payments were put in 1990 at 9% of GNP, which he said was almost equivalent to the total yield from income tax in the PAYE sector.  He continued that it was about 60% greater than total Exchequer expenditure on the health services.</p>  <p>  The powers of the NTMA were very strictly circumscribed by legislation and related to the delegation of powers of the Minister for Finance to borrow money to fund the Exchequer.  The NTMA had no power to provide any assistance to the banking sector and would have been acting outside its remit, and probably in breach of EU law, to have done so by its own decision.  The following paragraphs set out the carefully designed legal basis on which it was established and operated.  When funds were being raised abroad and legal documents had to be signed, it was generally done by officials of the Department of Finance acting on the basis of a signed and sealed power of attorney, given by the Minister for Finance.  It would have been completely impracticable for the Minister to personally negotiate and execute all the documentation relating to loans raised throughout the world.  Nevertheless, questions had been raised, generally by Irish lawyers, about the legitimacy of this procedure on the basis that the Minister could not delegate his power to a civil servant.  There could have been some validity in this argument.  It was felt unwise to see it legally tested as, if found to be wrong, it would have created an impossible situation in the absence of some complex legislative change.</p>  <p>  However, when the creation of the NTMA was being considered, it was essential that this issue be resolved as there was no room for questioning the legal capacity of the NTMA to enter into contracts binding the State for very large financial commitments.  Also, it was not intended the NTMA would be required to obtain a separate power of attorney from the Minister for Finance for every transaction undertaken &ndash; a situation that, as mentioned earlier, could be legally challenged anyway.</p>  <p>  In summary, therefore, the creation of the NTMA raised constitutional issues as the functions which it would be called upon to perform were part of the executive power of the State.  That power can only be exercised by or on the authority of the Government.  It was felt that if the borrowing of money for the Exchequer and the management of the national debt were taken away from the Minister for Finance, it could be questioned as to whether he was still Minister for Finance.  It was, however, recognised that the Government could delegate the functions of a Minister to a Minister of State, while still retaining the power to exercise those functions himself or herself.</p>  <p>  The legislation passed by the Oireachtas provided the NTMA would be established as a body to perform, on the authority of the Government, the functions delegated to it by the Government under the Act, at that time principally borrowing and debt management.  In effect it was established as a type of corporate Minister of State.  The Government would delegate to it certain functions of the Minister for Finance.  These would be performed, subject to the control and general superintendence of the Minister and subject to such guidelines and directions as he would give it.  The chief executive would be appointed by the Minister and be directly responsible, i.e. not through a Department, to the Minister for the performance of the functions of the agency.  The chief executive, who could not be a civil servant, would be answerable to the D&aacute;il public accounts committee.</p>  <p>  Because of the importance of the NTMA&rsquo;s functions as part of the executive power of the State, it was further determined that there could not be a board of directors, as with a State body, because this would diffuse responsibility to an unacceptable degree.  Instead, there would be an advisory committee to assist and advise the agency on whatever it might request and be consulted by the Minister on the terms and conditions of appointment of the chief executive.  </p>  <p>         The above arrangements applied throughout my period as chief executive of the NTMA.  They were, however, fundamentally changed by the National Treasury Management Agency (Amendment) Act 2014, but these changes are not relevant to my statement.</p> <p> I would like to draw the committee&rsquo;s attention to the evidence that my colleagues and I gave to the public accounts committee on 14 May 2009, over a period of about four hours.  This covered, quite comprehensively, what the NTMA knew about the banking crisis at the time and the actions it had taken.  I should add that on rereading the evidence I gave then, I would not see any reason to significantly change any of it.  I resigned/retired from the NTMA about six months later and just over one year before my contract expired. </p> <p> As a general comment before turning to the specific lines of inquiry that the committee has addressed to me, I should make the point the NTMA was quite a small organisation at that time, with a total staff of 169 when I left at end-2009.  It had four main businesses, namely the borrowing and debt management functions of the State - its original purpose; the management of the National Pensions Reserve Fund; the State Claims Agency; and the National Development Finance Agency, as well as a significant number of other functions, including a small NAMA unit.  These had all been assigned to the NTMA in accordance with a large number of pieces of primary legislation.  A NAMA unit was set up in advance of legislation.  I should emphasise that the NTMA had no regulatory, policing or oversight role and, except to the extent I might be asked for specific views, no policy input role.  It was recognised by the Nyberg report that the NTMA was not a public authority.  Nevertheless, it did provide any and all assistance it was asked for during the banking crisis, but would not have been party to, or present at, many of the discussions between Government Ministers, the Attorney General, the Department of Finance and the Central Bank. </p> <p> I propose to respond to each of the 24 lines of inquiry in the order that you set out.  I should state that, in several instances, I am unable to provide any assistance as I have no information on the subjects.  In the case of others, where I have no specific knowledge, I have given such information or views as I have or may have expressed elsewhere. </p> <p> The effectiveness of ECOFIN and DSG - the adequacy of the DSG process, including consideration of the bank resolution legislation: I had no involvement with ECOFIN from the time the NTMA was established.  The NTMA had been invited to attend DSG meetings from late 2007 onwards in relation to the placing of deposits with domestic commercial banks.  As stated in the Nyberg report, the NTMA reacted to the onset of the credit crisis like most market participants by withdrawing much of their deposits from private institutions and placing them with central banks.  The NTMA provided advice and assistance from 2007 in the following areas: assistance in accessing specialist expertise; preparation of contract documentation; gathering market intelligence; assisting with communications with rating agencies and providing information concerning cost implications of changes in sovereign debt rating; the provision of liquidity to Irish banks on the basis of ministerial direction.  It also put in place arrangements to allow it to engage in collateralised lending to Irish banks.  The NTMA provided comments on draft legislation, as requested, from time to time. </p> <p> The next item - effectiveness of the CBI liquidity group under the joint financial stability committee: the NTMA was asked to attend a group to discuss liquidity.  This was composed of a member or members of the Government, the Central Bank, Department of Finance, Department of the Taoiseach, the Financial Regulator and the Attorney General - not all present on every occasion.  There was generally a discussion on the liquidity situation of the banks, the extent of their borrowing from the Central Bank and problems associated with emergency lending.  Frequently, all the attendees other than the NTMA, Central Bank staff and regulator's staff would adjourn to another room to discuss the situation.  The role of the NTMA was generally to specify what funds we had.  There was, from time to time, discussions on the NTMA placing funds with the Irish banks.  We would do so but, on legal advice, only on the basis of a written direction from the Minister for Finance.  I attended many of these meetings myself, and invariably did so when the Minister for Finance wished me to be present.  Generally, however, someone from the NTMA was present in Government Buildings when meetings were in progress, but, in many instances, would not have been in attendance at some or most of those meetings.  This was also my experience. </p> <p> The role of advisers in analysing the crisis -  at the request of the Minister for Finance, we hired Merrill Lynch to provide advice to him.  The apparent reason for the involvement of the NTMA in this was that the Department of Finance wanted us to charge the cost to the NTMA operating budget, as they did not have adequate funds in their own budget to meet the cost - ultimately about &euro;6 million.  We also hired Dr. Peter Bacon, at the Minister&rsquo;s request, to produce a report for him which, ultimately, became the basis for NAMA.  In addition, PwC and Arthur Cox were engaged to provide financial and legal due diligence services, respectively, in regard to the Minister&rsquo;s directed investments by the National Pensions Reserve Fund Commission into AIB and Bank of Ireland in 2009. </p> <p> The liquidity versus solvency debate - there is some validity in the argument that lack of liquidity can lead to insolvency.  Many businesses that are solvent on an ongoing basis will rapidly become insolvent if they run out of cash and have to realise assets suddenly in what might be called a fire sale.  However, in the case of the banks, the enormous amounts they had lent to individual developers to enable them to pay extraordinarily high prices for property, and the rolling up of interest, much of which may have been taken into the profit and loss account, meant that insolvency was almost inevitable.  </p>  <p>         Department of Finance actions - appraisal of the conditions relating to increasing the deposit guarantee scheme; appropriateness of the bank guarantee decision.  I was in the United States on the night that the decision was taken and only became aware of it through a text message from a colleague the following morning.  If there was a risk of a run on the banks, then a guarantee on deposits was probably the best course of action.  I understand that the senior bonds were issued on the basis that they ranked <i>pari passu</i>with deposits.  The rationale for guaranteeing other bonds is not clear.<br/><br/>Effectiveness of reviews of banks&rsquo; loans books and capital adequacy - I saw the PwC review of the banks&rsquo; loan books.  At that stage the damage had been done and the only question was the scale of the disaster.  The early review underestimated the size of the ultimate losses; much larger State support was later required.<br/><br/>Decision to nationalise Anglo in 2009 and alternatives - At that stage it was probably inevitable.  By then there was nothing to indicate that it had a future as a privately-owned institution.<br/><br/>Establishment, operation and effectiveness of NAMA - The decision to establish NAMA was taken very quickly by the Minister for Finance and I supported the Minister when he announced it.  I also, at his request, went to see Mr. Trichet at the ECB to tell him that we would need about &euro;60 million ... sorry, &euro;60 billion from the ECB to fund it.  I was hesitant about the amount of money that was going to be paid into the banks and the rapidity with which it was to be done.  The Minister felt it would free up the banks to start lending again.  I felt that we should take just some loans from the banks and see if that would encourage them to lend.  I also felt that the banks should be pressed to recover the loans themselves as they knew where the bodies were buried.  Transferring them to NAMA would be a bonanza for lawyers and other professionals, as well as requiring a large staff in NAMA.  In the event, a very large number of loans were transferred to NAMA at a substantial discount.  And regardless of what happened, the likelihood is that the outcome would have been the same.<br/><br/>Decision to recapitalise Anglo, AIB, etc., and alternatives - Some type of banking system had to be preserved for the State and the Minister went for the two pillar bank model.  EBS was taken over by AIB.  The problem was that NAMA imposed very substantial discounts on the loans they took over - and I'm not in a position to give a view on the correctness of their discounts - and this had the effect of wiping out the capital of the banks.  They, therefore, had to be recapitalised to stay in business.<br/><br/>The cost of the crisis and sharing of the impact - I have no particular insights on this.<br/><br/>Role and influence of the ECB -  The ECB and the Irish Central Bank - as part of the ECB - had a role as lender of last resort.  They did provide very considerable resources to the Irish banking system, with a reported 25% of their total lending being extended to the Irish banking system.  My only involvement with the ECB was, as mentioned earlier, to ask Mr. Trichet for funding for NAMA.<br/><br/>Options for burden-sharing during 2008-2013 - In terms of sharing the burden with other eurozone countries, this just did not find acceptance.  In terms of what happened within the State, this was a matter for Government decision.  On the more general question, repayments abroad by the State in respect of its own debts were made as were repayments in respect of senior bank bonds, which, as I understand it, legally ranked <i>pari passu</i>with bank deposits.  Other repayments on junior bonds were also made.  However, many of the other payments were between Irish residents themselves and, as such, were a transfer of wealth within the Irish State.  In terms of the impact that they had on the balance sheets of banks and on their incurred losses, these had the same impact as if the cash involved was transferred out of the country.  There is, in my view, a valid argument that, to the extent that losses were incurred by Irish banks arising out of transfers between Irish citizens - and which gave rise in part to the need to recapitalise the Irish banks - the case for transfers from other countries, by way of free money or grants, to recapitalise the Irish banks was questionable.  Also to the extent to which cheap funds - i.e. at interest rates below what otherwise would have been the case - were made available to Ireland, there was a transfer of wealth from other eurozone countries to Ireland.  This applied particularly to funds provided by the ECB and this could be classified as burden-sharing.<br/><br/>The role of the eurozone and international partners in the decision - I was not involved in this area.<br/><br/>The ... B1(a), the adequacy of board ... the composition, skills and experience of the board and board sub-committees; adequacy of board oversight over internal controls to ensure risk is properly identified, managed and monitored - As CEO of the NTMA, I had no involvement with the above.  However, I would have read their annual reports and was very impressed at what they said they were doing in the area of corporate governance and risk management.  Boards can, however, be quite reliant on management to bring to their attention such items as are of importance.  There can be a tendency to swamp directors with vast amounts of paper and without prioritising issues with which a board should concern itself.  This may be seen as a form of self-protection by management, which can argue at a later date that all matters were brought to directors&rsquo; attention.  I do not know to what extent this was happening in Irish banks prior to the crash or the rationale they had for the very rapid expansion of credit.  Another important factor is the consensus culture on boards, where a discordant note may not be welcome, particularly on the part of a dominant chairman.<br/><br/>Appropriateness of funding sources - the mix, maturity profile and cost.  As CEO of the NTMA, this would not have been an area where I would have had an involvement.  I would have presumed that the highest standards would have applied.  However, I was somewhat perplexed at the very rapid growth in credit and on one occasion spent some time going through the Central Bank statistics to try to understand it.  </p>  <p>         The closest I could get to finding out the backing for this credit expansion was that, in respect of their Irish businesses, the Irish banks had borrowed somewhere between &euro;100 billion and &euro;200 billion.  As I was surprised at this, I asked a colleague to check my figures to see if it was correct.  He confirmed my findings, but was able to provide a more accurate figure.</p> <p> On the same general question of some banks' approach to funding costs, I should add that on a reasonably regular basis, I came across non-Irish banks that lent money to us, and as far as I could see, either made no money, lost money, or took risks on their funding that I would have regarded as, at best, questionable on their part.  To some extent, at least, banks internationally were buying market share or keeping themselves high in international rating lists, even where deals made little or no financial sense.  I would not have thought this applied to Irish banks.</p> <p> R1 (c) - appropriateness of the macroeconomic and prudential policy.  As CEO of the NTMA, I had no functional role in these areas and would have been very .. would have very little knowledge of prudential policy.  However, I was surprised that public expenditure was not cut back after the 2007 election, as it had been after the 2002 election, if for no other reason than to increase it again before the next election.  I also felt that the level of house and apartment building was unsustainable by any measure and, if applied proportionately to other countries, would have given figures that were multiples of what they were actually doing.  I think the same view was held by some persons at Government level and the hope was that at least some of the building workers could be employed in other non-housing construction areas.  I was also aware that costs and prices in Ireland were rising more rapidly than elsewhere in euro land.  These issues are difficult to correct, particularly in the absence of a crisis, and where so many people are benefitting.</p> <p> The fundamental problem arose because Ireland moved from a regime which had relatively high annual growth in wages and prices but which also had its own currency and control over its value.  While movements in that currency were constrained by Ireland's membership of the European Monetary System, it was possible to have currency devaluations with the agreement of other member states.  What this meant was that when a country got into currency-related difficulties, it could, in effect, press the reset button by devaluing the currency and starting again.  This flexibility went when Ireland joined the euro, but, in return, it was relieved of the risk of speculative pressures on its exchange rate and enjoyed a much lower interest rate regime.  It also gained access to what appeared to be virtually limitless sources of credit.  However, because the pattern of relatively high wage and price increases continued, competitiveness was gradually lost.  Also, the Irish banks, instead of covering their lending from a large population of small to medium deposits, i.e. not large corporate deposits, relied to a great degree on borrowings from the international interbank market.  By their nature these funds are short-term and need to be constantly rolled over.  When this becomes difficult, and other sources of funding are not available, a crisis arises, which is what happened.</p> <p> Effectiveness of the supervisory practice, Central Bank, Financial Regulator and Department of Finance - The NTMA had no involvement in the supervisory practice.</p> <p> Appropriateness of the expert advice sought - As mentioned earlier, on the instructions of the Minister for Finance the NTMA got advice for him from Merrill Lynch and from Dr. Peter Bacon.  It may be the Minister was receiving advice from other sources also.  His decision to create NAMA would have been based on advice he obtained from Dr. Bacon.  Advice was also got from PwC and Arthur Cox.</p> <p> Analysis of contrarian views - By the time the crisis occurred, I do not recall any strongly voiced contrarian views which were ... would have had a significant bearing on its outcome.  There were always calls from the Central Bank and other international organisations for more prudence on the part of governments.  This constant crying of wolf would have blunted its effectiveness.</p> <p> Appropriateness of advice from the Department of Finance to the Government - Apart from seeing a draft of a memorandum for the Government recommending the establishment of NAMA, I would not have been aware of what advice they were giving to the Government.</p> <p> Appropriateness of the relationship between the Government, the Oireachtas, the banking sector and the property sector - The NTMA would not have had any particular insights into these relationships and I would not be in a position to offer any view on them.</p> <p> Adequacy and impact of international organisations' oversight on banking regulation - The NTMA would have had no knowledge of what was going on in this area.</p> <p> There may be a perception in some circles that the NTMA was some, sort of, shadow Department of Finance or Central Bank.  While this was most certainly not the case, the NTMA did provide all such assistance and advice as we could during the financial crisis, based on the experience and knowledge we had and we assisted in procuring such other advice as was requested of us.  The Central Bank-Financial Regulator had a very large staff to deal with the banking sector.  The NTMA's role was very clear.  Its primary function was to raise funds for the Exchequer, not to provide liquidity for the banks.  This was the role of the Central Bank, as lender of last resort.</p> <p> To put the role of the NTMA in context during the financial crisis and to show that we were actually doing in line with our legal obligations, it may be worthwhile to set out some of the challenges faced and activities undertaken in 2009, and the situation at the end of that year.  We had a very full workload.  The national debt had gone up by &euro;25 billion during the year to stand at &euro;75 billion.  Even with that, however, the general government debt-GDP ratio was 65.6%, well below the EU average of 78.7%.  </p>  <p>         On a net basis, after deducting off cash balances and the assets of the National Pensions Reserves Fund, Ireland&rsquo;s debt-GDP ratio was 37.9% at end-2009.  The NTMA raised &euro;35.4 billion in long-term funding in 2009, of which &euro;24.6 billion was used to fund the Exchequer deficit, &euro;5 billion to refinance a maturing &euro;5 billion bond, leaving &euro;5 billion in long-term funding for the 2010 deficit.  Foreign investors held 84% of Ireland&rsquo;s bonds at end 2009.  The four major credit rating agencies still rated Ireland at AA at end-2009.  The yield premium over Germany had narrowed to 1.45%, down from 3% earlier in the year.  The debt service costs were &euro;686 million below budget, approximately half of which was due to interest rates achieved by the NTMA on 2009 borrowing, which were lower than those prevailing at the time the supplementary budget, which was agreed in April 2009.</p> <p> The State Claims Agency - the name used by the NTMA when dealing with claims - had received 1,219 new claims during 2009, had settled 1,631 claims and was managing about 4,000 claims at year end.  Of these, there were 1,783 clinical claims under management, with an estimated cost of &euro;693 million.  Obstetric-related claims, although only 18% of the total, represented 57% of the total estimated liability.  The State Claims Agency had a statutory brief to provide advice and assistance to all health enterprises and worked to support patient safety and help minimise clinical claims.  A comprehensive programme of training and services was undertaken in 2009, particularly targeted at hospital consultants and other speciality groups.  The State Claims Agency also dealt with employer liability, public liability and third-party property damage claims, with 2,271 such claims - having an estimated cost of &euro;90 million - under management at end-2009.  In this area, the SCA encouraged State authorities to implement internationally benchmarked health and safety management systems and worked with the Defence Forces, the Irish Prison Service, the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, as well as other Government Departments.</p> <p> The NTMA, as manager of the National Pensions Reserve Fund, invested &euro;7 billion in preference shares in AIB and Bank of Ireland on the direction of the Minister for Finance, known as directed investments.  Arrangements were also made to transfer the assets of 16 universities and non-commercial State bodies&rsquo; pension funds to the NPRF.  The fund disinvested from seven companies and excluded four others because of their involvement in the manufacture of cluster munitions or other anti-personnel devices or because they had not sufficiently distanced themselves from their manufacture.</p> <p> The NPRF was invested in quoted equities, including global large cap, global small cap and global emerging markets, fixed income, including eurozone government bonds and corporate bonds, and alternative assets, including private equity, property, commodities and forestry, absolute return investments and infrastructure, as well as the directed investments in the two main banks.  The directed portfolio, i.e., excluding the investment in the banks, recorded a return of 20.6% in 2009.  The fund at end 2009 was valued at &euro;22.3 billion.</p> <p> The National Development Finance Agency, established in 2003 to provide a financial advisory service to State bodies in respect of capital projects, had its remit significantly expanded in 2007 to include the actual procurement of all PPP public capital projects, except transport projects.  By end-2009, the NDFA had completed its advice on 48 projects with a combined capital value of over &euro;6.5 billion, was working on over 50 active projects and had brought the first bundle of schools to financial close.  Among the projects on which the NDFA had provided advice, and which were commissioned in 2009 or shortly thereafter, were the Criminal Courts of Justice building, the Dublin Convention Centre, the Aviva Stadium, the national integrated medical imaging system and much work had been put into metro north project, as well as the third level education PPP programme, the National Concert Hall, the DART underground project and the national plan for radiation oncology.</p> <p> In addition to the above functions, the NTMA was responsible for: the Housing Finance Agency commercial paper programme; the provision of central treasury services to non-commercial State bodies - local government authorities, the HSE and vocational educational committees - providing them with a competitive alternative to the banking sector for their treasury business; the European Central Bank liquidity management, which was regulating the level of Government cash balances at the Central Bank of Ireland; agricultural commodity intervention bills issued on behalf of the Minister for Agriculture to fund the gap between agricultural intervention payments by the Minister and recoupment from the EU &ndash; there was a turnover &euro;465 billion, sorry, that's million, I think,  in 2009; dormant accounts fund - certain unclaimed balances on bank accounts and insurance policies are received and managed by the NTMA, &euro;135 million at end 2009, pending disbursement by the Government or repayment to the owners; the social insurance fund - the NTMA had managed the surplus on this fund since 2001 and during 2009 transferred &euro;2.9 billion back to the Department of Social and Family Affairs; emissions trading - the NTMA was designated as the national purchasing agent for the purchase of carbon credits on behalf of Ireland in accordance with the Kyoto Protocol.</p> <p> In summary, at end-2009 the NTMA had &euro;21.8 billion in liquid assets to fund the Exchequer into the future and &euro;22.3 billion in the National Pensions Reserve Fund and its total staff at end 2009 was 169.  By the time the NTMA was brought into the deliberations on the banking crisis, there were no easy solutions.  However, by virtue of the fact that the NTMA existed and had prudently managed its operations, the State was in a much better condition financially to tackle the crisis than would otherwise have been the case.  Thank you, Chairman.</p></speech>

We had been sceptical about it for quite a long time.  We felt that it grew very rapidly, it seemed to make very good profits, it seemed to pay over the odds for cash, it seemed to charge over the odds when it lent out money.  It didn't have a natural deposit base.  It was kind of, we felt, an accident waiting to happen.  It relied largely on either large deposits or funding on the interbank market.  It didn't have a natural small deposit base which at least might be ... you know, fairly secure that you wouldn't find all these deposits disappearing at the one time.  But if you rely on the interbank market which is ... it's certainly not made for backing long-term lending ... well, there's going to be trouble.  So they had obviously got into trouble.  The impression we had was that a lot of their loans were ... well they'd been provided for property, etc., they would have been questionable.  Whether it was going to be nationalised then or at a later stage or whatever, I don't know.  But my general view would have been that it didn't have a long-term future and that it wasn't something that we could bring back to life again.</p></speech>

I mean, if there was going to be ... nationalisation might take a while.  I mean, I haven't ... I'm not very clear on how quickly you can actually nationalise a bank but you can do a guarantee very quickly and I had experience many years beforehand of a run on the Dublin Trustee Savings Bank where a panic was created because they were apparently running out of cash and it was not a scene I would want to see repeated.  So, if something had to be done quickly, I would have favoured a guarantee.  That did not necessarily ... guaranteeing deposits ... that did not necessarily rule out nationalising it at a later stage.</p></speech>

When you're not there, you're not very sure.  I mean, I've heard so many different descriptions of what went on that night.  The one that seemed to me to be most credible was that the two main banks went in and said they were prepared to provide &euro;5 billion each to Anglo to keep them going on the basis that they would get a State guarantee and for whatever reason by, I think that was 6 o'clock or something in the evening, in the early hours of the morning that seemed to have turned into a guarantee of everything that moved.  Now, what happened in between, I don't know.  I mean, I wasn't there.  I've heard bits and pieces of gossip but if I was there and we were threatened with a run on the bank, I would have felt that whatever else happens, we cannot have a run of depositors on the bank and if that requires a guarantee, well, we give a guarantee.  </p>  <p>         The question then is what exactly do you guarantee?  Do you guarantee everything?  I would have guaranteed deposits.  Whether I would have guaranteed the full 100% of deposits or not, I don't know.  Because, you know, there would have been an interplay of ideas.  I certainly would have balked, I think, at going any further than that because I wouldn't have felt it was absolutely necessary to go any further than that.  The thing, as I would have seen it, was to avoid a run on the banks, a physical run on the banks with people panicking outside banks looking for their cash back and I would have felt that would have to be stopped.</p></speech>

I mean, my attitude would have been give as little as you can, until you are pushed to give more and you are absolutely convinced that you have to give more.  Now I did hear that ... and I don't know how accurate this would be, that legally, in the prospectuses for those senior bonds that they ranked <i>pari passu</i>with deposits.  But, if the State, which didn't own any of these banks at this stage, if that had moved in to give a guarantee, it didn't necessarily have to, I think, guarantee the bonds because they ranked <i>pari passu</i>with deposits.  I think you could have just guaranteed the deposits because it was a third party and it could move in to do whatever it wished.</p></speech>

We're off to get lunch'.'  So they went off somewhere.  We went across the road to the Merrion Hotel and we got a bowl of soup and we came back and we were asked in then at half five to ... we were shown a statement that they were going to release.

I think Brendan McDonagh mentioned there about August 2007 that he called me.  I got a phone call then, either from the Department of Finance or the Central Bank.  I think it was the Department of Finance complaining that we, as deposits matured, we were taking them off the ... away from the banks and putting them into the Central Bank and we were causing problems.  So I rang back, I think it was to Oliver Whelan and said, ''I am getting these complaints, what's the scene?'' because I was on holidays at the time and I wasn't completely up to speed with what was happening.  So he said to me, ''Look, there is general unease about what's going on'', and he said, ''Well, but as the deposits mature'', he said, ''in accordance with your views, we are taking them off and putting them in the Central Bank''.  And I said, ''Well, continue to do so.''  And I think I rang back the Department of Finance and said, ''I have told the boy ... I'm not going on with what you want, I have told the boys to continue doing it ... taking it off and putting it into the Central Bank'', that we are not taking any risks.

I always had a concern about Anglo and there was always pressure on us to put money with Anglo.

And we agreed we'd put in &euro;40 million for up to one year, and the pressure continued from them to put in more and we wouldn't put in any more.  Now when the crisis occurred I checked on the Anglo deposit, and somewhat to my dismay I discovered that the deposit had been put on for 12 months, it was a 12-month deposit, because I thought maybe if it's three months, we'll get our money back quickly and that'll be the end of it.  But, unfortunately, it was on for 12 months.  So I went to see then could I get a credit default swap, which is effectively an insurance against the bank going bust, to cover the Anglo deposit but, I mean, the costs were off the wall for us to do it, even at that early stage.  Obviously, there was very little confidence in the ... in Anglo.</p></speech>

I was under ... every meeting I attended of the Department of Finance, Central Bank, whatever, I came under pressure to provide money for the banks which I steadfastly refused to do.  And we had a meeting of the NTMA advisory committee, I think it was about 6 December, when the pressure was extreme.  And I went off and I said I'd have to get legal advice on this as to where do I stand.  Because, I mean, the Minister for Finance was my boss and I wanted to see, well, what do I do?  Because the legal power that we were using was to borrow money for the Exchequer.  It wasn't to borrow money to bail out the banks and that was ... I signed prospectuses, statements to the Stock Exchange and everything else, stating that this was what we were borrowing money for.  And this was what ... the undertakings that I gave to banks.  We were borrowing money to fund the Exchequer.  Here we were being pushed to use that money, which was there to pay the bills at the end of the week, to instead prop up the banks, to provide liquidity for the banks.  So I went off and I asked for a legal opinion.  I asked, by the way, was this legal opinion provided to you, and I gather it hasn't been, although I have no objection whatsoever to applying ... to giving it to you.  It ... I gave it to the two Ministers.  I gave it to the Department of Finance and I'm quite happy to share the context ... contents with you.</p></speech>

I mean, apart from I might be doing with the money, it also said that by providing deposits to Irish banks we could be in breach of two EU laws, that we were providing preference to banks of a particular nationality, i.e. Irish banks, which apparently was in contravention of Article 12 of the treaty, that you can't discriminate on grounds of nationality.  And the second thing was that we could be in breach of state aid rules because this would be regarded as state aid to a particular group of banks, and that we were not entitled to provide a state aid unless it was cleared by the European Commission, and that it was unlikely that it would be cleared by the European Commission.  </p>  <p>         So, it ... the legal advice to me then was, &quot;Well, look, you can't do it.&quot;  There was a question mark about whether the Minister could do it, but, the advice to me was, if the Minister tells you, I mean, what it said was:</p><blockquote>	If a policy direction was given, querist would have to treat it as presumptively valid and would have to comply.  However, in the absence of a direction, it would not, in my view, be legitimate for querist to pursue the course of action proposed.  And, if the Minister wishes querist to adopt this course of action, he has a statutory procedure available to him.  This procedure has been provided for the purpose, namely, of transparent ministerial control.  It would not be appropriate to bypass, or, in any way, undermine that statutory mechanism by accepting and acting upon informal departmental requests or suggestions.  [Sorry, I'm not going to read a whole load of stuff here, but if I may,]  Querist owes a good faith duty to prudently manage funds under its control in accordance with law and in accordance with its own assessment of risk.  I do not believe it is legitimate for querist to use his fiduciary powers to pursue wider policy objectives, no matter how laudable these objectives may be, without the protection of a ministerial direction. </blockquote> <p>So, that was the basis on which I said to the Minister, there's my thing, &quot;If you want it done, you will have to direct me to do it, and then I will do it.&quot;</p></speech>

I mean, they ... our attitude was, we have this money, we've placed it with the Central Bank.  You, Central Bank, if you want to, you can use it to fund banks, you know. "Why are you looking for us to use it to fund banks?  Have you not got confidence?  Why don't you go and do it yourselves?"  So, that was basically our line.  And we also felt that they were the lender of last resort, they were part of the ECB, and they should be able to get whatever cash they needed.</p></speech>

In relation to NAMA, Dr. Somers, can I ask you to comment further on your statement, which is on page 8, that, even when loans are transferred to NAMA, participating banks should still be pressed to recover those loans themselves, as they knew "where the bodies were buried".  Was there an assumption that the existing management in banks would not be in a position to objectively assess the likely losses in their loan books and might just kick the can down the road?  So, just explain that, why-----</p></speech>

The more I thought about it, the ... well, I didn't quite know how it was going to be implemented, and I was uneasy about putting such a huge amount of State money into ... handing it over to the banks.  The story was that if we didn't do this, the banks wouldn't start lending again.  Now, of course, you could say, with the benefit of hindsight, well, did we really want them to start lending again?  It was the lending that had caused all the trouble, and did we want to facilitate them in this?  But anyway, that was, kind of, beside the point  But, I felt that ... the banks were supposed to have 5,000 people dealing with all these problem loans, and we, at that stage, didn't have anybody.  I mean, we needed to build up a NAMA operation.  Now, I was very conscious myself of how difficult it is to get suitable people, to weld them into a team, to get them properly motivated, to set up all the systems, etc., and my initial idea - and I didn't know how the NAMA thing was going to develop at this stage - my initial idea was that if it came through the NTMA to run, maybe we could do it in the same way as we did with some of the other things we had.  You know, we had the NDFA, we had State Claims Agency, etc., and that maybe we could get a small number of people, perhaps 30 or 40 people, and get the banks to do the donkey work and we would oversee them, and pressurise them to, effectively, get the money back, because that was my first thought, you know, they, they probably have commitments to, to people, property developers.  And, I, I was shocked when I saw the level of loans that were out.  But, that they could pressurise people to get the money back.  I mean, they're well capable of pressurising people who owe them money to come back with it, whereas trying to set up a new NAMA unit. it didn't seem to me to be the optical solution.  Now, I accept I could have been wrong on that because I think, well, okay, if they have it-----</p></speech>

This is in relation to the &euro;60 billion sum that you were seeking for NAMA.  So can you comment on that and can you give us some background on how the &euro;60 billion figure was arrived at?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.2909" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Michael Somers" time="00:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/BIJ2015070900002#ZZZ00200"><p>It was, kind of, an unusual situation.  The way NAMA was developing, it looked as though they were going to need &euro;60 billion funding to buy the loans off the banks.  I knew Mr. Trichet for very many years because I had been on various committees with him and I knew him from the 1980s.  We had been on the EU monetary committee and we were involved with setting up the EBRD, etc., and I knew him reasonably well on a personal basis.<br/><br/>The Minister approached me about it, he said, &quot;Would you go and talk to Mr. Trichet and tell him we need &euro;60 billion?&quot;  So I said to him, &quot;Would it not be more appropriate for the Central Bank or the Department of Finance to do it?&quot;  And he said &quot;Would you go and do it you know him?&quot;  So I said, &quot;Okay, I'll go and do it.&quot;  So I arranged it anyway, I got my PA to ring Mr. Trichet's office and said, &quot;Look, I'd like to go out and see him.&quot;  I don't think we said what exactly I wanted and he said, &quot;Yes, that's fine.&quot;  And I arranged to go out and see him I think it was about March 2009.  I have the date here somewhere.<br/><br/>But that information got out to the Central Bank who were, I think, quite perturbed about it.  They and the Department of Finance insisted on accompanying me out to see Mr. Trichet.  The thing became a bit bizarre after that.  I think there were two from the Central Bank - the Governor and the head of the director general and I think it was Kevin Cardiff from the Department of Finance.  They went out themselves and I went out on a separate plane.  For the life of me I can't remember why.  We went into the ECB building and it became a bit fuzzy but they arranged that we would meet some officials from the ECB and what surprised me was the length of time that the Central Bank people took in trying to explain our situation to the ECB people.  I thought that they would be in regular contact and they would be way up to speed.  Then at some stage or other I said, &quot;What about meeting Mr. Trichet?&quot;  And I was told Mr. Trichet is not available.  So I thought that was very strange.  So I phoned back to my PA in Dublin and I said &quot;Would you ever ring Jean-Claude's office and find out what's going on here, I am supposed to see him?&quot;  So she contacted them anyway and she came back and she said &quot;Oh yeah no, he is available to see you at 11 o'clock or 12 o'clock&quot;, - whatever the time was.<br/><br/>Anyway, it was coming up to that time and I said, &quot;Where does the president sit?&quot;  So the Governor of the Central Bank insisted on coming with me and we went in to see Jean-Claude Trichet.  As I say I knew him well, I was on first name terms with him.  I was quite surprised that the Governor was not on first-name terms with <i>Monsieur le Pr&eacute;sident</i>, etc., and I would have thought they would have had a closer relationship.  So we chatted anyway and I said, &quot;Listen Jean-Claude, I am here on a rather difficult mission.  You are aware of our difficulties and I am afraid we are going to have to come to you looking for &euro;60 billion.&quot;</p></speech>

And the written direction, you know, covered, you know, whatever it was, a three-month or six-month deposit, and we said, "Now, unless we get another direction, we're taking that money out and we're going to put it back into the Central Bank, so do you want to give us another direction?"  I mean, this didn't do any ... didn't do an awful lot for personal relationships because, you know, the Minister was ... would have been ... or the Department would have been quite happy if we had just done it without any direction, but we were not doing it without any direction.</p></speech>

The increase from &euro;20,000 to &euro;100,000 brought a contingent liability on the State of up to &euro;70 billion.  That was a fivefold increase; that was a lot.

I mean, that was done.  I don't think we were consulted or involved or anything in that, but, I mean, it wouldn't have caused me any undue concern.  I think the British subsequently went up to &pound;85,000 or something, sterling.  It was just ... Deputy McGrath put to me, I think, about what I would have done if I was there on the night.  I mean, my general approach to things was I didn't give anything unless I was absolutely arm-twisted to give it, but I would have been very concerned about a run on the banks, particularly a physical run on the banks if you have people panicking because you don't know where ... how you're going to control it then.  It's out of your hands; you've lost control.  So, if I was asked, "What do we do?" I would have said, "Yes, we guarantee the deposits."  Guaranteeing bondholders I would have ... I think I would have said I'd long-finger that and I'll think about it because I just don't know and there wouldn't, as far as I know, have been any legal obligation on us to do it just because we guaranteed the deposits, because we were not the owners of the banks.  But, down the road then, I don't know.  I mean, maybe we would have had to guarantee them anyway.</p></speech>

I probably did see the thing after it with the questions.  I mean, the problem we had with the Department of Finance was we were not the regulator or the controller.  We had oodles of other things to be keeping us going and I just ... I earmarked the four ... the three people in the NTMA: John Corrigan, who had a full-time job trying to run the pension fund; Brendan was running all the IT, back office, payments etc.; and Oliver Whelan, who was trying to do the borrowing on behalf of the State; and then I was the CEO, I was trying to keep all the ... the balls in the air.  But this was kind of a part-time activity for us.  We had no particular expertise in terms of bank restructuring or ... and we didn't particularly want to and we weren't ... you know, mentality-wise, we were not policemen or controllers.  We were trying to get on with the businesses that we were charged with.  And Brendan was extremely active.  I mean, he'd boundless energy and he worked day and night at this thing and he ... I suppose to an extent the rest of us were doing travelling because I was the Irish director on the EIB board, so that took me away out of Dublin two days per month and then we had all the other things going on.  You know, we had to do endless marketing in terms of Irish bonds.  We had to keep an eye on the pension fund.  John Corrigan was doing a lot of that, Oliver Whelan was doing it, I was doing it.  Brendan at least was stationary in Dublin.  He didn't do a huge amount of travel, so he got dug into these things a lot more than the rest of us did.</p></speech>

I mean, they ran to billions.  And I think I wrote to the Minister for Finance, he'd asked me to write a letter to him about what I thought of the overall economic and financial scene, and I wrote to him and one of the things I mentioned was that some individual had loans from the banking system equivalent to 3% of our GNP, which I thought was absolutely staggering.

That they were losing confidence and the Minister had complained to me a few times about the level of credit default swaps and he said to me, "Can you not go into the market and do something about this?"  And I said to him, "How do you think I ... this is a market, I can't go in and influence this market.  This is the view that other people are taking of us.  This is what they're charging to insure our banks and it's not showing very much confidence in us."  I mean normally, these credit default swaps wouldn't have cost very much I think.  But when people begin to lose faith in you, then they don't charge you to insure.</p></speech>

So, it was a continuing cycle and didn't seem to be getting any better and ... I'm not sure that we saw where this was all going to end.  The hope was, I suppose, that confidence would return to the markets and that the interbank market might start functioning again.  But the difficulty was that we weren't the only country that was doing this.  I mean the general attitude of people who had money, surplus cash, instead of putting into the interbank market was to take it out and put it into local, central banks.  And then that, of course, resulted in a huge squeeze on liquidity and money just wasn't available anymore.  Now, was that our problem?  My attitude was that's not our problem.  You know, we all look after what we're obliged to look after and the central banks can recycle the money and ... now, central banks were not very good at recycling the money, but there was no particular reason why they couldn't do it.  And I think at one stage there was talk of some mechanism being introduced among central banks that would facilitate them in recycling liquidity but I don't know whether it ever actually came about.</p></speech>

I mean, our concern was to safeguard the money that we had.  As I say, we had the pension fund money and we had the cash that we'd raised to fund the Exchequer and, you know, what ... I'm not sure what else we could have said.  You know, it's up to the Central Bank, as the lender of last resort, to go and solve this problem.</p></speech>

Well, fine, there was a problem.  We all knew there was a problem - so what were we playing at here?</p></speech>

In the event, a very large number of loans were transferred at a substantial discount.  Would you have acted differently?  Do you feel the NAMA discount was appropriate?  And were you requested to provide advice in relation to NAMA?</p></speech>

Because, as I say, I felt that they knew where the bodies were all buried - we didn't.  And we needed to put together a team to do this work and we didn't have a readily available team to do it, whereas the banks did have this team.  And I felt that they'd created the problem.  They knew what the problem was, they knew where the ... as I say, where the bodies were buried.  They knew the individuals they were dealing with and I felt that they should sort it out.</p>  <p>  In terms of the discount, I mean, there's no absolute value for anything.  The price of anything ... the value of something is what somebody's prepared to pay you and if there's no money around, of course, the value of a product, whether its a house or a piece of land or whatever, is going to fall.  So, in terms of the NAMA discount, I suppose I would have thought to myself, well ... I knew Brendan but I don't know if I said to anybody, "He's going to cover his back - he's going to impose whatever discount he feels is necessary to make sure that he, at the end of the day, doesn't end up showing a loss."  And if I was in his position, I would have done the same thing.  Now, whether they had the correct discounts or not, I don't know.  I mean, I ended up then on the other side of the field as the State director with AIB and I was looking at this ... these discounts and I said, "God, these are enormous discounts.  Are these justified?"  And, of course, they were saying, "Well, they're not."  And I said, "Well, why don't you challenge them then?"  And they said, "Well, we can't challenge them [I think] 'til the whole process is finished."  And I think they felt they were not going to win anyway.  But that was it.  And the problem was the discounts then, of course, impinged on the capital of the banks and we ended up then in a situation where, okay, NAMA was not going to make a loss but, on the other hand, the banks had to be recapitalised by the State, so we put it into one pocket and took it out of another pocket and handed it back to the banks to recapitalise them.</p></speech>

That's, what, &euro;218 million a year.  He has &euro;1.6 billion in CoCos, these convertible shares, which he's getting 10% on, that's &euro;160 million.  So that's 400 and something million per year that he can get in interest out of the bank.  Now, the bank is supposed to be worth &euro;10 billion or &euro;11 billion.  It's not my decision, by the way, but if it was ... if I sold the bank ... and you sell it in a tranche, say, you sell 25% of the thing, you're going to have to sell it at a discount because people are not going to pay you the full value for, you know, the shares where the State is still a 75% shareholder, so you're going to have to ... because they don't know what you're going to do.  So you're going to have to sell at a discount, so you're not going to get full value there.  Now, as you sell further tranches, I suppose you'd get a bit more value.  But even if you were to, say, to sell the whole lot today and you got, say, &euro;12 billion, the ... as I understand it, the only thing you can do with that money is use it to pay down the national debt, you can't actually use it to spend on, you know, worthwhile projects.  Now, if you use it to pay down the national debt, well, I think the ten-year rate on Irish Government bonds is about 1.7%.  So that's just over &euro;200 million that you'll save on interest payments on the national debt.  However, if you don't do that, you can collect 400 and something million per year in interest, which you can do what you like with.  You know, that comes in as general Government revenue as far as I know.  Do what you like with it.  And you also still have your investment of &euro;11 billion or &euro;12 billion, which hopefully will go up over the years and maybe, with a bit of luck, you might get close to the &euro;21 billion.  But, I mean, if you do it today, if you had to have a fire sale of AIB today, I suppose you'd get half that and then you have to ... then you crystalise the loss of &euro;10 billion.</p></speech>

Why ... what was our pay model?  When the NTMA was set up, it was set up because we could not hold staff.  By the way, I was secretary of the Department of Defence.  I was enjoying myself over there, you know, it was a boy scout's dream - best job I ever had.  The Government changed in 1987 and I was hauled back to the Department of Finance to, as Mr. Haughey said it, you know, he knew something about financial affairs, we've got to get this scene in order.  Now, you actually couldn't get staff into the place on the pay rates and you ... anybody who knew anything about the financial affairs then left, they went off to brokers, banks, whatever.  They left.  We were playing against the best in the world.  We were borrowing in every currency that you could imagine because we had Irish pounds, you couldn't borrow very much in Irish pounds, we were borrowing Kuwaiti dinar, dirhams, yen - everything.  It was quite a tricky business because you had to have some knowledge of the capital markets of the world and we did not have that expertise in the Department of Finance.</p>  <p>  So we were playing against the Goldman Sachses and the Merrill Lynches and everything else and the general view was we were losing.  That we were not getting the best deals.  And the Government of the day said, "Okay, if you can't beat them join them.  We'll set up the NTMA."  And Albert Reynolds was very clear about this in the D&aacute;il, that, "We'll pay whatever it takes to get the best because no matter what we pay people, it's still a fraction of what you can gain or lose by a good decision compared to a bad decision."  So I hired people in on the basis of a basic rate of pay and a performance-related bonus and a car and, I think, VHI.  Now the car, because of the BIK thing was a questionable thing.  And we hired people in and we, you know, we got the debt, I think, under control - at lease we got the interest bill under control.  And gradually, then ... I was approached by Dermot Gleeson then, who was the Attorney General, and he said to me that the whole question of people suing the State had got out of control.  We had the question of the Army, I think virtually the whole Army sued for deafness and it was not well-handled.  And there were other cases coming up - I mean, there was asbestosis and all kinds of things coming up - and he came over to me and he said, "Could you fellas set up some sort of an organisation that would pay people and not have the State ripped off?", because he said he saw it on both sides; he saw it, you know, claiming on behalf of people and then, as Attorney General, trying to defend the cases.  So I said, "Well, I know nothing about it", and he said, "Well, you're the only ones that have the commercial capability because you can hire people in and you can pay them".  </p>  <p>         So anyway he ... that Government lost office then and then it went onto David Byrne, who became the new Attorney General, I said to him, "Do you want to proceed with this?" and he was very enthusiastic.  And he went off as EU Commissioner ... so he was ... sorry?</p></speech>

If I can maybe deal with one question myself there Mr. Somers, or Dr. Somers before we move on ... and this comes back to your witness statement there where under the C3(c) heading, the &quot;Effectiveness of reviews of banks&rsquo; loans books and capital adequacy&quot;, and you give a very strong line there when you said that when you saw the PwC review of the banks' loan books:</p> <blockquote> 	At that stage the damage had been done and the only question was the scale of the disaster.  The early review underestimated the size of the ultimate losses; much larger State support was later required. </blockquote>  <p>If you could maybe outline for the committee, Mr. or Dr. Somers, your view on the scale and type of lending by financial institutions in the PwC reports you reviewed.</p></speech>

We were out borrowing money to run the country in amounts as low as &euro;100 million, and we did not find the Irish banks very helpful to us.  AIB had pulled out ... that they were originally ... we used to, we used to have two ... the two main banks were market makers, AIB and Bank of Ireland.  Bank of Ireland got rid of their market making onto Davy Stockbrokers and AIB, in the middle of an auction, pulled out of market making, which I was furious over.  And then when, you know, we were relying on foreigners to make the market in Irish Government bonds, apart from Davy's in Dublin, they were the only Irish ones that were doing it.  But when I saw the amount of money that they had been lending to these other people and we were out, as I say, scavenging, looking for &euro;100 million here and &euro;100 million there to keep the ship of State afloat, I was flabbergasted by it.  Now, admittedly we were not, we were paying as little as we could get away with, they were, the other boys must have been paying up or something.  But, I found it absolutely astonishing, and by the way, these weren't to mega-companies or anything, these were frequently just to individuals or individuals who had formed themselves into a company.</p></speech>

But the obligation on it was to maximise the return on that fund because it was supposed to meet a substantial portion of the pension liabilities and no money was to come out of it before 2025.  And that was all laid down in law.  So we ... when the Government said, "Okay you've got to put money into preference shares", the view of the commission was that is not a good investment so we can't do it.  And they had to change the law, and they changed the law to provide that they could give us ... that the Minister could give us a direction to put money into preference shares in the banks, so we did what we were told.</p></speech>

I mean, we had the pension fund well spread over all kinds of asset classes.  There was no way we'd put &euro;3.5 billion into anything.

Is there any chance that this money might flow back in again?  It was generally a discussion just about the liquidity of the banking system and how close they were to providing emergency liquidity.

I mean, it wasn't within our ... the range of any outfit that we ever wanted to do business with.  It would have come into our sights, I suppose, when the credit ... when they started looking for money from us and I can't remember how far back that was.  See, we always maintained as much cash as we could because I saw what happened to the South American republics in the 1980s.  They were not in the high ... they were nothing like as indebted as we were.  But the problem they ran into was one of liquidity.  They left their ... they didn't pre-pay loans or anything.  So ... and when a year would come up, they'd have not only the borrowing requirement for that year to meet but they'd also have all the repayments of loans in that year.  Now, we saw what happened to them so our policy was ... sorry, I'm digressing slightly but just to try and answer the question for you.   Our ... we used to try and pre-pay loans one to two years before they matured so that, say in year ten, when that came up, we would have actually pre-paid that loan in year eight.  So when it came to year ten, all we seemed to have to do was to borrow for the borrowing requirement of that year and maybe not even that much because we would have pre-borrowed.  And then in that year, we'd say, "Okay, all we need is the money for this year or some of the money for this year", but we would also, without necessarily advertising the thing, borrow other money and we'd try and pre-pay other loans that were coming up in the next couple of years so that we didn't get hit for any huge amount of repayments in any particular year.  So the result was, we built up a pot of cash and that cost us money because we had to pay interest on it.  And we tried to alleviate the cost of that by place ... if we placed it with the Central Bank, we'd get a certain rate of return - not much.  If we placed it around the market, we'd get a slightly better rate of return.  On the other hand, we were not prepared to take any undue risk with that money.</p></speech>

Having known him over the years, did he ever lift the phone during the crisis and say, "Dr. Michael, what do you think about this?

Can I welcome Dr. Somers.  A few things that have come up from other questions that I just wanted to ask you.

I suppose I was always a bit contentious in the Department of Finance.  I'd different ideas about how things might be done.  And it went back ... I was a young fella in the Department of Finance.  There was the trade unions and the staff associations wanted to set up a widows' and children's pension fund, and the Secretary of the Department, Dr. Whitaker at the time, and Mr. Haughey, who was the Minister, were all in favour of this.  The Department was opposed to it.  And I got ... I was working in the pension sector at the time, and I got involved in it, and I thought it was a good idea.  And I ended up - I was 26 or something - I ended up as the main negotiator in this thing and cut a deal, and I got to know Mr. Haughey quite well at that stage, and would have discussed the terms of the deal with him, and would have agreed terms with him, which the Department did not necessarily approve of.  But, I mean, we got the deal done, it's still there, by and large, for the whole public sector.</p>  <p>  Now, at the end of it Dr. Whitaker was going down as Governor of the Central Bank, and he brought me down for two years, so I escaped the wrath of the place for two years and then I went back again.  And I suppose I ... well, I had my own ideas about how things should be run.  Then I left, and I became Secretary of the Department of Defence and then, when I was brought back there was fury over it and I was, kind of, parachuted in and ... to try and do something about the debt.  And it did not go down well.  And then we set up the NTMA and there was fury over that, and ... I mean, there was an allegation made, I think before this committee, that somehow or other I had, when I set up the NTMA, I denuded-----</p></speech>

And I actually wrote a letter to the paper, because somebody drew my attention to this thing, and said, "You shouldn't let this thing go, you know, without any challenge because it looks as though you've ... you're the cause of the Department of Finance."  I think he suggested that the Department was not in a position to deal with the crisis when it occurred because the NTMA had taken the economists out of the Department.  Now, in fact, there was a 15-year gap, and I didn't take any economists out of the Department of Finance.  I took ... 25 people decided to follow me, and they took a ferocious risk in doing it, because they were warned that if they joined me in trying to set up the NTMA, they had to resign as civil servants and there was no coming back and they'd be out on the streets.  They said I'd fail, and they'd be out on the streets within a year.  But none of them were actual economists.  We took, I suppose, a high-profile activity out of the Department of Finance.  We were being paid more than they were being paid, we operated a different model.  I mean, we operated a professional model.  We hired in an awful lot of professionals.</p></speech>

I want to ask, in relation to your opening statement, you said in it that you, and I'm quoting directly, you became "somewhat perplexed at the very rapid growth in credit and on one occasion spent some time going through the Central Bank statistics to try to understand it".  Can you recall when that perplexion hit you?</p></speech>

And the economics, such as I could remember them - and I suppose it was Milton Friedman stuff - was and I'm sure Senator Barrett will correct me if I'm wrong on this, that you generally expected that the monetary aggregates would grow more or less in line with nominal GNP.  But here we had this fantastic situation where the Irish monetary aggregate seemed to be growing at multiples of nominal GNP, at 3%, three, sorry, three times.  And we used to muse about this in the NTMA, we'd say, well, and I ... my successor actually quoted at the recent ... at some public accounts committee that he was at, he said that I used to say, "Well, either we've learned some new branch of economics and they're going to have to rewrite all the textbooks, or else there's going to be an almighty crash".  Because, I couldn't see how the monetary aggregates could grow so fast.  But, anyway, one day this ... this was bothering me and I got out a whole load of Central Bank reports and I went through them to see how was this credit being created.  And the best I could do, because they're not, at least for me, they're not easy going, was that the Irish banks in respect of their Irish business had borrowed somewhere between &euro;100 billion and &euro;200 billion from outside the State, and I thought well this was a big risk area.</p></speech>

I said, "This is extraordinary stuff."  And he said to me, "You're not listening to the Governor of the Central Bank, the Irish banks are well capitalised, they've been stressed tested, what are you on about?"  So, I said, "Well, maybe I'm wrong."</p></speech>

And we would have discussed what was going on in the country.  And one of the issues was this idea of building 90,000 or 100,000 dwellings every year, it wasn't sustainable.  I mean, he accepted that it wasn't sustainable.  And he was very concerned about it.  But, I mean, the problem is you're on roll here, and how do you stop it?  And he had hoped, and I hope I'm not putting words in his mouth here, but he had hoped that the reconstruction of the whole centre of Dublin, the Carlton site and everything that went on around there, would absorb some of the workers that could not be employed anymore in building dwellings, because we just had too many dwellings.  And there was a huge plan to redevelop that whole area and the Arnotts site and everything else and he thought that might take some of them.  But it wasn't the full solution.  But it wasn't as though people were unaware of it.  But I mean, it was just, kind of, a fantastic amount of building.  I mean, we were bringing in people from outside the country to build houses for them to live in, and the Irish people buying them as an investment.  It was, sort of, extraordinary.</p></speech>

Well, my colleague, John Corrigan, whom, I think, you are seeing next week, he looked around to see who could we get that wasn't already conflicted because the Irish institutions had all hired their own advisers, etc., and the only ones that had not been hired for something were Merrill Lynch and there was some difficulty in trying to get Merrill's.  And we ... for whatever reason, I seemed to contact Bill McDonough about it who had been president of the New York Fed and he was able to put some pressure on them.  Anyway, they came in.  It wasn't a question that we had a huge choice.  They were the only ones.  Now, why was it done in such close proximity to the guarantee?  Well, when we hired them, we didn't know that guarantee was going to arise.  I mean, I had no idea that weekend that this crisis was going to suddenly arise on Monday because, as I said, John Corrigan and I, we were booked on a 10.30 flight on Monday morning out of Dublin.  We could very easily have cancelled that but we had no indication in the wide earthly world that this was ... I mean, there was a crisis every week but so what?</p></speech>

It was the Department of Finance, the Central Bank, obviously the Government Ministers and the Attorney General.  I mean, the Government Ministers ... well, it was the Taoiseach, Minister for Finance.  Sometimes Minister Eamon Ryan would have been there as well and, as I say, the Attorney General.

Dr. Somers, you retired from the NTMA in December 2009?  Is that correct?  So, did you have any sense at that stage of the fact that, within a year, Ireland would end up in a formal bailout programme and what do you believe were the factors that led to that over the course of 2010?  Given that you were there up to the end of 2009, did you see the inevitability at that stage of where all of this was going and what, do you believe, were the main factors that led us into a programme?</p></speech>

I never thought that it would happen.  I mean, one of the nightmares for us for many years - because I was responsible for our end for many years - was the IMF.  I mean, that was the thing.  Actually ... because we would be writing memos to Government telling them to cut back on their expenditure.  That was the bogeyman that we held up, "Listen, if you don't behave yourselves and get your finances under control, the next thing is we'll have the IMF in here running the show for us."  So, for me, I felt it was the ultimate humiliation actually for us, as a country, to have the IMF come in to run the show for us.  Why did it happen?  You know, we had three years warning of this thing.  This all started in 2007 ... August 2007.  And the bailout thing eventually occurred in ... three years later in 2010.  And you'd say to yourself, "Well, could we have got our act together better?  Could we have sold ourselves better or whatever in the meantime?"  I mean, we had been ... my colleagues and I, we had been through worse crises in the 1980s where our debt was enormous and, you know, we got through it.  We tapped every bank in the world for a few bob and none of them knew that we'd tapped the other fellas.  So we'd a vast number of very small loans and suddenly we'd a big load of cash.

You wrote an opinion piece in November 2010 on <i>The Irish Times,</i>which was really scathing of NAMA.  So ... and you actually said, &quot;What was really brought us to our knees as a country is the inevitable but calamitous consequences of working the NAMA project.&quot;  You say:</p> <blockquote> 	Namaism [as you called it] has created a monster that has done the opposite to what was intended.  With its haircuts and discounts and its immediate crystallisation of losses, it has wrecked the balance sheets of the banks and has ensured that there will be no net new lending by them. </blockquote>  <p>And you went on further.  You were absolutely scathing.</p></speech>

Well, I supported the whole NAMA project initially.  And, I mean, the Taoiseach said he went around the table and asked us all did we support it and I said "Yes."  I, kind of, began to get cold feet then about it as time went on and I saw the implications of it and the idea that we'd hand vast amounts of money over to the banks.  And I tried to persuade the Minister, and I failed on this, say, "Look, could we start with a few loans or something and see would that solve the problem.  Why do we have to take everything from them?  Or why can't we just, you know, get the banks to solve the thing and get them to pull in these loans that they've extended?  Why do we have to do this?  They created the problem and force them to do something about it."  He didn't seem to have an appetite for that.  I mean, he ... the whole Peter Bacon project ... he had met Peter Bacon somewhere or other, who had told him about this, kind of, project and he then rang me and said would I hire Peter Bacon, negotiate it with him, provide him with a room, etc., to produce a report to give him.  And Peter Bacon produced this thing very fast.  I thought actually, myself, that it would be turned down by the Department of Finance, because the one thing the Department of Finance were very good at was turning down things and I reckoned this would never get past them.  But it did and suddenly it became Government policy and it took legs.  And suddenly here we were with this thing and it was, kind of, semi-frightening that ... you know, that we were going to take on this huge liability and hand over all this money to the banks and I tried to see could I slow it down because, well, I never saw the likes of it before.  And it was done in Sweden.  You see, there was a Swedish model, but I think in Sweden it was only about 8% of their GNP.  It was nothing like the vast thing that we had here in this country.</p></speech>

I just want to wrap up a couple of things.  Dr. Somers, in or around 2007 ... you're a bit like myself, I'm not great on names and dates; I just remember the general picture.  But in 2007, the summer of then, the NTMA took an &euro;8 million investment in Bank of Ireland bonds and I think it started to invest other bonds in the Irish market at that time.  Would you have any idea, off the top of your head, as to what the quantity of the NTMA investment was in Irish institutional bonds in around 2007-2008?</p></speech>

I knew him quite well and Brendan Halligan asked me would I sit up so at least he'd have a ... whether he thought it was a friendly face or whatever but at least somebody he knew.  I mean, his attitude was, as I understood it, that he had a quarter of his loan book stuck in Ireland.  That he had given ... he had just given another chunk of money to Ireland and his attitude was, "If you want any more, you know, I've come to the end of my ... the road here, you'll have to go for a bailout, you'll have to bring a few others in because I'm not putting any more than 25%."  And by the way, if I was in his position I would have said exactly the same, you know, a quarter of your loan book out to one small country, it was, he was taking a huge risk, I think.  Now I'm probably biased because we've been friends for years and, you know, I wouldn't have the hostile attitude.  Well, I always found him a very pleasant fellow and, as I say, I knew he was a Breton he felt he'd close relations with Ireland and that he had done the best he could.

We all know him well from his previous role with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.  It is great to have him in attendance in his role as ambassador to the UN.  I extend a warm welcome to Mr. Donoghue.</p><p>Today's meeting is timely.  Ireland's permanent representative only flew in from New York this morning and is travelling on to Addis Ababa to the first of three meetings this year regarding sustainable development goals.  The first meeting will relate to financing.  The joint committee is aware of the role that the permanent representative has in co-facilitating the international negotiations of the global development framework in 2015 along with his colleague from Kenya.  We congratulate Mr. Donoghue on his prestigious appointment by Mr. Ban Ki-moon.  It is an important role in the preparation of the global development framework.</p><p>Under the format of today's meeting, we will receive an opening statement from Mr. Donoghue.  As usual, we will then have a questions and answers session with members.  Before beginning, I remind members, witnesses and those in the public gallery to ensure that their mobile telephones are switched off completely for the duration of the meeting, as they cause interference with the recording equipment in the committee room even while on silent mode.  I remind members of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person or body outside the Houses or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.

As the Chairman mentioned, we are meeting at an important moment that sees three major conferences taking place before the end of the year.  The Addis Ababa conference is first and is specifically on financing for development, followed by the New York summit in September that will announce the new sustainable development goals and targets and the climate change Conference of the Parties, COP 21, in Paris in December that we all hope will produce a new, legally binding and universal climate agreement.  People speak about 2015 as being a momentous year for sustainable development in all of its forms.  We hope that, by the end of the year, each of the three conferences will have been a success.  One can genuinely say that the world will be a different place if we can get these agreements <i>in situ</i>, but there are several large &quot;ifs&quot; that I will touch on in my statement and in discussion with members.<br/><br/>I will first address the particular task that Ireland has been asked to take on, namely, co-facilitating or co-chairing the post-2015 development agenda negotiations.  I am happy to discuss the prospects for Addis Ababa, but I have no specific responsibility for that.  I am broadly aware of what is happening and know the importance of the conference for my work.  Strictly speaking, though, the Addis Ababa co-facilitators are Norway and Guyana.  I do not envy them.  My Kenyan colleague and I are working closely with them, but I do not speak with any particular authority about the Addis Ababa track.<br/><br/>It is a great honour for Ireland to have been chosen to perform one of the two co-facilitation roles for the finalisation of the post-2015 development agenda.  One can speculate as to why we were approached but, to one degree or another, it reflects the esteem in which Ireland is held at the UN as an honest broker and sensitive mediator between the global north and global south on many issues.  We are known for an independent-mindedness.  It also reflects the specific reputation that the Irish Aid programme has had for many years.  This inspires confidence on the part of many developing countries in our impartiality and fairness <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>their interests.<br/><br/>The structure of the negotiations is such that we have had approximately six months of monthly sessions.  We are now approaching the final stretch and my Kenyan colleague and I are determined to complete the negotiations on the post-2015 development agenda by 31 July with a view to the summit in September.  The Addis Ababa conference is an important event that will happen between now and the end of July.  It is one that, if it goes well, will be a positive factor in the completion of our own work.  If it goes badly or there is a sense of frustration or stalemate on the part of any group of countries, that could affect the atmosphere around the conclusion of our work.  For the moment, though, I am thinking positively.  Within our post-2015 negotiations, the mood has been positive and constructive in recent months.  There have been some difficulties in negotiating the Addis Ababa outcome document.  I am happy to discuss them, but I hope that they are of a temporary nature and that, by this time next week, we will have clarity about the outcome.  There is a certain amount of concern about Addis Ababa because the negotiation of that document has been so protracted and, as of now, is not yet complete.<br/><br/>Members have held valuable discussions on this topic, so they will be aware of what the sustainable development agenda seeks to do.  In essence, where the millennium development goals, MDGs, were only eight in number and focused on traditional development priorities, for example, health and education, the sustainable development goals are new in at least three respects.  First, they will cover a vast range of policy areas because they reflected the so-called three dimensions of sustainable development, those being, economic, social and environmental.  We are no longer dealing purely with poverty eradication.  We are now dealing with poverty eradication, saving the planet - environmental protection - and the creation of conditions for sustained economic growth around the world.  If I am not straining the metaphor, this is like three sides of the same coin.  The view is that, for example, one cannot tackle poverty in a sustainable way without factoring in the other two dimensions.  A vast and highly ambitious agenda, it is considerably larger than the MDGs.  This is a key difference.  </p>  <p>         <b></b>Another key difference is that whereas the millennium development goals were not negotiated in a strict sense, they were just promulgated, these sustainable development goals are to be owned by all the countries concerned, the 193 member states, and they are, therefore, to be negotiated.  There was an earlier negotiation phase called the Open Working Group, which completed its work a year ago, and that phase reached agreement on a set of 17 goals and 169 targets but that was a relatively limited group of countries.  The negotiations, which I am co-facilitating, involve seeking the approval of each of the 193 member states of the UN for the goals and targets and finalising them in various other ways and also providing details about how we will implement the goals, both the financial and non-financial means, and monitor progress.  It is a framework we are trying to put in place based on a proposal which already exists for 17 goals and 169 targets.  The targets can be understood as subsidiary goals in individual areas.  This is a very ambitious project.  <br/><br/>The third key difference is that this agenda will be universal and that means literally that every country in the world will agree to take up these commitments.  They are only political commitments, they are not legally binding, but every country in the world would be endorsing the same agenda.  This is in an effort to get away from the traditional north-south divide whereby development was seen purely as a priority for developing countries, now the intention is to have a universal agenda covering all the areas I mentioned which will help every country.  Obviously, some countries are further along the spectrum of development than others but no country in the world, however well developed, could say that it has achieved all or any of the goals to 100%.  To one degree or another, there is room to be make up in every country in the world.  We emphasise very much that this is a collective agenda and it spans these three areas.<br/><br/>Ireland has been closely involved in this particular project for the past few years.  In September 2013 we co-facilitated a special summit which reviewed the millennium development goals and how they had performed.  On the whole they have performed well in some areas and less well in others but that summit took stock of where the world had got to in terms of the millennium development goals.  Ireland and South Africa co-facilitated that summit, and I pay tribute to my predecessor Ambassador Anne Anderson who played a key role there.  We have also been involved in the Open Working Group phase, as one of the smaller number of countries.  We also had a key role during the EU Presidency a few years ago when Ireland at ministerial and official level brokered agreement within the EU on how the EU should approach these negotiations.  <br/><br/>I am not sticking closely to my prepared script.  I will not exceed the time the Chairman has set me-----</p></speech>

Mr. David Donoghue" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070900002#C00300"><p>-----but I will try to give the members a general sense of what we are at.</p>  <p>  The particular document which my Kenyan colleague and I are negotiating among the 193 member states of the UN will begin with a declaration.  This is intended to be a concise but visionary and uplifting declaration by the Heads of the State and Government, who will meet in New York in September, of their political will and political commitment to the new agenda.  It is meant to be something on the lines of millennium declaration, a call to action, and that is an important part of our work.  </p>  <p>  On the goals and targets, my guess at this stage is that 17 will be the final number.  From time to time, one or two countries have suggested that the figure of 17 could be reduced but the overwhelming view among developed and developing countries alike was that it would be extremely risky to try to condense or amalgamate goals that had been agreed in the earlier phase because somewhere along the line somebody's key interest would be damaged.  It was considered much safer all round to leave the figure at 17 but to work instead on a communications strategy which would try to bring into focus what these goals are about for ordinary people around the world.  One can imagine that even the idea of summarising or crystallising the key points of the agenda is highly contested by some member states or groups because they fear that substance of importance to them will be lost in the process.  They are almost against any attempt to summarise.  However, my colleague and I have put forward a draft declaration which tries to distil the essence of the agenda, and we are making some progress.</p>  <p>  The targets are a tricky matter.  The figure of 169 targets sounds rather formidable but it means an average of, say, seven or eight per goal.  The targets will remain at 169 but a number of them could be improved technically because, in one or other respect, they are deficient.  Even that is a contentious exercise.  Many countries fear that so-called technical improvement would lead to substantive loss of substance, but I believe we will have some slight improvements.</p>  <p>  The issue of implementation is crucial.  What arrangements should we have at the global, regional and national levels to enable countries to demonstrate that they are taking this agenda seriously and that they are working within their own powers to implement it?  It is accepted that there will be some monitoring and review at the global level.  Members might think that is fairly obvious but for many developing countries, there is a concern that they will not have enough capacity in terms of data collection to be able to report faithfully on their progress.  They also fear that they will be exposed as having performed in an unsatisfactory way.  There is a great deal of resistance on the part of developing countries to strongly developed global review machinery.  They prefer to focus on implementation at national level, and I believe a balance will be struck eventually between the three levels.</p>  <p>  On the Addis dimension, if I can call it that, members may see the term "means of implementation" from time to time.  "Means of implementation" are the means, financial or otherwise, by which the goals will be implemented.  In the immediate sense, it means resources along the lines of overseas development aid, ODA, but by no means confined to ODA.  It also means policies, measures and a range of other items in a single, comprehensive package.  It is easier if I take ODA first.  The developing countries attach great importance to ODA but, broadly speaking, the developed countries take the view that it is very important but it is not the only part of the Addis package and that they also need domestic resource mobilisation.  That is the term used for efforts to improve the tax take in developing countries, notably.  The developing countries recognise that this is an important priority.  Broadly speaking, ODA and domestic resource mobilisation would be seen as the twin top priorities in the Addis package.  I will conclude shortly and take questions.  </p>  <p>         A key issue for all of us at present is that, first, the Addis Ababa meeting to be held next week will be successful and, second, that all concerned will accept that it will be the final word in terms of the resources needed for implementing the future goals and targets.  There is a real fear on the part of developed countries that developing countries will do their best to obtain the most favourable deal at Addis Ababa and then, having failed to get everything they want, turn their attention to our negotiations, which are due to continue until the end of July, and use political and moral pressure to try to squeeze out more in the context of, for example, ODA commitments.  It has been a running theme for the developed countries in recent weeks and months that the Addis Ababa conference must be seen as the end of the road in terms of the means needed to implement the future agenda.  On the other hand, the developing countries are keeping their options open.  There was a tension between those two positions but it is gradually being overcome.  With luck, if the Addis Ababa meeting produces a very clear-cut and satisfactory outcome all around, the developing countries will hopefully accept that, in effect, this is all that is going to be available in the context of implementation of the new goals and targets.  I use the word "all" because, potentially, this is going to be a massive package.  It is not a pledging conference but the document to be agreed in Addis Ababa is meant to cover, as already stated, financial resources of all kinds but also things such as capacity building, technology transfer, ways of making it easier to remit money, debt relief, trade negotiations, tackling illicit financial flows, etc.  The agenda is vast and the Addis Ababa package on its own ought to be sufficient to ensure the implementation of the golden targets.  As stated, however, the particular tension to which I refer has yet to be addressed.</p> <p> I have probably run out of time in terms of commenting on the UN.</p></speech>

It also happens to be the 70th anniversary of the founding of the UN.  The latter anniversary will provide the backdrop to the September summit and there will be quite an amount of publicity surrounding the entire event.  Ireland is marking 60 years of active engagement at the UN by hosting a number of public events, both at home and abroad, in order to raise awareness of the role we have played at the UN and the contribution we are continuing to make.  We are known at the UN for an involvement in a number of areas.  In no particular order, these are: human rights; disarmament and non-proliferation; peace and security, which is quite a broad spectrum but which includes issues such as women, peace and security - the role of women in defusing conflict; and, of course, development.  At present, there is a strong emphasis on our development interests but over the years we have been known for our engagement on the wider set of matters to which I refer.</p>  <p>  On 25 May, the Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade formally launched the 60th anniversary programme of events.  This programme includes: thematic lectures; a UN youth delegate programme and related youth events; a commemorative exhibition, which will be hosted in both New York and Ireland, about the early years of our membership; a peacekeeping event in partnership with the Department of Defence and the Defence Forces; and a symposium marking the date on which Ireland formally acceded to the UN, namely, 14 December 1955.  As the Chairman stated, some of the events in the programme have already taken place.  In particular, I refer to the visit of the UN Secretary General, Ban Ki-moon, which was a notable success.  The Secretary General's visit came about specifically because he was awarded the Tipperary International Peace Award but we used his coming here as an occasion to reflect more broadly on Ireland's role at the UN in this 60th anniversary year.  Ban Ki-moon managed to engage on each of those policy areas to which I refer.  The recent Irish Humanitarian Summit can also be seen as an initiative in the context of the anniversary, although it was actually one of the events being held in the build-up to the World Humanitarian Summit which is to be held next year and which will be a key priority for Ban Ki-moon in his final year in office.  There are various other events and activities that will be held during the anniversary.  For example, a reference map of our UN engagement across the globe will be published and distributed to all secondary schools in the run-up to the UN General Assembly week in September.</p>  <p>  I will leave it at that, if I may.  I just wanted to provide a quick overview of the activities planned.  I might add that an extremely attractive brochure, A Place Among the Nations: Ireland at the UN 1955-2015, has been published by my colleagues at the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade.</p></speech>

As a country, we are privileged to have a person of the capacity, calibre and commitment of Mr. Donoghue as our ambassador to the UN.  Those of us who have seen him operate in different roles in the past know of his commitment and of his great work on behalf of our country.</p>  <p>  The ambassador referred to the formation of the UN 70 years ago in the immediate aftermath of the Second World War.  Reference has often been made at meetings of this committee to the need for a complete restructuring of the United Nations.  The organisation has not changed in line with the changes to the geopolitical system across the globe.  That system is very different from what is was 70 years ago.  Is there any desire within the United Nations for change?  Are any of the major countries which control so much of its activity, etc., willing to put in place new structures?  The Security Council and other councils of the UN are dominated by a few major powers and blocs.  Is there any indication of a willingness to change the structures of the UN?</p>  <p>  The ambassador quite rightly referred to our proud record of participation in UN peacekeeping missions and in UN work in general.  There has been a strong presence of Permanent Defence Forces personnel from my constituency, Cavan-Monaghan, on UN missions over the years.  I recall quite well the pride everyone in the constituency took from local people going on such missions.  Some of the most satisfying ceremonies I ever attended were those held to mark the departure of troops on UN missions and those held to welcome them home.  The vast majority of our personnel have returned home safe from such missions, which is a major issue.  Irish Defence Forces personnel continue to do outstanding peacekeeping work in many difficult locations throughout the world.</p>  <p>  The ambassador also referred to the importance of the Addis Ababa conference.  That importance is obvious because it will set the scene in terms of what can be achieved by other conferences.  An issue of concern is that which relates to civil society space and the post-2015 agenda.  Successive Governments have quite rightly prioritised human rights issues, particularly the participation of women.  I understand that less and less space is being made available for NGOs and human rights defenders to participate freely in society.  Irish representatives on the UN Human Rights Council have championed this issue and they must continue to do so.  Is the ambassador satisfied that the draft text adequately highlights the issue of civil society space?  In light of Ireland's role as a facilitator of the process, are we somewhat constrained in terms of being a very strong champion and advocate in respect of this very important issue?  </p>  <p>               Does the European Union share the same views as Ireland in regard to civil society space and the need to tackle this issue head on?  </p> <p> I wish to refer to a few issues that the ambassador raised in his script and oral contribution.  In his script he stated:  "We are working towards a vision of integrated sustainable development which will be universally applicable while emphasising national ownership and differentiation."  That vision is desirable and necessary but it will be difficult to achieve.  How can we have universal applicability across different member states and regions when there are differences in societal structure and development, and economic development?  Is thought being given to this matter at the moment?  </p> <p> The ambassador mentioned that "a number of targets remain under consideration in the negotiations".  Are they critical targets?  Are they targets that have not been agreed yet and may be detrimental if agreement is not achieved? </p> <p> The ambassador mentioned another positive aspect.  I was glad to read in his script that there will be "a framework to review progress and implementation" which is essential.  One can have the best strategies in the world but if they are not implemented in a timely manner then it will be unsatisfactory.  </p> <p> I wish the ambassador well in his work as a facilitator.  I hope he will have an opportunity to refer to the role that the private sector should play in mobilising resources for the least developed countries and their people to ensure that they gain from resources that belong to their homelands.  </p></speech>

I shall speak as a member of this committee.  I shall also speak as the person who chairs the Irish section of AWEPA and, therefore, I have had a lot of engagement with African parliamentarians.</p>  <p>  The ambassador has said that the millennium development goals have enjoyed some success but I think they have not been a glaring success and there have been major shortfalls and gaps.  There are still millions of people who are hungry, there are still health issues and we can still see growing inequality.  Why are we debating 17 sustainable development goals when there is still so much work to be done on the millennium development goals?</p>  <p>  The ambassador used the word "ambitious" but I would add the word "aspirational".  How realistic are the 17 goals?  Is it wise to have 17 goals?  I am sure that he will be aware of the statistic that 80% of the world's humanitarian crises are man-made.  They are made by people in the developed world and in the developing world, but mainly the developed world.  It is the developing world that pays the price for the mistakes made by men in the developed world, all of which comes down to implementation and the resources to implement goals.  We talk about saving the planet but we know that the developed world has done more damage to the planet and has massive effects on the developing world.</p>  <p>  A report entitled Where Aid Meets Trade was recently published by Tr&oacute;caire and I chaired the panel at its launch.  The report complimented Irish aid because it is untied aid.  We are seeing a demand or request being made of donor countries.  The aid is increasing the economic growth of the donor country which, in turn, will have a major effect on sustainable development goals.  </p>  <p>  I have read the 17 sustainable development goals but did not see a goal of tax justice.  The whole initiative will go down the Swanee unless tax justice is addressed because we know more is being lost to the global south through tax avoidance and evasion than is coming to them in aid.  I would love to have seen tax justice as a major sustainable development goal.  I would like to hear the ambassador's opinion on the matter.  </p>  <p>  Finally, Addis is so important.  Addis is right and its conclusions are the right ones so the next two conferences will mean nothing.  The level of our delegation attending Addis is a matter I have raised before.  I mean no disrespect to the Minister of State, Deputy Sherlock.  I know he is committed to the matter but the conference will discuss financing for development and his brief is development.  I wonder about the level of representation by the African countries which is at a higher level than representation from Ireland or other European countries.  </p></speech>

I welcome the ambassador, Mr. Donoghue.  It is refreshing that he departed from his script and eyeballed the committee which always shows a real commitment and purpose.</p>  <p>  I support strongly what Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan said about need for tax justice to be addressed; it is a fundamental question.  Had she not raised the matter I would have raised it myself but she has done so in a very clear way.  I shall ask my question but I may not have time to wait for the reply.  At the conferences various goals will be discussed and 179 countries will be involved but the goals will not be legally binding.  That suggests to me that people will find ways of weaselling out of the goals unless they are legally binding.  I know it would be difficult to get 179 countries to agree to something that was legally binding.  When there is a crisis we see representatives of countries stepping up to the television cameras pledging this and that, and that they will give "X" amount of money but that never happens.  The public pledges are just done for publicity purposes.  What is the ambassador's feeling about the response of all of these countries?  The United Nations is a very mixed bag.  There are countries that are represented by, in many cases, rather squalid regimes.  How confident is the ambassador that these measures will be respected?  They may be agreed to in the full glare of publicity but they are without legal backing.  </p></speech>

Mr. David Donoghue" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070900002#E01100"><p>Yes.  The Senator put his finger on a weakness.  I do not think that is necessarily a fatal weakness of the future goals and targets.  No, they will not be legally binding.  It would have been inconceivable to get the agreement of 193 countries to some kind of court situation where they would be required to account for their performance.  The poorest countries would obviously claim that they were unable to implement to the degree that the rest of us wanted because they did not have enough capacity to do so and it is up to us to help them to get this capacity.  At the same time there is an enormous moral force that comes from the fact that, for the first time ever, almost 200 countries will sign up to the same set of commitments.</p>  <p>  I have used the phrase "political embarrassment" which is quite a real thing.  Countries will not want to be seen to ignore what they agreed to at the UN.  They can claim that, due to circumstances beyond their control, they are a bit behind in terms of implementation.  What they will not be able to do is simply say "we are not going to implement them."   Such a degree of intensity has built up around these new goals and targets that they will be a fixture from now on and will always exist.  Therefore, it will be hard for a country to ignore them.  There is also the peer review aspect.  Let us say one has eight or nine countries in Central America reporting individually on how they have done.  Each of them will want to be seen to be up to speed with the others, roughly speaking.  Incidentally, a regional implementation of goals and targets is also important.  In some ways, it will be more important than the global level.  Overall, it would be difficult for a country to wash its hands of them.</p>  <p>  The universal agenda was one of the points mentioned by Deputy Smith, or perhaps it was Deputy O'Sullivan.  The universal agenda is an extremely ambitious approach.  </p>  <p>         It is necessary to allow for the various differentiations at the regional or national level.  We have to make a go of it and begin by saying that these are commitments that every country in the world agrees to.  <br/><br/>In practice, we know that countries will set their own priorities.  We do not necessarily approve of that, but we know that it happens as a matter of human nature.  For example, Austria will not prioritise the goal relating to oceans.  I am being a bit facetious in saying that because it is a landlocked country and it will have other priorities.  It follows that some of the goals will be more important to a country than others.  There will be self-selection within the full set of goals.  Officially, every country is taking on the full set of commitments and will need to show why, in practice, it went for one set of priorities rather than another.  There will be a lot of understanding for such a position.  People know that it is not realistic to expect that there will be 100% performance across the full range of goals.  <br/><br/>There is also a desire to have a positive spirit for all of this.  It is not a question of finger wagging and telling a country it has fallen way behind the rest.  It is meant to be almost a collective self-assistance.  We want to help developing countries, in particular, to make the progress required.  The reason I am emphasising this is that, for example, people sometimes ask if the process would be like the universal peer review pertaining to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva.  The answer is &quot;No, it won't be&quot; because there are international human rights treaties which have been signed up to and are legally binding.  The commitments to which I refer are political.  If there is a voluntary political commitment, one cannot denounce a country because it has not moved as fast as it should.  The Senator is correct that if something is not legally binding, it may somehow fade away, but the collective moral force of the single agenda being taken on by all countries will not go away easily and will ensure that some progress is made. <br/><br/>I will take Deputy Smith's questions.  On the restructuring of the UN, he is quite right.  The issue has been around for quite a while and there are a couple of dimensions.  First is how the Security Council could and should be reformed.  The second dimension concerns UN agencies and whether they might find that their mandates need to be reviewed in light of the new goals and targets we are agreeing.  I will discuss the Security Council first.  It is true that the five permanent members of the Security Council have a certain interest in maintaining the <i>status quo</i>.  That said, they declare themselves open, to one degree or another, but some are more open than others, to an expansion of the Security Council.  <br/><br/>There are two main models being proposed.  I will not go into detail about them, but one, in effect, envisages creating an additional number of permanent seats and non-permanent two-year terms.  The second model proposes no new permanent seats, but more non-permanent seats.  From the point of view of a country like Ireland, we hope to be able to maintain a rhythm of getting onto the Security Council about once every 20 years.  That would be seem as reasonable and normal.  We would not want to see any new model adopted which would reduce the frequency with which we would get on and many other countries will feel the same way.  <br/><br/>Geographical representation needs to be expanded.  Africa, for example, accounts for about two thirds of the workload of the Security Council, but African states have to queue for a two-year term here and there.  There is a strong case to be made for creating some expanded representation for African countries.  Another issue is rising regional powers.  One could ask whether countries such as Germany, Japan, Brazil and South Africa should be given a permanent seat.  In the minds of many people, the questions have been answered and the answer is that they should be, but we are still at the debate level.<br/><br/>It had been hoped that concrete proposals for the reform of the Security Council would have been brought forward this year, marking the 70th anniversary year.  I doubt if we will make that deadline.  It is a matter for the General Assembly, which has considered the issue of reform of the membership of the Security Council for about ten years.  The debate will run for a little bit longer.  Ireland is involved with a number of other countries in trying to reform the working methods of the Security Council which is also important.  It means, for example, greater transparency <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the rest of the UN membership and is a valid objective in itself.  It is, strictly speaking, separate from who the members of the Security Council would be.<br/><br/>One positive development is a French initiative to voluntarily abandon the veto right when it comes to mass atrocities.  France, as one of the five permanent members, developed a proposal that the permanent members would voluntarily not use their veto rights for some particularly awful crimes, along the lines of Rwanda or Srebrenica.  So far, no conclusion has been reached.  Ireland and many other countries think it is a good idea and it is the first sign or recognition that veto rights are quite unhelpful.  However, the other four permanent members are not yet on board.  It is still a positive development.  <br/><br/>On peacekeeping, I could not agree more that is a major plank of Ireland's reputation at the UN.  When the Government decided in 2013 to provide an Irish contingent for a peacekeeping mission on the Golan Heights, UNDOF, it was warmly appreciated by the UN because another country had withdrawn its troops abruptly due to the dangerous situation involved.  Ireland stepped up to the mark and is known to be a reliable country in that sense.  It gauges each situation carefully, but the fact is that Ireland's decision to join UNDOF at that stage, as well as UNIFIL, was very much appreciated by the UN and was seen as another example of Ireland's commitment to peacekeeping.  <br/><br/>On the civil society space, our colleagues at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, where Ireland is completing a three-year term, have brought forward a civil society space initiative.  In our post-2015 talks, I and my Kenyan colleague have arranged for a more informal civil society involvement whereby once a week during our monthly sessions there is a direct three-hour engagement with civil society, which has been appreciated.  We are now coming into the final stretch of our negotiations and want to find some way of keeping that going.  There is no particular restraint on us because we happen to be one of the two co-participators.  Ireland is known for its absolute commitment to civil society involvement in negotiations of this kind and the general human rights and political space.  That is not compromised in any way by our role in the post-2015 talks.  The real difficulty is that I and my Kenyan colleague cannot impose an arrangement on the 193 countries.  We have to win their support.  Civil society has been given considerable access to our negotiations and they appreciate it.  <br/><br/>I refer to the targets under consideration.  </p>  <p>         No, these are not particularly critical targets.  That is what I was talking about a moment ago when I referred to technical improvements.  In the rush to finish the earlier negotiating phase, some gaps were left in the proposal.  For example, if one of the targets involved increasing something by X%, the percentage was not filled in at the time.  Now it will be, I hope, and that is why we are talking about technical improvements.</p> <p> The role of the private sector is a big theme for Addis Ababa because the World Bank issued a report a couple of months ago called From Billions to Trillions: Transforming Development Finance/Post-2015 Financing for Development: Multilateral Development Finance.  Billions is what is accounted for by existing or projected levels of ODA; trillions is what we will need to implement to achieve entire goals and targets, because they are on such a vast scale, and that will require private sector involvement of all kinds.  The private sector wants to be involved.  Of course there are commercial opportunities, but many private sector organisations also have a strong sense of solidarity with this entire exercise and they want to recognise a social responsibility.  The private sector, therefore, is ready to become involved for different reasons, and that will be theme of the Addis Ababa conference.</p> <p> Deputy O'Sullivan raised a number of points.  On the question of the 17 goals, I was involved in the earlier negotiating phase and because we had to cover all of these new areas, such as climate change, environment, sustainable cities, human rights and even the means of implementation, that inevitably brought us from eight goals to close to 17.  Then it became 17.  We hoped that it would have been possible to reduce the number to approximately 15 goals at the time, but nobody could agree on what two should be left out.  Eventually it stayed at 17, and no serious effort has been made to reduce the number because if, theoretically, one was to combine climate change with something else to bring the number down, then the climate change people would say that that devalues climate change as a component in the framework.  That is why it was left at 17.</p> <p> The question of tax justice is a matter for the Addis Ababa conference because taxation is a means of implementation.  The issues around international taxation and co-operation relate to an important means of implementation, and they are not directly for our negotiations, but we are hoping there will be a good outcome on that, which we can then reflect in the document for September.  As it is, we will annex the Addis Ababa agreement to our own document for September, and tax justice is clearly an important issue.  It has been, though, one of the issues that has held up finalisation of the Addis Ababa document, because developing countries want to see an upgrade, as they call it, for a tax committee that exists at the UN, but some developed countries do not want to bring tax policy within the remit of the UN; they feel it is for the OECD.  There is a fundamental division of views on tax but, nevertheless, there will be reasonably good language in the Addis Ababa document.</p> <p> The Minister for Foreign Affairs and Trade answered the question about the delegation yesterday.  All EU member states will be represented at the Addis Ababa conference at development minister level.</p> <p> The Millennium Development Goals are important.  We have tried to make clear in our document that we will complete the unfinished business of those goals through the new goals and targets.  There is no chance that they will be forgotten about.  What they failed to achieve is still there in the first six or seven of the new goals.  It is an important issue, and many groups of countries insist that this unfinished business will be a vital part of what we do.</p></speech>

Like Senator Norris, I want to refer to the issue of the process being voluntary, politically and legally, but not binding.  What structure is in place to regularly review progress?  Is sanction provided for against countries that do not step up to the plate?  My other question relates to the commitment on overseas development aid and achieving the target of 0.7% of gross national income.  I read recently that the ambition is to achieve that by 2030, within the lifetime of the sustainable development goals.  That represents a missed opportunity, because it is too wide a timeframe and it is not aggressive enough.</p>  <p>  I support Deputy O'Sullivan on the tax justice issue.  I welcome the indication the permanent representative has given that the Addis Ababa conference and the document will seriously examine that issue, because if a balance is to be struck between developing and developed countries, this has to be seriously addressed, as well as the involvement of the private sector, because we must ensure it acts ethically, particularly in developing countries.</p></speech>

I have a very specific question on goal No. 5 in respect of achieving gender equality and the empowerment of all women and girls.  The UNFPA is on record as saying family planning is central to achieving gender equality and women's empowerment but it is also a factor in reducing poverty.  This year, the UN has a very specific focus on youth but unless we have gender equality in terms of women and young girls being able to plan how many pregnancies they have and how far apart those are, it will be very difficult for any of the 17 goals to be achieved.  That is in the context of recognising that approximately 800 women a day die due to pregnancy or pregnancy-related complications in the developing world.  It is a huge number and it leaves many children orphaned, families without carers and villages bereft of females because of their biology.  I acknowledge that it can be a difficult issue but there has been some criticism, in terms of the millennium development goals, that equality slipped down the agenda as it is politically difficult.  If one wants to end poverty and achieve the first part of goal No. 3, which is to reduce global maternal mortality, the key is access to safe, free choice in relation to family planning.</p>  <p>  We have spoken about countries setting their own priorities and that is a huge concern where, culturally, women are not seen or treated as equal.  Mary Robinson, a much better Irish woman than me, said it is the perpetrator and never the victim who uses the excuse of culture.  Where in the 17 global goals are those issues going to challenged?  Central to that is another WHO figure I came across recently.  Approximately 14 million people enter and die in the world every year who are never registered.  It goes back to this whole central thing about data collection.  What can we, as parliamentarians and as a government, do and what can the UN do to ensure that really boring but important work of data collection is a priority so that we can see that we are making inroads?  If one is trying to measure maternal death rates, population and mortality, it cannot be done unless births and deaths are registered.  It is not something people instinctively think about when they think about trying to improve infrastructure, but it is central and key.  As a parliamentarian or a diplomat, one might understand that kind of knowledge, but it may be a harder sell for others to get involved.</p>  <p>  Given our own difficulties with the issue in Ireland, how can we make a global impact?  I fear that if we do not get this right, it will make it very difficult to achieve any of the goals.</p></speech>

I will follow along the lines of Deputy Conway and am supportive of the general thrust of her remarks.  From my own experience in dealing with immigrants from developing countries, there is increasing evidence of people who are vulnerable remaining vulnerable even when they come to this jurisdiction.  They have become accustomed to being treated as second class citizens or not being allowed to achieve their full entitlements under any constitutional remit.  They are fearful of asserting themselves or considering that they have an entitlement to be treated as equal citizens to those around them.  This gives us all an opportunity to recognise their predicament first and foremost.  There have been many of them.  We can all talk about folklore in these cases but I remember the unfortunate case of a young woman who spent two or three years in this country, fell between systems and was deported to a developing country.  Eventually, she contracted AIDS and died.  That was unnecessary because help was at hand but the systems do not always work.  While our systems are supposed to meet, greet and catch those who are in danger of falling through the loops, they do not always work.  That is simply because the system is often impervious to the needs of the people.  For example, the Department of Justice and Equality and the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade have a different roles.</p>  <p>  I have come across the following situation on numerous occasions and I wish to emphasise it.  In assessing the entitlements of immigrants and people who are vulnerable, it often comes to pass that criteria are applied that are not really relevant.  If one checks with the Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade where a person in a particular category is very vulnerable in his or her homeland, one will find that no matter how much aid is diverted or concern expressed, he or she will fall through the system.  What I am asking about is how those who fall through the system can have their issues addressed.</p></speech>

My focus is on the COP21 conference which is one of the most important to be held not only this year, but this decade.  I read an interesting piece by Lara Marlowe on the conference in which she referred to the experience of an adviser to President Hollande at a previous conference in Morocco.  </p>  <p>               A participant there said that people in Paris will decide who lives and who dies.  Of course, half of the mammals, birds and reptiles of the world have disappeared in the last 45 years as a result of human activity but particularly due to climate change.  When one sees the US military classify climate change as more dangerous than global terrorism, which is on our news every day, one would have to consider it to be a serious and perhaps extinction level event for humanity.  Unfortunately, however, the immediate takes over importance at present and global terrorism is what makes the six o'clock news while the incrementalism of climate change, even though its effects are all around us, is not as dramatic as the stories about ISIS.</p> <p> The humanitarian crisis in the Mediterranean is partly caused by ISIS and global terrorism but is also caused by climate change, yet there is what can only be described as a very poor response by the developed countries across the European Union.  When one sees that level of response to what is more manageable compared to the scale of climate change, it is nothing short of a disaster.  It is only the beginning of the migration season; it has not yet hit its height.  This year will not be the last year of it.  In fact, we will probably look back in five years' time and think 2015 was not such a bad year when there were only half a million people trying to cross the Mediterranean, because it is just going to get worse.  One sees the inability of Europe to address it.  We have just commemorated the anniversary of Srebrenica where Europe could not stop a massacre on its doorstep, yet it is faced with something colossal in terms of what must be dealt with.  The world's and humanity's ability to deal with something so colossal is probably not good, as history will tell us.</p> <p> As Mary Robinson and others have pointed out, this is the most important issue facing humanity as it affects everybody, yet our trade agreements and economics tell us that trade should not be affected by anything decided in respect of climate change.  The two are not compatible.  We cannot continue to insist on making profits or China cannot consistently open one coal burning electricity generating station a day, as it was commissioning at one stage, and expect that things can continue as normal.  As China now knows, life expectancy there has dropped by five years as a result of climate change.  Can the world agree before it is too late?  That sounds desperately dramatic but all the evidence is before us.  We had a global economic crisis and the evidence was there telling us that there was such a crisis, yet everybody was denying it was happening.  Then it happened and everybody said it was predictable.  It was predicted but nobody was listening.  How realistic is it that there will be something comprehensive and that the major powers will abide by it?  There have been too many failures in the past.</p></speech>

Mr. David Donoghue" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070900002#K00200"><p>Senator Mullins asked what structure there is at present to review progress.  Strictly speaking, we will be creating new structures through the September summit and the document that will be issued.  There will be a global structure to review progress in implementing the goals and targets.  There is a body called the High-level Political Forum on Sustainable Development which has just finished meeting in New York.  It is under the United Nations Economic and Social Council, ECOSOC, and this high-level political forum, which is only about two years old, will have the responsibility to carry out reviewing and monitoring at global level.  That much is clear.  The detail of how it will do that is only being worked out and, in fact, not all of that detail will even appear in the outcome document for September.<br/><br/>I mentioned earlier the reservations that many developing countries have about machinery which is too intrusive at global level, from their point of view.  On the other hand, there are developed countries which feel that, especially with the massive amount of resources which will be directed towards implementing these goals and targets, there must be something systematic and rigorous at global level.  It will be a compromise.  What will probably happen is that the high-level political forum will meet once a year and it will have a supporting secretariat.  It will receive reports from individual member states and it will summon them over a period of several years.  Obviously with 193 member states, it will not be easy.<br/><br/>There will also be thematic reviews.  It might be that individual UN agencies will carry out a review of, for example, gender equality, migrants, indigenous peoples or some such aspect, and see how they are doing under the new goals and targets.  These are ideas which are being worked on at present and, precisely because many developing countries are worried about something which is too structured and prescriptive, we will probably hold back on much of that detail.  The document for September will be couched in very general terms.<br/><br/>At the regional level, there are already some regional commissions, for example, in central America or in west Africa, which represent UN interests.  They will be used to carry out some element of peer review.  The phrase &quot;peer review&quot; goes down badly, but it is the idea of comparison between one country and another in a positive spirit to see if there are lessons which can be learned within a particular region from the effectiveness of one country in achieving the goals on, for example, health, and whether those lessons can be carried across.  It is meant to be a positive experience sharing approach.<br/><br/>Most of the effort will be at national level.  Most countries will set up some type of centralised arrangement to monitor how they are doing on the SDGs.  Each country will do its own thing.  In fact, in some cases countries have already set up the machinery before the new goals have even been approved.  Colombia, for example, makes much of the fact that it has a national plan which already reflects the draft goals and targets from last year.  National development plans around the world will be used to give effect to the goals and targets.  That is a somewhat lengthy reply but I wished to indicate the thinking that already exists.  I note the comment on the 0.7% target, but I will not respond on that.  The Senator also referred to the tax justice issue.<br/><br/>Deputy Conway is absolutely right about gender equality.  To reassure her, there is a really strong sense that virtually no issue is more important than gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls in terms of the implementation of this new framework .  It is hard to quantify matters and say one issue is more important than another, but across the board in all groups of countries there is a strong emphasis on the importance of gender equality.  The Deputy has read goal No. 5.  Perhaps I can refer to the declaration I mentioned earlier, which will be a key part of the document.  There is a paragraph where we state:</p> <blockquote> 	Working for gender equality and the empowerment of women and girls will make a crucial contribution to progress across all the goals and targets.  The achievement of full human potential and of sustainable development is not possible if one half of humanity continues to be denied its full rights and opportunities.  This is also a basic issue of human rights. ...Women and girls must enjoy equal access to education...[and so forth]. </blockquote>  <p>  </p>  <p>         I am just giving a flavour of it.  That is the type of language that will be used in the declaration.  The specific issues raised by Deputy Conway are perhaps covered by the following: </p><blockquote>	We commit to accelerating the progress made to date in reducing infant, child and maternal mortality by ending all preventible deaths of infants, children and expectant mothers by 2030.  We shall ensure universal access to sexual reproductive health care services, including for family planning, information and education etc. </blockquote> <p>The Deputy's concerns are valid and they are being addressed not only in terms of the goals and targets set but in the surrounding declaration.  I believe they will be highlighted in the public presentation of the goals and targets.<br/><br/>On data collection, again the point made was an extremely important one.  The developed countries recognise that they will have to help many developing countries to not only improve their statistical capacity but to create it in the first instance.  There are some countries that do not exist in statistical terms because they have never been able to file returns.  This new framework will not work unless we can show that returns have been filed for every country in the world.  We will have to be able to fill in all the blanks.This is recognised as a responsibility for the more affluent countries that are in a position to provide resources.  It is a crucial issue.  Also, indicators are being developed by the UN Statistical Commission, along with civil society, which will help countries to check on their progress.  For example, if one of the targets is that all children will have access to primary education, which may seem obvious, an indicator might be that by 2021 98% of all children will be in primary schools, with this increasing to 100% by 2030.  I am simplifying it bit but indicators will be a third element, coming after the goals and targets.  Those indicators are being developed by statisticians.  The purpose of the indicators is to help countries plot the pace at which they will implement these goals and targets.  All of this is dependent on high quality disaggregated data which allow us to capture the gender balance on particular issues and so on.  We need to have much more detailed data available to us than has been available to us up to now.  Deputy Conway is correct that the new goals and targets cannot be implemented without that.<br/><br/>I agree with Senator Daly's points in regard to COP21.  By way of clarification, although the post-2015 agenda and Addis Ababa tracks work closely together and, in fact, overlap to a degree, the climate change negotiations are happening independently.  We do not have any greater insight to those than anybody else.  At the same time, the political imperative of the three conferences being linked together and of good outcomes in each is being highlighted by everybody.  For example, Mary Robinson is taking a keen interest in our negotiations and in the Addis Ababa negotiations because she knows that in the context of the new goals and targets, there will be an impetus towards a good outcome in Paris.  She also knows that a good Addis Ababa package should include climate finance.  As the Special Envoy of the Secretary General for Climate Change she can see direct use, to put it mildly, for our two sets of negotiations in terms of her own agenda.  She wants to see the three knitted very closely together, as we all do.  We are hoping that there will be a momentum building from a good meeting in Addis Ababa, through to a good New York outcome and another in December, such that it would be very difficult for countries who have signed up to the earlier commitments to then dodge them somehow or not follow through on them by agreeing a universal climate change agreement.  That is the theory of it.  It is what we are all hoping for. <br/><br/>I thank Deputy Durkan for his comments on equality, with which I agree.  The Deputy spoke about the problems faced, in particular, by immigrant populations here.  There is no doubt that equality is at the heart of the entire agenda.  It is also emphasised in this declaration that we are combatting poverty and inequality of all kinds.  It is almost the same concept.  Another phrase we use a lot is, &quot;Nobody is to be left behind&quot;.  While that is a nice, sentimental slogan what it really means is that we do not want any marginalised people, people the system has somehow forgotten about.  In every country, there are communities of indigenous peoples, for example, who for one reason or another have not been protected by the system.  The motto of the new goals and targets is that nobody is to be left behind.  This will have to be worked out in practice.</p></speech>

We hope that conference is successful and that the countries attending it will achieve the development goals.  What is important is the people in the countries concerned.  As stated by the ambassador, the first of the three very high level conferences is the one on financing, which is important and which will be followed by the New York and Paris conferences.  We wish all involved in the conferences well.  I again thank the ambassador for attending today's meeting and hope to see him again in the near future.</p></speech>

Before calling Senator Daly to move the motion, I remind members that this matter was dealt with last week by the committee, at which it was noted by the clerk that in the opinion of the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, this matter came within its remit and that it has agreed to hold meetings on it in the autumn with a cross section of interested groups.  As Chairman, it is my view, and that of members who attended last week's meeting, that there is no point in this committee holding similar meetings to those proposed by the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  In fact, it would be a duplication of the work being done by both committees.  Also, legacy and reconciliation issues form part of the 2015 work programme of the Joint committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement.  Does Senator Daly wish to comment?</p></speech>

I was not, unfortunately, in attendance at the committee when it dealt with correspondence matters.

It has subsequently transpired that there is to be no joint meeting with this committee, which is news to me and other members who attended the Joint Committee on the Implementation of the Good Friday Agreement, where it had been agreed.</p></speech>

We will move on to the next motion in the name of Senator Daly, which relates to the proposed demolition and transfer of Susiya in the Israeli settlement of the West Bank.  I invite the Senator to speak in support of this motion.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.3327" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1159" speakername="Mark Daly" time="14:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FOJ2015070900002#M02300"><p>I move:</p> <blockquote> 	That the Foreign Affairs Committee condemns the proposed demolition and transfer of the inhabitants of the Bedouin village of Susiya in the Israeli settlement of the West Bank. Forcible transfer of the protected population is prohibited according to Article 49 of the Fourth Geneva Convention and is considered to be a grave breach of international humanitarian law according to Article 147 of the Convention.  We instruct the Minister to contact the Government of Israel&rsquo;s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Minister of Defense Moshe Ya&rsquo;alon, Military Advocate General Danny Efroni, Israeli Military Judge Advocate General Avichai Mandelblit, and Israeli Military Chief of Staff Gadi Eizenkot to express Ireland&rsquo;s condemnation of the proposal to demolish the village of Susiya and expel its residents. </blockquote>  <p>Many of us have received correspondence on this issue, which epitomises the situation in the West Bank and the occupied territories, especially in relation to a community like the Bedouin community.  Permits are impossible to come by.  We all know the situation with regard to the settlements we have opposed.  I know the Minister of State, Deputy Dara Murphy, has taken a question on this matter in the Seanad and the Minister spoke about it yesterday.  Ireland as a country has raised its objections to settlements and the activities of the Israeli Government in the West Bank.  The future of this village is a particular case that we have been asked to highlight.  I do not think it is much to ask of the Minister.  We have done so in other cases.  If the Israeli Government has its way, the village in question will not exist this time next year.  I can only imagine the reply we are going to get.  I have read a reply that refers to not intervening in specific cases.  This affects future actions.  If Ireland says it is going to raise the matter in a general sense, I do not think that is strong enough.  This is continuing to happen to a particular community.  We have received replies from the Israeli Embassy on this matter.  We have also received counter-replies.  It is very simple - we have been asked to highlight this issue, which affects a particular village.  I think we should support that cause because this is a manifestation of national policy on Israel and Palestine.</p></speech>

It appears from the note that the Minister has already made known his view and that of Ireland on this matter, which is that this is a breach of international law.  The Minister has acknowledged that view, which has been brought to the attention of the Israeli ambassador, the European Union and the United Nations.  The Minister also brought it to the attention of the Israeli Minister for Foreign Affairs during his visit to Israel earlier this year.  Members will recall that the Minister restated this view at yesterday's meeting of the joint committee.  Does anybody else want to speak on this motion?</p></speech>

The original motion, parts of which have been disallowed, referred to issues that are not pertinent to the function of any committee.  Some of the things that were being suggested are not possible.  We do not direct Ministers in this committee because we do not have the power to do so.  I suggest that we reiterate what we can do.  For that reason, I am proposing an amendment to delete all the words in Senator Daly's motion after "Article 147 of the Convention" and include in their place "and the Joint Committee calls on the Minister to convey Ireland&rsquo;s concerns to the Israeli authorities".  That is the normal procedure to be followed in a situation like this.  If we do otherwise at this stage, we will reduce the level of debate.  In that context, I would like to make a point about something I have noticed in the House in general.  The level of debate and the manner in which we make our case can have a huge bearing on the manner in which what we say is greeted by the intended recipients.  If we decide to lower the tone of debate in the Houses or the committees, the subject matter is diminished considerably by virtue of that.  I strongly urge us all to recognise that in future when we are making our case to a Minister, an ambassador or whoever it may well be.  I accept that there was no intention to offend anybody, but the original motion I saw was certainly offensive and argumentative and was ruled out of order for those reasons.</p></speech>

I believe we have to follow certain procedures, decorum and protocols.  If we depart from that, we diminish the strength of our case and our cause.  When we are working within the committee, within the Houses of the Oireachtas or in our discussions with other entities such as embassies or ambassadors, we should make our submissions in line with the normal procedures that apply in such cases.  To do otherwise is to reduce the debate to a level that I will not offend anybody by describing.</p></speech>

My colleague, Deputy David Stanton, chairs the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality.  I welcome the members of both committees.  During our first session we will discuss the case for banning so-called legal high drug stimulants.  I welcome Mr. Packie Kelly, project co-ordinator for Teach na Daoine, family resource centre, in Monaghan town and Mr. Tim Murphy from the Cavan-Monaghan drug awareness project.  I have known Mr. Kelly for a number of years and worked with him on a couple of projects.</p>  <p>  I thank the clerks to the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for their role in arranging this very important public meeting.  My colleague, Deputy David Stanton wishes to make some opening remarks.</p></speech>

This is our third joint meeting during this D&aacute;il.</p>  <p>  We are looking at the drugs issue from the point of view of the criminal justice system.  Recently a committee delegation travelled to Portugal to examine the Portuguese model.  Portugal has adopted a very interesting approach in that it has moved from looking at the issue from a criminal justice system to a health viewpoint.  It treats addiction and the use of small amounts of drugs as a health and education issue.  We are exploring this idea to see whether we should adopt a similar approach in Ireland.  It would have the advantage of diverting Garda resources and time away from the courts.  It would also mean that young people would not have a criminal record.  They might be dissuaded - the word used in Portugal - from going down the path towards further use of illegal drugs.  </p>  <p>  We are inviting public submissions.  The relevant information is on our website and the closing date for receipt of submission is 7 August.  We hope to liaise with the Joint Committee on Health and Children and engage in further joint consultation and discussion when submissions have been received.  We look forward to our engagement this morning and further engagement with the Minister of State, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; Riord&aacute;in, on the policy in this area.</p></speech>

The committees are meeting jointly for the first time in accordance with D&aacute;il Standing Order 84 and Seanad Standing Order 72.  I again thank the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality for facilitating this important and historic meeting.  </p>  <p>  Deputy Caomhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in who invited the representative of the Cavan-Monaghan drug awareness project to come is, unfortunately, tied up in the D&aacute;il asking questions of the Minister for Health.  He sends his apologies, but he will be here as soon as he can.</p>  <p>  Should those watching and listening to the proceedings at home wish to make representations to us on the issue, they can do so through our e-mail address which is available on the Oireachtas website.  </p>  <p>         I wish to advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the Chairman to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice and ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or any official by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.<br/><br/>Apologies have been received from Senator Imelda Henry and Deputies Eamonn Maloney and Ciara Conway.  The Co-Chairman, Deputy Stanton has also received an apology from a member.</p></speech>

I would also like to thank my colleague, Mr. Tim Murphy, for coming along today.  As the Chairman stated, Teach na Daoine Family Resource Centre is one the national programme of family resource centres which is currently funded by Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  We had this report in mind as during recent years we were contacted by numerous people seeking support who were facing drug addiction issues and a range of difficulties accompanying those, both psychiatric and other illnesses.  We were not sure what was happening within the community in the early days.  Unfortunately, today we are mindful that in a very small community of only 170 houses we have lost two of our young people, young P.J. McQuaid and Michael Power, in a 12-month period as a direct result of the synthetic cannabinoids.  We are very mindful of their families in Monaghan town.</p>  <p>  After those events, a number of public meetings were held at which a huge outcry and frustration was voiced in the community of Monaghan town about how we would tackle this issue and try to solve the problem.  As a result of that, the Teach na Daoine Family Resource Centre decided to embark upon a short piece of research, the outcome of which is this report, to gather evidence on the extent of the problem not only within the area of Teach na Daoine but the wider area of Monaghan.  We were getting anecdotal evidence that this was the number one drug of choice within the county of Monaghan, that it was becoming a serious problem and more people were surfacing with a range of needs.  Thankfully, we got some support from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency, and the HSE and we also got expertise from Cavan Monaghan Drug Awareness Project and we put together this report.  Unfortunately, it makes very stark reading.  This is a very difficult problem.  It is compounded by a number of issues that are affecting our community.  They range from the services that users and their families will need and difficulties around the legislation on this area.  We are facing a difficult problem.  It seems to be escalating.  Those are the difficulties we face.</p>  <p>  I am not going to read the brief that has been provided to members but the report touches on the key issues, namely, awareness of harm and consumption of these products.  They are know locally as "herbal", which is a terrible name because any herbal products carry the connotation that they must be good for us but, unfortunately, that is very much not the case with these products.  They have many negative consequences for users and also for the community because they cannot understand the uncertainty surrounding the legality or illegality of these products.</p>  <p>  We want to give the members as much information as possible.  We have brought along information cards that have been given to families and I will circulate them to members.  Probably the most important item we have is the wrappers these drugs come in and I would also like to circulate those to the members.  They will note that they way they are packaged and marketed shows that they are clearly targeted at the very young market.  Our survey has highlighted that children as young as 13 years of age are using these products and the oldest user, of whom we are aware, is in their early 40s.  Unfortunately, these products are freely available.</p>  <p>  With regard to the marketing of these products, they are called "Joker", "Juicy Fruit", "Clockwork Orange Loaded" and we found a new packet on the market only yesterday that is called "Volume 2".  From a chemical composition, we suggest they contain all the same things, namely, synthetic cannabinoids.  The newest version we found on the street yesterday has the exact same kind of compound.  It is causing a wide range of difficulties for children and their families.  The scale of the problem is escalating as we find that a range of people are accessing our family resource centre every day seeking support.</p>  <p>  From the service point of view, the growth of this problem has compounded matters as it is impacting on a number of areas.  People are behaving in an extremely psychotic way and they may not have a mental health diagnosis.  It is quite difficult from a service point of view to work out the treatment to provide.  One of the recommendations in our report is to create a separate path where a detoxification unit could be accessed by high-end users of these products.  Unfortunately, in Monaghan town and county, these products are the number one drug of choice.  Their availability is quite unbelievable.  The report refers to the issue of drug tourism.  One can go across the Border to the North and buy these products in a joke shop.  They are sold as incense products.  If one has an address in the North, one can order these products in large quantities, 100 bags at a time, on the Internet and bring them across the Border where their legal status is somewhat grey.  The issue is further compounded with Monaghan's proximity to the Border and these products being openly available in the North.</p>  <p>  Our community has faced a number of difficulties.  They are outlined in the report, which is an attempt to seek the support that is required.  There are key recommendations in the report.  It is a short piece of evidence.  We are very thankful that nine users were very honest and truthful in telling their particular stories.  It seems clear that high-end users are afraid of coming off these products because one of the deaths was related to a young person struggling to come off them.  One seems to go to a very dark place in trying to do that and, unfortunately for that young fellow, it ended in suicide.  Many people who are on these products and wish to come off them are terrified about trying to do that on their own.  The expert advice suggests that one should not do this on one's own as it is very dangerous to do so.  That is a very small snapshot of where our community is at in dealing with this issue.  We will field any questions members may have.</p></speech>

As was pointed out, investment in treatment services is what will produce change.</p> <p> As far as I understand, the difficulty with the legislation and the reason it does not appear to be working is because the laboratories are having difficulty demonstrating that these substances are psychoactive.  My perception is that they are only able to compare new psychoactive substances against lists of controlled drugs.  It is difficult for a laboratory to say with any degree of confidence whether a new substance is psychoactive in effect.  The only way we can determine if something is psychoactive is through observable effects.  A key recommendation I would make today would be for other evidence to be taken into account when classifying and cataloguing new psychoactive substances, for example, evidence from accident and emergency admissions, psychiatrist and pharmacologists.</p></speech>

I welcome Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in to the meeting.  I mentioned earlier that he was in the Chamber but that he had made a request for the committee to discuss the Cavan-Monaghan project.  Perhaps, in the absence of the Fianna F&aacute;il spokesperson, Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in would like to contribute now.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.3404" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/969" speakername="Caoimhgh&iacute;n &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015070900002#D00300"><p>I apologise to both our guests here this morning for not being here to hear their full contribution.  However, I read my copy of it in advance of this meeting.  The clash between the timing of this committee's sessions and parliamentary questions to Ministers has irked us for a long time.</p>  <p>  This is not an abstract issue, but is about people.  Once again, speaking on behalf of my entire home community, I extend sympathy to Sharon McQuaid and her family on the tragic death of her son, P.J., and to Michael Power and the Power family on the sad passing of his son, Michael junior.  This is the reality of the presence and ever-growing threat represented by so-called legal highs.  Our community has been severely hit, not only with the tragic loss of two young lives but by the fact that many other lives have been significantly impaired and seriously affected.  This was demonstrated in a recent television interview and has been graphically outlined in the report commissioned by Teach na Daoine.  I understand copies of that report will be circulated to members before the conclusion of today's session.  I commend Teach na Daoine on its initiative and its support for not only the immediate community it serves but the wider community in Monaghan whose interests it has always sought to represent.</p>  <p>  It is vital that members not just of the Joint Committee on Health and Children but also of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality inform themselves on this issue and collectively impact on Government consciousness in regard to the threat presented by legal highs.  We will have an opportunity to hear and question the newly appointed Minister of State with responsibility in this area, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, shortly.  I wish him every success in his new role and responsibilities.  We would urge that one of the first things he should do is inform himself in regard to any deficiency in the legislation to ensure there can be no question or doubt on the part of the Garda or the wider community as to the effectiveness and efficiency of existing legislation.  We also urge that he takes the required steps to amend legislation as required to properly combat this substance threat.</p>  <p>  The Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010, which saw the demise of the head shops, clearly has loopholes that allow for modified and re-modified substance manufacture and marketing.  The efforts in evidence in my community are geared towards a particular profile of young people and the opening statement from Packie Kelly indicates the profile of the users.  That profile is a particular cohort of people in every one of our communities who are clearly at risk.  This is not only a County Monaghan or a Cavan-Monaghan issue.  It is an issue of concern throughout this State and island.</p>  <p>  I have a few questions in regard to mental health services, for young people in particular.  I understand there is some difficulty in this regard and that the mental health services will not deal directly with a young person presenting with substance abuse, either its side effects or active use of legal highs.  Their position is that this abuse in some way disguises what might be underlying mental health issues.  It is important we give some attention to the point made in the presentation about compounding difficulties in securing treatment for young people.  This issue must be examined in tandem with an evaluation of the legislation's fitness for purpose.  Will Mr. Kelly and Mr. Murphy explain the situation in regard to the relationship with local garda&iacute;?  What do they feel are the difficulties in regard to the Garda facing up to and presenting a serious challenge to the proliferation of these products?  Will they expand on the difficulties there are in securing access to and support from local mental health services?</p></speech>

I find this extremely interesting, because I was unaware of this development.  When the witnesses say this drug is freely available, what do they mean.  Is it is in shops or where do people get it?</p></speech>

We know the sale of illegal drugs is underground, yet they are freely available.  However, the impression given in regard to these drugs is that they are perfectly normal and without side effects.  This is obviously not the case.  Has research been done in other countries into these products?  Our witnesses are based near the Border, but what are the implications in regard to controlling the sale of these drugs in this regard, particularly if the Minister responsible needs to make an urgent response in this area?</p>  <p>  I believe Cavan-Monaghan has one of the best mental health services in the country, especially in community mental health services, and it is often held up to other parts of the country as an example of how to improve.  I recognise that no system is perfect, but I acknowledge the excellent community health service in Cavan-Monaghan.  </p>  <p>               This is one of the products.  How many products are there?  I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

On reading this report, this is a new area for all members but as members of the Joint Committees on Health and Children and Justice, Defence and Equality, it is important that this issue be examined and grasped and that members give consideration to what they can do.  On listening to the presentation, I have a specific question.  Mr. Kelly mentioned the term &quot;young people&quot;, which can have a wide meaning in certain ways.  I seek greater understanding of the profile of the type of young people concerned.  Is it socio-economic or what is the age profile?  I ask to enable me to understand, because it is a new area.  On examining the materials and packaging the witnesses circulated to members, some of it certainly is aimed not even at teenagers, but at very young people.  As for the report produced for Teach na Daoine by Dr. Marie Claire Van Hout and Evelyn Hearne, I opened one page on which there was a quote from a participant in one of the case studies stating:</p> <blockquote> 	There&rsquo;s also child protection issues, very young children and their parents are taking this stuff, they&rsquo;re exposed to this stuff, and they&rsquo;re walking around picking it up off the street.  Sometimes parents and children are fighting over it.  Fighting over who needs it the most. </blockquote>  <p>As one of the children then even went on to ask, &quot;How do you expect me to report my mommy and daddy?&quot;, there also is an intergenerational aspect.  I wish to try to understand better, in order that I do not leave the meeting misinformed.  In the specific recommendations made, I note Mr. Kelly called for increasing local sports partnership activities.  What of the youth work organisations' activities in the area and the funding thereof because drastic cuts have been made to those areas and perhaps this is an area that should be examined?  Mr. Kelly mentioned clinical awareness.  What engagement does Teach na Daoine have with the formal health services?  Obviously, it is positive that it is getting funding from Tusla, the Child and Family Agency.  What engagement does Teach na Daoine have on a clinical level?  On the interagency side, is there an issue with regard to dual diagnosis, that is, looking at the mental health issues?  While I have not seen it yet, I am merely trying to wade through this report, which was handed to members as the meeting began.  Consequently, I would be interested in being apprised regarding the mental health issues and the correlations.</p></speech>

Certainly, in talking to local members of the Garda, they are as frustrated by this issue as is the community.  As there appears to be a degree of greyness around the current legislation as to whether they are able to charge people, I believe they are quite frustrated with it.  As for the Garda's level of knowledge with regard to availability, this also is within our report, the availability of this substance is that it is easily purchased in the North, where it currently is legal.  The BBC programme in which we participated recently highlighted issues whereby the United Kingdom is trying to bring forward legislation that would effect a total ban on this and they were examining existing Irish legislation to ascertain whether that current ban is effective.  It certainly showed up anomalies within the current Irish legislative system that allows stuff like this to be legal as such.</p>  <p>  In respect of the mental health issue, we certainly have had experiences of young people presenting themselves, either to accident and emergency units or to the mental health service, in a highly psychotic state.  The difficulty is that it is not until those young people come off the drugs and are clean, for want of a better word, that the mental health services then can diagnose and confirm the person in question has a mental health difficulty which the service can treat.  Consequently, it really is a chicken-and-egg position as such for the mental health services.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's question with regards to availability.  What one can do is to purchase this substance on the Internet if one has an address in the North and, as stated earlier, one can purchase 100 or 200 bags.  Then, if one is a dealer, one gets one's runners or one transports it oneself across the Border-----</p></speech>

That is the purchase price, while the street price ranges anywhere from &euro;15 to &euro;20.  I think I have touched on the point regarding the legal stuff.</p>  <p>  To respond to the Senator's point, our age profile is in the range between 14 and 43 or 44 year olds.  The socio-economic profile is such that most of the users have a range of socio-economic difficulties such as no formal qualifications, an unemployment history and addictions to other issues.  In respect of the youth work, which is an important point the Senator also raised, the only people within the area who are carrying out any youth work are attached to the family resource centre because of the cutbacks to other youth organisations.  Within Teach na Daoine's area, it is the only organisation which is doing this.  There is the Garda youth diversion project but again, as members will be aware, one may already have committed an offence or have been on the verge of committing an offence before one gets access to that.  Perhaps, if it is all right with the Co-Chairmen, to fill up some of the gaps, I will ask Mr. Tim Murphy to respond to some of the questions asked.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.3418" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015070900002#E01100"><p>As far as the Garda is concerned, I believe that samples have been seized and sent away in earnest.  My information, after a couple of queries, going back to November 2014 is that the results coming back from the laboratories stated it was not a controlled drug, which I believe may be answering a different question from the one being asked.  Again, one can see how, despite the Garda taking a problem seriously, it is unable to bring a successful prosecution.  I think Mr. Kelly outlines the age profile well.  Predominantly, we are seeing young males between the ages of 18 to 25, all presenting with serious mental health-type symptoms such as paranoia, suicidal ideation or depression.  The difficulty for us as a support service is they often are so affected that they are unable to engage with counselling in any meaningful way and what they probably actually require in many cases is inpatient treatment and for the symptoms to be managed symptomatically by mental health services in an acute setting before they would be able to engage with addiction support services in a structured way.</p>  <p>  As for the range of substances extant, I believe a Home Office report was issued in 2013, which I think has been well summarised by an organisation called Drugwatch, which published an article in 2014.  Its findings were that there were more than 80 different synthetic cannabinoids available on the European market at that time and that there was potential to make hundreds more by relatively easy manipulation of the production process.</p>  <p>  In respect of the mental health services response, the difficulties go back to the A Vision for Change document, which clearly stated that stand-alone addiction problems should be outside the mental health services.  In my opinion, the presenting symptoms are so serious - as Mr. Kelly noted, in many cases we are dealing with psychosis and serious suicidal ideation - that there must be at least a short-term response, probably in an inpatient setting.  Without going into detail, in one case with which we are dealing, we have someone who has been referred to our service.  The person ended up being admitted to acute psychiatric services on an inpatient basis, only to be released within a few days when the symptoms had abated somewhat.  However, because the person does not appear to be past that critical withdrawal period, and these substances are highly unusual in that there appears to be a withdrawal syndrome, the person turns to alternatives very quickly and is constantly bouncing back into the accident and emergency units, the general practitioner and those kinds of services.  We have also had recent uncorroborated reports, although I have seen availability of the Internet, that the products may be becoming available in vaporiser form for e-cigarettes.  </p>  <p>         That would be another particularly worrying development if it becomes widespread.</p></speech>

Their work is of help to a lot of people.</p>  <p>  Have we any idea of the percentage of young people availing of this drug, although I presume we are talking about any age from 14 or 15 up?  I presume it is an illegal high.  Is it spreading by word of mouth within communities or are people actively promoting it and making money out of it?</p>  <p>  On education, I note Mr. Kelly's presentation stated that three of the user participants were educated to junior certificate level, two only to primary school level, and one to leaving certificate level.  In view of the fact that some people did not go beyond primary school, how can a message be gotten across to that group?  I have worked in projects in Cork and have found that many people drop out of school because there is no parental support.  What is the best way of trying to get the message across of the dangers of using these substances?  Is there anything new that can be done to move people away from using these drugs?  I know it requires a collective approach.</p></speech>

This is one of the best ideas I have seen in a long time.  The whole issue of herbal drugs is something I would be familiar with in my own constituency.  I am glad to hear that the HSE and Tusla have helped to produce a document.  I have not had a chance to read much of it at this stage, but the information card is very important.</p>  <p>  I remember that when the drugs problem was at its height in the inner city, a small group of parents came together to organise groups and information sessions highlighting the drugs issue to young people.  The problem is right across the country, in every corner of every town and outside the towns.  Herbal highs are very attractive to young people, in particular, and they are marketed very well.</p>  <p>  We have just gone through a whole rigmarole with cigarette packaging and we are going through the process of introducing minimum pricing of alcohol.  Looking at the price of this drug on the street, &euro;20 would buy 20 bottles of beer rather than one package of the drug.  Where are young people getting the money?  Has crime increased in the area?  Have there been more break-ins and burglaries?  Anywhere we see people hitting hard on drug, we will get the bounce-back in criminal activity.  Unfortunately the users themselves often turn to criminal activity to fund their own personal use, which is very sad.</p>  <p>  I did not read the community-based study because I did not have time.  The one thing that struck me from what I read was the line from one of the participants that  "[t]here's only one way of getting off herbal and that's taking yourself out of this life."  For me that is very stark.</p>  <p>  What has been done to educate parents on this?  As parents, we live in a bubble and think our children are far beyond doing anything wrong.  On the ground in communities, there are opportunities to bring parents in through schools, local groups or the family resource centres.</p>  <p>  What happens to the people the witnesses have met on the street and in the resource centre, who have given their sad and poignant stories?  What do we do with people like that?  What channel can they be put into?  Is there a detox programme for them and, if not, why not?  Our job here is to listen to the witnesses and to try to find some solutions to help their work.</p></speech>

Is that right?  The report said there is a lack of clarity regarding the substances' legal status.  I wanted to clarify that.  Did the witnesses mean that people who are taking them are not necessarily clear as to whether or not they are legal in the Republic?  Different laws apply in the North, where the substances are obtained.  To describe them as legal highs here is, I think, incorrect in legal terms, is it not?  The legislation banning psychoactive substances would presumably apply to at least some of these products but there is a question mark over others.  Are the witnesses advocating any particular change to criminal justice law in this jurisdiction?</p></speech>

I thank the members for their questions.</p>  <p>  On the issue of availability, the substances can be purchased on the Internet and there are numerous dealers.  We have knowledge of about eight dealers within Monaghan town from whom people can freely buy the drugs.  When members get time to peruse the report, they will read about the way herbal is advertised.  People come into the area in their cars playing very loud music.  One participant said it is like the ice cream van.  Everyone knows the dealer has arrived.</p>  <p>  The age profile of users is 50:50.  There are children as young as 14 and some people in their early 40s.  While our small study covers Monaghan town, I was glad to hear Deputy Byrne saying the problem is everywhere.  It certainly touches every aspect of life in County Monaghan.  This is not just a Teach na Daoine or Mullaghmatt Cortolvin issue.  Herbal highs are widely available in Monaghan town and in the small villages throughout the county.  </p>  <p>  The issue of accident and emergency services and what happens to young people was raised.  To be fair to everyone, no one knows how to deal with the symptoms of this issue.  </p>  <p>         What the experts would say is: "We do not know what is in this stuff, so we do not know how to treat someone."  The real difficulty for us in the family resource centre with limited resources - although by no stretch of the imagination would I wish to dramatise this - is that on a daily basis we are afraid that once the person who has come in and sought some resource from us, or just some chill-out time, leaves the centre, they may not be back.  There is certainly talk within the community of who is going to die next.  That is the level of substance use that exists.  People are afraid that another person within the community may die as a result.  It is a very difficult issue for a family resource centre or even for an addiction service such as that in Cavan-Monaghan to deal with this issue, as there are many layers to it and it is compounded with many difficult problems, not to mind access to the services or the legality of the issue.  We have asked the experts about this because, like the committee today, we are learning in regard to this issue.  We asked them what is the equivalent of this problem, and they said it was the equivalent of crystal meth.  Given the international experience in this regard, that really hits hard.  They say that users who use crystal meth only use crystal meth.  In Monaghan, users who use this do not use any other substance.  Current users of this would previously have been abusers of alcohol, but they have stopped.  I said that in the report.  They say, "Forget about alcohol; alcohol does not count any more.  This is the stuff."  This is the stuff that puts them in a place where they unfortunately want to go.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.3427" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Tim Murphy" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015070900002#G00200"><p>One of the questions was about where the service users go after they present to mental health services.  The answer is to the other community services, such as ourselves, the Cavan-Monaghan drug awareness project, and Teach na Daoine.  The issue is that they are not properly equipped to deal with the problem.  They present with symptoms so serious that often they require inpatient treatment.  Because we cannot get them past that critical withdrawal period that I described earlier, they are discharged quite quickly after being admitted to acute services, and they return to using the drug just as quickly.  Clearly, trying to provide a counselling and support service to a person who is in an awful mental state is not the correct approach.  In terms of prevention and education initiatives, the leaflet we produced was made because that is what we are currently resourced to produce.  As to what education needs to be provided, it needs to be a solid evidence-based approach, possibly delivered through social, personal and health education in schools.  I think that is the only way it can be done in a structured and widespread manner.</p>  <p>  We have certainly conducted educational initiatives through talking to parents and young people whom we know to be at risk, and certain groups within Youthreach organisations and such places.  Again, there are not sufficient resources to cover all the schools and all the areas where there are identified problems.  </p>  <p>  As a follow-on to a point made by Mr. Packie Kelly about the seriousness of the presenting symptoms, I do not want to be alarmist, but, as the committee has probably deduced, I am originally from just outside Liverpool, where I worked in addiction services, where we had a significant crack problem, and the comparisons in terms of the way people are presenting are quite stark.  We run a methadone clinic - opiate substitution - in Cavan.  We have a small number of habitual heroin users who have presented to our service, saying they are in a mess.  That really focuses the attention.  Without doubt, synthetic cannabinoids are a very serious substance.  In terms of legality, this is probably a question for legal experts and the Garda rather than me, but there appears to be a general lack of understanding about its legal status.  I think users are under the impression that it is perfectly legal because they have told so by the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na or they have been told there is no way the Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na can pursue a successful prosecution.  The people who use these substances know that, and that is why it is an even more attractive alternative to, say, cannabis - because they know it does not carry any penalties under law.  </p>  <p>  As well as investing in treatments and support services, I believe we need to review the policy document A Vision for Change with a view to establishing dual diagnosis, because there appears to be great emphasis on primary and secondary diagnosis - that is, there is a primary addiction issue which is causing one's secondary mental health symptoms, which are therefore not within the remit of addiction services.  However, the whole principle behind dual diagnosis, and what the research would support, is that the two issues are so inextricably linked that one cannot tell which issue came first, and both needed to be treated in tandem by multidisciplinary organisations or support teams.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.3428" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Co-Chairman (Deputy David Stanton)" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015070900002#G00300"><p>I thank the representatives for the presentation.  It is very timely, and the work they are doing is very important given that we are dealing with life-and-death issues.  Along with Deputy McGrath and two other colleagues, I recently visited Portugal, which is on the real front line.  While we were there we engaged with the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction.  I will read into record what one of them said to us:</p> <blockquote> 	New psychoactive substance (NPS or 'new drugs', often sold as 'legal highs') were detected in the EU last year at the rate of around two per week.  A total of 101 new substances were reported ... in 2014 (up from 81 substances in 2013), continuing an upward trend in substances notified in a single year.  This brings the total number of substances being monitored by the agency to over 450, with more than half of that figure being identified in the last three years alone. </blockquote>  <p>What they told us is that there are labs in third countries where highly qualified people - people with PhDs - are manufacturing these substances and churning them out.  The issue we have here, from a justice point of view, is the arrival on the market in Europe, Ireland or wherever of something that is not on our list.  They have changed some chemical in it and it is a different substance.  It is so difficult, as Deputy Finian McGrath would agree, to keep track of that.  The other thing that is playing an increasing role is the Internet.  The idea of somebody dealing in the back corner is old hat.  There is the deep web, the dark web, and hidden transactions using Bitcoin.  It is hugely complicated and a major challenge for policing across Europe and in Ireland, as well as for our health services.  It is not simple.  It is a multi-million-euro business, billions in fact.  These are powerful and wealthy organisations - multinational drug cartels - dealing with this stuff.  The growth of online virtual drug markets poses a major challenge to law enforcement and drug control policies, as stated in the report.  <br/><br/>Existing regulatory bodies need to be adapted to perform in a global and virtual context.  What the representatives are presenting to us today is a microcosm of a larger national and European issue that is growing.  I do not think we are equipped to deal with it.  Our thinking is back in the 20th century, whereas these guys have moved on to the 21st century.  We have got to get away from the idea of somebody dealing and handling stuff.  It has gone beyond that at this stage.  We were told in Portugal that they are putting this substance in the post.  It is so small that it is easily hidden, and it is impossible to detect because the volume of post is so huge.<br/><br/>One suggestion I would like to make - Deputy Finian McGrath and others discussed it earlier - is the idea of a standing parliamentary committee to deal with this issue alone.  That is something I will be calling for.  </p>  <p>         Deputies Finian McGrath, Catherine Byrne and others have brought to our attention the major gangland crime issues that feed on this also.  It is a major issue for us from a criminal justice point of view.  The presentation referred, as have Deputies &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in, McLellan and others, to health, education, youth leisure, boredom and increased sports partnership, which is another issue.  Justice is in there, and one can go across the whole range of Government Departments.  All committees here are extraordinarily busy, but I suggest that there should be a standing parliamentary committee focusing on this alone.  I would be interested in the reactions of colleagues and the witnesses to the suggestion.  The standing committee would work with the Minister of State with responsibility for drugs, who, thankfully, is now in position and is very active.  This is extraordinarily serious stuff.  The witnesses are right that this new substance is highly addictive and very dangerous, and we do not know what chemicals are in there.  Those chemicals are changing constantly.  The issue has to be dealt with on a multi-agency level.  There is no simple answer and it is not just a matter of putting more garda&iacute; out there.  Those involved are bypassing that.  Borders do not matter here.  In many instances, they are just posting the stuff through.  It is changing so quickly.  We must change our thinking as well to bring it into the 21st century.  We have the resources in mental health prevention, etc., but we must focus on this on a constant basis and work with our European partners, as they are also facing the same issue.</p></speech>

It is certain that they should not be.  As I said in my opening remarks, I have met with garda&iacute; in my local community to discuss the tragedies that have occurred, the community response and the need to have effective redress.  I can report to the joint committees in session here today that one of the most senior garda&iacute;, whom I respect personally, has told me the Garda does not have the legal resourcing to deal with this.  It is not only about manpower; the legislation does not do the business.  It links a little bit with what Mr. Tim Murphy was saying.  These are synthetic cannabinoids.  Mr. Murphy made the point that tests came back and the substance did not fit with any of those listed in the legislation.  The Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 listed more than 200 so-called legal highs and we have been adding to that year-on-year in the period since.  The trick these people use is not to reuse or rehash; it is to mimic.  It is a mimicking process, as the Co-Chairman, Deputy David Stanton, has said.  They are finding a way to replicate and reproduce the psychoactive experience of the known drug - cannabis or another illegal drug.  There are chemists who are investing all of their knowledge and time in this mimicking process.</p>  <p>  We must get away from the notion that once we identify something, we can add it to the list.  One is always playing catch-up.  We have to leapfrog to be ahead of them.  We must put the hand up and stop them in their tracks, which requires strong and tough legislation in the first instance and all of the other resourcing that must come also.  We need to have the strongest possible legislation and there must be some way to say that any and all of these, no matter what the substance, are illegal unless they are actually provided for and listed as legal.  We should work on the basis that they are illegal until they are, for whatever qualifying and acceptable purpose, brought on to a legal list of substances for human use as drugs, medications etc.  I am in favour of simply going ahead of them and doing it most effectively.  There is no other answer.</p>  <p>  When Mr. Packie Kelly and Mr. Tim Murphy respond to Senator van Turnhout and talk about supports, alternative opportunities and different activities within relatively deprived or unprovided-for communities, this is where the risk presents.  We must look at that and provide for and reintroduce the necessary supports in order to provide for that community response.  That is also imperative.</p></speech>

The more one listens, the more one learns, they say.  I was very interested in what Mr. Tim Murphy said about education, particularly through schools and SPHE.  I am a firm believer that if you get people at a very young age, instil in them some sense of who they are, where they have come from and a sense of worth and build their confidence, one can prevent many of them from doing things they know very well to be harmful to them and their families.  When my children were in school, I was very aware of local people and community garda&iacute; being able to respond and come in to talk to children about drugs.  Sometimes, however, I thought it was not graphic enough.  I think back to the television advertisement about a young girl losing her ability to walk because a guy in a car veered off the road and jammed her up against a wall.  Those are very poignant images for young people.  My own children hated that ad.  They saw the reality of what could happen with this guy completely out of control and bouncing into a wall.  I wonder if the issue is whether we can instil in young people through education in school the image of what can happen to them, how this could affect their lives.  It is the fact that we do not even know what is in some of these things and how it could affect them, not only now but into the future as regards their bodies and everything else.</p>  <p>  Alcohol is the stepping stone into any kind of addiction.  It starts off with young people having a few cans and then getting into something else.  For some people, unfortunately, the train left the station on this a long time ago.  It is very difficult for those people, but we should focus now on those people who are still in school, whether through youth work, music or sports.  We should focus on improving their self-image and allow them opportunities.  Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in talked about community provision, but I am not talking only about the provision of services; I am talking about the provision of education in school around sport, music, theatre and all of those things that give children a different image of what they want to do with themselves.</p></speech>

I am someone who protested outside a head shop in Dun Laoghaire until it had to close down due to the level of bad publicity we brought to it.  I am also very aware that a beautiful young girl died recently in my constituency, while a number of others were rushed to hospital, after taking something like this outside a nightclub in Dublin city centre.</p>  <p>  I hear about education and I am a former school principal, but I believe the parents need to be educated.  Everyone talks about the children.  There is overload in school and we are telling them what not to do.  Often, we are bringing in strangers to tell them about things and provide programmes.  </p>  <p>               When I was raising my own boys I felt it was my responsibility to warn them against taking drugs.  In my view, when it is done in school and when a parent hands over that responsibility to a school, sometimes parents sit back and think the kids will have the information.  However, I think that parents need to be targeted.  I am sure they are not aware that these drugs are available which look like chewing gum.  It is necessary to empower parents, to give them the power to parent their children properly and to know who they are with and what they are doing.</p></speech>

Parliamentary democracy insists on votes being held.  I welcome the Minister of State at the Department of Justice and Equality, Deputy Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in, to our meeting.  This is his first visit to a committee meeting involving the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality and the Joint Committee on Health and Children.  I thank him for his presence and for agreeing to hold a joint meeting of these committees with regard to his new brief and the national drugs strategy.</p>  <p>  The committees had an interesting first session this morning and I thank Mr. Packie Kelly and Mr. Tim Murphy from Teach na Daoine and the Cavan-Monaghan drugs awareness project for their presentation.  We are keen to consider several proposals with regard to the issues raised this morning.  </p>  <p>               My Co-Chairman, Deputy Stanton, has made a proposal which we will discuss at the end of our meeting.  I call on my Co-Chairman to make a few remarks.</p></speech>

Like my Co-Chairman, I apologise to everybody for the long delay in reconvening the meeting.  My committee has done a lot of work on this area.  Recently, a number of us visited Portugal to look at the Portuguese approach to the drugs issue.  It has dissuasion committees where people are not actually put into the criminal justice system.  For small amounts of drugs for personal use, people are sent for education and rehabilitation, treatment and so on and that seems to work pretty well.  It ensures the Portuguese police can put more of its resources into tracking down dealers and sellers of drugs.</p>  <p>  Today's meeting of the two committees is historic and it is one of the first times this has happened.  It shows how seriously we take the issue of drugs.  This morning we heard an interesting presentation by people from Monaghan on so-called legal highs.  At the time, I pointed out that the monitoring committee of the European Union had told us that two or three legal highs are being detected each week, that there are 450 of these, which are monitored by the agency, and that the number is growing exponentially.  We are in a new drugs era.  The idea of somebody selling drugs on a back street is gone and people now use the Internet, the dark web, and social media.  A while ago, someone told me that people use drones and all kinds of technologies to sell this stuff.  There are labs across the world churning out different types of very dangerous chemicals which we are now, unfortunately, beginning to experience here.  Therefore, we must treat this matter extremely seriously.  We welcome the fact that we now have a dedicated Minister of State.  There is no better person than the Minister of State present to lead this initiative.  A number of months ago, my committee recommended a dedicated Minister of State when we examined the issue first.  I look forward to the engagement and to what the Minister of State has to say to us.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2015-07-09a.3445" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1018" speakername="Aodh&aacute;n &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in" time="09:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2015070900002#R00400"><p>I welcome the invitation to address members of the Joint Committee on Health and Children and the Joint Committee on Justice and Equality on the national drugs strategy.  I am delighted to have been given the opportunity to take on a ministerial role in this area.  I see it as a vital role that needs the attention of a dedicated Minister.  From my work as a teacher and principal in Dublin&rsquo;s north inner city, I am aware of the devastating consequences of drug abuse and the damage it causes in communities.  I am deeply committed to doing all I can in my role, as Minister of State, to ensure that drug users are given the support they need to overcome addiction and once again live fulfilling lives.</p><p>Since taking up my new role, I have met many people who share my concern about the extent of the drug problem in Ireland.  A lot of people have said that they would like to see a change of attitudes to addiction and a more compassionate health oriented approach to those who are dependent on drugs.  Too often those afflicted by addiction suffer from stigma and a lack of public understanding and education which can hold back their recovery.  It is against this background that I am delighted that the justice committee is inviting public submissions on its drug policy review, with particular reference to the question of whether an alternative approach to the possession of small quantities of illicit drugs for personal use should be considered.  I very much welcome a discussion on this important issue.</p><p>The national drugs strategy aims to tackle the harm caused to individuals and society by the misuse of drugs through a concerted focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research.  The strategy encourages inter-agency working in a difficult cross-cutting policy and service area. </p><p>The oversight forum on drugs, which I chair, monitors the progress in implementing the strategy.  As part of the work of developing a new strategy to cover the period from 2017 onwards, I intend to carry out a comprehensive assessment of the extent to which the current strategy has provided an effective policy response to the drugs problem. <font color="#FF0000"> </font>I will speak in more detail later about my plans in this area.</p><p>In order to have an informed evidence-based approach to drug policies, we need accurate information on the nature and extent of drug use.  The national drugs prevalence survey, which is carried out by the national advisory committee on drugs and alcohol, is a key source of such information.  Fieldwork for the fourth wave of the survey in 2014-2015 is at an advanced stage.  I look forward to the first results bulletin becoming available later this year.  This will give the key findings on drug use and will enable comparisons with the three previous surveys undertaken in 2010-2011, 2006-2007 and 2002-2003.</p><p>The nature and scale of the drugs problem is constantly changing.  While levels of illegal drug use stabilised between the 2006-2007 and 2010-2011 surveys, drug use in Ireland has increased over the past decade.  Cannabis is now the most commonly used illegal drug in Ireland with 6% of those surveyed reporting use of the drug in the year prior to the survey.  The increasing trend towards polydrug use, involving a combination of alcohol, illicit drugs and prescription medication, is a major concern for me and the Government.  Our treatment services are also seeing an increase in the use of benzodiazepine and z-drug.  The fact that this often occurs in the context of multiple substance use is a particularly worrying trend.  </p><p>Unfortunately, because of the hidden nature of heroin use, we do not have good data on its usage in Ireland.  We know that there are in the region of 9,800 people in methadone maintenance treatment, which is an indicator of the extent of the problem.  The NACDA is currently undertaking a survey, which will provide us with an up to date estimate of heroin users later this year.  Even without this data, I am satisfied that heroin represents a substantial element of our drug problem and I am determined to find the most effective way to tackle this blight on communities. </p><p>I have already highlighted the multi-sectoral nature of our response to the drug problem.  I would like to pay tribute to An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na and the customs service for their role in the significant drug seizures that we have seen in recent years.  The continued disruption of the supply of illicit drugs remains a key priority and this is also reflected in An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na's policing plan for 2015.</p><p>The emergence of new psychoactive substances, specifically designed to circumvent drug controls, has been a matter of particular concern in recent years both in Ireland and at international level.  The Misuse of Drugs Regulations and the Criminal Justice (Psychoactive Substances) Act 2010 have had a significant effect in closing head shops and reducing the supply of the substances.  Recent research conducted by Trinity College shows a significant fall in recent and problematic use of head shop drugs among young people, following the national ban that was introduced in 2010, a measure which had cross-party support. </p><p>I met the UK Minister for Policing, Crime, Criminal Justice and Victims, Mr. Mike Penning, during the British-Irish Council summit meeting in June.  He was keen to discuss with us the practical impact of banning so-called legal highs, as the UK Government has introduced a Psychoactive Substances Bill, currently going through its Parliament, which is modelled on the Irish experience. </p><p>The problem of new psychoactive substances is a constantly changing phenomenon.  New substances are emerging all the time.  We continue to monitor the problem through our national early warning system which enables authorities to identify new drugs, describe new trends in use and report the serious and unusual consequences of drug use.</p><p>I view it as vitally important to continue to highlight the potential dangers associated with taking illegal drugs.  Evidence-based awareness raising and prevention programmes also play a key role in promoting healthier lifestyles and changing attitudes.  Education programmes, such as the SPHE, facilities and services for young people in disadvantaged areas and diversionary programmes for young people at risk, all help to equip young people to make more positive lifestyle choices.  However, the drug problem is a wider societal issue and cannot just be addressed within the educational system.  As I often say, children and young people do not live in schools.  Parental involvement and community concern play a role in protecting young people against substance misuse.  Young people have been handed this problem by a previous generation and we should resist the temptation to blame such young victims who are merely continuing and mirroring what their parents and grandparents practised.  </p><p>I am delighted to confirm that funding of &euro;1 million will be allocated from the Dormant Accounts Fund later this year for substance misuse prevention.  Grants of between &euro;30,000 and &euro;50,000 will be available for proposals developed by drug and alcohol task forces to mobilise communities to tackle drug and alcohol-related issues.  </p>  <p>                 As I mentioned earlier, approximately 9,800 people are currently availing of opioid substitution treatment.  The number of new entrants to treatment whose main problem drug is heroin is in decline.  However, services are seeing an increase in the number of people whose main problem drug is cannabis, as well an increasing incidence of poly-drug use.  The HSE is committed to achieving improved health outcomes for problem drug users and has reoriented its services in recent years to cater for those with poly-drug use issues.</p> <p> Waiting times for access to services, particularly outside Dublin, have been considerably reduced.  The latest figures indicate that in the region of 95% of clients over 18 are accessing treatment within one calendar month of assessment, while almost 100% of under-18s are accessing treatment within a week.  Additional funding of &euro;2.1 million has been provided in the HSE budget for 2015 for measures targeting vulnerable drug users, bringing the total allocation for addiction services to almost &euro;109 million.  The extra funding includes support for an additional 53 beds, creating 439 new treatments.</p> <p> The Government has also stepped up the effort to reduce drug-related deaths.  In 2012, there were 633 drug-related deaths in Ireland.  While there has been a small decline in the overall number compared to 2011, drug-related deaths remain at an unacceptable level, and every death is a tragedy in its own right. </p> <p> I especially welcome the HSE-led pilot project on naloxone which has been launched recently.  Naloxone is an antidote used to reverse the effects of opioid drugs such as heroin, morphine and methadone upon overdose.  This innovative project involves training lay persons, such as the family and friends of a drug user, in administering the naloxone injection to overdose victims.  Research shows that providing increased access to naloxone for people likely to witness an overdose is an effective way of reducing overdose deaths.  I have no doubt that lives can be saved as a result of this initiative.  We have an overdose problem in Ireland.  I think we have the third worst rate of overdose in Europe.</p> <p> There is a problem with street injecting in Dublin and elsewhere, which is unhygienic and unsafe for both drug users and the general public.  Medically supervised injecting facilities exist in a number of other countries, and have been suggested as a response to the problem of street injecting in this country.  I have recently received a draft legislative proposal in relation to this matter, and I have asked my officials to examine the issues in more detail.</p> <p> Those struggling with drug problems are often the most marginalised in our society.  They may have multiple, complex, interlocking needs, such as poverty, housing, poor health and education.  This underlines the importance of services working together, through a client-centred approach, to foster client progression.  The Government is committed to the full implementation of the national drugs rehabilitation framework, which aims to ensure continuity of care for the recovering drug user through shared care planning.</p> <p> I would like to outline for committee members my priorities for the remainder of the lifetime of this Government.  The first relates to the Misuse of Drugs Acts.  In March of this year, the Minister for Health brought forward emergency legislation to deal with an adverse Court of Appeal decision regarding the Misuse of Drugs Act 1977.  The ruling had the effect of decontrolling all substances that had been controlled by Government order, including ecstasy, new psychoactive substances and benzodiazepines.  This meant that it was no longer an offence to possess these substances.  The Oireachtas passed emergency legislation on 11 March to restore the controls on such substances by placing these in the Schedule to the Act.  I intend to bring forward another Bill by the end of the year to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act so as to allow the Government to declare substances to be controlled, thereby meeting our EU and international obligations to control substances that are dangerous and have the potential for abuse.</p> <p> The Bill will clarify the provisions under which Ministerial orders and regulations are made.  This will once again allow regulations to be made and, if necessary and appropriate, allow the introduction of stricter or less strict controls on substances that are already covered under the legislation.</p> <p> Second, as Minister with responsibility for the national drugs strategy, I will be leading the development of the drugs strategy for the period after 2016.  My intention over the coming months is to lay the groundwork for a concise and focused policy, placing a clear emphasis on the practical implementation of actions.  An examination of the approach to drugs policy and practice in other jurisdictions will also help to identify any additional evidence-based approaches which might be considered in an Irish context.  The development of the new strategy gives us the opportunity to have a constructive and wide-ranging public dialogue on our current drug policies so that we are in a strong position to develop a fit-for-purpose response to the drug problem which will meet challenges into the future.</p> <p> I will endeavour to answer any questions that members of the joint committee may have.</p></speech>

I wish him success in his new role and responsibilities.  It is a welcome decision of the Government to appoint a Minister of State dedicated to the task of addressing this need.  It is only regrettable that nobody was in that position over the previous four years.</p>  <p>  In my questions to the Minister of State, I wish to concentrate on the specifics concerning the earlier presentation by voices representing my own community and their experience in dealing with this matter.  There is a big question mark over so-called legal highs.  The real question is whether they are legal.  Most certainly, they should not be legal.</p>  <p>  We are discussing this question against the backdrop of two tragic deaths.  As I said earlier, this is not an abstract issue.  It has affected people whom I know personally.  The friends who made presentations here this morning are dealing with these matters on a continuous basis.  The community has been deeply affected by the almost epidemic presence and accessibility of these substances.</p>  <p>  I note that the Minister of State met with the UK Minister with responsibility for policing, crime, criminal justice and victims, Mike Penning, during the British-Irish Council summit meeting last month.  There is concern in my community as to the effectiveness and fitness for purpose of existing legislation here.  Yet we note that the British legislation, the Psychoactive Substances Bill, which is going through Parliament but has not yet been enacted, is modelled on the Irish experience.  That is a fact; it is not just the opinion of the witnesses we heard earlier, Mr. Packie Kelly and Mr. Tim Murphy.  I can advise the Minister of State that I have personally met senior representatives of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na in the Cavan-Monaghan division who tell me that the existing legislation is inadequate to allow them to address the growing scourge of packs of dangerous substances.  That is the view of senior members of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na, which must be factored in.  I would be concerned, if any other jurisdiction were modelling legislation on what we currently have, if the reality is that our legislation is deficient and incapable of properly allowing the policing service in this State to deal with the problem.  I sincerely ask the Minister of State to ensure that a serious review of this situation is undertaken.  In his closing remarks, he spoke of bringing forward another Bill by the end of this year to amend the Misuse of Drugs Act.  The 2010 Bill effectively contributed to the closure of head shops across the country.  That legislation listed some 200 banned substances, and the methodology is to continue to proscribe and add to the list over the intervening period.  We must face the fact, however, that we simply cannot keep up.  </p>  <p>               As Deputy Stanton, the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, put on record here this morning, new substances are being created at a rate of two per week and people who have the chemistry know-how are working continuously to create these substances.  We simply will not be able to deal effectively with this situation if we are always trying to catch up.  We will never catch up.  We need to find a way of getting in front of all of this with some form of blanket legislation that provides that substances are illegal until they are determined to be legal, acceptable and having a valid purpose.  That would allow the Garda - and any other police service, where comparable legislation came into effect - to deal with the issue as it must.  I ask the witnesses to expand on what they hope the amended legislation will achieve by the year end.</p> <p> I did not realise the passage of time.  If I am allowed to reflect on one last point, the Minister of State in his contribution said that waiting times, particularly outside Dublin, had been considerably reduced.  We placed some attention on this issue earlier this morning, but some of the difficulties concern the fact that people who are users of these substances and who may have underlying mental health issues are not able to access mental health services while they are users.  They can only be assessed and assisted when they are absolutely "clean", which is the word used, and no longer using these psychoactive substances.  Those qualified to make the assessment are then able to deal with them as standalones in their own right.  There is an absolute need to look at this issue, because the required pathways to secure the help that is badly needed are not there.  </p> <p> This is a life-or-death situation which is, in real terms, currently affecting the county of Monaghan in a serious way, but I believe it is also the experience of communities right across the country.  It may not take the format of those little packs to which the Minister of State has now been introduced, but if it has not, I can tell the Minister of State with confidence, it is only a matter of time.</p></speech>

I thank the Minister of State for his presentation and congratulate him on his appointment, which I believe to be a significant one.  There is a view that, in recent enough times, we have lost focus on this issue.  A leading role by the Minister of State is vital to tackling the issue, which is widespread and pervasive.  It may not be understood enough at a central level, but this is a problem affecting every town, village and street right across the country.  It is significant that a Minister of State is leading in this area and is firmly putting the focus back on dealing with the issues.</p>  <p>  I wish to focus briefly on the future.  A number of important things need to be done.  The Minister of State indicated some of them in his presentation.  The most significant one is the drug strategy after 2016 into the future.  It is absolutely essential that we have an inclusive discussion and consultation on that strategy, which involves youth and community organisations, family resource centres, those who have been at the front line in dealing with this matter and those who have been affected directly by drugs.  That is absolutely essential, and I hope the Minister of State will put in place a formal structure for such an inclusive consultation.</p>  <p>  The Garda has done a lot of good work in the area of prevention by identifying and stopping the shipment of drugs.  It has also done excellent work in the area of diversion.  In the past, certainly in recent enough years, we have to a large extent lost the community policing element.  Unfortunately, due to cutbacks or whatever, community garda&iacute; across the country have been transferred to other duties.  In many cases, the community policing aspect is tagged on to other duties.  There should be a particular focus on community policing and ensuring these garda&iacute; are available to communities.  </p>  <p>  Community facilities and services is another crucial area in dealing with drug abuse and misuse.  The availability of community centres and sporting facilities in our communities is key to our future drug strategy.  There is also the question of the adequacy of the law governing this area.  The presentation earlier this morning raised that issue.  There is a lack of clarity on legal or herbal highs.  This aspect is crucial.  Those four areas - the inclusiveness of consultation on the new drugs strategy, community policing, community facilities and clarification of the law - will be vital in fighting this problem in the future.</p></speech>

I also welcome his appointment, which, as others have said, is hugely important.  As a member of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, I welcome, in particular, the fact that the Minister of State is now in charge of developing a national drugs strategy which is to commence after 2016.  I welcome the initiatives he has spoken about on prevention and education and the allocation of resources in that regard.</p>  <p>  Coming back to the national drugs strategy, the Minister of State has given a welcome commitment to examine policy and practice in other jurisdictions and to identify any evidence-based approaches which might be considered in an Irish context as part of that strategy.  The Minister of State will be aware that the Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is undertaking a review of drug policy.  As our Chairman, Deputy David Stanton, said, some members of the committee went to Portugal and looked at the Portuguese approach, which treats drug addiction as a health issue rather than a criminal justice issue.  I think we are all conscious from this morning's earlier presentation of the huge harm caused to health and, indeed, life by substance misuse.  We also have to be conscious that our most recent survey by the National Advisory Committee on Drugs and Alcohol shows that 25% of Irish people have taken cannabis at least once.  There is clearly a huge prevalence of the use of currently illegal drugs.  The abuse or misuse of substances by some people is a major health issue.  What is the best evidence-based approach for us to adopt?  Will the Minister of State, in his development of the drugs strategy, be looking, for example, at the Portuguese approach and that much clearer health-based model rather than the criminal justice model?</p></speech>

Deputy &Oacute; Caol&aacute;in raised the issue of psychoactive substances and the effectiveness of the 2010 legislation.  </p>  <p>               We have a cultural problem with addiction in Ireland.  Every family in Ireland has an addiction problem.  It is in every corner of the country.  There is a traditional misconception that it affects only certain geographical areas of Dublin.  That is not true.  It is everywhere, in every class group, every income level and every part of the country.  People in a higher income bracket tend to be able to hide it better.  Those in a lower income bracket cannot hide it as easily.</p> <p> In 2010, there was a cultural shift in that not only do we have a cultural acceptance of misuse of alcohol, which is a dangerous cultural problem, but we also have a cultural problem with our view of cannabis in certain sections of society.  Head shops were prevalent in 2010 and schoolchildren in uniform were lining up outside head shops where they could legally purchase substances which were very dangerous.  We had crossed a cultural border in the acceptance of that type of activity.  The legislation introduced in 2010 was effective in closing down the head shops.  There have been 260 controlled substances since then.  I agree with Deputy Healy that we are constantly trying to catch up with a very sophisticated and lucrative market because it is only necessary to change one small component of a substance and re-package it.  The system is trying to catch up with it.  I attended an interesting presentation during the week by a member of An Garda S&iacute;och&aacute;na at the north inner city drugs task force who said he has had conversations with women in his area who ask him how can they tell their children to get a poorly paid job in a department store if they have the option of earning &euro;1,000 per week selling zoplicone on the corner of their street.  The vehicle to address this is the Misuse of Drugs (Amendment) Bill 2015 that will come before the House this year.  I agree about the challenge in doing that. </p> <p> I accept that we have challenges in the area of treatment.  I am trying to be as open as possible to meeting groups and drugs task forces and those who meet service users and people in recovery and have identified several gaps.  One gap appears to be between the moment of realisation for a person with a substance abuse problem and the moment when treatment kicks in.  There is an expectation that the person&rsquo;s behaviour or substance intake will change before the person can enter a mainstream programme.  There are varying degrees of agreement or disagreement as to whether that really is a gap.  We have to identify how we interact with an individual who, for the first time, has had that light bulb moment that life cannot continue in this manner and needs assistance.  Crossing the threshold of a centre involves making a major personal change and calling out for help has a massive effect on self-esteem.  Are we engaging with those people effectively and practically at that moment?  I am not sure we are.  There is also an aftercare issue.  Are we just putting those on methadone programmes into cold storage for ten or 20 years, or do we deal with them as people with massive potential, who can work through their recovery and play a significant and important role in society?</p> <p> We have a cultural problem in how we view people in recovery.  It is not edifying to call them by nicknames, which we do.  We have to challenge and move beyond that behaviour.  They are sometimes very poorly treated by the media and in political circles and we have to move beyond that type of victim blaming.  Anyone else with a medical problem would not be treated in such a manner and it does really inhibit them and their potential to recover. </p> <p> I agree completely with Deputy Healy about the national drugs strategy and inclusive consultation because there are many people with much to say and the nature of the drug problem has changed completely since 2009.  We are working with a strategy developed for 2009 to 2016.  Ireland was a completely different place in 2009 and the drug issue was completely different then, as is the nature of what young people do now.  I do not want to focus only on young people because people of all ages take illegal substances but young people engage in poly drug use, taking benzodiazepines mixed with alcohol and cannabis, which is much more potent and dangerous than it may have been ten years ago.  It is a massive problem.  I met a man aged 21 in a detox centre in Fingal last month who had been addicted to cannabis for nine years.  This weighs heavily on my thoughts when trying to come up with a new drug strategy.  I am not convinced we need a seven year one; we need a tighter one, a more focused number of years when we can make a difference through what we are trying to do.</p> <p> I take on board Deputy Healy&rsquo;s comments about policing.  I intend to hold a conference on 29 July in the Mansion House in order to bring as many stakeholders as possible into one room at the one time.  I cannot wait for a review of the national drugs strategy to put a proper political focus on the nature of the problem in Ireland, which is a very serious one.  What I hear in different parts of the country terrifies me about the nature, prevalence and danger of drug use because we are not giving it the attention it needs.  I intend to bring a paper to Cabinet as soon as I possibly can and not to wait for the review of the national drugs strategy to do so.  I will do that most likely in the autumn.  This committee can certainly help me in that process.  On 29 July, in conjunction with the new Ardmh&eacute;ara of Dublin City, Councillor Cr&iacute;ona N&iacute; Dh&aacute;laigh, I want to host a conference and start that thought process about how to feed into the snapshot of the nature of the drug problem in Ireland. </p> <p> Although Senator Bacik had to leave to vote in the Seanad, I will deal with her issue about the Portuguese approach.  I do not see any point in persisting with dealing with people who are caught in a possession of a substance for personal use through the criminal justice system.  It is a complete waste of Garda time and of the system.  Under the Portuguese model there is an intervention, there can be sanctions but it is a waste of everybody&rsquo;s time and efforts to approach a person with an addiction issue who has a substance for personal use and decide that person is a criminal.  That person has a medical need and should be dealt with in that manner.  We have a lot of hearts and minds to win on that.  The committees&rsquo; consultation process is very useful because as soon as the word decriminalisation is used, people think one is talking about legalisation.  They are two very different things.  Our terminology has to be carefully used and sculpted.  We have to use international models.  The value system and dynamic in every country is different.  A legislative approach cannot be taken from one country, stuck into another and expected to work.  When the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Justice and Equality held discussions on prostitution, it was told not to take the Swedish approach without taking its value system of counselling and education, and the entire package.  If we were to go down the Portuguese route, it could not be only a legislative change; it would have to be an entire package of measures. </p></speech>

I know he received a copy of draft legislation from the Ana Liffey project about safe injection rooms.  I support that.  </p>  <p>               I get many calls from parents telling me about the needles and drug-related things that are thrown all over the place when they bring their children for a walk in the park or to a playground and in school grounds.  On a number of occasions I have met parents whose young children have picked up syringes.  That is a real problem, particularly around the inner city.  I hope the Minister of State will give due consideration to the draft legislative proposals from the Ana Liffey drug project because I think this is a step in the right direction not only for the people living in the area but for the users.  It might also give the Minister some significant data on the numbers who use heroin.</p> <p> I continually make the point on the social, personal and health education curriculum.  I honestly think we need to change the model and look at ways that we can identify in the classroom how drug abuse is destroying young people's lives.  We need to be more effective on the ground and get the message out.  If young people at school do not get a graphic lesson on the effects of drugs, when they are out of school and into their 30s they are lost in the system and one cannot deal with them.  Building self esteem comes not only from parents and education but from the community.  I think that is very important.</p> <p> I have a number of questions related to the task forces.  Deputy Dara Calleary tabled a parliamentary question in June about the national drugs strategy budget.  We hear all the time about the reduction in the money allocated to the community, but the reply to this parliamentary question included a table setting out the funding from 2010 to 2015.  In my area, six different bodies receive local drug task funding and yet after huge sums of money have gone to them, we still have a significant drug problem.  I wonder if this is due to the duplication of services.  In some areas I see the same people accessing all of the services and nobody knowing who is doing what.  The money is going into the services but nobody is tracking who is availing of the services.  The services are duplicated in each of the areas.</p> <p> I have a bugbear about young pregnant women with addiction issues who give birth in maternity hospitals to babies with addiction to alcohol and to drugs.  We need to encourage these young pregnant women and help them because the substance abuse is not only killing them but affecting their unborn children.  I have reservations around how these young women who have both alcohol and drug addictions are being treated when they go into the maternity hospitals.</p></speech>

I welcome the Minister of State, Deputy &Oacute; R&iacute;ord&aacute;in and I have always supported the principle of having a Minister directly responsible for the drugs issue.  I feel strongly that we need somebody in politics, a political director, to pull all the different agencies together.  I also firmly believe we need somebody outside the political sphere that will pull everybody together and deal with the day-to-day issues.  The Minister of State who is focused on the drugs issues has responsibility for asylum and other issues.  We need to ensure we have a strong national director who will push the Departments and the services every single day of the week.</p>  <p>  We have been discussing the drugs crisis but we have not put enough emphasis on the reasons young people take drugs.  When one sits down with young people to observe and talk to them - in a previous day job I worked with young people -  about the reason they took drugs, they will say it is for the buzz, to deal with anxiety, low self esteem, lack of love and affection in their personal and family life.  Many of them come from very dysfunctional families where there was a lot of violence and aggression.  The constant theme of these young people is the constant pain in their lives.  As part of any strategy, we have to deal with theses issues to prevent those people going down the drugs route.  One needs to get in early.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned that we have 9,800 people on the methadone treatment programme.  It is great that these people are in a programme and I welcome that, but do we have numbers for those outside the system?  To deal with a major national problem we need accurate information on the numbers.</p>  <p>  We need to address the impact of drugs on communities.  At present the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality is doing a report on gangland crime and the widespread intimidation that goes on in some communities.  We have dealt with horrific stories.  We need to focus on the completely innocent victims of these drug gangs who live in the community and make life a living hell and total nightmare for others.  We need to look at the impact of drug gangs as part of the overall response.</p>  <p>  I was a member of the delegation that accompanied the Chairman of the Joint Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality, Deputy David Stanton to Portugal to learn about their approach to drugs.  We got a very good insight into the problem.  We saw at first hand the alternative approach to the aftercare and social integration of drug addicts.  I think we should examine their model seriously as an option.  From the political perspective I was also fascinated that Portugal has decriminalised drug use.  The Minister of State referred to the forthcoming debate on decriminalisation and legalisation of drugs because it will frighten the bunnies and will be open to public opinion.  </p>  <p>  In Portugal there was all party agreement to do this and it was totally under the radar of public opinion.</p></speech>

That is a very high figure.  However he failed to mention the number of deaths as a result of gangland murders and violence in the community.</p></speech>

I really wish the Minister of State well.  This is perhaps the greatest example of a situation where we need first thinking.  This is a classical example of society, and not just Irish society, looking at something in a certain way for 50 or 60 years, seeing the evidence stacking up, ceiling high, that what we are doing is wrong but continuing to do it.  In medicine and in science, we believe in empiricism and in testing something and if it fails, we say that it failed and that it is time to try something else.  In terms of dealing with drug policy, we have not been good at that.  Effectively, we are doing the same kind of things now that were done in the 1950s and 1960s with subtle nuances.  When I say &quot;we&quot; I do not mean we in Ireland, I mean globally in the western world in the way we tackle the problem.  I am not making any personal criticisms or, indeed, any professional or systems criticism of the way we do things in Ireland, because we do it pretty much the same way that most other people do it and we do it wrong.</p><p>I am a parent.  I have four children and I hope none of them takes drugs.  I do not want anybody to think I am saint, which means that I am somehow soft on drugs or that I am some kind of an aging hippy - I am aging - who has got some kind of liberal ideas because I do not; I am very anti-drugs.  I would cast a weather eye on people using drugs in any sphere of my life and would do everything I could to stop them doing it.  I think we all have that as a goal.  I made a few suggestions over the past eight years about different ways of doing it, and one takes a certain amount of personal criticism for that.  People assume that somehow one is soft on drugs or one is soft on drug users.  I am absolutely well aware of the devastation caused by drugs to individuals, their families and society at large.  </p><p>The war on drugs has cost hundreds of billions of euro.  One would have to say it is as unqualified a failure as we have ever seen internationally in anything.  The number of people who are using drugs in most countries is higher than it ever was.  There has been very few instances of countries where drug use has systematically gone down or the number of people whose lives are damaged by drugs has gone down.  </p><p>The major emphasis on interdiction and criminalisation and the metric of success being the street value of the stuff police have in whatever part of the world when they have the great photo opportunities with all the great big bags of stuff they have seized is irrelevant.  The metric has to be how many people are taking drugs, how much they are using, what kind of drugs are they using and the cost of the devastation to their health, their families and society.  That is what we really should be looking at.  The Minister of State has already given us many hints that he is looking at the alternative approach, one which is best exemplified by the Portuguese, by other selective centres in Scotland and by other places that have gone into a harm reduction approach and a medicalisation approach for many of the drugs but one of the key things is to look critically at being brave enough to say to people that we may end up reducing some of the emphasis on police and on naval vessels and that we may do something rather different in the way we are trying to tackle the problem.  It is not because we have given up, that we do not care, that we are pro-drugs or that we are liberal but because what we have done in the past has not worked.  That is a hard message to get across because people assume that if one is not being <i>&uuml;ber</i>tough on drugs or sounding like someone from the Tennessee state house, that somehow one is some kind of a communist.</p><p>It is critically important to dissect this problem into the many problems which it is.  In the cancer world, it has dawned on us over the past 20 years that diseases which we thought were unitary in fact comprise many different kinds.  Drug use is a similar analogy.  </p>  <p>               We cannot hope to tackle cocaine abuse in the same way we would seek to tackle heroin, marijuana, alcohol or tobacco use.  We need to see all of these as interrelated issues.</p> <p> I might be accused of a certain inconsistency in these matters in that I would not hesitate to tighten the noose on the tobacco industry and make it ever harder for it to sell its products.  We should be aiming for zero tolerance on tobacco use.  It is achievable if we give ourselves a 20-year timeframe and a clear statement of purpose that it will no longer be legal to engage in for-profit commerce in tobacco after some future debate.  That type of timeframe would facilitate farmers to switch to other crops, give investment houses time to invest in something else and allow factories scope to retool and so on.  At a time when the world is desperately short of food, we could use the bioprocessing capacity currently taken up with tobacco production for something other than growing cancer-causing, addictive drugs.  In the case of alcohol, my view is that we should, as a society, be aiming for a huge reduction in the volume we consume.  However, these matters are another day's work and I will not go into them today.</p> <p> My views are somewhat different when it comes illegal drugs.  In the case of opioids, which are a special problem on their own, I did some research during my first year as a member of this committee; we met with many individuals and stakeholders and participated in on-site inspections.  I came away from all of this convinced that we must regard opioid use as its own particular problem.  People with an opioid addiction have a medical illness, and the treatment for the withdrawal phase of opioid addiction is opioids.  We need to get people desensitised and ultimately off the drug, but when somebody has an acute withdrawal, the treatment they really need is an opioid of some kind or they will get terribly ill.  We need a strategy of harm reduction, which will inevitably involve medicalising the use of heroin and heroin-like drugs in a bigger way than we currently do.  The physical manifestations of the illness and withdrawal are such that people, especially if they are in relatively low-income situations, will do anything to get the drug, with all the social chaos this causes not only for themselves, but also for their families.</p> <p> I wish the Minister of State well in his undertaking and would be delighted to meet with him again for a more leisurely chat about these issues.  I reiterate that when it comes to tackling drugs misuse, each aspect of the problem needs to be dissected and examined on its own merits.  There will be no single solution.</p></speech>

I thank the Chairman for facilitating me, as a non-member, to participate in the meeting.  I wish the Minister of State well with the conference to which he referred.  It is important to hear the voices of those affected by this issue.  However, his predecessors, as we know, also held conferences; it is time now for concentrated action.  The national drugs strategy is not keeping up with reality, which the Minister of State knows from the projects he has visited and as he will have heard at the north inner city drugs task force meeting the other day.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred in his opening statement to the need for legislation.  There was reference to new Z drugs, such as zopiclone, which has the brand name Zimovane.  The minute these types of drugs appear, they must be tested and immediately banned.  We know, however, that as soon as they are controlled, other drugs will appear.  Whatever legislation is put in place, it must include a mechanism whereby whenever a new substance appears, there is immediate testing of it.  I acknowledge that the testing centres are under fierce pressure, which is another issue.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State referred to people accessing treatment.  The problem is that so many who need it are not, for a variety of reasons, accessing any treatment.  In the case of a person who presents at accident and emergency with chest pains, for instance, we could string off a list of procedures and treatments they might be offered.  When somebody presents at a hospital suffering from the effects of alcohol or drug abuse, there is usually some emergency treatment administered and the person is then discharged.  More often that not, that person will be back in the accident and emergency department many times again.  We are not providing enough treatment opportunities and options at that particular point of access, which, in many cases, is the main point of access to the health system for people in addiction.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State gave a very blas&eacute; answer this morning to my question about alcohol services, saying he had never heard of a project that did not claim to be struggling.  I am asking him to examine those projects where the evidence is that they are doing well.  Staff and clients at &Aacute;it Linn are very excited about his upcoming visit.  I met a group from that facility the other day who are in recovery from alcohol addiction.  They spoke about the economic cost of their alcoholism by way of accident and emergency visits, hospitalisation, missed work, doctor visits, medication and so on.  The cost of their residential treatment was either paid for by themselves or covered by the medical card and they are now back in work and paying their taxes.  Some have their own businesses and are employing people.  Furthermore, there is a knock-on beneficial effect for their families and communities and, in many cases, they are supporting others in recovery.  &Aacute;it Linn receives funding of &euro;150,000 a year.  We need such a facility in every town in the country such is the extent of the abuse of alcohol and drugs in our society.</p>  <p>  There has been talk since 2010 about making naloxone available for the treatment of patients with drug overdoses.  Will the Minister of State indicate whether there is any progress in that regard?</p>  <p>  On the question of decriminalisation, it is important that age be given due consideration as a factor.  There are extenuating circumstances to consider when a young person is caught with a small quantity of an illegal substance.  When we are young, we think we are immortal and will never be caught out.  It is a totally different scenario when an adult is habitually engaged in criminal behaviour around drugs.  Our emphasis must be on supporting young people to get off a criminal path that will have massive implications for their future.</p>  <p>  The Minister of State mentioned the changing nature of the drug culture and the need for urgency in addressing the issues.  I urge that he consider replicating on a broader scale those projects, some of which he has seen or will soon see for himself, that are working and making a difference.</p></speech>

I agree with Senator John Crown's sentiments about it not being enough to continue on with what has been handed down to us but that we must instead form a logical view of what is happening and what needs to be done.  As I said earlier, there is no point in clogging up the courts system and criminalising people for what is a medical need.  There can be a lot of tough talk around this issue, which is really pointless.  We have an understanding of the issues facing people who live on the edges of society and the excesses that can sometimes arise in their behaviour.  Tough talk offers great one liners for journalists to latch onto but essentially amounts to meaningless and vacuous commentary which does not address the reality of the situation.</p>  <p>  Continuing down the road of the Just Say No policy is a waste of time because a lot of young people do not listen to that message.  Some are affected by the call and respond accordingly, but many others do not.  I agree with Deputy Catherine Byrne that the education component is very important in terms of setting out our stall, but it is not really the most effective way of reaching young people.  If children were influenced to that extent by everything they are told in school, we would not have the issues we have.</p>  <p>  I am instinctively an advocate for the idea of medically supervised consumption rooms.  I am in favour, too, of a decriminalisation model, but it must be one that suits the Irish context.  That is a crucial point.  I referred to the different legislative approaches taken in different countries.  We must ensure any provisions we bring in will work in this country and in the context of Irish dynamics.</p>  <p>  There is a huge amount of work to do in terms of raising public awareness.  Deputy Finian McGrath mentioned the 633 people who died from drug misuse in 2012.  It is an appalling statistic.  If it applied to road deaths, there would be a massive public awareness programme arising out of it.  We need to look at how to hone our message, but there remains work to do on what that message should be.  This is an issue that impacts people of all ages, young, middle-aged and older.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan made an interesting point about age being a factor in decisions around criminal sanctions.  Some people have taken drugs all their lives and do not make a connection in their own heads with the tragic stories that enter the public realm from time to time.  </p>  <p>               Consequently, I do not know; I am willing to listen and learn as to how best to approach this matter.  I accept the Deputy's point about how the Government is constantly trying to catch up with a lucrative and sophisticated industry.  The Deputy and I are aware, from the area she represents and which I used to represent and in which I used to teach, that this is an extremely lucrative industry.  It is not a casual, recreational activity in which people get involved but is a parallel economy.  It employs people, one can make money out of it, people derive power from it and it has a hierarchy within it.  Why would one spend one's time in education or further training when is a lot of money to be made within this parallel economy?  As there is a huge amount of empowerment to be gained from doing that, the question is how should that also be tackled.  I acknowledge the Deputy mentioned that the previous Minister held a conference in early 2014 and I understand the focus was mainly on the issue of alcohol.  My intention is not to allow this conference, which is to be held at the end of the month, to feed into the national drugs strategy necessarily but to let it feed into a paper I wish to present to Cabinet, which basically will outline Ireland's current position in this regard.  As for waiting for the national drugs strategy, such a strategy will be produced anyway.  Governments and the political system will deliver that anyway.  However, I wish to provide a snapshot in time of the nature of our drug problem, how important it is, how dangerous it is, and how serious this is.   I want people to say things like people are not showing up, to refer to the drugs task forces, the gaps in the service, the aftercare and all the rest of it.  I believe we can get to the bottom of these issues at the conference at the end of the month.</p></speech>

I refer the Minister of State back to the earlier point I made.  Is it at all possible to be out ahead of it?  Without wishing to repeat everything I stated earlier, I suggest a general ban on human use or absorption of substances that are not actually deemed legal and within approved purpose might be a means by which the Garda would be better able to carry out its function in the face of the presentation of new substances on a continuous basis, which is the case and unquestionably will continue to be the case.  I refer to when a new substance presents and the definition as to whether it is psychoactive.  The laboratory testing will make a determination as to whether the chemical structure of the new substance is comparable with existing psychoactive substances.  However, of itself, it perhaps cannot decide that it is; it can only tell one what is the make-up of the substance and that it is similar to known psychoactive particles.  Is there a way, within the existing or the new legislation the Minister of State is planning, of having legal certainty whereby one could allow for the prosecution to proceed on the basis of the laboratory testing and of all the available information?  Is there a way to ensure beyond reasonable doubt that this comparable make-up to known psychoactive substances is sufficient to proceed?  It is the case that some of these are challenged, there is uncertainty and it is unknown, particularly in respect of synthetic cannabinoids.  As I stated in the earlier session, these are not the same but are mimicking what something else we know of can and does do.  Can the legislation be amended to ensure the laboratory test is adequate confirmation of the purpose, the intent and the effect of the use of these substances?</p>  <p>  I refer to the role of the mental health services in treating induced psychosis or other presenting crises such as, for example, suicidal ideation.  I made the point earlier that there is not immediate access.  There must be an amendment to the existing brief regarding mental services in order that people are not turned away only to then go back to a community-based or similar service within the community.  There must be some access to professional help and services, not awaiting the person to be off the particular drug in which he or she is involved.  For all of this, increased investment in treatment and support is needed.  Finally, I refer to the establishment of inpatient stabilisation and detoxification facilities.  Are these matters the Minister of State will proactively consider in the new amending Bill he proposes to bring in before the end of this year?  He should provide members with greater certainty as to what he intends to do.</p></speech>

It was the court case that caused the confusion and the emergency legislation and that is why we are in this position.  If I might suggest, the pre-legislative stage in this committee or committees would be key to teasing out those issues, be it the justice committee, the health committee or whichever committee is deemed appropriate.  Collectively, across the House, there is a determination to deal with and nail this issue and to be on top of it.  I completely accept the point made by the Deputy that when one is dealing with a highly sophisticated industry, which can change a small component of whatever substance it is and then repackage, reproduce and distribute it, one is constantly playing catch-up.  The Government wishes to have as robust a legislative framework as possible to deal with that.  My understanding of the 2010 legislation is that psychoactive substances effectively were banned and that there is a list of those which were not in order to give a legal structure around it.  I suggest the pre-legislative stage here at this committee or in joint sittings of committees might be the best way to tease that out.  However, on the Deputy's question, I certainly have an open mind as to how best we can deal with the issues he has raised.</p>  <p>  One of the Deputy's questions pertained to the issue of mental health and addiction and a new strategy.  That absolutely will be a central part of the new strategy and I believe it is key to it.  Earlier, I mentioned the interaction I have had with people, including those in recovery and their families and the trauma their families have also gone through sometimes is overlooked.  As I mentioned at the outset of my presentation, I believe it should be acknowledged that every family in Ireland has had an addiction problem.  Therefore, every family has suffered from it, every family understands it and every family needs to be helped through that process too, because it is not just the person in recovery who needs assistance; it also is the people who care for the person in recovery.</p></speech>

It was an interesting and engaging meeting.  I noted one or two points.  The Minister of State initially spoke about a focus on supply reduction, prevention, treatment, rehabilitation and research and then he spoke about inter-agency working in a difficult cross-cutting policy and service area.  This encapsulates the challenge and as someone mentioned earlier, the Sports Council has a full-time chief executive officer who is focused on sports and on sports only.  Perhaps there is a need for somebody, perhaps somebody already is doing this, to pull together everybody, all the agencies and Departments, and to work with the Minister of State on a full-time basis.  This might be something worth considering.</p>  <p>  I also wish to mention the issue of youth work.  The Minister of State or perhaps someone else earlier this morning noted that students do not live in school, which is a good comment as they do not.  They live in communities and in homes.  Very often, if youngsters are engaged in out-of-school formal youth settings, one can have outreach there as well and this is an area that might be expanded and explored and which might be worth considering.  Deputy Maureen O'Sullivan mentioned this earlier but in Portugal, members noted the importance of the local treatment centres.  </p>  <p>         People have somewhere local to go so they do not have to travel long distances for treatment.</p> <p> I wish to bring the Minister of State's attention to the amazing work done by the Churchfield Community Trust in Cork and ask him to visit it at some stage.  The Cornmarket Project in Wexford also does amazing work with people who are really challenged.  I visited both and have met the people involved.  Next week representatives from Churchfield Community Trust will come before the Joint Oireachtas Committee on Justice, Defence and Equality to make a presentation on the very impressive work they do.  Colleagues have said such work is being done throughout the country.</p> <p> The Minister of State said many people have multiple complex interlocking needs such as poverty, housing, poor health, education and mental health issues.  The challenges are massive.  I speak for all colleagues when I say that the sense I have is that everybody is behind the Minister of State in the work he wants to do and he has full support.  If I am wrong I ask people to pick me up on it, but I sense a real impatience to get on with it, that the Minister of State should do what he needs to do and that he will not have resistance.  People will be impatient to get on and have this dealt with.  This is above politics.  It is life and death for many people and we want to give the Minister of State fair wind to get on with it.  The idea of committees coming together like this is useful because it is cost-cutting.  As Chairman of the Working Group of Committee Chairman I will explore with colleagues whether we can do this to give the Minister of State further support.</p></speech>
