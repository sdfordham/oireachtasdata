He is accompanied by Ms Georgina O'Mahoney, a deputy director in the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General.  Apologies have been received from Deputies Marc MacSharry and Josepha Madigan.</p><p>I suggest we deal with all correspondence and other matters at the end of our first session or this afternoon in order that we can proceed directly to our engagement on the accounts and statements for 2015 of the Revenue Commissioners.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  I welcome the chairman of the Revenue Commissioners, Mr. Niall Cody.  He is accompanied by Mr. Declan Rigney, an assistant secretary in the planning division; Mr. Tom Dowling, an administrative budget manager; and Mr. Liam Gallagher, principal officer.  I also welcome Ms Vicki Cahill from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Visitors Gallery to turn off their mobile phones entirely or leave them in airplane mode.  It is not enough merely to leave them in silent mode as they still cause interference with the broadcasting and recording of the proceedings.</p><p>By virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of the evidence they are to give to the committee.  If, however, they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person or an entity, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy or policies.  They are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the Houses or an official, either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>We are to examine the 2014 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts, Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners; the 2015 annual report of the Comptroller and Auditor General and Appropriation Accounts, Vote 9 - Office of the Revenue Commissioners; chapter 12 - tackling fuel laundering, and chapter 15 - taxpayer compliance; and the 2015 Revenue accounts.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.13" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Seamus McCarthy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016101300002#B01000"><p>The 2015 account of the receipt of revenue for the State collected by the Revenue Commissioners was certified by me on 15 April 2016 and received a clear audit opinion.  The account includes receipts of taxes and duties which are remitted by Revenue to the Exchequer and receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies.  The account shows that total receipts of taxes and duties amounted to a net &euro;45.8 billion in 2015.  This represents an increase of &euro;4.4 billion, or 10.6%, when compared to 2014.  Within this figure, the most significant change related to corporation tax receipts, which increased by &euro;2.3 billion, or 49%, year on year.  As a result, corporation tax receipts accounted for 15% of the tax take in 2015, compared to 11% in 2014.  Receipts collected by Revenue on behalf of other agencies also increased year on year by approximately 11%.  Pay-related social insurance and health levy contributions accounted for over 89% of that category of receipts in 2015.  These contributions are remitted directly to the Social Insurance Fund.  Revenue&rsquo;s administration and operational expenses are charged to Vote 9 - Revenue Commissioners, rather than the Revenue account.  The appropriation account shows that the total spend by Revenue in 2015 amounted to &euro;401 million, which represented an increase of 4% on the figure for 2014.  Taking account of appropriations-in-aid of &euro;82 million in 2015, net expenditure under the Vote amounted to &euro;319 million.<br/><br/>Chapter 12 examines the actions taken by Revenue in recent years to tackle the issue of fuel laundering.  Excise duty on mineral oils represents a significant proportion of the total excise duty collected each year.  In 2015 it made up almost half of the total excise duty receipts of &euro;5.5 billion collected by Revenue that year.  Marked gas oil for agricultural and other off-road use is subject to significantly lower rates of tax than diesel intended for use in transport and passenger vehicles.  Fuel laundering is an illegal process, whereby the markers are removed from the marked gas oil which is then sold on for use in road vehicles.  The associated cost to the State includes the taxes forgone and the cost of removing and disposing of the waste dumped by fuel launderers.  There were almost 1,000 cases of waste dumping between 2008 and 2015, with the clean-up costing the State almost &euro;7 million.  While Revenue carries out certain targeted analysis projects in the area of mineral oils, it does not have an estimate of the loss to the Exchequer as a result of fuel laundering.<br/><br/>From 2011, the detection of laundered fuel became more difficult because the sulphur content of marked gas oil was reduced to the same level as road diesel.  To address the increased risk, Revenue developed a mineral oils strategy to combat the illegal trade.  The strategy introduced a number of key measures to address the risk, including improved licensing arrangements for the sale of fuel, a supply chain reporting system to give Revenue details of the movement of fuel stocks, reckless trading provisions, a national risk-based sampling programme using portable analysers to detect the presence of the marker and a new fuel<b></b>marker in a joint project with the UK revenue and customs services.  In combination, these measures act as a deterrent to fuel launderers.  A random sampling exercise carried out by the Revenue Commissioners in January 2016 found no evidence of the new marker in the samples tested.  I have made a number of recommendations to Revenue to tighten controls in the supply chain reporting system.  I am glad to note that Revenue has accepted these proposals.<br/><br/>Chapter 15 outlines Revenue&rsquo;s approach to monitoring and managing taxpayer compliance.  Revenue undertakes a range of compliance interventions, including tax audits.  Under its random audit programme, it carries out approximately 400 audits of randomly selected individual taxpayers and businesses each year.  The results of the completed audits for the period between 2013 and 2015 consistently showed that approximately 60% of taxpayers selected for audit had paid the correct amounts of tax due, but approximately 40% of taxpayers selected for audit were found to have under-declared their tax liabilities.  The results of comprehensive random audits can be used to provide an estimate of the audit gap; that is, losses as a result of non-compliance by registered taxpayers.  The 2014 random audits suggested that, on average, registered taxpayers had underpaid their liabilities by an estimated 2% in the reference year.  Revenue's main compliance work is its programme of risk-based tax audit.  The results of the programme indicate that Revenue's detection work is generally well targeted.  In 2015 some 68% of the risk-based audits resulted in identification of additional tax due.  This is significantly higher than the non-compliance rate for the random sample.  Although the number of compliance interventions undertaken by Revenue decreased between 2012 and 2015, the overall yield from its compliance activity has increased.  It should be noted that there are likely to be losses of revenue from activity by economic agents that are completely outside the tax system, operating in the shadow economy.  Revenue does not generate estimates of such losses which are referred to as the tax gap.  By comparison, the UK revenue and customs service estimated the tax gap there to be 6.4% in 2013-14.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.15" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016101300002#B01200"><p>I thank the Chairman for giving me the opportunity to make a short opening statement.  As time is limited, I will concentrate on giving a brief overview of the two relevant chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  </p> <p>  Large-scale laundering of marked fuel escalated in 2011 when ultra low sulphur marked gas oil became widely available on the market because of changes in EU environmental standards for fuels.  This fuel is the same as road diesel, apart from the markers and dye.</p><p>Revenue responded to this increased risk and, since 2011, has implemented a comprehensive and successful strategy to tackle the problem.  The strategy is designed to make it much more difficult to source marked diesel for laundering and to get laundered diesel onto the market.</p><p> Our strategy includes the following elements.  The licensing regime for auto fuel traders was strengthened with effect from September 2011 to limit the ability to get laundered fuel onto the market.  A new licensing regime was introduced for traders in marked fuel in October 2012, designed to limit the ability to source marked fuel for laundering.  There was identification and implementation of a new fiscal marker jointly with Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs for implementation in Ireland and the UK.  A new supply chain reporting regime was introduced from January 2013, which requires all fuel traders to make monthly electronic returns to Revenue of their fuel transactions.  We use these datasets to identify suspicious or anomalous transactions and patterns of distribution for investigation.  Revenue, in co-operation with other law enforcement agencies on both sides of the Border, has intensified the targeting of enforcement action against suspected fuel-laundering operations.  This process is facilitated by the cross-Border fuel group, which is representative of all relevant agencies North and South.  In addition, a reckless trading provision was introduced in the Finance (No. 2) Act 2013 that makes a supplier who is reckless in supplying rebated fuel for a use connected with excise fraud liable for the duty evaded.  This provision has strengthened our hand in dealing with those traders supplying fuel recklessly to dubious customers.</p><p> In the Finance Act 2014, provisions were introduced to strengthen our ability to refuse or revoke a mineral oil trader's licence where that trader does not comply with excise law, does not maintain adequate stock management systems and records or provides false or misleading information.  Under the new provisions, Revenue's assessment of applications is based on the legitimacy of the applicant and their business, and the quality of their accounting and stock control systems.</p><p> The tax loss associated with fuel laundering is not quantifiable but there is no doubt that it was significant.  Following the implementation of a range of measures to tackle the problem, we recently completed an analysis of oil market trends in Ireland and, on the basis of a comparison of extrapolated pre-2013 trends with actual results for 2013 and 2014, estimated that our mineral oil strategy may have saved the Exchequer up to &euro;200 million in 2014.</p><p> Clearances of marked gas oil from tax warehouses dropped significantly in 2013 and 2014 and were stable in 2015 despite the strengthening economic recovery that saw road diesel clearances rise in the same year by over 9%.  The successful implementation of this strategy has resulted in major strides made to reduce and eliminate fuel laundering.  This is evidenced by the fact that a recent random sampling programme produced no evidence of the new marker in any of the samples taken.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General has made a number of recommendations as a result of findings made during his review.  The recommendations have been accepted and will be implemented.</p><p> On the taxpayer compliance chapter, Ireland has a self-assessment system.  It is a fundamental principle of self-assessment tax systems that returns filed by compliant taxpayers are accepted as the basis for computing tax liabilities.  Revenue promotes compliance with the tax system by pursuit of those who do not file returns, by auditing selected returns and by taking appropriate action against tax and duty evaders up to and including investigation and prosecution.</p><p> We carry out compliance interventions for a variety of reasons: to protect the Exchequer; to assure ourselves as to the accuracy of self-assessment returns; to influence compliance behaviour; to provide a level playing field for all taxpayers; and to minimise the distortive effects on legitimate business caused by the shadow economy.  We constantly strive to prevent non-compliance by making it as easy as possible for our customers to pay the right amount of taxes and duties at the right time.  Through our service-for-compliance approach we are providing more and more user-friendly ways of doing business with us, increasingly through digital channels.  However, a minority of people choose not to comply with their tax and duty obligations.  The type of intervention to be undertaken in any particular case is the one considered to be the most appropriate to target the specific risk or risks identified and to influence the compliance behaviour of the taxpayer.  By carefully selecting the cases for intervention and choosing the type of intervention, we maximise the use of resources and minimise the compliance burden on compliant taxpayers.</p><p> We have made a strategic shift in recent years to increase the number of less intrusive non-audit interventions.  This does not mean that we are ceasing our audit programme, though as the Comptroller and Auditor General has noted in his report, it does mean a reduction in the numbers of what were previously classified as audits.  We believe that by increasing the focus on non-audit interventions, we can increase our coverage of potential risk and we can focus our resources more effectively on the biggest risk cases.  Non-audit interventions involve verifying documentation and requesting additional information in order to address specific risks.  Revenue continually assesses the appropriateness of interventions.  This mix of audit interventions and non-audit interventions has led to a higher level of non-compliant yield being collected, from &euro;492 million in 2012 to &euro;642 million in 2015.</p><p> We also risk assess any information that might suggest the existence of aggressive tax-planning as an avoidance or evasion mechanism.  An example of this is our recent review of the tax affairs of medical consultants, which also featured in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  We opened 763 interventions nationally, 403 of which were closed by 30 June and yielded &euro;48.7 million in tax, interest and penalties. The Comptroller and Auditor General's report also featured a chapter on the research and development tax credit, a tax expenditure that has increased considerably in recent years.  Revenue's compliance activity in relation to this credit has increased proportionally.  In 2015 we completed 178 interventions with total yield in excess of &euro;46 million.</p><p> The Comptroller and Auditor General has made three recommendations arising from the review.  Revenue has accepted each of the recommendations in part.  While our random audit programme is not currently designed for the purpose of estimating the audit gap, I have committed to reviewing the role that audit-gap measurement could have in assessing our effectiveness.  Similarly with tax-gap measurement, while continuing to have reservations on developing a full suite of tax-gap measurement tools, we will continue to carry out critical analyses of compliance in particular sectors and activities.  As regards increasing the level of risk-based audits, our strategy has shifted to identifying the most appropriate intervention to address the identified risk.  Risk-based audit will continue to have a very important role to play in implementing this strategy.</p><p> I am happy to discuss any issues and answer any questions raised by the committee, subject, of course, to taxpayer confidentiality.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.17" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1216" speakername="Se&aacute;n Fleming" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016101300002#C00200"><p>I thank Mr. Cody for his opening statement.  He specifically concentrated on the two chapters in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report which we mentioned to him in advance of the meeting.  Obviously, however, we will also ask some questions on general Revenue activities.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.18" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1218" speakername="Shane Cassells" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016101300002#C00300"><p>I welcome Mr. Cody.  I pay tribute to him and all his staff for the work they do and their contribution to the State.  I also thank the Comptroller and Auditor General and all his staff for their consistent work on behalf of the committee.</p> <p>  With so much focus this week on expenditure in the State, it is opportune that officials from the Revenue Commissioners are here this morning as we look at the income side.  Despite the fact that Revenue collected &euro;62 billion in gross receipts last year, listening to Deputies making statements in the House in recent days and adding up the cost of the many items on their it is possible that Mr. Cody and his colleagues may have to bring in a few more euro.  Perhaps he could find out for us whether what would be possible.</p> <p>  I will cover the Revenue accounts and appropriation accounts before coming to the chapters on fuel laundering and compliance.  In our role as political representatives, one of the items with which we continually deal is the pressure on small and medium-sized businesses.  One of the issues that struck me from the figures that which relates to managing taxpayer debt.  At the end of 2015, approximately 8,500 taxpayers or businesses - covering almost &euro;96 million of tax debt - had phased payment arrangements to enable them to overcome significant cashflow problems.  Given that only &euro;96 million of the &euro;823 million of the debt available for collection had phased payment arrangements in place in respect of it, is there not scope for increasing the level of such arrangements so that more businesses could be helped?  With 8,500 businesses covered by the &euro;96 million to which I refer, how many are covered by the remaining &euro;727 million?  Any small businesses person would talk about the operating pressures he or she is experiencing.</p><p>I know that when they are hit with a tax bill, they say it is always something that shakes them to the core.  If a greater phased arrangement could be put in place on the debt side to enable them to overcome these cashflow problems, it would be most significant.  Can Mr. Cody comment on that?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.20" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016101300002#D00200"><p>I thank Deputy Cassells for his compliments to Revenue staff.  They do a difficult job in difficult circumstances.  I will outline the position on debt collection and debt management.  A comprehensive review of debt management featured in the Comptroller and Auditor General's 2014 report.  We have never had a chance to discuss it but I would be pleased to touch on some of the issues now.</p> <p>  I have up-to-date figures on phased payment arrangements.  As of 30 September 2016, the figure is 11,432, covering &euro;108 million of debt.  According to the report, we had &euro;734 million of debt that was neither subject to a payment agreement nor enforcement proceedings.  In last year's budget package, we got additional resources to focus on debt collection.  This tends to be at the lower end, in other words, small rather than medium-sized enterprises.  We were having difficulty getting to them.  Obviously there are greater numbers of them but smaller amounts of money are involved.</p></speech>

There are no PAYE workers.  Some have small amounts of VAT outstanding as well.  We focused on the &euro;734 million.  As of September 2016, of that &euro;734 million a total of &euro;568 million has been collected.</p> <p>  After the Comptroller and Auditor General carried out the study on the &euro;734 million, we undertook to map those debts.  We engaged proactively with the businesses in question.  Of those, approximately 3,500 entered into a phased arrangement.  We have increased the numbers under phased arrangements.  However, getting involved in a phased arrangement requires two parties in the transaction.  We require up-to-date returns, meaningful engagement and a commitment to keep current returns up-to-date.  Of the &euro;734 million there is only &euro;43 million left that we have yet to engage with.  We have done a considerable amount.</p> <p>  It is really interesting.  Around 2012 we had 16,000 cases under phased arrangements.  This was when the recession had really hit.  Obviously it had hit in 2008, but by the time the debt had risen to enforcement stage it was 2012.  By then, we had &euro;126 million under phased arrangement.  Some of this reflects the fact that people completed their phased arrangement, their debt is paid and they are on a steady basis.</p> <p>  We are keen to keep feasible businesses in business and to keep people in jobs.  However, it requires engagement by the taxpayer.  We will talk later about the tax gap.  Anyway, there is a down-side.  Part of the tax gap includes uncollected debt.  Obviously, it has implications for feasible businesses if their next-door neighbours can trade without paying taxes.</p></speech>

I wish to move to the local property tax, something that is also alive in the minds of people.  According to the accounts, Revenue achieved 97% compliance for the tax in 2015.  Recent media reports covered how Revenue would chase the remaining 3% and bring them into the net.  Has Revenue identified a cohort of homes or a regional spread?  Can Mr. Cody offer a comment in this regard in terms of the plan to bring in the 3%?  It is all collectable?  Is there always a certain portion of bad debt?  What are the Revenue targets in this regard?</p></speech>

Obviously we have a target of 100% collection on everything, but that is not realistic.  There will always be an element of bad debt.  There is, however, an issue around the 100% accuracy of the LPT register.  The LPT register was built from scratch in 2012 and 2013.  From our analysis of the 3%, we are satisfied that approximately 1.5% represents duplicate properties or flaws in the register.  I imagine the committee has discussed Eircode.  Anyway, there is a problem with matching non-unique addresses in country areas, where there may be a townland and commonality of names.  For example, there could be Patrick Ryan and P.J. Ryan and they could refer to the same person.  There could be two addresses or we could have the address in twice.</p></speech>

The idea of putting officers on the highways and byways and counting the number of houses in townlands would not represent a sensible use of resources.  It is really interesting that the census data were published recently.  While the Central Statistics Office cannot by law give us details, it publishes a wealth of information on the distribution of houses and we map census data to our data.  We have some really interesting tools for geographic mapping.  We can look at areas, essentially at the desk, and see whether there are areas we need to target.</p> <p>  The LPT is designed in such a way that if we do not write to the property owner but the property owner is liable, he or she is still liable.  Ultimately, the liability remains a charge on the property.  It is a tax that is really hard to avoid.  It is probably a tax that will eventually have a 100% liability.</p></speech>

There have been three main policy changes.  Most overpayments are as a result of sick leave.  Sometimes people go on sick leave and then go above the threshold where pay gets reduced to half-pay or gets stopped.  During the downturn and the change in rules, the threshold for sick pay was reduced or halved from six months to three months.  More people hit the threshold following the sick leave policy change.</p> <p>  The other major change in the Civil Service has been the move to a shared service called PeoplePoint.  Whereas up until 2013 we had full control over our payroll, from 2013 we became part of the shared services operation provided by PeoplePoint.  It is acknowledged by those in PeoplePoint as well as all the constituent parties that the integration of the information technology systems that allows reporting of sick leave instances to PeoplePoint is improving but it is still not there.  Certainly, for the first year and a half there were difficulties.</p><p> There is an active campaign to tackle the overpayments and enter into payment arrangements.  In the past two years, while the amount has increased, the actual rate of increase has gone down significantly.  We are now in a situation where we have PeoplePoint and a shared services payroll function as well as ourselves.  We need to continue to build up the integrated IT system.  I think this will be a feature of the appropriation accounts for all offices.  We are more than 6,000 people or approximately one sixth of the Civil Service.  The Office of the Revenue Commissioners, the Department of Social Protection and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine are the largest organisations.  Therefore, because of our size and scale, there is a concentrated attempt on the part of PeoplePoint, which does not come under the auspices of ourselves, our central HR and all our managers to try to prevent the overpayments arising in the first place.  We have also set up a proactive team to manage overpayments.  In certain cases, the overpayments are particularly sensitive in that they mainly concern sick leave.  We have to have a sensitive approach.  It is a bit like what Deputy Cassells spoke about earlier.  We have to agree an instalment arrangement or a deduction over time.</p></speech>

Roughly one third, and for the past few years it has been as high as 40%, of those audited have been found to have underpaid their tax and owe on average of &euro;18,500 in unpaid tax.  In terms of the audit gap, the loss in a tax year as a result of non-compliance was put at about 2% of total liability by the Comptroller and Auditor General in his report.  Mr. Cody said that his office does not produce estimates of the gap.  Has his office drawn up a plan to implement its undertaking to review the role of the audit gap measurement and its impact on the office's random audit programme?</p></speech>

There was an initial discussion at board level on the review of the random audit programme.  The random audit programme has been in place for a long number of years.  It has run at approximately 400 cases per year, with cases selected randomly in the same way.  This allows us to identify a trend over time.  As a result of the changes we are making to our overall risk-based approach to interventions, now is an opportune time to review how we do it.  A paper has been submitted to the board and we have asked for further work to be done.  Obviously, before we sign off on any changes, we will discuss them with the Office of the Comptroller and Auditor General to ensure that we do not have a row in three years time when taxpayer compliance is reviewed and it says it would never have agreed to the changes.</p> <p>  Some of the work we are doing in the office concerns segmentation of our case base.  The random audit programme is taken out of the 850,000 chargeable persons and companies that are self-assessment cases.  However, there is a huge variety of self-assessment cases and the bottom end of the self-assessment register are those who are more akin to PAYE workers.  For instance, they might have a foreign pension.  They would be PAYE taxpayers if we had anyone to collect it from.  We need to segment it.</p> <p>  I have examined some of the approaches.  For example, HMRC in the neighbouring jurisdiction carries out 4,000 audits for its random audit programme but it takes three different sectors - sole traders, companies and SMEs - and leaves all the large cases out of the programme.  We are interested in examining the random audit programme.</p> <p>  A couple of matters arise when this review takes place every few years.  We always counsel against relying on the average yield.  The average yield was hugely distorted by one case.  A total of 79.9% of the cases have a yield of less than &euro;2,000 and 1% of the cases had a yield in excess of &euro;50,000.  One can get a very false-----</p></speech>

Our colleagues in the Danish revenue authority, which has focused very much on tax gap analysis and audit gap analysis, carried out 10,000 random audits.  They practically stopped their risk-based audits in one year in three to try to assess it.  We are not convinced that is the best use of what are scarce resources.  It is also a huge burden and cost on business.  We think the random audit programme provides a useful measure but are yet to be convinced that Ireland and Revenue, moving to full tax-gap, outcome-based measurement, will add to the work we do.  There are also a number of other examples.  The European Commission does a VAT gap analysis across the 27 member states although there are a couple of countries that have not been able to provide statistics.  Other measures are available.</p></speech>

As Mr. Cody has stated, these are mostly small businesses which would, according to the figures, owe an average of &euro;18,000 and, in many cases, it is less than &euro;2,000.  I am sure these people would be interested in hearing about compliance or, indeed, non-compliance by larger companies.  Will Mr. Cody speak to that for a moment?</p> <p>  The one that captivated people's imaginations was the recent EU ruling in respect of Apple.  We have heard plenty since then from the company and the EU Commissioner as well as many other commentators.  Politicians here debated it in a special sitting of the D&aacute;il as well.  What is Mr. Cody's assessment of the ruling?  Does he believe it is correct?  I am sure plenty of those small businesses would be interested to hear his analysis of what has been said by the Commission and in our Parliament?  Also, what are the next steps for Revenue in terms of engaging with Apple and where the process goes, as has been explained to us, in terms of acquiring that money and the establishment of a fund?</p></speech>

We are bound by it.  Apple, just like any other taxpayer, is afforded that confidence.  Also, the issue is now subject to legal proceedings.  I am, therefore, a bit constrained in what I can say.  Having said that, I want to be as helpful to the committee as possible.  I also want to take the opportunity to set out Revenue's view of the issue.</p> <p>  On the day the Commission had its press conference and launched its decision, I issued a statement.  It is worthwhile repeating our initial remarks.  We co-operated fully with the Commission inquiry.  We provided all documentation and all explanations that were asked of us by the Commission.  The issue of international tax planning involving mismatches between different countries' tax rules is well known and is the subject of the OECD BEPS project.  Those mismatches go to the heart of what the case is about.</p> <p>  Revenue can only implement Irish tax law.  It cannot say that EU state aid rules apply directly.  It cannot say that someone is liable to tax if it is not in accordance with the relevant tax code in Ireland.</p><p>Under Irish tax law, non-resident companies are chargeable to Irish corporation tax only on the profits attributable to their Irish branches by references to the facts and circumstances.  The profits of non-resident companies that are not generated by their Irish branches, such as profits from technology, design and marketing generated outside Ireland, cannot be charged with Irish tax under Irish tax law.  I went on to say that while I could not comment otherwise on the specific facts of the case, I could confirm that there is no departure from the applicable Irish tax law by the Revenue Commissioners, there was no preference shown in applying that law and the full tax due was paid in accordance with the law.</p><p> In regard to the engagement and follow-up, the Commission has issued a decision.  Under state aid rules, the country is obliged to implement and collect the state aid regardless of the appeal.  The appeal will take its course and the European Court of Justice will eventually give a view.  There is a four-month period from the date of the decision to the collection of the state aid.  That runs to 2 January.  Our responsibility is to calculate the actual liability.  The decision has not been published and it does not contain a figure.  At the press conference, the Commissioner mentioned a figure but the decision was not with her.  The responsibility is on us to calculate what that would be.  That process has started.</p></speech>

On that basis, is it a red herring from the Commission that there is a pot of money due to the people of the State?  It is being used in a political context as a pot of money that could be used for expenditure on a range of items.  As the tax collecting body of the State, the Revenue Commissioners have been very definitive in saying there was full compliance with Irish tax law.</p></speech>

It is saying there was state aid; essentially, that there was an interaction of the tax code, opinion and treaties resulting in state aid.  That is the job of the Commission's competition authority.  It is entitled to carry out the investigation and form its view.  We do not agree with the view but because of EU rules, regardless of whether we are appealing it, we must agree to collect the amount and put this back to the position that would have existed if there was not state aid, according to the Commission.  That process has started.</p> <p>  The Minister has indicated the amount will be held in escrow.  That is a matter that is still to be finalised and agreed, along with the process of how it is collected.  The way corporation tax works, the easiest element is to take the figure of the profits that were not taxed in Ireland and multiply them by 12.5%.  That gives a figure.  There are other compensating amounts and claims, and as the Commission noted in its decision, depending on what other countries do, that amount might change.  The process has started and although good progress has been made, I do not know what will be the final figure.  We can rest assured that the figure will be collected, depending on what the process for the collection will be.  Ultimately, it will depend on whether it is a tax assessment or another amount.</p></speech>

I was appointed to the board of the Revenue Commissioners on 1 February 2012.  We had the EU Presidency for the first half of 2013 and until March 2013, international tax was a subject for tax journals and occasional business articles.  In March 2013, the environment changed.  We had an EU Presidency in which we wondered if we would have enough business to keep going.  The issues surround base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, took off, along with the European Commission efforts in this regard, and international tax has been the front page story since March 2013.  The public accounts committees here and in the UK have dealt with it and the finance committee here had a sub-committee examining international and corporation tax.  International tax, tax avoidance and international mismatches that allow multinationals to minimise their tax is a serious story.  Ireland is part of that but it is not the cause.</p> <p>  We have invested significant resources in people dealing with international tax.  We made a commitment at the start of the BEPS project to be fully involved.  For a small country with a small administration, we talk about resources that are to be dedicated to risk-based audit.  We are punching above our weight in solving the issue and it must be done on an international basis.  Other countries comment on what happens in Ireland but a detailed study of what they do may also show issues.  This is a competitive world and we, as the Revenue Commissioners, implement the tax Acts as they are.</p></speech>

The Comptroller and Auditor General report and the Revenue Commissioners have indicated there were clean-up costs of nearly &euro;7 million.  I know the strain this puts on the State and local authorities.  At one stage, there were 539 cases in Louth and 459 cases in Monaghan.  The Revenue Commissioners have spoken of efforts to crack down on fuel laundering and they have clearly been successful, as in Louth the case numbers have dropped from 239 to 69 and from 186 to 11 in Monaghan.</p> <p>  In liaising with agencies such as the Garda, are the Revenue Commissioners getting to the point of negating the problem?  Is there a criminal aspect lying in the long grass?  I am sure there is regular contact between the Revenue Commissioners and the Garda because it is a cross-agency issue, both in terms of the loss of funds to the Exchequer and the damage being done to small businesses, people's automobiles and, ultimately, the environment.  I know in very scenic parts of County Louth and County Monaghan the criminal underworld involved with this activity has no regard for the communities they devastate from an environmental perspective.  Will the witness address this and how the Revenue Commissioners liaise with the Garda?  Is there a tangible analysis done so there can be a real crackdown on the criminal element?</p></speech>

They move from fuel laundering into tobacco.  There was a recent discovery of a giant operation between ourselves, the PSNI, HMRC and the Garda in which designer fuel was tracked to the port.  Designer fuel is where one uses different lubricants to essentially dilute ordinary diesel.  The activity is not as profitable as fuel laundering but it shows that the people involved are looking at we have done and for business opportunities.</p><p> I would say any Deputy from the northern half of the country will have had representations from people involved in solid fuel about cross-Border solid fuel from North to South - there is a big differential because of the carbon levy on solid fuel - and that also is organised gangs.  We have had carousel fraud.  Ultimately, with the Border and the differential and now with sterling the way it is, opportunities will be taken.  We decided that tobacco smuggling, because of the quantities and how one can smuggle it in different ways, is very difficult to eliminate.  Fuel laundering is different.  It is big, bulk quantities, it all has to be brought in ships and tankers and moved about.  We decided that we would actually defeat fuel laundering.  Last week, a fuel laundry was found in sight of but north of the Border.  The sludge that has been found this year has had traces of red diesel, which is laundered Northern Ireland fuel.  The North uses a red marker and we use a green marker.  Fuel laundering is not eliminated on the island but we are very satisfied that we have practically eliminated it on this side of the Border.  The only thing is that if it is laundered in the North it can be sold in the South, so we have to keep testing it.</p><p> The last time I was here, the Comptroller and Auditor General and myself talked about how they had started to work on the fuel laundering.  What he was interested in was doing a random sampling with the analysers to give that view of tax gap analysis.  Most of the work we do is risk-based.  Where it is risk-based we hope to get results.  With a random sampling we were hoping not to get results.  It was statistically sound.  The sample was picked by our statisticians, who have no involvement in the control.  It was very positive and we will continue that exercise on an annual basis.  There is no doubt that the people who were involved in organised excise fraud have not stopped doing something.  We are very interested in looking at-----</p></speech>

The UK has suffered significantly.  Now it is a different issue because the white van trade from Calais to Dover is much easier than from Calais to Rosslare or wherever.

Obviously there was a high level of co-operation with designing the new fuel marker.  The measure has assisted, eliminated or reduced a significant issue that has been damaging in a whole lot of different ways.</p> <p>  In terms of that level of co-operation, we are moving into a different era in which the customs and excise element will be a significant issue for Revenue.  Mr. Cody mentioned Revenue&rsquo;s 6,000 staff.  I presume there is a degree of planning going on at present.  I presume the likes of fuel laundering and other things that will crop up will be used to make money by sources that would not be acting legally.  I ask Mr. Cody to tell us what Revenue does to keep up to speed with an evolving situation and whether its resources are adequate to cope.  Does Revenue look at worst-case and best-case scenarios?  What is Revenue&rsquo;s approach?  </p></speech>

In a way, excise and VAT all flow from customs when it involves third-country imports and exports.  The issue is confused because it depends on the actual model that is taken.  There are various different models and we are looking at the contingency.  There is the Norway agreement, which has a level of cross-border checking between Norway and Sweden even though they are part of the Single Market.  There is a Turkey arrangement that has Turkey as part of the customs union for the EU but it all involves a level of customs declarations, not tariffs, so there is a process.  We have done scoping of the implications.  One can compare the present with the time before the Single Market in 1993 or before we joined the EU in 1973 and 99.9% customs control of the legitimate trade is handled electronically.  It is all based on a risk-based approach to flagging goods for physical presentation.  We have done an analysis of our IT systems to be able to cope with the scale if customs procedures will be required between the UK and the Republic.  </p> <p>  The issue is that the level of imports and exports from non-EU third countries will double when the UK leave.  That is the scale.  The values will double.  The numbers will probably be something in the region of five times that because there are far more small importers and exporters.  For years they have not even considered themselves as being importers and exporters so there are significant implications.  Just to scale up our IT systems for customs procedures would probably cost something in the region of &euro;3 million.  </p> <p>  In the budget on Tuesday, the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform mentioned in his Brexit chapter that additional resources are being provided to us for planning around Brexit.  What happened in this year&rsquo;s budget is that we looked for an indicative number of something in the region of an additional 40 resources.   Thanks to the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform, we got that approved but we will not be bringing them in now because it depends on what happens in March.  By the end of next year we would expect to have additional resources.</p> <p>  We had started a process of reorganising our customs policy division.  The division, for about the past 15 years, has been based in Nenagh as part of the overall decentralisation process.  Last year, we had decided to pull back some of it to Dublin because the problem about having a customs policy area in the middle of the country is that the people who work in the ports are not easily moved in and one does not keep refreshing with practical operational things.</p><p>It is like we must have known something was coming, but we did not.  We have started that process.  We are looking at how to facilitate legitimate trade because first we must concentrate on how to let legitimate trade work.  There are significant problems.  Deputy Cassells mentioned the cross-Border movement in the agricultural sector.  This is an all island market and theoretically there are customs procedures.  If we look at the supply chain of any of the big multiples, it is just a stock control system for them at present, but theoretically there are potentially imports and exports post-Brexit.</p><p> We are putting a lot of thought into it.  Obviously we cannot negotiate agreements with HM Revenue &amp;amp; Customs, HMRC, but we have excellent relationships with it.  We have bilateral meetings at board level on an 18 month basis and we have ongoing bilaterals on practical issues.  We hope that whatever the outcome, legitimate trade will be facilitated as much as possible.</p></speech>

I am concerned about a number of issues from this point of view.  Who informs or questions Brussels?  Is there any role for Revenue when it is asked to adjudicate on something, as was the case in 1991 and 2007?  We are not isolated, we obviously exist in the European Union, and there is a connection between the two things.  Is there a role for asking whether the state aid rules have been checked?  If we do not do this, we can hardly complain afterwards.</p> <p>  Part of the reason it landed on our doorstep is because the companies facilitating this and domiciled here did not have a headquarters or staff.  Is there an issue regarding examining the number of companies?  It is easy enough to set up a company.  Is there an issue with companies?  Does Revenue keep records of large companies which are only brass plate?  Obviously this is how it is facilitated.</p></speech>

The two companies have significant Irish activities in Cork.  We have taxed the companies and they have paid Irish tax in respect of the branch profits in Ireland.  The use of Irish registered non-resident companies has been a feature of tax planning by multinationals.  Irish law and changes in tax law usually involve a budget announcement where state aid approval must be given, so there is a process around changes to Irish law being subject to state aid.  The Commission regularly reviews our legislation to see whether it is in accordance with state aid rules.</p> <p>  There is no doubt the motivation for the investigation was the Senate hearings in the US.  The issue around the tax paid by multinationals which have an Irish registered non-resident area has been well known for a long time.  The US equivalent of the CSO published data on the effective rate of US-controlled Irish registered non-resident companies and it features in the review of the effective tax rates the Department of Finance published in 2014.</p> <p>  Clearly, over recent years, with the base erosion and profit shifting, BEPS, project, the use of these types of procedures is clearly not acceptable.  The Minister in recent budgets has moved to close down the opportunity for stateless companies and then to rule out the opportunity for the double Irish process.  Anybody who has-----</p></speech>

How would a Department know that, for example, a company was seeking a ruling from Revenue on the scenario we saw?  Who would consider the other side of it?  Does Revenue have any role in considering the other side or even suggesting the other side should be looked at?</p></speech>

It is not a negotiation of special arrangements.  It is applying the Irish tax code to the facts and circumstances of a case.  A company is entitled to look for a ruling, we call it an opinion, on complex issues.  We have published guidelines since 2002 on how to get a ruling.</p><p>We revised them in 2014 for cases dealt with by our large cases division.  Under the ruling, the company puts to us a basis of calculating its liability, having regard to the tax code and what the company does.  It is about how the company calculates the profits for its branch in the case of an Irish branch of a multinational company.  We engage with the advisers and the company and agree a process for calculating the profits, having regard to that activity.  We would not, nor would anybody, have the idea of asking whether there is a state aid issue.  The authority to determine whether there is state aid is the European Commission Directorate General for Competition.  It may examine our legislation on occasion and we receive requests from it to review or provide information on a specific section of the Act as to whether it meets state aid rules.  We engage in this.  In some cases, it goes on to a legal challenge, in others, when we explain what the system does, that is the end of it.  In the original opening statement by the Commission, it stated that, regardless of whether there was an opinion or a ruling, if the law were applied in the way it was applied, it could still be state aid.</p></speech>

There are obvious examples such as tobacco.  No revenue is paid on some of the cigarettes that are imported, some of which are even more dangerous than regular cigarettes.  At the top level, would Revenue look at it from the point of view of aggressive tax planning?  Is that where Revenue will bring in the bigger return?  Will Revenue look at it from the point of view of where it will get the biggest return?  While section 110 is used legally, I do not believe anyone considers use of the provision by non-charitable entities to be legitimate.  Revenue needs something to measure tax foregone, and it is an obvious gap.  Will Revenue examine such areas, where it is likely to pick up on big, aggressive tax planning schemes in real time or nearly in real time?  It is difficult to see how it is possible to get to grips with the big audit houses, which open a new loophole on the day another is closed up.  What methodology will Revenue use?  Will it be small-medium, quick wins or particular sectors?</p></speech>

We can provide the committee with summary data on the type of tax planning schemes we have come across.  Tax planning is tackled in a number of ways.  We need to identify the schemes and have the legislation.  Sometimes, legislative change is the only solution.  Ultimately, we have our general anti-avoidance provision, originally section 811 of the Taxes Consolidation Act 1997.  Ireland was one of the first countries to have a general anti-avoidance provision.  The UK has only recently introduced one.  As part of the BEPS and EU approach, there is a need for a general anti-avoidance provision.  The Deputy is right.  When the law is changed, unintended consequences flow from the changes.  Artificial losses are created and there is tax arbitrage between capital and income, to use the reduced rate that applies to capital taxes.  All this process is on an ongoing basis.</p> <p>  The challenge in anti-avoidance is that the people involved are very well resourced.  We are challenged.  During recent years, the first challenge is not an appeal but a judicial review.  Judicial review is the first port of call.  Earlier this year, the Supreme Court found in our favour in a judicial review process of a significant tax planning scheme involving high-worth individuals, most of whom had sold significant businesses.  The result of two to three years through the court process is we now are in a position where the appeal of the tax issue is only starting, and it could, potentially, go through the appeal process to the High Court, the Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court.  It is a difficult and long-standing area.  In the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, it is highlighted that some of the medical consultants' cases took more than four years to finalise.  Those were the early cases.  We had to get senior counsel advice.</p> <p>  Tax avoidance happens very much, in some ways, in the open.  It has significant legal documentation.  Tax evasion happens in the undergrowth.  It is a significant job to challenge it.  The Deputy's comments on the tax gap analysis are probably closer to our own than the recommendations about overall tax gap analysis.  We are interested in focusing on segments where we can, hopefully, find not only what the gap is but where it is.  While we did not do a tax gap analysis with oils, we did the opposite and looked back at it.  We are trying to fine cases and, to use a verb that only we use, we try to operationalise the results.  We did it with tobacco.  We try to fine people.</p></speech>

He accepts all the recommendations of the Comptroller and Auditor General except two which were only part agreed.  I welcome that he has come in, put his hands up and agrees with the recommendations.  That is a very good start.  Mr. Cody should correct me if I am wrong but the only two items he disagrees with is the concept of the audit gap and the tax gap.  He partly agrees with those.  To clarify that I understand what the audit gap is, it is the possible difference between registered taxpayers that are audited and those who are not audited.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

Last year we recruited 407 staff.  This year to date we have recruited 467, including the additional resources.  This year we will recruit over 500 staff.  Next year, we will recruit over 500, including the additional resources.  The issue we have is the capacity to take people in and train and develop them.  The organisation is working flat out to regrow itself.  There has been an embargo on recruitment for a considerable number of years.  A number of years ago, 50% of staff in the organisation were over 50 years of age; it is now 47%.  A significant proportion of staff have over 35 years' service.  In three years, there will be over 1,000 people who have less than three years in an organisation of 6,000 people.</p></speech>

From 1982 to 2002, there were really small numbers recruited.  All the people who are between 50 and 60 are not lifetime civil servants because now recruitment happens at all ages and levels of experience.  We have 2,000 over 55 and we have another 1,100 or 1,200 over 50.

The other thing I wanted was additional resources for information technology because the key to the success of our organisation, as we see it, is our ICT system.  We get visits from revenue authorities from very advanced countries and they cannot believe how joined up our ICT systems are.</p></speech>

I hope the Chairman is a little bit generous with me because he has come in quite helpfully during my time.  I will run through a few things on IT and then I will come back to Apple.  On the excise duty, it says here it is currently not incorporated into Revenue's mainstream IT system.  Mr. Cody has acknowledged that and has acknowledged that there will be audit training.  What is the timeframe for the review of the procedures that have been promised?  A number of anomalies were pointed out and only one of them came to light - perhaps it was more than one - through the Comptroller and Auditor General's report.  Mr. Cody is nodding and I appreciate that he accepts that.  What is the timeframe to review that?</p><p>Mr. Cody dealt with the question on overpayments from Deputy Cassells.  What is the strategy and timeframe to deal with them?  He said sick pay was the issue.</p><p> Some items relate to the seizure of goods and the exchange of financial information.  A total of 28 criminal convictions have been obtained for serious tax issues.  Was any money paid as a result of those convictions or did we lose out?  The next section is on convictions with fines.  It states that the first exchange of financial account information between Ireland and the US took place in September 2015.  What was the nature of this financial account information?  What was its purpose and what did we learn from it?</p><p> Does Revenue anticipate that, with the price of cigarettes going up, there will be more illicit activity?  Is there a way of valuing the loss to Revenue?  There were 2,722 detentions of counterfeit goods with an estimated value of &euro;5.45 million.  What is the context of that?  What percentage of the total figure for legal goods does this represent?</p></speech>

Excise has traditionally been a stream within Revenue.  It has been very tightly controlled and a lot of money is collected from a small number of traders very high up the supply chain, which is its great advantage.  We launched a process of integrating the excise suite into our IT general systems, to take place in the next three or four years.</p></speech>

There is a detailed plan and we have started with oils.  In 2013, before we started integrating, we put in place the supply chain system, which was a first and which gives us a monthly report of oil movements from traders.  We have several systems for turning up anomalies.  We introduced new IT systems to monitor and control the process but we are a big, diverse organisation and our senior people know an awful lot about stuff.  One of the disadvantages is that it takes time to get them to work in a different way.  They think they know how to do it so it takes a bit of time and this touches on the need to improve communications within districts, a point on which the Comptroller and Auditor General picked up.  The revised guidelines will issue before the end of the year.  Oil has gone into our integrated tax system, ITP, and the next project is alcohol.</p></speech>

The board is developing its IT systems, like ourselves, and is carrying out a root cause analysis of specific elements of its overpayments.  It is developing a strategy to tackle each of them.  Staff in Revenue give out about PeoplePoint because we had a highly developed system and they see it as worse than what we had but there is a concentrated attempt by PeoplePoint and the services board to improve the system.  The reality is that the system was rolled out before the IT system was fully developed.  The plan is in train, however, and I am very confident that it will bring about a significant reduction in overpayments.  I hope to get back to the levels we were at before we were in PeoplePoint.</p></speech>

The figure for 2015 was 11% but it has stayed between 11% and 12% for the past few years.  There is a constant battle between ourselves and the UK to have the highest-priced cigarettes and with the way sterling has gone we are probably first again.  The projected figures in the past couple of years, when there was a 50 cent increase, were met and we are confident that the forecast of a &euro;65 million increase, arising from the rise in tobacco duty in this budget, is robust.  Obviously, the incentive to smuggle is increased and in 2007 and 2008, when I had responsibility for policy in indirect taxes, we would have been more comfortable with 20 cent or 30 cent increases.  That was 20 cent or 30 cent out of &euro;7 or &euro;8, however, whereas now it is 50 cent out of &euro;10 or &euro;11.  In other words, 50 cent is starting to become the new 20 cent.  There are health considerations too, of course.</p></speech>

Deputy Catherine Murphy has also asked about this and I understand Mr. Cody's explanation.  Even if I do not accept it, it is a rational explanation.  Did Revenue have any role in going back to Government to highlight what it saw on the ground with this company, or any other company, in relation to its head office, the lack of premises or the lack of employees?  Apple is not the only company that avails of these procedures.

This is a matter of public record because it has appeared in the newspapers as a result of requests under freedom of information, where Revenue was identifying issues in relation to section 110 and the use in the context of Irish property.  Deputy Catherine Murphy mentioned earlier about real time.  "Real time" in the context of business taxes for Revenue is at least 18 months after the event because of the way returns are filed and accounts are prepared.  We started raising the issue when we saw evidence of Irish property in section 110 vehicles.  We first had to do an analysis on it.  Obviously Deputies and journalists have raised the issue as well.  The Minister has now published draft legislation and has undertaken to bring forward further amendments in the Bill as published.</p> <p>  The use of charities in the context of section 110 is not about tax at all.  It is about the use of a trust.  The only type of trust available in Irish law is a charitable trust.  The issue is, I understand, subject to inquiry by the charities regulator.

I was going to finish with Apple, but I will start with it, given that it follows logically from the previous speaker.</p> <p>  Much has been said about this in recent weeks and months.  The Government has stated its position.  Revenue has stated its position and Apple has stated its position, but there seems to be a difference of language when Apple is talking in public and in the statement it made on RTE and on national radio and television stations and what it said at the US Senate hearing a number of years ago.  I wish to clarify what Mr. Tim Cook said when he was before the Senate hearing giving sworn evidence.  There is a difference between what they say when they give sworn evidence and what they say publicly when they are speaking to the media in Ireland.  Mr. Tim Cook said at the hearing that the Irish Government gave the company a tax incentive agreement.  He talked about a special arrangement.  When the head of tax of Apple was pressed about what that meant, he said that they had negotiated a tax rate which meant that their tax was calculated at less than 2%.  Was Tim Cook wrong when he said that he and his company had negotiated a tax incentive agreement with the Irish Government and was his head of tax wrong at that hearing when he said that negotiation meant that the company could calculate its taxes at less than 2%?</p></speech>

This is a very high powered committee in the US.  It is illegal to give false testimony to the US Senate.  If we have the head of Revenue, or somebody in Revenue who is in a senior position in this State, who is saying that Tim Cook gave false information under oath, or gave incorrect information or maybe his interpretation of what he said, but he gave wrong information to a Senate hearing, that is very serious.  It was not just Mr. Cook who gave this information, it was also the head of tax in Apple, who went further and said that this arrangement meant that the company could calculate tax at 2%.  Apple was under pressure at that hearing and the representatives said what they said  I think it is very serious when Mr. Cody says, and he may be correct, that the information was incorrect.  I think that is serious for Apple as a company.  It raises more questions on this issue.

This means that 4.1% of companies or individuals that were audited were found to have a tax liability outstanding of between &euro;20,000 and &euro;50,000 and a further 3% had liabilities of over &euro;50,000.

I merely want to establish the facts first.</p> <p>  Obviously, that is of concern because this is merely the sample.  It goes back to what was stated earlier by an Teachta Connolly on what is the tax gap.

What we do not have is any sense of how much unpaid taxes there are year on year because of underpayment but we can say with certainty that it is a sizable amount.  It is crucial to taxpayers and policymakers.  We just had a budget in which we had difficult decisions to make in respect of investment, tax, etc.  We at least expect that taxes due should be paid.  Why is it so difficult to calculate or even have some estimation of the total lost revenue or tax gap?  Why is that one of the recommendations that is only part agreed?  Is it because Revenue - this is for Mr. Cody - believes that there is no real value in having that data or putting the resources into it, is it that it would just take a lot of resources to calculate the figure or is it that it is complex to do it?

Tax gap analysis is arrived at in a number of ways.  Sometimes it is taken from the top down, one uses the Central Statistics Office's GNP figures and national accounts figures and then one works out a theoretical gap.  However, the reality is that tax evasion and the shadow economy are, by their nature, hidden and the figure is always an estimate.</p> <p>  The country that has gone furthest down the road of tax gap analysis is the UK.  The authorities there do it annually and it is their major measure of the success of the organisation.  What happens every year is that HMRC arrives at a tax gap analysis which is subsequently amended by national accounts figures.  One has an agreed tax gap for 2013, in 2014, that is changed and in 2015 it is changed, depending on what happens with national statistics.</p> <p>  Some of the issues around identifying the top-down approach is that there is an estimated figure put into the national accounts for the shadow economy and then one works out the shadow economy based on an estimate that has gone in to the overall figures.  Sometimes you are actually chasing your tail.</p></speech>

We have taken a sample of people who are registered for tax.  We can see that there was a non-compliance rate of 35%.  Surely there would be value in knowing - in circumstances where there was full compliance - what would be the lost revenue, especially when we, as politicians, have to make tough decisions on behalf of taxpayers.</p></speech>

As it is designed, it is not big enough to get a proper view of the audit gap.</p> <p>  While there is a consistent figure of 35%, it is important that 80% of cases had a yield less than &euro;2,000.  The yields and underpayments in tax arise from a lot of reasons.  Some of them are interpretation.  Some of them are just pure error and mistake.  We have classification of a technical error, innocent error, carelessness, carelessness with significant consequences and deliberate default.</p></speech>

If we, as a revenue authority, have managed to get 98% through the self-assessment system, that, to me, is nearly better - I was going to say the random audit programme is perfect and we will take that audit gap of 2%.  If it is right, one would suggest that if one applies our risk-based audit programme - in which we collect significantly higher averages and a significantly higher hit rate - to the audit gap, we at least collect half of it every year through our risk-based system.</p> <p>  Looking at the figures, I suppose that if we manage to carry out more risk-based audits, at some stage we might actually collect more through the risk-based programme than the audit gap displays from the random programme.  Then we will have managed to collect over 100% of the tax due.  I do not know where that will leave us because that is the possibility.</p></speech>

The targeted audits are looking at multiple years and relating collections for multiple years to the tax forgone in an individual year is probably a complication there.</p><p>We have, in a number of reports over the years, championed the importance of the random audits to try to give us some sort of a fix on what is the level of tax foregone in an individual year.  Essentially, it is useful to Revenue to be able to say the level of activity we have targeted is capable of being expanded and of yielding more revenue.  To me, it is a useful technique, a useful tool and a useful estimate.  It is valuable over time to see that if there is a deterioration, if it goes to 3% or 4% as it might do, at least we could then signal that more effort is needed on targeted-----</p></speech>

There are about 850 between individuals and companies.  It is purely random.  It does not include PAYE cases and I believe that is one of the flaws.  Earlier, I outlined that because of how self-assessment works, there are a lot of non-trading people in the self-assessment system who are not really businesses at all.  What we are really interested in doing is segmenting our case base to establish the traders who have trading activity and we could get a more sophisticated random audit programme.  We are doing a lot of work on this.  It is actually partly why we agreed to undertake the work on improving the audit gap.  Improving the audit gap and the random audit programme is achievable.  With the tax gap we would much prefer sectoral approaches and focusing on things such as oil and tobacco where, because they are excisable goods, they are properly controlled at the very top of the chain and one can ask where are there linkages.</p></speech>

I will turn to section 38 and section 39 organisations and charities and their compliance with Revenue.  There has been some discussion on this matter because there have been a number of HSE audits, which have not been good.  I will not go into any of the details of the organisations or name them but I tabled a parliamentary question to capture exactly how many Revenue interventions there may have been with charities.  For the years 2007-16, Revenue conducted almost 7,500 debt management interventions and in excess of 1,600 compliance interventions with regard to charities.  That seems like a very high figure to me.  It is 177 compliance interventions every year since 2007.  The reply explains the exemptions in place for charities.  From internal audits we have seen there were issues regarding salary payments that were not taxed or subject to payroll taxes or that untaxed salary payments were made to employees who were working for some organisations to other organisations.  There were all sorts of issues.  Is Mr. Cody concerned about that and would he see the intervention figures for that period - of 7,500 for debt management and 1,600 for compliance - as high?</p></speech>

Most of the debt management issues in charities relate to PAYE.  With regard to debt management intervention, if a charity is late in its payment, it is driven by the non-compliance that takes place.  It is a feature of charities that when they start getting into financial difficulty for whatever reason, PAYE seems to be one of the early triggers.  That applies to most of the charity-----</p></speech>

Like every other sector, we make risk-based interventions having regard to risk that arises.  We have a charity section which monitors and controls on an ongoing basis.  We also engage with the Charities Regulator.  With the nature of its business, there is not significant tax risk in the charity sector.  Charities' incomes are not liable to income tax or corporation tax.  They may have some VAT liabilities but generally it does not apply.  The big issue is the payroll.  Obviously, there are rules around employees and directorships and that is an area to which we pay close attention.</p> <p>  An interesting item from the budget speech that has not yet received any coverage  - and this is relevant to PAYE, charities and all businesses - was the Minister's announcement of our engagement in a consultation process about the modernisation of the PAYE system and a move to real time.  We have launched that.  It was published on our website on Tuesday and we are going to engage with payroll businesses.  The key issue there is it will give employees control over their tax affairs.  Currently, no employees, be they charity employees, public servants or private sector business employees have control over their own tax details through the year.  They are fully dependent on the employers and the end-of-year process.  In a way, if a business is running into difficulty, the employees often are the last to know.  They do not know the real-time situation, as it is not there to see.  From this committee's point of view, and in improving the overall compliance, I believe that PAYE modernisation events over the next couple of years are very important.</p></speech>

There are certainly some but all our engagement to date suggests that drink is not as significant a problem as it is in the United Kingdom.  One of the ways we always will know if there is a serious issue is the legitimate trade will be very quick to complain.  The legitimate trade complained significantly around fuel and has complained constantly about the cigarettes.  I believe some of the complaints on cigarettes are to try to prevent excise increases happening but there has not been that same level from the alcohol sector, but no doubt there are some.</p></speech>

For example, this week we seized 999,000 cigarettes in three operations.  Some 900,000 were in a container in Dublin Port, 40,000 were in a seizure in Castletownbere and the balance was seized at Dublin Airport.  Generally, we do pick up things in markets, streets and city centres but they always are in small quantities because nobody is going to have big quantities of cigarettes there.</p><p>In regard to alcohol, we carry out test purchases in bars, which is not a secret.

In the case of people who are paying tax that was previously underpaid, a complaint I often get relates to the interest that is charged.  These people are caught for whatever amount but the interest doubles or triples it.  How does Revenue assess the interest owing, which is sometimes very severe?

The Taxes Act provides for an 8% rate for income tax and corporation tax and a 10% rate for PAYE and VAT underpayments.  It is an annual charge.  The Deputy is right that if the debt is owing for a number of years, the interest rate adds up very quickly.  In some of our back duty investigations, there would be interest owing equivalent to 100% of the underpaid tax.  That is provided for in legislation and is not something we calculate individually.  It comes down to the idea of taxpayers making a declaration and coming forward earlier rather than later.</p></speech>

We are not a bank.  If we had an interest rate that was less than an overdraft rate, why would people go to the bank to get a loan when they could choose instead not to pay their taxes?  This issue has been the subject of discussions with tax advisers for years, with the argument being made that the interest rate is too high given the ECB rate is now practically nil.  However, one would not get an overdraft at 8% if one had outstanding taxes to be paid.  A case that was brought to court some years ago saw the matter of our interest rate challenged.  The judge asked why there was all this talk of the ECB rate and pointed to the credit card rates of more than 20% at that time.  The interest rate has to be set at a level that makes sure there is no incentive for people not to pay tax.</p></speech>

There are many ways of measuring effective tax rates and no agreed method.  A report published by the Department of Finance in 2014 found the effective tax rate in Ireland for corporation tax is 10.1%.

There is no doubt that there are errors and mistakes.  There are companies that are not paying the full amount.  It is probable that some companies pay too much as a result of errors.  That is what our compliance programmes and our risk-based programmes are about.  We use all our analytics and datasets to monitor and control that process.

I wish to touch upon the risk-based audit success - or relative success - that Revenue had, particularly with regard to the random audit programme.  The report identified a 39% rate of non-compliance, with the random nature of the programme, as far as I understand it, yielding approximately &euro;18,000 per case.  Given that the Government is investing an additional &euro;50 million in Revenue for the purpose of bolstering that particular programme, from a policy side in terms of implementation, would there be an enlarged revenue gain for the State on the basis of further investment?  Is there a case to look at the self-assessment process, given such a relatively high level of non-compliance?  It must be said that 39% is a significant amount of non-compliance.  I do not want to be badgering the Revenue Commissioners, as I think it does an exceptionally good job, but at the same time, 39% is a very high level.  An average of &euro;18,000 of collected taxation on the basis of an audit is a significant figure.  Perhaps the witness would like to comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.305" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Niall Cody" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016101300002#S00400"><p>As I said earlier, 35% to 39% has been the rate of cases that have had an issue throughout probably the whole life of the random audit programme.  It has constantly stayed at around that level.  The issue around the average is essentially a presentational issue.  It is the average, but it is not the norm.  As I have said, 80% of the cases had a liability of less than &euro;2,000.  The outliers constituting less than 1% had a yield in excess of &euro;50,000.  The results of the random audit programme and the area in which the audit gap is really important is in how it tries to show what it is, which is that 2% figure.  It is important to note that among businesses - the self-assessed community - there is a very high level of voluntary compliance with the Irish tax system.  I think it is really important to think back to where it was before we had a self-assessment system, when we had bogus non-resident accounts and there were serious levels of unpaid tax.  Obviously, the committee and the Comptroller and Auditor General have to focus on areas in which there are errors, omissions and mistakes.  However, I think it is really important to acknowledge that Irish businesses' compliance levels are very strong.  It is important to recognise the important role played by tax practitioners and advisers.  In an earlier discussion, we spoke about tax planning and tax avoidance but the majority of taxpayers are just trying to get on with their business and pay the correct tax.  They would rather not see sight nor sound of us from one year to the next.</p> <p>  The random audit programme has an average.  A risk-based audit programme has a much higher average.  The risk-based audit programme has a yielding of 68% as opposed to 39%.  The average yield is &euro;52,000.  The average yield per yielding audit is &euro;75,000.  What we try to do and what the Comptroller and Auditor General recommends is that we carry out more risk-based audits.  To make the right intervention in the right case, with regard to the risk, is what we are keen on.  What I am really interested in doing over the next couple of years is carrying out more detailed investigations of serious evasion cases.  Less of them are done because they take time and are not sorted easily.  I agreed in part with the recommendation because I believe that we should do more intensive investigations, though they might be less in number, if that makes any sense.  It is about how many person hours, man hours or officer hours that we engage in detailed risk-based programmes.</p> <p>  That is why the other issue mentioned in the budget speech is around changes and proposals around offshore evasion that I hope are being introduced in the finance Bill next week.  The Minister announced in the budget that we were going to remove the opportunity for disclosure from 1 May for people who have engaged in serious tax evasion using offshore facilities.  What that will mean is a serious increase in the level of penalties as well as the introduction of a strict liability offence for people who have engaged in it.  The audit gap is useful.  We have committed to work with the Comptroller and Auditor General to improve it, but what we really want to do is make the intervention that is appropriate to the taxpayer's behaviour.  Because of our technology, our third-party reporting, what is coming down the tracks in the international exchange of financial information and what happens with things like the Panama papers, HSBC or LuxLeaks by which information comes into the public domain, the environment for serious tax evasion is going to get a lot chillier.  Those are the things that we have to balance.</p></speech>

It may well be in the report but I am afraid I have not been able to identify it.  Does the witness have a ballpark figure for that?  Does he have a figure for the number of man-hours used per case assessed?  What I am trying to get at is that if Revenue is identifying an average settlement of &euro;18,000, how much does it cost to get the &euro;18,000?</p></speech>

We do 400 audits.  The scale of some of the cases are very short because they are picked at random.  Obviously, the small number of yielding cases take time.  In the comprehensive review of expenditure that took place in 2014, we talked about how for every &euro;1 spent on an auditor, we would expect to bring in &euro;10.</p><p>It is a multiple of ten to one.  It becomes an opportunity cost if the auditor spends time doing cases with an average yield, even taking the average yield of 18 as opposed to an average yield of 72.  Across the board of our audit and risk management interventions we try to benchmark this.  The Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, does a lot of studies on benchmarking across tax authorities.  A year ago the audit had a slightly higher return than the risk management interventions.  For the first time, this year, the risk management interventions are slightly higher than the audit.  It is so affected by outliers and voluntary disclosure.  This is where the figures that are put into the budget around an additional 50 staff and the result of that come in.  It depends on their level of training but the great thing about what has happened over the past few years to get the facility to increase our numbers is that there are people who came in two years ago who are coming out fully trained now.  We will see the benefit of that next year and thereafter.</p></speech>

Two years ago we introduced the electronic form 12, which is absolutely brilliant and very simple.  We will take it that the system will come in as intended, although it has to go through the process in the Oireachtas.  For the years required to get the tax back the taxpayer will have to have form 12 completed.  We are building a system whereby the intending purchaser can give the mortgage company one-off online access to confirmation from us that he or she will be eligible for the refund.  That will carry forward.  It is also really important that we ensure that people who have, for example, health expenses, claim them and that is factored into the process and that it is final.  They will not have to do four years if they have paid enough tax in the previous two years to cover it.  It is for the years in question.  It is a very simplified form 12 and we see it as one of our best flagship developments.  It has taken off.  It is not compulsory but 89% of form 12s are filed electronically, although it has only been in place for two years.</p></speech>

There are green, orange and red routing.  Under green routing goods are cleared automatically and there is a whole set of rules behind the interface.  Orange routing requires a documentation check, the goods are not presented but the documentation needs to be examined.  The red routing is less than 1%.  In the case of red routing the goods have to be presented for clearance.  This would not be for example to do with items such as tobacco, this would be tariff-related goods coming from particular countries depending on what the EU customs rules are.  In the context of whatever happens in a post-Brexit environment, the challenge becomes really significant, if it is a full third country because the numbers are very different.</p></speech>

If there are customs procedures required it will impose costs on business, development costs.  There are procedures which obviously entail costs.  We are in a very electronic environment and we will be working closely to ensure that Irish business will still be able to benefit from whatever simplified procedures are in place.

No Irish law was broken because the Irish law was introduced.  Ultimately the Directorate-General for Competition would have been saying how the Irish law was structured was in breach of state aid rules.  It is the competent authority on state aid and is therefore entitled to investigate.  If it were not entitled to investigate, we would not have given it the information.  That does not mean that by investigating and reaching a finding it is right.  Others might say it, but I could not say it had no entitlement.  If it had no entitlement, we would have had no entitlement to give them-----</p></speech>

I think they are two different things in the context of the findings.  I wish to stress another matter.  It has been regurgitated many times since the press conference, but there are references to the findings as statements of fact, which they are not.  The Directorate-General is not a court and therefore does not get to make that determination.</p> <p>  I have a fundamental difficulty with the fact that the Revenue now has to go off and assess the tax liability under its findings.  If the economic activity did not occur within this jurisdiction, the Revenue Commissioners will not have any information on it other than the stated public accounts of a public limited company, that is, those of a multinational firm.  I am not being flippant about it, but are Revenue officials literally picking up the phone to Tim Cook and asking him for Apple's global accounts so that Revenue can make up a notional figure to comply with the request of the Commission?</p></speech>

That is where we are at.  Ireland has an obligation to follow it and we have remedies through the appeal process.  The company also has remedies through the appeal process.  From the outset, we have co-operated fully.  The company has co-operated fully in the context of the case as well, but the position is different now from what it was during the investigation.  The company now has its own standing and has appealed the decision as well.  As a regulator, people may not agree with what we do at times, but we do what we do and people can challenge us in the courts.  The Directorate-General for Competition is a regulator.  It works as it sees fit and the remedy is through the court process.  There is an issue, but it clearly is the competent authority in this area.  However, that does not mean it is right.   Further, it does make a decision.  It is a bit like us raising an assessment.  If an assessment we raise is not appealed, the assessment is due.  That does not make us a court of law.  However, if we raise an assessment and it is appealed, we cannot collect it until the appeal is settled.  That is as close as I can get to explaining where we are in the process.</p></speech>

One relates to a number of different issues, one of which is vehicle registration tax, VRT, and the diesel controversy surrounding Volkswagen, Audi and others.  I understand there are issues in terms of who has jurisdiction over this matter.  Indeed, this is occurring outside the State as well.  However, there have been findings in the US to suggest that on a technical basis the cheating software and-or hardware installed in certain vehicles - I will declare an interest because I have one of them - is also limiting or suppressing the NO2 levels that are recorded and assessed in the United States, for instance, but which are not recorded or assessed in Europe or this jurisdiction.  A US court has found that the effect of the software or hardware is that it is also suppressing CO2 emissions.  I am sure Mr. Cody is aware that the same allegation has been made in documents here in Ireland and in a case in Mayo.</p> <p>  If that is the case, there is an impact on the assessment on the vehicle from the VRT perspective and on the local authority system from the perspective of motor tax.  Are we examining this issue and are we assessing the technical side?  Are we in contact with Volkswagen and Audi Ireland?  Are we assessing whether the cheating software and hardware, where appropriate, has not broken any Irish law or EU regulation?  Does Mr. Cody agree that the finding and the cases that are pending and in the public domain will have a profoundly negative effect on the diesel market and will have implications for the Revenue Commissioners in the collection of tax and VAT and all the rest of it as detailed in the report?  Will Mr. Cody comment on that?</p></speech>

The same provisions on taxpayer confidentiality apply to the VRT affairs of a car distributor or importer.  I therefore do not want to speak about what we are doing or might be doing in a specific case.  However, we are closely monitoring the situation.  The major effect of the suppression software concerned NO2 emissions.  I mentioned earlier my role in indirect taxes in 2007 and 2008.  I was in charge of the VRT policy when it moved to being based on CO2 emissions.  I was speaking to the current head of it when the controversy arose.  At the time I was awake in the middle of the night trying to convert what it would mean if the CO2 emissions were understated and how it would be calculated having regard to the number of diesel sales.  We have carried out an analysis and, essentially, the impact on CO2 seems to be much smaller in respect of the banding.  It may well have implications.  We are not-----</p></speech>

The legislation is drafted on the basis of agreed CO2 emissions by approved testers.  There is a number of approved testers throughout the community and we follow that.

On page 162, paragraph 12.26 of the report, it states:</p><blockquote>Revenue does not estimate the loss to the Exchequer as a result of fuel laundering.  A report published in May 2016 estimated the loss to be &euro;239 million in 2015.</blockquote> <p>The report in question was produced by Grant Thornton.  Earlier today, Mr. Cody said the tax loss as a result of fuel laundering was not quantifiable.  We have gone through the difficulties arising in calculating this but it is not a satisfactory position from the point of view of the Committee of Public Accounts.  If it is not estimated and not quantifiable, we are not starting from a good place.  The report also mentions that clean-up costs were &euro;6.7 million so, aside from fuel laundering itself, it has knock-on costs.  The environment Department had to pick up the tab for that through local authorities.  Agriculture sells itself on the basis that it operates in a clean, green, environment so this is damaging to our agricultural process too.  Mr. Cody mentioned designer fuel.  Can he briefly touch on that?  It is another new concept. </p></speech>

Essentially, it is diesel stretching and we aware that it happens in eastern Europe.  The designer fuels come into the State under different customs entry codes.  We have come across some recent examples of it and, in conjunction with our colleagues from Northern Ireland, we have intercepted and seized vehicles and tankers in connection with such activity.  We have to monitor and control it but we are fairly satisfied that it is a test operation by people who were previously engaged in fuel laundering.</p></speech>

We cannot quantify the loss to the State but it causes environmental problems.  It causes damage to the good, clean name of our agricultural exports and to people's cars.  Why do we have this system at all?  I cannot understand why we have two separate systems and later I will come to the cost of following it.  It is a pointless system.  If we had had no additions to it we would not have had any of the problems which have been referred to.  The people in business, whether it is construction or farming, should be able to reclaim whatever they can.  I have never met a farmer who is afraid to fill out a form if there is money at the other end of it so nobody should suggest that people will not do it.</p></speech>

I agree that one could design a rebate scheme but the problem we would have is that an all-Ireland solution would be required.  If we moved to a rebated scheme we would end up with the worst of all possible worlds.  We would be making some level of fraudulent repayments.  Diesel would be washed in the North and brought here because it is just a matter of removing the dye.  The evidence we have seen since the new marker came in suggests that any sludge-----</p></speech>

People would be using diesel sourced in the North.  A fuel launderer would launder Northern diesel, bring it across the Border and sell it to hauliers and couriers as clean diesel, not rebated diesel.  It concerns us that if we are too successful compared to the North, people would source the rebated fuel in Northern Ireland, pay the 10 pence in excise duty there and sell it down here and we do not even get the excise on the marked fuel.  This question comes up regularly and I remember chatting with my predecessor a couple of years ago about it.  The system is very traditional and has been around forever and we could go to a rebate system with the technology that is available.  It would be very straightforward for a business to do, even if it would be more difficult for home heating oil.  There could be all sorts of improvements to fuel grants but the real challenge is that we would need to do it on both sides of the Border.</p></speech>

They have done their tax gap analysis and see a problem in Northern Ireland but they believe it is only a problem in Northern Ireland.

We know this because we have detected tankers of laundered fuel leaving Dublin Port.  We refer to dangers, but it is being done in a reckless way because it is masked.  Putting fuel tankers as masked loads on ferries is lethal.  We did not conduct the tax gap analysis, but we took a post-development view and carried out random sampling.  I would be comfortable undertaking a tax gap analysis in terms of fuel in future, but the amount is small.</p></speech>

The essence of Mr. Cody's answer is that the criminals will beat us.  Fuel will be laundered in the North, it will be brought into the South and we will lose revenue.  We have moved into the area of criminal justice.  We are all satisfied that Revenue cannot quantify that loss.  The system is causing damage to the environment and cars and problems for our agricultural sector's good name.  The only reason proffered for us potentially not dealing with it is that the criminals might beat us.  I am not happy to be in that space.

I stated that this was something that we have defeated.  We have successfully tackled fuel laundering.  We have eliminated it south of the Border.  In conjunction with HMRC, we have practically eliminated it on the island.  I am confident that, if we conducted a tax gap analysis of the fuel situation in 2017, we would see a low figure.  I am open to doing that.  One can conduct a good tax gap analysis in terms of fuel because it all comes into Dublin and Cork ports.</p></speech>

In our supply chain analysis, we are working on improving the IT systems because we want to visualise the fuel starting in the tanker and being tracked to its final destination.  Previously, fuel used to get diverted to some barn or other, get washed and then be returned to the chain.  We have a reckless trading provision as well as co-operation and feedback from the legitimate trade.  In 2011 and 2012, legitimate traders were concerned about what was happening and were forced to provide marked fuel to people whom they were not comfortable supplying because business was being lost.  We have defeated the fuel laundering problem and that is the result of the Comptroller and Auditor General's review.</p></speech>

Mr. Cody will send to the committee the memo on the double Irish from which he read.  Regarding aggressive tax planning, many of those companies that used the section 110 provisions bought properties from NAMA - I am not referring to any individual company - and, according to Mr. Cody, used the charity trust mechanism to have a small or zero tax rate.  Would he not consider this aggressive tax planning?  Can Revenue do anything about it?</p></speech>

The two issues are being conflated.  The issue of concern, and one that is being addressed in the context of the Bill, relates to Irish property-based funds where loans have been transferred.  This House is undertaking that process.  In his pronouncement, the Minister invited those Deputies who had majored on this issue to feed into that process.  That is happening.

Revenue stated that it would take the same approach to the data being released as it had done to all offshore asset investigations.  A heading on page 29 reads: "Challenging Offshore Evasion".  I will link the two paragraphs together.  What has Revenue done since publishing its report six months ago?

Both of my two predecessors have been asked here why Revenue did not prosecute people from the Ansbacher cases.  We have always said proof <i>mens rea</i>from collaborative witnesses is nearly impossible in an international context.  However, having an offshore account and having been involved in serious tax evasion will now be a criminal offence.</p></speech>

Take the case of somebody with a liability in 2009 of &euro;114,800.  If he or she came in voluntarily under the current regime, he or she would pay a penalty of &euro;11,480 and interest of &euro;61,000, giving a total of &euro;187,000.

We treat data protection very seriously and in any exchange we engage with the Data Protection Commissioner and whatever body with which we are engaged.</p> <p>  Suspicious transaction reports come from financial institutions.  We are one of the designated bodies they are required to report to.  We analyse the reports and build them into our recording systems.

Deputy Connolly referred earlier to the topic covered in this regard.  There were 11 convictions for a serious duty offence and custodial sentences of 18 were imposed in two cases, with the final six months in one case having been suspended on appeal.  A custodial sentence of 18 months was reduced to time served in a further case.  Seven cases resulted in suspended custodial sentences ranging from three months to two years.  Chart 22 on page 80, which is related to this item, is a summary of criminal convictions in 2015.  Was there any conviction for income tax offences?  There was a conviction for non-filing of tax returns in respect of a mineral oil tax; convictions in respect of VAT, cigarette selling and cigarette smuggling but there is no mention of any conviction in respect of income tax?</p></speech>

Table 22 deals with summary offences.  Table 21 deals with indictable offences which involve serious income tax and VAT prosecutions.

Table 13 on page 77 deals with collection enforcement programmes, which involves solicitors, the Sheriff and attachment orders.  The value of referrals to solicitors was &euro;126 million and the yield was &euro;36 million, which is a 29% yield.  The value of referrals to the Sheriff was &euro;254 million and the yield was &euro;142 million, which is a 56% yield.  The value for attachment orders was &euro;145 million but only &euro;26 million was collected, which is a yield of 18%.  I know the sheriff is probably a bit more brutal but why is the attachment order yield so low?  Given the value of referrals to the solicitors, the Sheriff and the attachment orders versus the yield is so high perhaps Mr. Cody would send a note to the committee on the amount outstanding in that regard.  That information is not provided in the table.</p></speech>

Obviously, if there is an enforcement by the Sheriff that will be more immediate.  The solicitor cases usually involve going to court, getting judgment mortgages and so on, which is a protection that we will be able to collect the money eventually.  Attachment orders usually trigger a response.  We would see it as a serious and carefully applied enforcement option because it has an immediate affect on the banking relationship, if it is a bank we are attaching the order to.</p></speech>

It was about the nature of the financial account information being shared.  I believe that only began in September 2015.  What is the nature of what is being shared?</p> <p>  The other question relates to nursing homes.  Does the Revenue Commissioners collect for nursing homes?  I believe it involves a transfer of &euro;12 million to the Department of Finance.  Will Mr. Cody explain that to me and how that is monitored?</p> <p>  With regard to Apple and the issue the Chairman raised, the Commission judgment stated it breached competition laws and that this company, in particular, got state aid as opposed to any other company.  Is that not right?  That is the essence of what it has breached.  If other companies got the same assistance, then there is no breach of the competition law.  That is the end of that judgment.  If that is the case, the appeal should succeed, but it raises a different question for us as to the number of companies that have that deal, which is an even more serious problem.  I do not expect Mr. Cody to comment on it.  I am just highlighting it, but I would like answers to the other questions.  I also asked about counterfeit goods.  There were three practical questions with regard to nursing homes, the sharing of the information, and the counterfeit goods Revenue has seized and set out.  How does that fit into the overall percentage of those goods?</p></speech>

That is the context.  In terms of the overall counterfeit, some of our role on the counterfeit side is limited to Customs controls.  We also have a role on behalf of what used to be called the Irish Medicines Board.  It has a new name now but I cannot recall it.  We conduct exercises in the mail centres for medication.</p> <p>  When the Deputy asked me the question, she had the list but the Foreign Account Tax Compliance Act, FATCA, was the one question we skipped over, and I was hoping we would get back to it.  I touched upon it with regard to what is in the offshore proposal.  The FATCA is the first of a suite of measures to do with international exchange of financial information between countries.  The US brought in the FATCA in 2012, and we were one of the first countries to sign an agreement with the US to exchange information.  We send the IRS information on US citizens with financial information we receive from Irish financial institutions.</p></speech>

We will be getting financial information on Irish citizens from something like 100 countries.  I spoke earlier about the offshore disclosure regime.  We will have a load of information.  We will have to slice and dice it, match it but, ultimately, there will be gems, from a taxman's perspective, in it.</p></speech>

We are the collection agency for the HSE.  I have a note on it.  We collected &euro;12 million in 2015.  So far this year, we have collected &euro;9.85 million.  Most of it is collected by agreement.  If somebody is in the scheme, they have pledged some proportion of their property and, ultimately, it is collected out of the estate.</p></speech>

Are the minutes of 6 October agreed?  Agreed.  Are there any matters arising from the minutes?  Nothing special arises today from the minutes.</p> <p>  We will go through correspondence received since the last meeting.  Items Nos. 91A and 101A cover briefing material in respect of the appearance of representatives of the Revenue Commissioners.  That is noted and has already been discussed.  Items Nos. 97B(i), 97B(ii) and 97B(iii) are associated with an e-mail received from P&aacute;draig Corkery of NAMA with copies of correspondence from Cerberus to NAMA relating to the payment of success fees.  That is noted.  The correspondence is not complete as it does not include the e-mails from NAMA to Cerberus or internal e-mails relating to same.  When the NAMA chairman, Frank Daly, was before the committee, he read from an e-mail in connection with the undertaking from Cerberus to NAMA and he referred to the documentation from Cerberus to NAMA.  We would like to see the e-mails that went from NAMA to Cerberus which led to that e-mail.  We have only received one side of the correspondence and we will follow up on the rest.  Item No. 99B is an e-mail from Declan Reid of the Department of Finance on the six directions that the Minister of Finance made to NAMA since 2010.  That is noted and will go on our file.  Item No. 97C relates to an e-mail from an individual enclosing a newspaper article on Project Eagle.  I suggest we note this as well.</p> <p>  Items Nos. 96C(i), 96C(ii) and 96C(iii) are associated with an e-mail from an individual drawing attention to the allocation of &euro;720,000 in September 2016 for the provision of Irish language coaching to Gaeltacht children.  The individual believes that the moneys will be wasted.  He encloses some details on the scheme and a record of D&aacute;il Deputies speaking on the revival of Irish.  As this relates to a policy and implementation of a programme about to begin, it is not within our remit.  We can only look back at expenditure.  There is no evidence that money has been wasted.  We note this and we will inform the individual and suggest that he should bring it to the attention of the Joint Committee on the Irish Language, the Gaeltacht and the Islands.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  Deputy Catherine Connolly is involved in that committee.  We will pass that over to the Deputy.</p> <p>  Items Nos. 98C(i)and 98C(ii) are associated with an e-mail from Deputy Catherine Connolly and an attachment entitled papers from the First Minister following 14 October 2015 briefing session.  The third and fourth pages were referred to by the Deputy during the meeting with the Minister last week.  This relates to Project Eagle.  We note this on our file.  The next item is an e-mail from Declan Reid of the Department of Finance with follow-up information from last week's meeting.  We note this correspondence.</p> <p>  Next we will deal with reports, statements and accounts received.  We will put the list on the display screen for committee members.  Since the last meeting some documents have been received.  The first one is headed Ciste Pinsean Tithe an Oireachtais.  This relates to funds and pension benefits for former Oireachtas Members and surviving spouses and children.  It has a clear audit report.  The next item is the national training fund.  This fund is used to raise the skills of those in unemployment and to provide training to unemployed persons.  It has a clear audit report.  The Teagasc report for 2015 has a clear audit report.  The Arts Council 2015 accounts also have a clear audit report.</p> <p>  The next page on the screen relates to the Residential Institutional Statutory Fund, Caranua.  The fund was established in 2013 and oversees the use of cash contributions pledged by the religious congregations to support the needs of survivors of residential institutions child abuse.  A fund of approximately &euro;100 million was accumulated and the document refers to a remaining balance of &euro;69.3 million.  There statement from the Comptroller and Auditor General refers to statements on internal control and discloses that the board did not have an internal audit function in place during 2014.  He states that the board did not carry out the required annual review of its effectiveness of systems and internal controls.  Furthermore, weaknesses in the board control over grant payments in 2014 were identified and the statement refers to the steps taken by the board to remedy these witnesses.  That is not a clear audit report and I do not want to let this go.  I have received correspondence in my constituency clinic from some of the people who have applied for grants but who have been refused.  Now that this has been brought before us, I will pass this over to the committee.  I call on the Comptroller and Auditor General to comment.</p></speech>

If the committee members review that statement, they will have an idea of the kinds of weaknesses and so on that exist.  This was effectively the first year of operation of Caranua.  It was established in 2013 but there was little spend that year.  The organisation was putting systems in place.  Caranua was struggling with having the right number of staff and continuity of staffing as well as getting its systems in place.  It has taken some time to get the financial statements for 2014 completed.  Currently, the financial statements for 2015 are being audited.</p></speech>

Project Eagle was the code name given to the sale of NAMA&rsquo;s Northern Ireland loan portfolio.</p> <p>  We have already had meetings with Comptroller and Auditor General on his report, with NAMA and with the Minister for Finance, Deputy Michael Noonan, and his officials.  Today Mr. Brian Rowntree is before the committee and I would like to thank him sincerely for making himself available.  Mr. Rowntree was a member of NAMA's Northern Ireland advisory committee, NIAC, at the time of the sale of Project Eagle.  The NIAC was established by the NAMA board in January 2010.  It comprised four NAMA board members, NAMA&rsquo;s head of asset recovery and two external members.  The main purpose of the NIAC was to make recommendations to the NAMA board on matters pertaining to Northern Ireland in the context of NAMA&rsquo;s objectives and functions and to make recommendations to the board concerning NAMA&rsquo;s strategy for Northern Ireland assets.</p> <p>  We are also joined today by the Comptroller and Auditor General, Mr. Seamus McCarthy, and his colleague, Ms Mairead Cosgrove.</p> <p>  I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery to switch off their mobile phones.  I wish to advise witnesses that by virtue of section 17(2)(l) of the Defamation Act 2009, they are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to this committee.  If they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence in relation to a particular matter but they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise nor make charges against any person or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.  Members are reminded of the provisions within Standing Order 186 that the committee shall also refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policies.  Finally, members are reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official by name in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p> <p>  I invite Mr. Rowntree to make his opening statement.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.524" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. Brian Rowntree" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2016101300002#MM01300"><p>I thank the Chairman and Deputies for the invitation to attend this meeting today.  My opening remarks will simply lay before the committee the facts as they apply to me as a member of the NIAC at the time of Project Eagle, the sale of the NAMA Northern Ireland loan portfolio.  I wish to confirm that the complete sale of Project Eagle was a matter for the main board and senior executive team of NAMA.  A decision was taken by the NAMA board to oversee this process under strict controls and we, as the Northern Ireland advisory board, were in no way consulted, referenced or updated on the detail on the bid and sale process and the resulting compliance issues.  I respected this decision and at no time during, prior to or subsequent to the sale process did I make any personal or corporate interventions to the NAMA board or executive team, to the bidders in this process, PIMCO and Cerberus, political representatives, political parties, civil servants, other investors' or potential bidders' representatives or developers.  At all times I respected the corporate governance provisions surrounding the Project Eagle sale process, the commercial confidentiality of the process as well as the corporate integrity of the NAMA board and senior executive team.<br/><br/>As a member of the NIAC I was updated on the original interest expressed by PIMCO but only in general outline terms and no specifics of the interest were discussed with us as a committee.  After this outline briefing no further outline updates were offered and none were sought by me.  At subsequent NIAC meetings the committee was simply told that Project Eagle was still a live process.  I was never informed of the Cerberus bid and I was notified of the sale agreement and the NAMA board sign-off the day before the public announcement of its completion.  Mr. Frank Daly, the NAMA chairman, rang me to inform me of the successful conclusion to Project Eagle.<br/><br/>At NIAC meetings we were not made aware of direct or perceived individual conflicts of interest as noted by individual members.  Declarations of conflicts were noted in writing at the start of each meeting by each person attending and we had to regularly update our own personal register of interests.  All such records were held centrally by the NAMA corporate governance directorate.  NAMA put in place a robust corporate governance framework which applied to all component parts of its operation, including the NIAC, and as members we were subject to regular training and update discussions on governance provisions.  At all times I respected and adhered to this strict governance framework.  An organisation with such a commercially sensitive mission as NAMA's can only be effective and respected when all stakeholders adhere to the principles of good governance.<br/><br/>The NIAC was not a decision-making forum and we all understood this from day one.  The committee was purely a consultative and advisory framework on strategic aspects of NAMA business and dealings that had particular reference to the socio-economic indicators for Northern Ireland.  The NIAC did not engage or seek to engage in the details of individual debtor portfolios and individual debtor cases were not discussed.  The discussions at the NIAC were high-level, strategic impact discussions on the direction of travel for NAMA in respect of the assets secured against the consolidated debts.  Members of the committee were fully aware that NAMA did not own such assets but were equally aware that the ownership and control of the debt resulted in <i>de facto </i>control of the assets.</p><p>With this in mind, the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee reached agreement with the main NAMA board not to engage in a fire sale of Northern Ireland assets so as not to adversely impact further on the Northern Ireland property market.  With this in mind, it was also understood by the committee that the Northern Ireland Executive would not control but would be informed of the work of NAMA in Northern Ireland.</p><p> Through the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee also undertook high-level strategic asset studies.  Such research was indicated as strictly confidential and the university undertaking the study also engaged with other banks and lenders on comparable research to provide a confidential high-level consolidated report indicating the opportunity for selected asset type development to extract realistic value from the loan book, both current and projected.</p><p> It is important that the allegations surrounding the Project Eagle sale are investigated in full and that any such investigations look also at the corporate governance controls, both executive and non-executive, surrounding the bid process.  It is important that integrity is the key principle in any such investigations and any confirmed breach of integrity must have supporting accountability and sanction.  I fully support the essential desire and drive for the facts and truth surrounding the allegations leading to the sale of Project Eagle.</p></speech>

We worked to a direction of travel which was laid out by the main NAMA board.  The majority of members of the Northern Ireland advisory committee were main NAMA board members.  As an advisory forum, it was primarily driven from the main NAMA board.  The forum, as I have already outlined, was seen as a consultative forum with no decision-making powers or capacity.  The forum was one where, in the main, matters pertaining to discussions at the main board that had an impact on Northern Ireland were primarily discussed.  There was not a huge degree of interrogation of other areas of activity within the Northern Ireland advisory committee and the minutes of the meeting indicate that.  I have commented on the research which was something I was very keen on because we needed an evidence base to talk about the impact of what was happening in Northern Ireland.  The land issues in Northern Ireland were totally different to those in the Republic of Ireland.  We did not have a huge overhang of surplus housing.  We had a history of people trading in land.  As a consequence we had multiple debt portfolios around certain areas of land.  One could see those debt portfolios increasing around the same land holdings because those lands were being traded-----</p></speech>

They were very formal, with agendas set by the chairperson.  There were very carefully controlled discussions in the room.  We had meetings that gave rise to discussions about whether they were proceeding to put a portfolio into administration or were considering the administration of certain aspects of the portfolio.  They would give us that information.  They would not name the debtor but they would say they were moving on certain aspects of the portfolio that could have an impact on Northern Ireland.  We discussed issues around the valuation of lands.  These were not specific valuations but how land in general was moving in Northern Ireland and whether there had been any considered uptake in interest in lands in Northern Ireland.  We looked at the aspects of commercial, industrial and residential in broad terms, not in key, specific terms.  Meetings tended to last between two and two and a half hours.</p></speech>

I want to get to a part of Mr. Rowntree's speech where he talks about conflicts of interest or individual conflicts of interest.

"During NIAC meetings and in annual statements of interests, one external NIAC member, Mr Frank Cushnahan, declared his involvement as an advisor, mainly on a non-fee basis, to six NAMA debtors and to a third party".  It goes on to say that when the Comptroller and Auditor General's examination team looked at this, it was estimated that the loans of the six debtors represented about half the value of the Northern Ireland loan book.</p><p>It says that during NIAC meetings and annual statements of interest, one external member declared his involvement as an adviser.

There may not have been sufficient examination of what that meant but the declaration was made.  In the "Spotlight" programme, Mr. Rowntree said there was commercially sensitive information that would be of value to an overall portfolio and that there were things that he witnessed and heard in NAMA that would have offered commercial opportunity.  I am trying to put myself in Mr. Rowntree's shoes.  If I was a member of the NIAC and was involved in discussions at whatever level or however sensitive and one of the people I was sitting next to had the same position as Mr. Rowntree and had a relationship with debtors that made up 50% of the loan portfolio that I was not made aware of, I would feel personally let down.  I am not asking Mr. Rowntree to comment on an individual's behaviour but I am asking if he feels let down because the information was not shared with him.  Does he believe it should have been shared with him?</p></speech>

It is a decision of the NAMA board how to make available those conflict of interest issues.  They are personal declarations and need the permission of the persons who have declared them to share them.  Whenever I made the statement to "Spotlight" I was not aware of the declarations.  I was talking about another matter that is contained within my statement here today.</p></speech>

I am trying to get at the process.  We want to establish whether the processes within NAMA were robust enough to withstand potential breaches of process.  When there is a conflict of interest and when a conflict of interest arises, we must make sure in every organisation that there are best and robust practices in place.  It does not seem to have been the case in this situation because it is now established there were conflicts of interest.  The Minister for Finance in the South was here last week and he said he accepted the process had become corrupted.  That aside, surely Mr. Rowntree must have a view as a former member of the NIAC of whether the process was robust enough in respect of declarations of interest.</p></speech>

It was a best value study.  The scope and terms of reference are limited in that regard.  To have an all embracing report, one needs to consider the governance framework surrounding the bid process.  This was a bid that emerged from an approach to NAMA in the early stages.  There was not a collective decision to go out to an invitation to tender for bidders and run a short list and do the necessary provisions.  In a sense, it is defending a different position.  It requires examining the corporate governance provisions that surrounded the overall exercise internal to the board, internal to the executive team and external to those in the process.</p></speech>

These success fees were with PIMCO.  They were in three parts, one for Brown Rudnick, one for Tughans and one for Mr. Cushnahan.  We are also aware, from paragraph 55 in the Comptroller and Auditor General's report, of the relationship that Mr. Cushnahan had with Tughans, that he shared its premises and that there were two NIAC meetings there.  Did Mr. Rowntree attend those two NIAC meetings?</p></speech>

I believe the appointment of someone with those levels of conflict, perceived or real, whatever we want to call them, does make it more difficult for that person to manage the relationship within the committee and it makes it more difficult for the committee itself to manage its relationship with the person and the information control therein.

Before it would even undertake or engage with NAMA it had a series of caveats around confidentiality of the information.  These were explained to the committee.  If this is not commercially sensitive I do not know what is.  This data was not only location and type of properties, this data also had the details of planning permissions which were current, about to expire and the potential for renewal.  It also had details of housing and residential needs overlaid on top of it.  It also had details in consolidated form of holdings by other banks.  One would have got a picture of the complete landbank available in Northern Ireland and one would have looked at the opportunity locations within this portfolio.</p></speech>

There was a volte-face over the question of a fire sale.

The conversation quickly went into banking terms in respect of the loan book and the sale of the loan book itself.  Its assets and the securitisation of assets in support of the loans were no longer matters for debate.  The debate was on selling the loan book.  The work the University of Ulster did was around the assets.  The NAMA board must have some note in the minutes of its discussions about the change of heart in Northern Ireland, from an emphasis on a controlled and strategic platform to deal with the asset book to one dealing with the sale of the complete loan book.</p></speech>

I have experience in land assembly, in moving residential housing platforms forward.  These would not be done on a three-year cycle, but on a five to 15-year cycle in the main - five-year short-term provisions for immediacy and 15 to 20 years for longer-term provisions.  This is effectively about the capacity for people to live.  A mapping exercise of that nature gives an indication as to where the need is and how that can be mapped over what is available.  If lands are not available, the need has to be displaced somewhere else.  That is the reality of it.</p></speech>

To go back to the confidentiality issue, for the University of Ulster to acquire the data from other lenders, it had to have express confidentiality agreements in place before that information was released.

We saw a rural and heavy urban divide.  I ensured, through the Northern Ireland Housing Executive, that we gave our housing need studies and we laid the data over them.  This really gives the capacity in terms of residential property and shows hot spots and hot spot activity.  Lenders want to ensure maximisation but also immediacy of return on their spend.  Therefore, in many ways they want to locate their spend around hot spots.  The data identified these hot spots but they also showed, if one spread it out, where one could displace some of the demand to other areas to give regeneration capacity in other regions.  This would have an impact on public transport provision, private sector development, commercial activity, etc.  There are also lands which are more difficult, if not impossible, to develop.  In commercial terms, in its entirety, one must ask what compensating loss one is prepared to bear on the non-development lands and the premium one would pay for the development portion.</p></speech>

I did not want to join a committee that was dealing with the operational issues of NAMA and the businesses cases.

Here we were where we had literally a meltdown in the financial circles in 2008 and we were on a very slow path of recovery.  We were working on how to bring some added value to society, how do we remove the continued dependency on the public sector to pick up this tab and pick up this intervention required as a result of the financial collapse.  I think that what we saw was some strategic discussions around Northern Ireland and how we might do something successful, and how we even might engage.  Yes, it would be a slow burn and there is no doubt about that but I think if one could have gained momentum, then things could have emerged.  Suddenly we had a discussion which was then around, we have an approach on the loan book and we are getting rid of the loan book.  The assets and the work through of those assets and the added value to the community and society really is not our concern.</p></speech>

Given the fact the strategy was to bundle debtors, which captured a lot of assets in the North, and then reflecting again on the conflict of interest that Mr. Cushnahan had - Mr. Cushnahan had a relationship and this is a matter of fact, so I am not asking Mr. Rowntree to speculate - with seven debtors, does that not mean the scenario becomes all the more problematic in respect of a conflict of interest?</p></speech>

I take from Mr. Rowntree's evidence a very clear statement that control, decision-making and ultimately responsibility was vested in the board of NAMA, which was located not in Belfast but in Dublin.</p></speech>

Let me take the Deputy back on that, if I may.  The original terms of reference, which Deputy Connolly referred to, indicate that this was not a decision-making forum.  It clearly set that down.  The decisions were made by the main NAMA board.</p> <p>  In relation to Project Eagle, it is very clear, and even the minutes give testament to this, that the control and responsibility for that process rested with the main NAMA board, and within the senior ranks of the executive team supporting the board.  The decision was then taken by the main NAMA board to set aside any discussion on Project Eagle with the Northern Ireland advisory committee.  I would go as far to say, therefore, that the committee itself is removed then at that point from the sale of Project Eagle because there is no reference to anything in relation to Project Eagle thereafter.  One has to then go to the main NAMA board to seek resolution of the considerations that are under review by this committee and by others.</p></speech>

I do not wish to put words in Mr. Rowntree's mouth but from his testimony today I think that he raised questions at least in respect of that NAMA position.</p></speech>

I am sure that audit committee had the good grace and the benefit of legal opinion to support its views on it.  I am sure then the movement forward by the board, in concluding the deal, was supported by some evidence base that said that this all is in order on our side of the equation.</p><p>In any transaction, like buying a house, there are two parties to the transaction - the buyer and the seller.  Both have to have legal cover.</p></speech>

I compliment Mr. Rowntree on his precise knowledge of Northern Ireland.  It is obvious from his presentation that his major concern was about keeping the economy in Northern Ireland going or improving it.</p> <p>  Mr. Rowntree mentioned a fire sale.  Was his reason for going on the NIAC that he did not want fire sales or quick sales that could do damage to the economy in Northern Ireland?</p></speech>

It was not just NAMA selling land; there were other banks that had land portfolios, particularly Ulster Bank, which had a sizeable exposure in terms of the debt.  We then had public sector lands that were being sold as part of the programme for Government.  What would the impact be of a fire sale from NAMA which was probably a 30% or 35% stakeholder in the lands that were securitised against loans?  What impact would that have had across the piece?  It would have done nothing but drive down the value of lands; that is the first thing.  It also might have stagnated sales for a long time.  So the potential would have been removed from the equation.</p></speech>

We have questioned representatives of NAMA and others.  Does Mr. Rowntree believe that instead of selling the loan book in one big lump, it would have been better to sell the assets over four or five years?  Would more money have been realised in the long term if it had been done gradually rather than selling off the whole lot in one go?</p></speech>

Those in the South had an overhang of housing and greater opportunity sites than we had.  There was going to be a slower burn.  It might have had the intention to go for a quick fix on this one.  It takes a different strategic approach to work the Northern Ireland landbank out.  That would have been taken as read.  It is a mixed bag of tricks in many ways.</p> <p>  Also on the political side, yes, there was political angst regarding an immediate fix.  However, we were not going to get an immediate fix around this.  There never was going to be an such a fix.  I pose the question: if there had not been a NAMA, where would the Northern Ireland landbank have been today?</p></speech>

Mr. Rowntree said he knew nothing about PIMCO, Cerberus or anything like that; he was just there as an adviser on Northern Ireland.  Did he find it strange to learn afterwards that the same advisory and legal companies were used by PIMCO?  There was a success fee of many millions and Mr. Cushnahan was involved in that so there was a three-way pay off.  Was Mr. Rowntree surprised to learn that Tughans and the other legal advisers were still involved with Cerberus when it went on to buy the portfolio?</p></speech>

Any investment in a social dividend comes at a cost to the State and to those who are investing because one is dealing with those who are most vulnerable; therefore, the reward that emerges from these groupings is far less.  Taking a mixed economy approach might have been in everyone's interest.  I go to back to my earlier remarks.  It may have been worth the consideration of a clause within the sale process to have some social dividend.</p></speech>

I would not either, not that I would been that in position, given the amounts involved.  The amount bid for the assets without having done due diligence was remarkably near the amount for which they were ultimately sold.</p></speech>

I am sure those who were seeking to acquire the portfolio did their homework; therefore, on the other side, one has to look at whether the value was maximised.  There are differences of opinion between the Comptroller and Auditor General and NAMA on the determination of value, but then one gets into the issue of corporate governance.  That is why I said in my opening remarks that it behoved someone to conduct a corporate governance investigation into this process and produce an independent corporate governance report that would look at how the various processes were controlled and regulated, as well as at the validity of the assumptions and decisions made and how they were evidenced.</p></speech>

The minutes state the chairman had broadly outlined what a NAMA sale process would entail with value and in an open market and key considerations for the agency.  The committee discussed the approach to be taken and views were expressed.  Mr. Rowntree raised a number of issues such as the sale of a portfolio of such a scale leading to strategic land locking and the sale requiring value to be achieved by NAMA, with transparency as a protection in this regard.  The minutes further state: "The approach from PIMCO implies that a value can be obtained from the portfolio although the NI debtor portfolio also includes British assets" and a discount would be sought and that, therefore, the question of value was key for NAMA - sell versus hold.  The discussion included external member feedback on the proposed approach.  I ask Mr. Rowntree to reach into his powers of recollection as I would like to get a sense of the discussion which took place.  Earlier we agreed that there was a set compass which was asset focused as against debtor working out.  Work was done by the Univeristy of Ulster and then, bang, out of nowhere this came.  I presume the matters are recorded, as would be expected, in a neutral fashion on the page.  Was Mr. Rowntree concerned when this happened?  The discount has been a lively topic in respect of the portfolio.  That emerged in the discussion.  Will Mr. Rowntree talk us through that meeting and exchange?</p></speech>

It is quite confusing because we were being informed of an approach to the main board but there was no real substance as to why the approach was being made.  If the Deputy looks at the bullet points to which she referred, the assets are not mentioned in any of them.  It is the value of the loans, not the value of the assets that is referred to.  We were in a situation where in all of our previous discussions we had looked at where we would take Northern Ireland and where we would work for its betterment and go against the fire sale provision.  One could argue that we had a fire sale of the loans here as opposed to a fire sale of the assets.</p></speech>

The minutes reflect the fact that the Minister for Finance's view was that it was a commercial matter for NAMA.  They state: "The chairman broadly outlined what a NAMA sales process would entail".

Even though preliminary discussions had been had with PIMCO - Mr. Rowntree can only speak for himself; Mr. Cushnahan obviously is a different person with a different history in these matters - the issue of discount is there.  I assume that Mr. Rowntree would have assumed that on a matter like discounting the debtor portfolio, NAMA would have sought advice, evidence and expertise.</p></speech>

For NAMA to even consider setting aside the PGs, it would have had to have a rationale for doing so.  If it could set them aside at a sale process, why could it not set them aside in terms of a business case settlement?  In my view, one would be setting some precedent in doing this.  The conversation was at a very high level, no great detail was offered and it was more or less advising us that the board had met and had come to a certain sense of reality around this situation.</p></speech>

That is the meeting in December.  December through to January saw the approval to dispose of the portfolio and the appointment of the sales advisers.  It broke in the media in February that something was afoot.  The data room was opened in February and there was material with the Comptroller and Auditor General where concerns were raised or observations made.  PIMCO withdrew in March while closing date for bids was April.  On 3 April, the board approved the sale.  During all of that time, there was no meeting of the Northern Ireland advisory committee.</p></speech>

When you are dealing with a portfolio the size of the Northern Ireland portfolio, never mind the larger Irish portfolio, you want as much evidence to support decision making as possible.  There were very intense discussions around what that might look like and whether there were any other contributions or interventions we wanted to make.  As I said, the position then changed.</p></speech>

We know it goes right back because I have a note here from 14 June 2013.  It is just a short note about the meeting the day before between Sammy Wilson, the then Minister for Finance in Northern Ireland, and the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan.  It noted that Mr. Wilson raised concerns about NAMA's operation in Northern Ireland and its commitment.  He also queried whether NAMA would consider a full divestment of its Northern Ireland portfolio as this was something it had been approached about.  The Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, said that it was a matter for NAMA, quite rightly, but that he would raise it later with the advisory committee.</p><p>I presume that refers to the other advisory committee, not the Northern Ireland advisory committee.</p></speech>

I note, on page 106, that they refer to matters the committee had discussed in respect of Project Eagle.

The committee and others reviewing this matter will look at the definition of "confidential".  What I would say is that if one conducts a corporate governance investigation and review of Project Eagle and one looks at the reference material contained within the NAMA Northern Ireland advisory committee, that review will give a clear determination on what was or was not confidential.

In hindsight, Mr. Rowntree must be disappointed.  Having been a member of an advisory board in Northern Ireland which had been in place for many reasons and having for many years advised on asset control and sales, all of a sudden the committee was dismissed, NAMA took a different route and the committee was forgotten about.  That must have been disappointing for Mr. Rowntree who had been advising NAMA and had much goodwill towards the Northern Ireland economy and businesses there.  NAMA went for the sale of the loan book instead of an asset driven process.  Having listened to Mr. Rowntree's evidence, it seems the Northern Ireland advisory committee was basically dismissed.  It talked for a couple of years and then that was it.</p></speech>

It is frustrating more than disappointing because there is potential to provide a dividend in society.  Perhaps this is outside the terms of the committee, but when I look at the housing issue in Ireland and the housing issue in Northern Ireland, I ask what do we have.  Do we have a testament to success or do we have something which was a financial solution that fitted in a moment in time, that is, it fitted an approach from another source?  I think there is a balance to be achieved between maximising value and also getting some dividend in society.  The two were not as well balanced as they should have been.  However, that is said in hindsight and everyone is great in hindsight.  I certainly believe the conditions which NAMA created and the opportunity it created were not exploited to the full.</p></speech>

It appears to be significant, yet no one has seen it, other than members of the advisory committee who saw it privately.  Should NAMA have looked at it more?  I presume considerable finance and research went into the report which was never used.  If the committee had access to it, it would have a better insight into the reasons NAMA sold the loan book rather than the assets.  I would like to see the report, find out what is in it and compare its contents with what happened later.  Mr. Rowntree has seen it.  Would it have made a difference if it had been used properly?</p></speech>

What I can say is that, as Deputy Catherine Connolly said, there were quite animated discussions in the build-up to the draft report from the University of Ulster.  There was a level of intensity around these discussions which were focused on opportunity and strategic visioning, but that was set aside.  Someone has an evidence base somewhere, I presume, that says we no long require this and this is the best we can achieve, that is, selling the loan book.</p></speech>

Considerable emphasis has been placed on the University of Ulster report today and we will seek a copy of it.  I am conscious that Ulster Bank, Santander Bank and other entities may have contributed to the report and that, therefore, it may not be in NAMA's gift to provide a copy for the committee.  However, we can ask for a copy.</p> <p>  On achieving value for money, the NAMA loan book was sold for approximately &pound;1.25 billion, with approximately half of the assets relating to the loan book based in Northern Ireland.  This means that approximately &euro;600 million of the sale proceeds were related to assets in Northern Ireland.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

The board agreed that I would appear today with my three fellow board members, Dr. Meta Osborne, Mr. John Moloney and Mr. John Powell.  I am chairman of Horse Racing Ireland.  I am also chairman and former CEO of the Keeling Group that employs in excess of 1,700 people.  I have a number of my board colleagues here with me today.</p> <p>  Horse racing is a life long passion of mine.  I have been a sponsor, an owner, a breeder and a racegoer for many years.  Our industry returns over &euro;1 billion every year to the Irish economy and employs more than 14,000 people.  It is one in which Ireland has natural advantages.  I am confident that we can grow it into a &euro;2 billion industry, but to do so we need to have the best team in place.</p> <p>  I apologise to this committee about the way that the appointment process was handled.  It could have been done better and I take responsibility for this matter.  When I became chairman of Horse Racing Ireland, I became aware that Mr. Brian Kavanagh&rsquo;s contract was due to end in September 2016.  I decided to look for an extension because I took the view that Irish racing needed to retain his skills and expertise.  This was due to the specialist knowledge that he brought to the position and the need for stability and experience at a time of much change for the organisation.</p> <p>  The Government's guidelines on this area allow exceptions to be made where the person brings scarce expertise or special qualifications to a role, and I believe that this is a case in point.  In 2011, the HRI board asked the then chairman, Mr. Denis Brosnan, to deal with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the CEO&rsquo;s contract and his ability to be reappointed.  This task passed to me when I took over from Mr. Brosnan.  I accept that there were problems with the sequence of events and the communications between myself, the Department and the HRI board but that is all.  There have been errors but no wrongdoing.  I   reject claims that Departments or Ministers were intentionally misled or that I misrepresented the views of the board in my dealings with the Department.   The board has since confirmed this, most recently in a statement that was issued after its meeting on 27 September.</p> <p>  There has been much said on the issue of a business case for Mr. Kavanagh&rsquo;s reappointment that the board had not reviewed.  What is referred to as a business case is in fact points made in a series of letters between myself and the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in terms of extending the contract.  The Department used the term business case in its briefing notes to the new Ministers that were published on its website in May.</p> <p>  I was always aware that it was a decision for the board of HRI to approve an appointment of a chief executive but first I needed to establish the position of the relevant Departments.  I made this my priority so I could present the full facts to the board.  This took longer than expected, partly due to a general election and the absence of a Government for three months.  The matter has been dealt with by the HRI&rsquo;s remuneration committee since April of this year  but, with hindsight, should have been brought to the board earlier. </p> <p>  The appointment was approved by the board at its meeting on 21 July on the same terms, conditions and salary as the previous contract.  At that meeting, the board agreed that Mr. Kavanagh was the right person for the role.  The concerns raised were around the process and the issue of succession planning within the organisation.  Dr. Meta Osborne, vice chairperson of HRI, will shortly outline the measures that the board has now put in place to ensure that such a situation does not arise again.  The board is satisfied that Mr Kavanagh&rsquo;s reappointment is the best outcome for the HRI and the industry at this time.  Both the board and Mr. Kavanagh have agreed that this will be his final term as chief executive.</p> <p>  Horse racing is a great industry.  Only last week, in the most prestigious flat race in the world, Irish bred horses filled seven of the first ten places and Mr. Aidan O&rsquo;Brien became the first person ever to train the horses ranked first, second and third in the race.  2016 has been a record year on the track for Irish horses and we have just completed a successful yearling sales season.  Racecourse development is happening around the country and, thanks to the new offshore betting tax regime, the net cost to Government of funding horse and greyhound racing this year will be almost &euro;20 million euro lower than last year.</p> <p>  In conclusion, I once again express regret at the issues that have arisen from this process and confirm that the board have taken measures to address this governance matter for the future.  I ask all parties to unite behind this industry and work together in facing the challenge of delivering a &euro;2 billion annual return to the Irish economy.</p></speech>

I am a veterinary surgeon with my practice being predominantly focused on mare reproduction and stud medicine.  My husband and I are also thoroughbred breeders and operate a stud farm in County Laois.  I have served as a member of the Veterinary Council Of Ireland from 2000 to 2013 and was president of the council from 2005 to 2007.  I was appointed to the board of Horse Racing Ireland in December 2013 for a four-year term.  I have been a member of the Turf Club since 2005 and was appointed senior steward in December 2015.  Following my appointment to the board, I served on the audit committee of the HRI for two years until last December.</p> <p>  I am on record at the board as saying that I thoroughly enjoyed my time on the audit committee.  It gave me a fresh perspective on the work of HRI and reassured me that our processes and procedures stood up to scrutiny when audited.  This is confirmed by the fact that the annual audit reports by the Comptroller and Auditor General have never been qualified in any respect.  The specific formal audit of corporate governance within HRI by our internal auditors, that was carried out most recently in 2015, has never given rise to any significant concerns. </p> <p>  In my experience, both as a board member and audit committee member, I can confirm that the importance of proper corporate governance is recognised within Horse Racing Ireland.  Corporate governance is one of those abstract phrases that must be lived to become a reality.   We are a diverse board that is comprised of people from a variety of backgrounds.  We are here before the committee today because, in the matter under scrutiny, we may not have lived that reality and our processes have been found wanting.  We recognise this, and the chairman of the board has already expressed his regrets.</p> <p>  I fully supported a recent request for mandatory training in corporate governance for all board members.  At our next board meeting at the end of this month I understand that we are due to have a detailed briefing on the new code of practice for the governance of State bodies from our legal advisers, which I welcome.</p> <p>  I first became aware that there was a process under way regarding the reappointment of the CEO when I was asked to attend a meeting of the appointments and remuneration committee on 14 April of this year.  I was uncomfortable that the committee had a membership of just two and that the terms of reference had not been updated since the days of the Irish Horseracing Authority.  It was explained to me that revision of the terms of reference had been on hold pending the enactment of the new legislation.  One of the items on the agenda was the reappointment of the CEO.  I felt at that first meeting that I did not have enough time to consider what would be a very important issue for the board.  I believed that it was imperative that our processes, procedures and decision-making stood up to the closest scrutiny.</p><p>Given the extreme complexity involved, I felt it prudent, as a board member, to invoke my right to seek independent legal advice.  I also requested that the committee be expanded to three members and this was sanctioned by the board.</p><p> In the light of the reservations I had expressed and pending receipt of the external legal advice, the committee was not in a position to make a recommendation to the board meeting scheduled for 18 April on the reappointment of the chief executive officer.  I was given the opportunity to review two legal opinions which had previously been prepared on the legal complexities surrounding the chief executive officer&rsquo;s contractual history and was happy a third opinion would not change matters.</p><p> The remuneration committee, now expanded to three members, subsequently met on three occasions in May and June.  After extensive deliberation we were satisfied to recommend to the board the reappointment of the chief executive officer, mindful of the fact that the decision was ultimately one for the board.</p><p> The board then met on several occasions to consider the reappointment of the chief executive officer.  These meetings involved open and frank discussions, both about the reappointment which I fully supported and the processes involved.  Arising from this, the board has put in place robust and detailed procedures to cover management development and succession planning in the organisation and the timings and processes to be adopted in the recruitment and appointment of the next chief executive officer.  In particular, I welcome the proposal for the introduction of a performance management and development programme for senior executives within HRI.  </p><p> I am absolutely satisfied that there has been no wrongdoing and no bad intent throughout the process.  As a vet, my training has taught me to look at the reasons a problem has developed.  More importantly in the here and now, it has taught me to carry out a clinical examination and formulate a treatment plan to make the sick foal better or to help the barren mare go into foal.  The priority for me is the patient and its prognosis.  We ask about what happened previously in order that we can learn for the future.  There were problems with the process for reappointing the chief executive officer of HRI, but lessons have been learned.  I believe the prognosis for the patient is excellent.

I have been on the board of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, since December 2010.  I am grateful to have the opportunity to appear before the committee.</p> <p>  I have two simple points which I would like to make.  First, there is no question in my mind that Ministers were not intentionally misled.  The committee heard from the chairman, Mr. Keeling, and I would like to speak as one of the other board members.  I have been on the board throughout the process and it is worth noting that five of the current board members were also members in September 2011 when the chief executive officer&rsquo;s previous contract was concluded.  It is a board which represents all sectors of the industry.  From 2011, I was aware that there were outstanding issues with the chief executive officer&rsquo;s contract.  I was satisfied that the chairman was dealing with the relevant Departments and would come back to the board when he was ready to do so.  The preference of the board would have always been to receive permission to extend the chief executive officer&rsquo;s contract.  However, all options could be considered once the position of the Department was known.</p> <p>  The legislation is clear.  It is a function of the board to appoint the chief executive officer.  At our last meeting the chairman brought the board through all of the correspondence on this matter, including the various letters and meetings with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  I have read all of these letters and I am satisfied that they reflect the wishes of the board.  At our meeting on Tuesday, 27 September, the board agreed that there was no intention to incorrectly inform the Minister, nor had the board&rsquo;s views been misrepresented.  I am clear that I was not misled and do not believe the board was misled.  I accept that the timing and communication could have been better, from which there are lessons to be learned.</p> <p>  There is no doubt in my mind that Mr. Brian Kavanagh is the correct person to fill the position at this time.  I have worked with him for several years and witnessed him doing his job at first hand.  He has been particularly helpful to racecourses in securing new media rights deals and helping to create racecourse capital development funds.  The job is a complex one, with many stakeholders and interests to be managed, and requires a knowledge of and expertise in all aspects of the racing, breeding and betting sectors.  Mr. Kavanagh possesses this knowledge and experience and is well respected in international racing circles.  His reappointment has been broadly welcomed within the industry.</p> <p>  We all regret the fact that this situation has developed.  There is no doubt that the process could have been managed better, but I am confident the measures that the board has now put in place will ensure it will not happen again.</p></speech>

As one of those who voted against the reappointment of the chief executive officer for a third term, I wish to explain that this was because of a concern shared by others that it would be in breach of the Government&rsquo;s guidelines and fail the test of good corporate governance.  I expressed my concerns at what was effectively my first board meeting in July.  It was not about the individual and it should never have been dealt with as an eleventh hour issue.  It was based on my belief it was a collective failure and that the matter should have been dealt with in the context of an open competition several months previously.  The board voted by a majority to accept the reappointment.  I accepted the majority decision.</p></speech>

I agree with them on the value of the horse racing industry to the country and the importance of the work carried out by HRI.  I have no doubt that they would want to be somewhere else other than here today.  However, there are significant questions to which we require answers.</p><p>Since the regulations on the appointment of chief executive officers to semi-State boards were introduced by the Government, a third extension was granted to the term of appointment of the chief executive officer of HRI who has been in place since 2001.  There are questions about the thoroughness of how the Government approached this unprecedented appointment.  There are also serious questions about the role of HRI which were not completely answered in the presentations.</p><p>Mr. Keeling accepted that things could have been done better and that there was no intention on his behalf to mislead the Minister or the Government.  In his letter requesting a third extension of the term of appointment to the Secretary General of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine on 16 December 2014 he stated:</p><blockquote>Given his unique qualifications for the post, the positions he holds in international racing bodies and the value of his experience and expertise in the coming years, the board wishes to confirm Brian as chief executive officer and, I am, therefore, seeking consent to conclude a further contract. </blockquote> <p>This letter is presenting it as the board wished to confirm Mr. Kavanagh as the chief executive officer.  Will Mr. Keeling elaborate on this?  When we asked the Minister last week about this, he indicated that it was his view that it was the wishes of the board which were being expressed.  Mr. Keeling outlined in his opening statement that it was his own view that it would be in the best interests of HRI.</p><p>Certainly, it was presented at the outset as the board's view.  As such, I ask Mr. Keeling to elaborate on why that approach was taken and whether it would have been misleading in terms of the message being given to the Government.</p><p> A second extension of term was given to the CEO in 2009.  Was it clear at that stage and did the Government clearly impose a requirement on HRI in giving that second extension that there should be no further or third extension and that should be the end of it in terms of any further extension?  If that was the case, surely it was very remiss of the board and, in fact, a dereliction on the part of Horse Racing Ireland to fail to plan for that and to fully discuss at the board how that eventuality could be planned for.</p><p> There are questions about the handing down of the mandate which the previous chairman received from the board to Mr. Keeling on taking up the position.  I would like clarification as to Mr. Keeling's exact understanding of the mandate and of what was asked of his predecessor.  Did Mr. Keeling feel there was an onus on him as chairman to bring these matters to the board and to have them discussed?  Why did he not do that?  The following is something for the four board members to address.  Were questions ever raised over the last three to five years at board level as to what the plan was for when the current CEO's contract extension would run out?  If so, were the issues addressed?  On the request the board made for a third extension, the case has been outlined as to the experience of the incumbent CEO, but were there other contractual considerations which were informing its view also?  If so, can the board elaborate on them?</p><p> Dr. Osborne indicated that when she was on the remuneration committee she was given the opportunity to review two legal opinions which had been prepared previously on the legal complexities surrounding the CEO's contractual history.  She said she was happy that a third opinion would not change these matters.  Can she elaborate on those because it is a very distinct matter from the experience and credentials of the CEO in that it deals with contractual issues which seem to be very much at the heart of the considerations of the remuneration committee to the extent that two legal opinions were received?  Dr. Osborne also indicated in her presentation that she first became aware that there was a process under way on the reappointment of the CEO when she was asked to attend a meeting of the appointments and remuneration committee on 14 April.  Who asked her to attend that committee meeting?  Was she appointed to it by the board?  It does not say that certainly, but she says she was asked and has outlined that she had concerns following on from that in that she was one of two people on the board and was there because she was asked to be.  Mr. Powell referred to the issue of a breach of Government guidelines and a failure of corporate governance and indicated that as the reason he opposed it.  The contractual issues seem to run through the presentations as being very much to the forefront of considerations.  Certainly, we need further clarification on that.</p><p> Did the chairman, Mr. Keeling, at any stage inform either the Minister or civil servants that he was scoping out the potential for a third reappointment and that it had not been discussed by the board?  Was the Department made aware that it had not been discussed by the board and that he was scoping out its reaction and whether it would approve it or was the Department working on the basis, as far as Mr. Keeling was concerned, that he was engaging with it with full board approval and authority to seek this unprecedented third extension?</p></speech>

It is very important to bring clarity and, hopefully, closure to this issue.  We are all aware of the importance of the horse racing industry to the economy.  Can I get some clarity on the actual process?  It was well flagged five years ago that a new CEO would be in place by this time 2016.  What succession planning and processes were put in place?  It was not a surprise that the CEO contract had to be renegotiated or a new CEO appointed.  What independent external advice did the board get on that?  Did it advertise the role, were there applications and, if so, how many?  If it did not advertise, why did it not take that step?  It comes down to the whole issue of due process and the actual corporate governance.  In a nutshell, as an entity, what process did the board put in place five years ago for the succession planning around this event?  Did the board have a view five years ago that it had its man and would hold on to him in five years' time?  Some people looking in take the view that this was never going to change.  I assume we can get clarity on those issues because in a position of such importance for the Irish racing industry, transparency was very important for everyone.  As such, we need to get clarity on the whole process, the timelines and how this decision was arrived at to bring us to where we are today.  It is unfortunate because the board members are busy men and women and do not want to be in front of the joint committee.</p> <p>  Going forward, what process has been put in place to ensure that we are not in the same position in five years' time?  The board has seen the mistakes of the past.  Have we learned from them moving forward?  Clarity is required.  The witnesses might explain what advice the board got, from whom and when the process started.  Did it start two years ago or five years ago?  Was the position advertised?  How many people applied?  If it was not advertised, why was it not?</p></speech>

While we have an issue at hand, the horse racing industry in Ireland is very strong.  It is a matter of sentiment for many of the individuals here and the organisations who are represented.  That cannot go unsaid.  One glove does not fit all.  While there is a negative aspect here today and this is the one we need to get to the kernel of, we cannot overlook all the positives.  The chairman admits in his statement that this could have been done better and says he takes responsibility for it.  If he could wind back the clock, what would he have done differently, if anything, to avoid the situation, the questions being asked today and the negative spotlight being put on this scenario?</p></speech>

The hand-over to me took place over a three-month period prior to my start date in March 2013.  Prior to March, I had meetings with the previous chairman.  Part of that process involved issues regarding the chief executive's contract which were not addressed.  I took it from that meeting and from my first meetings with him that the succession plan was Brian Kavanagh.  When I took over in March 2013, I waited for 12 to 15 months until I was sure that I concurred with that myself.  I used my experience over 40 years as director, chairman and chief executive of the Keeling Group.  It was my decision and my judgment and I took the view that Brian was the best person for the job.</p><p>I took that view and I had unofficial contacts.</p><p> I believed the biggest issue with Mr. Kavanagh's reappointment was getting permission from the Minister.  I had unofficial meetings with him.  Members have all seen the letters.  I was reflecting the informal board decision.  Having been on a board for 45 years, I know when people are with one or not.  I felt the board supported the view, and I proceeded with that.  I believed there was no point in going to the board &mdash; this comes from my experience in a private company &mdash; until I was ready.  To me, the big decision was getting permission from the Department.  I focused on that.  At all times, I acted in the best interest of Horse Racing Ireland.</p><p> Senator Paul Daly asked whether I would have acted differently had I to do this over again.  I do not believe so.  I would always have acted in the best interest of Horse Racing Ireland.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1301" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Meta Osborne" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016101300002#E00200"><p>I wish to add to this.  There are two parts.  I was asked when I was asked to attend the meeting of the appointments and remuneration committee.  I was actually appointed to it in January and it did not meet until April.  There was the usual notification that a meeting was to take place.  At the committee meeting, we eventually got around to discussing the reappointment of Mr. Brian Kavanagh.  Something that came out of that process was that we needed a succession plan for the future.  When we came to the board with the recommendation that Mr. Brian Kavanagh should be reappointed, one of the very useful points that emerged from the discussions was that we should set up a special committee to examine that particular issue.  That is what we did.  There are three strands to it.</p> <p>  The first strand concerns having management development processes for senior management at executive level in Horse Racing Ireland with a view to identifying internal candidates who might be in a position to compete for the role of chief executive officer in five years' time.  That was a very useful exercise.</p> <p>  Second, there is now a defined timeline that works backwards from 2021, when Mr. Kavanagh's contract is to terminate.  There is a process working backwards whereby a job specification is to be drawn up, the position is to be advertised and an appointment is to be made with a six-month transition between the person taking office and Mr. Kavanagh finishing in the role.  That has been a positive lesson learned from what has happened over the past little while.</p></speech>

I focused on Mr. Brian Kavanagh, the most senior horse racing administrator in Europe, if not the world.  He has done specialised work.  He has a complete knowledge of the racing and breeding industry and holds senior positions with various international racing bodies.  He has an unparalleled reputation nationally and internationally.  I did not focus for one moment on the legalities.</p></speech>

There were two legal opinions received by Horse Racing Ireland, one in 2011 and the other this year.  They both concurred that there were complexities in this area regarding the potential for a contract of indefinite duration.  In any of these circumstances, one puts all the issues on the table and balances out what is in the best interest of the organisation.  I concur with the chairman when I say that, on balance, and with the contractual difficulties notwithstanding, the fact that Mr. Brian Kavanagh was the best man for the job would have been the point that swayed us in his favour.</p></speech>

I believed it was a waste of money to have him compete a third time because he still would have won, if that was the issue.  That is why I did not focus on that.</p></speech>

As I said in my statement, the chairman was dealing with the relevant Departments and was to come back to the board when ready to do so.  The then chairman, Mr. Brosnan, passed on the task to Mr. Keeling.  I was waiting for Mr. Keeling to come back to us regarding this chief executive officer's position.</p> <p>  With regard to the view that Mr. Brian Kavanagh was the best man for the job, it is fair to say he has a wonderful record in Irish racing.  He is a chartered accountant by trade.  He was manager of the Curragh Racecourse and financial officer and chief executive officer of the Turf Club.  He has been chief executive officer of Horse Racing Ireland since 2001.  His experience and knowledge of this great industry, as it was referred to already today, is very good.  He is chairman of the European Pattern Committee.  He is chairman of the European and Mediterranean Horseracing Federation and also vice-chairman of the International Federation of Horseracing Authorities, which has 69 members.  He has an excellent record.</p> <p>  The chairman was asked about whether there was an interview for the job.  As the chairman stated, Mr. Kavanagh has gone through two interviews and won them.  The possibility of anybody beating him would not have arisen.</p></speech>

Mr. Kavanagh signed his contract but two issues remained outstanding.  In fairness to Mr. Keeling, who is doing his job for nothing and whose commitment to the industry is evident, he was left with a fairly difficult situation.  The contract was never concluded as such and Mr. Kavanagh's employment, in effect, was left in free flow.  Does Mr. Keeling agree that is what happened?  The appointment in 2001 stretched out to 2009, which was beyond the seven years, 2009 stretched out to 2016, and now we are off again.  Mr. Keeling was trying to resolve the matter because he knew there was a problem.  He cannot deny that.</p></speech>

I put it to the Minister the last day that it was clear there was a problem.  Mr. Kavanagh signed his contract but there was disagreement over two issues.  One of the issues which held up the show, as I understand, was a provision that he was not to be reappointed to any position within HRI after his contract expired in September 2016.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1352" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1370" speakername="Willie Penrose" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016101300002#F02200"><p>Why was that not concluded as part of the contract?  It is a difficult one for Mr. Keeling, in fairness, because he was not there.  However, five of the members of the board at that time remain in position and should be able to deal with it.  It is an important issue.</p><p>In 2011, the board failed in its duty to finalise matters and did not carry out its functions satisfactorily.  Does Mr. Keeling agree with that?  The effect was that he was left carrying the baby, which is the kernel of the problem.  Is that not the reason Mr. Keeling wrote to the Minister in December 2014?  He has told us there was no business plan but merely a series of letters put forward.  To clarify, this is not about the individual in question.  Mr. Kavanagh is clearly a highly competent, well qualified person, apart altogether from his horse racing expertise.  However, it is somewhat unusual to make the case that because somebody is good at his or her job, that it is the end of the matter.  It is far fetched to claim that the development of the Curragh would fall asunder if that person was not in position.  There were a lot of other people who put their shoulder to the wheel to advance the Curragh redevelopment and all the other work that is going on.</p><p>We should not forget that &euro;60 million of hard-earned taxpayers' money was given to Horse Racing Ireland.  I was my party's spokesperson at the time and supported that allocation, notwithstanding that those were very lean times for most ordinary people, not many of whom would have had horses competing at the millions races.  I was somewhat bemused to read a reference in the <i>Irish Independent</i>today to a member of the board of HRI congratulating Mr. Keeling and Mr. Kavanagh on playing their parts in securing funding for the organisation.  This was great news, according to the board member, which put everything else into context.  The message was that it was all about getting the loot and the corporate governance thing was only a side issue.  It is not very encouraging for anybody to read that, especially people, for example, who are struggling to get a child into special needs provision.  I was very irked when I read it.</p><p>The delegates have devised a succession plan that is effectively an insider's charter.  It seems clear their intention is not to allow any outsider to compete for the position of CEO.  This insider's charter means there never will be fresh blood at the top of the HRI.  That is what the corporate guidance amounts to.  HRI executives are being guided to compete for the position and, lo and behold, one of their names will come out of the drum.  Why was there not an open competition?  Mr. Kavanagh did attend for interview in 2009, but how many others were interviewed?  We had a notorious row over anti-competitive practices at this committee a few weeks ago.  What we are hearing today puts that in the shade.</p><p>As a barrister, I cannot understand why legal opinions were sought if no issue had arisen.  The last thing one does is chase barristers or solicitors looking for legal opinions if there is no issue.  It seems there was sufficient concern for somebody on the committee or board to be wise enough to seek an opinion in that regard.</p><p>When Mr. Keeling first communicated with the CEO, he was seeking a three-year extension of Mr. Kavanagh's term.  Why was that changed to five years?  On 2 May 2016, Mr. Keeling wrote to the Department indicating the CEO's salary would be lower than that paid to the CEO of the Turf Club.  Does Mr. Keeling maintain that is the factual position?  I contend it is not.  There are very few CEOs who have exceeded the guidelines laid down by Government.  I was there when those guidelines were drawn up and when there were cuts to the pay of every public sector CEO, withdrawal of cars and bonuses and so on.</p><p>I am very grateful to the delegates for coming here today voluntarily and if I am wrong on the next point I wish to make, I will be glad to be corrected.  As I understand it, the board of HRI was not unanimous in its view on the reappointment of Mr. Kavanagh.</p><p>Mr. Keeling went to the Department with a letter listing all the positive things the outgoing CEO had done, including his international appointments and expertise and how important they were on the international stage - I do not doubt that for a minute.  Then when he got the okay from the Minister, he brought back the consent.  The Minister was going to hand out &euro;64 million.  No board could turn this down and say, "Well, Penrose has the approval of the Minister and with that is the &euro;60 million.  We would be shown to be very ungrateful souls".  Mr. Powell has submitted a simple note, which I appreciate.  I assume it was his board meeting in July that he was referring to.</p></speech>

That took a bit of doing and I salute people who stand by the correct thing to do in that regard.  If the big issue in 2011 was the reappointment procedure, how can we say five years later there will not be another row?  Is it written in a contract that the term is five years and that is it?</p><p>The Indecon report in 2012 was important and it made many recommendations.  We went through them <i>ad nauseam</i>in committee and during the passage of the Bill.  Will the board members commit to ensuring a value for money audit is carried out immediately in line with the recommendation in the Indecon report in the context of the funding that is made available to HRI?  Will that be done without any further delay?  Perhaps an independent review of corporate governance might be initiated as well.</p></speech>

When the Minister appeared before us, he assured us that the questions we had would be more appropriately directed to them.  I have no doubt that we will have to call him back because there are still some questions that need to be answered by him.  Mr. Keeling said he met the previous chairman on a number of occasions when he was taking over.  He said, "Brian Kavanagh was the plan".  I do not understand how he could have been the plan when his contract clearly stated that his appointment could not be renewed for a third term.  Mr. Keeling said he also did not focus on the legalities.  As chairperson of the board, it is his job to focus on the legalities.  He also said there was no point going back to the board with this because he knew when he had the board with him.  I do not mean to be personal but that is quite an arrogant way of explaining the position.  Surely, Mr. Keeling's job was to bring the board with him and to ensure if there were legal issues, he was aware of them and they were addressed.  The legal position was Brian Kavanagh was barred from a third term and, therefore, the plan should never been Brian Kavanagh.</p> <p>  The business case, which was talked up a great deal when this issue emerged, turns out be a series of letters and correspondence that went over and back between board members.  The Minister said when he appeared that the big part of the business case was the five-year plan for HRI.  I have looked through the plan and while I expect the management of the industry is important, the plan does not state that it hinges on any single individual on this planet, let alone Brian Kavanagh.  I, therefore, do not understand how he could be the only person that could possibly run this organisation.  With the best of good wishes to the man, if something happened to him tomorrow morning, somebody else would have to be found.  I do not understand how the board of an organisation in receipt of &euro;60 million in taxpayer's money could act in such a way and expect to get away with it, and then say it had no other plan and it did not focus on the legalities.  It is a flippant way of dealing with this issue.</p> <p>  Are many people awaiting reappointment who are not full members of the board?  Were they all properly appointed by the organisations that were supposed to have nominated them?  This comes back again to proper governance.</p> <p>  HRI is a sporting body.  Yesterday evening, Special Olympics Ireland, SOI, was rightly commended by the President at &Aacute;ras an Uachtar&aacute;in.  SOI received &euro;1.4 million in 2015 and &euro;1.2 million in 2016 compared to &euro;60 million for HRI.  That is a huge issue.  In 2015, &euro;53.4 million was awarded in prize money at horse racing meetings and HRI contributed almost &euro;35 million of that.  I come from County Leitrim and I know many farmers and ordinary people who are struggling to survive and who have a nag or two.  None of them makes it to the winner's enclosure.  I expect that the &euro;35 million was won by 20 wealthy individuals.  We represent the people here and this represents a huge transfer of public money to the wealthiest in our society and I have an issue with that.  As members of the board of a State body, the witnesses should also have an issue with that.  Many issues in the horse racing industry need to be addressed but the issue of where all this money is going is one of them.</p> <p>  I have a question for Mr. Moloney.  Has HRI just agreed to put &euro;6 million into a champagne bar at Galway racecourse?  If so, is that a proper use of taxpayer's money?  Does Galway racecourse have other properties at home or aboard?  Why should the taxpayer put money into this industry?</p></speech>

The point made in the letter was that if his salary was reduced in line with the new guidelines, he would be paid less.  That seemed to come out wrong.  If his salary complied with the guidelines, he would be paid less.  He is paid more now but if his salary complied with the guidelines, it would be less.  That was the point that was made but it was taken up wrongly.</p><p> On the betting tax, the thing that stuck me when I came in initially was that I could not understand why the betting tax was so low.  We have been pressurising the Government to increase the tax and there would then be no commitment from the Government to reduce the spend enormously.  I agree with ccc.  I could not understand over the past five or six years why the money should go to racing when it could be got back in betting tax.  We have a proposal in front of the Minister to increase the betting tax to 2%, which would reduce all payments coming from the Government.  However, that is a matter for the Government.</p><p> When I came in initially, I could not understand why the revenue from betting tax was so low.

Betting duty receipts in 2015 amounted to approximately &euro;31 million and the figure will rise to roughly &euro;56 million in 2016 as a result of the Minister putting a 1% levy on all bets struck in Ireland with offshore companies.  We were requesting him to increase the levy on betting to 2% in the budget, which would have ensured taxpayers would have had no liability.  However, we would like to thank him for the funding of &euro;6 million for the horse and greyhound racing fund.  It was a three-year agreement.</p></speech>

What is often forgotten is that while racing is a wonderful sport, it is also an industry.  The &euro;64 million coming into the industry is like a stimulus package.  The Irish racing and breeding industry is worth something like &euro;1.1 billion to the economy.  We have a strategic plan from the board of Horse Racing Ireland, HRI, whereby we hope to grow the figure to &euro;2 billion.  It is not just a case of taxpayers' money going one way; it is actually stimulating growth.</p> <p>  This industry, business and sport has been my life.  We have a stud farm in County Laois which my husband and I started in 2002, just after the new board of HRI and the new funding model came into being.  The development of our farm has been in parallel with what HRI has been trying to do.  A framework has been put in place to give people confidence to breed and raise horses in this country.  People talk about where the prize money goes and say it goes to wealthy individuals.  In fact, it encourages individuals to keep horses in training and pay training fees which help to pay stable staff, vets and farriers and for feed.  That is where the &euro;1.1 billion comes from.  As I said, it is a wonderful sport, but it is also a very important part of the rural economy.  There are stud farms and training establishments, if not precisely in the Deputy's constituency, pretty much all over the country, certainly in areas where there might not be other employment opportunities.  It is very important that we get the message across that this is a positive story.  While there may have been lapses and we are here to express our regret about the,, we want to look forward and make sure, first, that they do not happen again, and, second, that we concentrate on our big job, delivering that sum of &euro;2 billion.</p></speech>

It is a debacle and I am not sure they realise the seriousness of the issue.  In layman's language, the reason we are here is that there is a belief the board, or at least a substantial part of it, was, in essence, bypassed by Mr. Keeling and perhaps one or two others who, basically, more or less went a solo run to strike a deal with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine to reappoint Mr. Brian Kavanagh, specifically against the wishes of the Department of Finance and all rules of corporate governance for State bodies.  That is serious.  The board may ultimately have voted to back that position, but it is not accidental that it was faced with the decision initially in July, when the D&aacute;il was in recess, and finally in September, when, exactly as Mr. Powell said, the spectacle of two Ministers being embarrassed was evident.</p> <p>  The Minister has questions to answer also.  We were told at the time that the reason was a business case had been submitted by Horse Racing Ireland, HRI.  It is now clear that the business case which it has reiterated was along the lines of, "Big Brian is the best man for the job and everybody knows it.  What is your problem?  Move on."  That is not good enough and Deputy Martin Kenny's question has not been answered.  I honestly thought the delegates would come up with a different answer, but they have said that the succession plan was Mr. Kavanagh.  It was unlawful for HRI to do this.  The Horse Racing Ireland (Membership) Act 2001 specifically states the office shall be held for five years.</p></speech>

That has not been changed in the legislation in 2016.  We have a system of governance which is in accordance with the obligations laid down under the codes of practice.  The obligations of the board of Horse Racing Ireland are governed by two documents, the codes of the practice of 2006 and 2016.  I note that Mr. Keeling said the guidelines allowed an exception to be made where a person brought "scarce expertise or special qualifications to a role" and that that applied in this case.  I cannot find that reference in either of the two codes of practice.  It simply does not hold sway.  If Mr. Kavanagh were to get sick or die, would the racing industry be on its knees?  How is he going to juggle being a CEO in the organisation and all of his other international duties which the delegates have outlined?</p> <p>  There is a reason the guidelines are in place and State bodies are governed in this way.  Nobody should be in that position.  The only organisations in which it happens are in dictatorships such as North Korea.  I think the only other one is the Olympic Council of Ireland and do not think HRI wants to move in that direction.  It does not add up.  Mr. Keeling has admitted that he specifically went off to achieve an outcome that was against the guidelines.  There was no back-up plan; the plan was Mr. Kavanagh.</p> <p>  I would like Mr. Keeling to elaborate.  Does he accept that, under the code of practice, making appointments, remuneration and succession planning are matters reserved for the board?</p><p>The use of the word "reserved" in the code is significant.  That is the board's job.  The fact that a remuneration committee went off and did that behind the back of the board is a real problem.  The minutes would seem to back this up.  It is a real corporate governance problem.  I would like to know why in a letter to the Department, information was given that the board was to be informed about what was going on behind the scenes to reappoint Brian Kavanagh.  We were told in April that the board would be told.  Subsequent to that, however, the remuneration committee, which is subservient to the board, decided to exclude the board from that information.  That is a huge problem of corporate governance.  I would like to know who decided to bypass the board in that way.  Why did they decide to do that?  What could possibly be the rationale for that?</p><p> I notice in the opening statements that Mr. Keeling places a lot of stock in the press commentary that Horse Racing Ireland has put out.  It goes back to the historic dealings in September 2011.  As the witness said in his opening statement, "This task passed to me when I took over from Mr. Brosnan".  I would like to know who passed it to him.  Where was this documented and what was the involvement of the board in that situation?  What was the change?  A lot of what is coming out from the witness and in the press commentary is that this was an historical thing and that everybody was on board with Brian Kavanagh being reappointed.  I would like the witness to address the change in personnel on the board.  Did he talk to the board at that time?  Was the issue of Brian Kavanagh's reappointment discussed at the board in 2014, 2015 or 2016?  We know Mr. Keeling was going to a lot of effort behind the scenes to try to clarify that position with the various Departments in order that he could take up that position.  I would like an accurate appraisal of how much the board was kept on board on the basis that its members are the people under statute and under law who are charged with overseeing the remuneration in that regard.</p><p> I would like to tap into the question from Deputy Penrose.  The idea of a full inquiry into the whole area of corporate governance of Horse Racing Ireland over the last five years would be very good and beneficial.  I do not know what Mr. Keeling's attitude would be to that.  I need him to answer the point as to why Horse Racing Ireland thought it could break the legal restrictions put there for very good reason as to why people are not appointed.  Does the witness now accept that the salary is well in excess of the guidelines that are there now?  Is that the clarification?  I presume he accepts that now.</p><p> In her opening remarks, Dr. Osborne made the point that the importance of corporate governance is recognised within Horse Racing Ireland.  I put it to her that maybe that is contradicted by what she said later in her statement that Horse Racing Ireland has only now put in place procedures around these matters.  Is that not an admission that it did not have it before and in essence failed in its responsibilities in that regard?</p></speech>

They are getting a lot of questions put to them.  There are a couple of points on which I would like some clarification before I go into the issue of the CEO.  I come from a constituency in which the horse racing and horse breeding industries are hugely important.  There is the issue of the &euro;64 million and the value for money.  There is a split between national hunt racing and flat racing.  I would rather the split was more favourable towards the national hunt.  It is of greater benefit to many individuals.  While the prize money might seem strong, there was a time when all of our best horses left this country.  Thankfully now many of them stay here to race.  We have many big owners here but that prize money filters down through the sales.  Many small owners are able to make the selling of store horses a profitable business.  The distribution of the prize money should be something that should be looked at into the future.</p><p>Before I get  into the CEO issue, I want to make a point about the betting tax that was talked about.  I am a man who enjoys a day at the races.  Track bookmakers are coming under serious pressure.  I refer to the 1% tax and the need to have the licence.  We still have a lot of people who are betting illegally outside the licences and who are not paying the 1% tax on their turnover.  Track bookmakers and the way they are treated with regard to this tax have to be examined.  At any racecourse, whether it is horse racing or dog racing, the number of bookmakers has diminished very significantly.  I think the board should look at the way this tax is operating and the way track bookmakers must operate under it.  Bookmakers are the heart-throb of the industry and of racing.  It would be a shame if we lost track bookmakers.  That is something that should be looked at.</p><p>Mr. Moloney said that when the chief executive was reappointed in 2011, he raised the two outstanding issues on the contract and that he wanted the chairman of that time to sort him out.  I have sat on many different boards down through the years.  How many times was it brought up over the following three or four years as to what progress was being made on those two issues?  In terms of succession planning, in 2011 it obviously was the view of the board that a new CEO would be appointed in 2016.  Was there ever a formal discussion over the following two or three years as to what was going to be done?  If not, why not?  As a man said to me once, a chairman's job is to appoint the right chief executive and then the chairman can sit back and enjoy the ride.  I can understand that the chairman perceived that Mr. Kavanagh was the best man for the job and wanted him to be reappointed.  However, there are questions over the way this was handled and on the whole issue of corporate governance.  The chairman held up his hand and said there were things that were not done correctly and I accept that.  However, I cannot understand why a board, 12 months after 2011, would not ask whether progress had been made on these two outstanding issues or whether they had been dealt with.</p><p>A point was made by Deputy D'Arcy about the indefinite contract.  Was it always at the back of the board's mind that this was a <i>fait accompli</i>and there was virtually nothing it could do about it in any case?  If that was the case, it should have been stated clearly.  Dr. Osborne has said it was never raised as an issue that the contract was of an indefinite duration but surely the board must have had it at the back of its mind.  How many times in the intervening years, between 2011 and 2016, was the issue of succession raised at the board?  How many times was it brought up?</p></speech>

In Mr. Keeling's opening statement, he refers to his own business and I congratulate him on many years of job creation and so on.  However, he is not running his own business in Horse Racing Ireland.  I appreciate that in his business life, he would have sought to hire the best people, keep them on and achieve the best outcome.  This is a very different matter.  A very significant amount of public money is involved.  As he is aware, there has been a huge focus in recent years on salaries and appointments and that things are run properly.  The presentation today is not plausible, frankly, in terms of people of Mr. Keeling's experience not understanding fully the implications of what they were doing.  There is a need to elaborate further.</p><p>As for the existing members of the board, Mr. Keeling said that they are appointed properly and that everything is in order.  I seek more information on how long the board members have been <i>in situ</i>and how many terms they have served.  I seek clarification on all of the board members.  The witnesses are bound to have that information and if possible, they could supply it to the committee after today's meeting.</p><p>The next question is in respect of Mr. Brian Kavanagh.  Why is he apparently being paid &euro;50,000 above what is set down in the code of practice?  My understanding is his total salary is more than that of the Taoiseach.  Did Mr. Keeling also propose a bonus for Mr. Kavanagh, on top of that salary of &euro;191,000, which also broke guidelines?</p><p>Can I get an answer on that?</p><p> I understand HRI is a large shareholder in Dundalk Racecourse.  Right now, there are legal matters that could expose HRI to financial outlay.  One of the concerns people always have is that the State sometimes utilises taxpayers' money in a way that they would not due to the risk.  They would not engage in a legal dispute.  Can I have some clarification around that?  Is HRI satisfied that it has independent advice that it is right to proceed?

The salary level of the CEO is a matter for the Department.  The current Government guidelines allow for exceptions to be made.  Exceptions are made in situations where the person whose appointment is sought brings exceptionally scarce expertise to the role, which is relevant in this case.  Exceptions are subject to the approval of the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform and that was achieved in this case.  We did not make a decision on it.  We can reply to the committee on the question on Dundalk afterwards as we do not have that information here.</p></speech>

I was asked about prize money.  Deputy Cahill comes from a very special county in horse racing terms.  We saw over the weekend, as was mentioned, the amount of prize money that came back to County Tipperary which was won by a wonderful racehorse in France in what is probably the richest race in the world.  One should be proud to have that trainer, jockey and owner living in one's constituency.  Regarding the national hunt and flat racing, we are always trying to find a balance.  On the programmes and fixtures committee, we are always trying to make that divide as near as possible.  With regard to flat racing, the prize money for the international races, as we had during the champions weekend here not so long ago, is very successful.  It was won by a French horse.  There are swings and roundabouts and it can go out of the country as well as being won here.  We have a wonderful national hunt breed in this country and all those who subscribe to that should be complimented whether in our point-to-point field or national hunt racing on Mondays and on any other day.  There is racing in Punchestown today and we would all rather be there.  It is being looked after as well as possible within the industry.</p></speech>

I joined the board in December 2013.  We had a half day session on corporate governance in the spring of 2014.  That took place for a variety of reasons, not least of which was the fact that we were waiting for the HRI Act to come into being.  The board has been in transition for the last two and a half years.  I referred in my opening statement to formal, mandatory corporate governance training now that we finally have clarity on the composition of the board and a better idea of when people's terms will expire and their successors will be appointed.  We can now set in train a proper programme.  We recognise absolutely the need for that.  The last couple of years have seen the board in a kind of limbo which has made it difficult to progress this sort of thing.  We are absolutely committed to it being part of our training for board members in future.</p></speech>

I would meet the members of the board at race meetings.  I would meet the members of the board more often outside board meetings.  The board met every six weeks to two months but I would meet the board members every Saturday and Sunday.  When we met at the races we discussed things that went on at the board meeting.  There was a great deal of informal discussion when we met.  We will change that in the future.</p> <p>  It took so long to appoint a new board.  I do not think there is a member of the board who has not tried to do the best he or she could.  They always acted in the best interest of Horse Racing Ireland.  I am really happy with the membership of the board.  The members show great commitment.  Members on the board have different views but that is good.  It is a very healthy board that has divergent views.  There is respect for one other's views.  I come from a family business and there are plenty of different views.</p></speech>

Where there is a difference of view, it is even more important that it gets aired at board level.  Mr. Keeling obviously inherited difficulties when he took on the role of chairperson but he indicated that he took the view that in his judgment, the incumbent CEO was the best person for the job.  He also said that because of that, he felt there was no point in going to the board to discuss it with its members.  Mr. Keeling may have been having informal discussions but he did say he felt there was no point in going to the board to discuss it with the members and that it would be a waste of time and money to re-interview for the job, because he was convinced that Mr. Kavanagh was going to be the best person for the job.  Will Mr. Keeling elaborate more on that?  There obviously were things that were very wrong with the way the board dealt with this process.  That is why we are here today.  In order to have confidence in the governance of HRI, it needs to be absolutely clear that the board fully understands and accepts the problems that were there and how they were dealt with and that the committee can be fully assured the board has learnt from that and that the issues will be addressed in the future.  From the responses to the questions today, that is certainly not coming across.  It is not apparent that there is a full acceptance that things should have been done differently and the correct procedures followed.</p> <p>  Will Mr. Keeling respond to the questions I put at the outset?  In respect of the initial letter to the Department, at the end of the letter Mr. Keeling's request for Mr. Kavanagh to be appointed was presented as being at the request and wishes of the board.  Will he please specify why he put that across and why he believed that, because it was not the factual position of the official position of the board?</p></speech>

There is only one letter, which went out at the very start, that said I had board approval.  Every other letter said it was subject to board approval.  Not all letters we write are perfect.

Perhaps Mr. Moloney can clarify this as well.  Mr. Moloney indicated there were contractual issues in 2011 which were delegated to the chairperson.  Will he clarify the exact nature of them?  Mr. Keeling also indicated in his address that in 2011, the HRI board asked the then chairman, Mr. Denis Brosnan, to deal with the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine regarding the CEO's contract and his ability to be reappointed.  Will both Mr. Keeling and Mr. Moloney clarify that the board mandated Mr. Brosnan to find out from the Department about the CEO's contract and his ability to be reappointed?  When Mr. Keeling wrote to the Department was he seeking the reappointment of the CEO or was he asking the Department for legal advice as to whether he would have to be reappointed?</p></speech>

A former party leader of mine, Mr. de Valera, said when he wanted to know what the people of Ireland were thinking, all he had to do was to look into his heart.  That was no mandate to disregard a Cabinet or a D&aacute;il.  All these contractual issues were present in the toing and froing to the Department with regard to a contract and whether it was possible for Mr. Kavanagh not to be re-awarded a contract.  Surely, as chairman of HRI, it was not good enough for Mr. Keeling to make his own judgment and his own call as to whether his was the right man.  Given all the issues surrounding it, legal and otherwise, it surely was simply unacceptable that this would not come to the board for a full discussion.</p></speech>

The spectre of the CID hung over this process like a dark cloud.  Therefore, HRI was effectively neutralised.  There was a rush to get the Minister to approve the agreement in order to avoid potential legalities in the future.  It is as plain as night follows day and the nose on one's face.</p> <p>  I am somewhat surprised by the comments made by Mr. Moloney.  Of course the board was negligent in 2011.  In September 2011 two issues were discussed with the board.  The chairman was then sent off.  When Mr. Keeling arrived in mid-March 2013, some 18 months later, the issues had not been resolved.  What did the board do?  Did it not discuss the matter every month and agree to get to the root of the two outstanding issues?  The board has a mandate.  What did it do?  Were Mr. Kavanagh, the Department or whoever else spoken to in order to resolve the issue?  The board sat on its hands for 18 months and said it was not negligent.  Is that good corporate governance?</p> <p>  I am impressed today, not by the level of response but rather the level of non-response.  Mr. Keeling wrote a letter to the Department which stated that Mr. Kavanagh's salary was similar to the chief executives of the Turf Club and Eir?  That is not right.</p></speech>

As I said earlier, I am not an employment lawyer.  I came onto the remuneration committee in April.  I saw sight of the legal advice which stated that there was potential for a risk in that regard.  That was not the only thing we considered.  If that was the only thing we considered, no matter who the incumbent was we would have said we were stuck and would have to take the person concerned.</p> <p>  We also considered the record of Mr. Kavanagh to date.  As I said, the board has been in a state of transition.  We need a steady hand, which Mr. Kavanagh is.  It was not the case that we felt we were being strong-armed into reappointing him.  We gave the matter full consideration.  </p> <p>  I have a minute - I am not sure whether Deputies and Senators have access to it - of a recommendation from the remuneration committee which I will read.  It states: "The remuneration committee support the extension of the contract of employment for a further five years based on the business case presented to and accepted by the Department, the efficient and effective management of the organisation by Mr. Kavanagh and taking into account the legal advice which indicates that Mr. Kavanagh has a contract of indefinite duration."  That document went to the board.  It was fully aware of the position.  </p></speech>

I do not think we are getting clarity.  This meeting has probably resulted in more concern rather than answers.</p> <p>  Two contradictory things have been said.  On the one hand, we have heard that the reason for the reappointment was that Mr. Kavanagh is the world's best in terms of horseracing and the world would not survive without him, but on the other there is an acknowledgment that there was a legal problem.  </p> <p>  The real issue for me is neither of those things.  Rather, it is corporate governance and the legal position outlined in the code of practice which states that the responsibility for the appointment, remuneration and succession planning for the chief executive is something reserved for the board.  I have heard nothing that contradicts the evidence that the board was not given ownership of that process.  The process was undertaken not by the board but by others outside it.  In his dealings with the Department and the remuneration committee, there are minutes that show decisions were taken to exclude information from the board.</p> <p>  In terms of governance of an important body in receipt of State funds, if we do not learn lessons from this we will have serious problems with regard to how the board is constituted.  I accept that many issues go back to 2011, but I am not getting the vibe that lessons have been learned. </p></speech>

I ask for clarity on it.  It is addressed to the chairperson from Brendan Gleeson, assistant secretary of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  It involves proposed amendments to the contract, as far as I can read from the minutes.</p><p>The first line in the contract indicates that the duration of the contract must be a maximum of five years.  Do I take it that the previous contract was of indefinite duration?  In other words, this is what the Minister wants to have included.  Did Horse Racing Ireland include a five-year maximum term or did it have to wait for the Minister to include it?  Who initiated the move to have a five-year maximum term?

Legalities seem to have dominated the process going back as far as 2011.  It certainly seems to be the case that there were two pieces of legal advice - one from Horse Racing Ireland's steed and one from the Department - that there was a contract of indefinite duration issue.  I find it incongruous, going into a third contract, that there is no clarity on whether a contract of indefinite duration still hangs over the tenure of the chief executive officer.</p></speech>

Perhaps we might get the information in writing and have it approved.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1531" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1244" speakername="Charlie McConalogue" time="14:30:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/AGJ2016101300002#N03300"><p>Whether the board wants the term to end in five years does not affect the legalities.  It comes down to what the contract states.  Since there have been contractual complications since 2011, surely the board has obtained legal clarity at this stage on whether there is a contract of indefinite duration.  Did the Department make it clear pre-2011 that there should not be a third extension?  If so, how did it come to pass that the board did not plan for this?  It strikes me that this got bogged down in legalities and that the issue of a contract of indefinite duration came up.  This is not only an issue for HRI and its CEO, there are parallels with the impact on and implications for other State boards of the Government's guidelines on there being one maximum seven-year term.</p></speech>

While I cannot comment on the legalities in the context of having a contract of indefinite duration, I think Mr. Kavanagh has accepted that his tenure will end after five years.  He has signed up to this and is a party to it.</p></speech>

It states there are issues facing the organisation and that there is a new draft strategic plan covering a period of five years.  Is that the basis on which the contract should be extended?  The letter goes on to state Mr. Kavanagh has overseen development of the plan and should be charged with its implementation.  Is that the reason he was given a period of five years?  We understood initially, when the lobbying began, that it would be for about three years.  I am trying to help the delegates.  Is that the reason?</p></speech>

It is a three-year project at the Curragh that will not be completed until 2019.  We have to remember that Mr. Kavanagh has many talents and that he will look after the project.  There is huge investment at the Curragh and huge confidence in him.  We have raised a sum of &euro;30 million.  Would we have been able to raise those funds independently without him?  It would have been more difficult to do so.  We had had the experience of losing money on a previous development at the Curragh, but Horse Racing Ireland lost no money as a result of the good practices put in place by Mr. Kavanagh.  There is a huge amount of development work being carried out and the process is very important.  The board has confidence in him.  We will be spending a lot of money in the next five or six years.</p></speech>

The legal responsibility to appoint a new chief executive officer was the board's, collectively, but it was not made by the board.  It was made outside it.  It was presented to it as a <i>fait accompli</i>..  That is the problem.</p><p>There are also issues about the money.  People have spoken about the salary scale.  Most people in my part of the world, if they were to spin the wheel on &quot;Winning Streak&quot; and win &euro;197,000, would think they were made up for life.  This guy is going to get that amount every year.  As far as I can see, people in this part of society are out of touch with reality and where ordinary people live.  That is my problem.</p><p>Another issue that has been raised is media rights.  There is an issue about satellite information services and the media rights contract.  Who negotiated that deal?  How much is it worth to Horse Racing Ireland?</p></speech>

He and I, in consultation with the committee and the chief executive officer of the Association of Irish Racecourses, negotiated the contracts.  They are very sufficient, but they are commercially sensitive, given the amounts of money involved.  However, they are of huge benefit to Irish racecourses.</p> <p>  The Deputy mentioned the strategic plan.</p><p>The key objectives of the strategic plan are to increase the value of the Irish racing and breeding industry from &euro;1 billion to &euro;2 billion, complete the current racecourse capital development programme, including the major development of the Curragh and Leopardstown racecourses, and seek the establishment of further schemes to succeed the current scheme.  All racecourse will partake in the capital development fund, which amounts to approximately &euro;100 million, of which racecourses will contribute approximately &euro;60 million.  Further objectives include to increase racecourse ownership through the expanded racehorse ownership department; increase employment levels and improve welfare in the industry; develop long-term multi-annual funding solutions to replace the current year-to-year basis on which funding is provided through the increase in betting tax from 1% to 2%, about which I have spoken; improve the racecourse product and support racecourses to grow attendances; support the Turf Club in delivering a world class regulatory structure for racing; and implement the Horse Racing Ireland Act 2016.  Those are the objectives of the strategic plan.</p></speech>

Since the establishment of Horse Racing Ireland in 1999, more than &euro;1 billion has gone into the horse racing industry.  This is a serious amount of money in a small country.  I have major problems with the culture that has been evident today.</p></speech>

In the period between 2001 and 2016, revenue from the betting tax amounted to &euro;627 million, which left a shortfall of &euro;400 million.  The horse racing industry provided &euro;627 million to the Government coffers in betting tax, which is a substantial amount.</p></speech>

Horse Racing Ireland was either extremely unlucky or grossly incompetent in this regard.  Mr. Kavanagh's appointment was extended to 2009 and again subsequently to 2011.  As a barrister, it is clear to me that the game was over in 2011.  The best county manager in the country might have an eight-year contract extended by three years.  The game was over in 2008 and at that point Horse Racing Ireland should have advertised or negotiated with the same person but the term of the CEO was extended until 2011.  I expect someone wanted the contract to start again in 2011 and continue until 2019.  Instead, it commenced in 2009 and continued until 2016.  Will the witnesses assure us that Horse Racing Ireland will have everything in place to ensure this shambles does not reoccur?</p></speech>

I have not heard enough today to reassure me that the board members took the primary decision or were kept up to speed about matters.  In response to my earlier question on the 2014-15 period, Mr. Keeling stated the issue of Mr. Kavanagh's appointment was discussed repeatedly at the board.  We know Horse Racing Ireland was in detailed correspondence with the Department at the time.  How many times was the issue discussed by the board?  Did it discuss the idea of appointing a chief executive officer by means of an open competition?  Did someone ask what would happen if Mr. Kavanagh was not reappointed and were alternatives to his reappointment considered?  How many times was the matter discussed?  Are these discussions formally reflected in the minutes of the board's meetings?  It is the legal responsibility of the board to deal with this matter and a problem arises if it did not deal with it.</p></speech>

There was an item in July 2015 when our chief financial officer retired and William Flood raised the issue of the fixed term contract of the CEO.  That matter was discussed at the board.

Guidelines and codes of practice are subservient to employment law.  Contracts of indefinite duration, CIDs, have gone through the courts, which have taken a very strong line on how contracts are applied.  When a contract is extended even one day beyond its term, the holder has a contract of indefinite duration.  Regardless of whether we like it, that is what the board was left with.</p></speech>

I come from a single parent family and I am a full-time second year journalism and visual media scholarship student at Griffith College Dublin.  I thank the joint committee for the kind invitation to attending this hearing.<br/><br/>First, we welcome the statement of the Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton, that he proposes to reintroduce grants for part-time post-graduate students but he has forgotten us.  We are Wake Up SUSI.  We represent about 200 students, eligible for SUSI funding, who applied via the CAO for a full-time QQI validated degree at State recognised institutions that award up to masters level 9 on the NFQ.  Our students, from low-income and single parent families, want the same State funding as other third level students attending similar QQI approved institutions.  We are not the so-called privileged students that attend private colleges.<br/><br/>In the past 12 months, we have met SUSI, the HEA, civil servants from the Departments of Education and Skills and Public Expenditure and Reform and over 30 members of the Seanad and D&aacute;il, some of whom kindly tabled parliamentary questions on our behalf.  The recently published Cassells report on the funding of higher education recommends that low-income families whose children choose to attend private colleges should receive SUSI funding.  Following publication of this report, we met with the Minister, Deputy Bruton.  He spent over 35 minutes with us and listened to our case.  The Minister noted that Cassells recommended that SUSI grants be extended to our eligible students but he said that he would not make a decision in that regard until this committee had reported to him on the Cassells report.<br/><br/>Ladies and gentlemen, we are in your hands.  We are worried and concerned that in the committee's deliberations on the Cassells report all the attention will be on the issue of student loans and our case will be missed.  We are heartened that we have been invited here today.  We hope that the committee will support us as the Minister, Deputy Bruton, made it clear he will listen to the committee's recommendations.<br/><br/>I am accompanied this morning by other members of the Wake Up SUSI committee.  I will shortly ask each of them to make a one-minute statement on how this inequity is affecting them and their families.  My first question for the committee is how can SUSI not give those of us from single-parent families and low-income households our entitlement?  How can the State on the one hand fund private secondary schools to the tune of over &euro;100 million a year, encourage private health care, private transport and private media and ignore our discrimination?<b></b>We are not here on behalf of the colleges we attend: we want funding for our QQI full-time course.  Essentially, we are looking for equality for Irish students regardless of the institution they attend.<br/><br/>My second question is why are we being discriminated against for having chosen to undertaken a QQI full-time degree course at a reputable private college?  We chose Griffith College, the Dublin Business School and the Irish College of Humanities and Applied Sciences because of their reputations and their ability to nurture the student with smaller classes and excellent student supports.  Why can we not be treated in the same way as other students attending non-State owned institutions such as the Royal College of Surgeons and National College of Ireland?  We have learned that some students attending for-profit colleges such as BIMM, The Sound Training Centre and Setanta College, which are all very reputable and excellent institutions have been lucky enough to get all their entitlement as their degrees are awarded by institutes of technologies.  Our degrees are awarded by QQI.QQI degrees have the same currency as all other degrees awarded in this country.  I welcome the opportunity to highlight this point again in our discussion this morning.<br/><br/>We thank the joint committee for the invitation to attend this meeting and we ask that it make an early recommendation to the Minister, Deputy Bruton, as some of the students we represent are dependent on the Society of St. Vincent de Paul, hand-outs and credit unions to complete their education.  Some students have approached the HEA for assistance under its student hardship fund but they were refused as they are not covered by the SUSI scheme.</p><p>Imagine trying to pay &euro;600 a month for a room in Dublin without a SUSI grant or access to the HEA's student assistance fund.</p><p> I thank the committee for listening to me.  I shall introduce each member of our committee who will speak for roughly one minute each.  They are as follows: Ms Emma O'Sullivan, who is from Cork and is president of the Dublin Business School students' union; Mr. Pierce Connolly from Roscommon, who is president of the Griffith College students' union in Dublin and is the founder of this campaign; Mr. James Roberts from Cork, who is a Quality and Qualifications Ireland psychology student at Dublin Business School; Ms Suzanne Quin from Raheny, who is a Dublin law student attending Griffith College, Dublin; and Mr. Martin Byrne from Limerick, who is a counselling student at the Irish College of Humanities and Applied Sciences, ICHAS.  I call on Ms O'Sullivan to commence her contribution.</p></speech>

They have come to me to discuss how difficult they have found supporting themselves in Dublin.  These students are from low-income families.  They chose a private approved third level institution for its reputation and for a full-time QQI degree that was offered as part of the CAO.  I would like to share with the committee a blatant injustice.  These eligible students have been refused access to the back-to-education allowance and the student assistance fund that has given over &euro;43 million in the past six years to over 77,000 students.  Why is this the case?  Why have we not been included as part of the scheme?  In other private institutions students have been assisted.  As I am here to represent DBS students, I put that question to members of the committee.  I will hand over to Mr. Pierce Connolly, who is the chair of the Wake Up SUSI campaign and president of Griffith College students' union.  </p></speech>

My name is Pierce Connolly and I am president of students' union in Griffith College, Dublin.  I have gone into my fourth year of a full-time QQI approved degree in journalism.</p> <p>  I am eligible for a SUSI grant as only one of my parents works.  The reason I established the Wake Up SUSI campaign was because of the unfairness and inequity in the current system.  As president of a students&rsquo; union, like Ms O&rsquo;Sullivan, I have seen a lot of students who are struggling.  I want to make the committee aware that the State pays &euro;5 million each year for students to go to the UK and over &euro;2 million to students in private colleges that have partnerships with institutes of technology but yet the State will not fund us.  I have also discovered that more than 400 students receive SUSI funding even though they attend private for-profit colleges that have partnerships with institutes of technology.  I shall discuss further details of this matter with the committee but shall now hand over to Mr. Byrne.</p></speech>

I am a third year student in ICHAS in Limerick.  I hope to be a counsellor and then to go on to be a psychotherapist.  I am eligible for the grant.  I attended the University of Limerick for a year to study health and safety but left after one year due to mental health reasons.  I suffered from depression and the course did not suit me but I was drawn to studying counselling.  My college is one of the very few colleges that provide training in counselling.  The closest such college to Limerick is Cork but there are two further away in Dublin and Maynooth.  These three colleges were the only QQI-accredited courses in counselling that I could find.  Unfortunately, we do not get a grant.</p> <p>  For members who do not know, ICHAS is a very small college.  I can see the University of Limerick, UL, from my college and all I have to do is look out of the door and I can see it.  The only difference is that I am across the road.  When I crossed the road I immediately lost my grant.  This year I have to undertake work experience for my course.  For every five hours of work experience I must have an hour of supervision that costs me &euro;50 per hour and I need 25 hours of supervision.  I have no subsidies to pay for this.  My work experience has eaten into the time that I can work, as it depends on when a person is available to see me.  If there is time later in the meeting I wish to go into more detail about my story but for now I will hand over to Mr. James Roberts. </p></speech>

My Dad works hard for his family.  He is a taxi driver who works in the city of Cork.  There are five children in my family, including myself.  I am the second born and my younger siblings are aged 15, 17 and seven.  I have always wanted to study for a degree in psychology.  My family was very happy with my choice and encouraged me when I was accepted, on my CAO, by Dublin Business School.  It is a college that has a great reputation in the area of business.  I honestly did not know that DBS was a private college when I applied because the fact was not noted on the CAO form.  It was not until I was offered my college place that I was informed I would not receive a SUSI grant.</p> <p>  My Dad works mad hours.  He works a lot of hours just to keep me in the Dublin Business School.  Recently I got a job just to help him and myself as my tuition fees are &euro;5,900 a year and my travel and maintenance costs are at least &euro;700 a month.  There are very few colleges that offer a course in psychology.  If I attended the Dublin Institute of Technology, DIT, that is located up the road from the Dublin Business School, I would be entitled to a SUSI grant of &euro;2,800 and a registration fee of &euro;3,000, which amounts to nearly &euro;6,000 a year from the State.  Is it fair that my family should carry the stress and burden of loans?  I now hand over to Ms Quin.    </p></speech>

I am from Raheny, Dublin and I am entitled to a SUSI grant, including a registration fee.  I am also eligible for a disability access route to education, DARE, place.  I come from a low-income family.  My Dad was made redundant last year and my Mum is disabled and so receives a disability allowance.</p> <p>  I am a second year LLB student at Griffith College in Dublin.  I chose the college to improve myself and gain confidence.  The college also has an excellent reputation as a law school.  I hope to later share the story of two of my colleagues.  Ms Amy Liggett is from County Down.  She is a law student and is here today.  At the last minute she was refused funding to attend Griffith College and is now in a limbo situation.  There is also another student who has requested not to be named.  She has worked alongside the CLAY Youth Project in Crumlin and with its help, she was able to receive a scholarship to Griffith College but has since been refused a SUSI maintenance grant.  As a result she has found it very difficult to keep afloat financially while attending college.</p></speech>

The committee has heard examples of genuine stories and members must see that we are not the so-called privileged kids.  There are many more examples that we could give.  We have learned from our research that there are no more than 200 students who are eligible for SUSI grants but attend the three colleges, namely Dublin Business School, Griffith College in Dublin, Cork and Limerick and the Irish College of Humanities and Applied Sciences in Limerick.  As far as we know this is the total number of institutions that are impacted by this inequity.  I thank the Chairman again for the invitation to attend.</p></speech>

They have raised pertinent points.  I commend them on the work they do on behalf of the other 190 students who have been impacted by this matter.  I congratulate Mr. Connolly for starting the campaign.  Sometimes it just takes one person to stand up and draw attention to an inequity.  The committee appreciates the work the witnesses have done to bring this campaign to this point.</p> <p>  I ask members to indicate to me now their wish to speak and ask questions.  Mr. Byrne has addressed this point to a slight extent but I am interested in how the witnesses chose their colleges.  Was it possible for them to apply or attend other colleges that operate the SUSI scheme?  </p> <p>  The committee is getting into its work programme and will deal with the Cassells report.  I would like to hear the views of the witnesses on student loans.  Do they think they are a good idea for students in the future?</p><p>We will discuss with a number of different groups all the different options.  The witnesses are students on the ground, so I am interested in their views.</p></speech>

First, I welcome the witnesses here this morning.  I am inspired by them all.  They are a credit to themselves and their families, and I compliment them on their campaign and the way they have organised themselves.  It is fair to say there is something badly wrong with a system that holds such people back.  I for one, and I am sure other members, will give serious consideration to their request.  The number to which they referred, 200 students, seems minimal, and the cost of funding 200 people, if they are all on a par with the witnesses, would be a great investment for the State to make because we would get it back tenfold.</p></speech>

I met members of the Limerick branch of the campaign in Limerick recently and was inspired by the many stories I heard.  It is strange that all these courses appear on the CAO yet students are not informed so they go into the application process blindfolded and do not realise that they will not be eligible to receive any of the grants.  These are all very legitimate courses.  Taking Mr. Byrne's story, he did not have much choice; the course he chose was the only one on offer in his area.  I am sure many more such stories are replicated across the 200 students, so I take the campaign very seriously.  We need to consider it seriously because why should the 200 students across the country be disenfranchised while we pay for people to go abroad on courses and so on?</p></speech>

The witnesses' presentations were very impressive and have given us plenty of food for thought.  I have two brief questions.  One concerns what Senator Byrne touched on.  I am struck by Griffith College, for example, and other colleges that do not inform students of their status as private colleges.  Some of the witnesses referred to the fact that they had applied to Griffith College and only realised afterwards that the grants would not be provided.  Do the colleges make an effort to inform students in this regard?  Second, I am curious to know what SUSI's response to the students has been to date.  What kind of reasoning or rationale has been offered to them?  In other words, what is the other side of the story that SUSI is putting forward?  I am curious to know that.  I apologise as I must leave but I will pick up the responses afterwards from the official record.</p></speech>

I am amazed that only 200 students are involved in this matter.  The situation of the students affected is extremely unfair.  If the information being sent out by colleges is not clear, as in a couple of cases in which people genuinely did not realise they were applying to private colleges, that needs to be addressed.  I commend all the witnesses.  Are the other 196 students all fully behind this campaign?  Have they been lobbying as strongly as the witnesses on the issue?</p></speech>

The witnesses find themselves in a desperate and very unfair situation.  What we need to do as a committee is put our heads together and see what solutions can be found to try to make sure that nobody is discriminated against financially because of what would appear to be a lack of information being provided through the CAO system.  I thank the witnesses for coming before the committee.</p></speech>

I welcome the witnesses, a few of whom I have met already.  It is appalling that they are being left in limbo.  I think it was John F. Kennedy who said that education should be the greatest equaliser of all.  There is no level playing field in this situation at all, and I am a firm believer in equal access.  I was particularly struck by Mr. Byrne's contribution when he said that he lost his grant when he crossed the road.</p> <p>  Following on from Deputy Byrne's question, will the witnesses clarify they are only seeking the maintenance grants?  I submitted a parliamentary question on this matter and got quite a convoluted answer, at the end of which the Minister stated, "It is open to private higher education institutions that operate on a 'for profit' basis to use their own resources to provide financial supports to students that they consider to be in financial difficulty."  I am curious to know whether that happens.  Is there any sort of support being offered in any of these colleges?</p> <p>  Finally, I agree with the other members about the lack of clarity.  I think it was Ms Houlihan who, when I met her, said she was so excited to get the course she wanted only to find out she would not get the necessary support.  We need to tackle that obstacle as a committee for the witnesses.</p></speech>

The first question concerned student loans.  We have not made an informed decision as to whether student loans would be good or bad for us so we will not answer that question.</p> <p>  The second question concerned colleges letting us know whether they are private institutions, which is the case.  However, our problem is that when we apply through the CAO, we are not told that because we are applying for a particular college we will not get a SUSI grant.  One will not see that anywhere on the application form and that is our problem.  It is not that the college has not said that it is a private institution; it is that the CAO does not tell us that because we are applying to a particular private institution, we will not get a SUSI grant.  My situation is that I applied to Griffith College and then, once I accepted the offer, I was sent back a letter from SUSI stating I would not get any sort of funding from SUSI.  That left my family in a very difficult situation as we had to take out credit union loans, borrow from my grandparents and so on.  I know of further cases in which people had to borrow from the Society of St. Vincent de Paul as well.</p> <p>  Every student who is eligible for a SUSI grant but is not getting it is behind us.  It is just that we cannot bring 200 students in here.  They are fully behind us.  I have talked to so many students.  Yesterday I was talking to one who shook my hand and said, "Thank you so much for doing this for us.  This will help me.  This will benefit me so much."  The person about whom I am talking and who I will not name works ridiculous hours.  He does his college work and then goes straight to work four or five days a week after college.  In that regard, every student who is eligible for a SUSI grant is 100% behind us and backing us.</p> <p>  Other questions-----</p></speech>

This would be a huge help to us.  I would say &euro;200 would have got me out of a hole over the past two years I have been in college.  Luckily, the support in my college has been very good.  We were asked whether we have financial support.  My college is very good in the sense I have missed payments, perhaps more than I should, but there has never been any call to the office or a lock-out.  If I needed to pay it over the summer that was no problem.  If I wanted to leave it for two or three months and come back there was no issue.  If it can do anything to help me it will.  I mentioned I must do supervision for &euro;50 an hour.  My class went from 58 in first year to the high 20s or low 30s.  One can argue that a few of them might have left because the course was not for them, and that is perfect, but I know that in many cases the reason was cash.  They could not fund it.  They could not get the money together, and no matter how much the college accommodated them they could not get it across.</p></speech>

He states the Department has met the Wake Up SUSI campaign to better understand the case and see whether any facility can be extended, but that, as he mentioned, extending student support schemes which make up a substantial part of &euro;1.5 million spent on higher education to private colleges would be a very big decision with large financial implications needing budgetary provision and Government approval.

They will be sent to the committee.</p><p>There are three main ones which we have discovered.  One is that IADT has a partnership with the Sound Training College in Temple Bar, which is a bit of a distance away.  That is a partnership in creative music production which costs the State over &euro;150,000.  The DIT is in partnership with BIMM music college, which is the British and Irish Modern Music Institute.  That course is called "commercial music" and it costs the State &euro;1.2 million.  Finally, we have Setanta Sport, which runs a course in conjunction with LIT on sports strength and conditioning, which costs the State &euro;630,000.  Over the last year alone, &euro;847,000 was paid to approximately only 400 students attending these courses and getting SUSI grants.  I know one of them personally.  It was &euro;847,000 in just maintenance grants alone.  It is very unfair and upsetting.  These are private, for-profit colleges like Griffith, DBS and ICHAS but because they have a partnership with an institute of technology, their students receive a SUSI grant.  I think the members can agree that it is very unfair.</p></speech>

He has written to us about a number of other situations, of course.  We discussed that earlier this morning.  However, we will be happy to make a recommendation, in particular when we are considering funding for higher level in the context of the Cassells report.

It is a privilege and an honour for me to come before the joint committee as chairperson designate of the Higher Education Authority.  I record my thanks and appreciation to the joint committee for rearranging the original date of this meeting and facilitating me.  In opening, I will take a few minutes to give the committee some background on myself.  I woke up in the middle of the night last night thinking about this and I realised that I had not mentioned my family in the text of my opening statement.  My wife Carmel and children, Emma and Dave, are the rock of anything I have done and anything I will do in future, notwithstanding which I realised at about 4 a.m. I had not mentioned them.</p> <p>  I was born in Cork and went to the North Monastery Christian Brothers school.   When I left school, I went straight to work at Cork Corporation as a clerical officer.  After being a clerical officer, I was what was called at the time a "work study assistant" which was a role dealing with time and motion and method studies.  It was an unusual thing to do at the time.  From there, I joined AnCo, the industrial training authority and precursor to F&Aacute;S, as a training advisor and, subsequently, I moved to the Institute of Public Administration as training specialist.  I was there for approximately two and a half years before moving from the IPA to the Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland, RCSI, where I was an administrative assistant.  I remained in the RCSI until I stepped down as chief executive in December 2009.</p> <p>  During my time in the RCSI, I was involved in all aspects of college management, including student affairs, curriculum development, faculty administration, examinations, human resources, and project management.  Finally, I worked there as chief executive.</p><p>I was deputy chief executive for nine years before I became chief executive.  In the 1990s, I was also deputy director of a contract we had to manage in a hospital in north-western Saudi Arabia.  Later in the 1990s, from 1993-94, I was involved in the establishment of the first overseas campus of RCSI in Penang, Malaysia - the Penang Medical College.  In early 2000, I initiated and led the project of developing the first online surgical training programme, at the time the first in the world.  It is named BeST, which stands for Basic electronic Surgical Training.  This training programme comprised over 400 hours of online instruction in all aspects of the basic sciences of surgery.  It is still in use and continues to be an exemplar of what is possible in terms of e-learning.  In 2002, I led the negotiations and the team establishing our campus in Bahrain.  This campus has a purpose-built medical school building next to a general hospital.  The building was officially opened by President Mary McAleese in 2006.</p><p> Not long after joining RCSI, I applied to and entered Trinity College as a mature student on its evening course leading to a BSc in computer science.  Having completed that degree, I took a break of two to three years and then enrolled in University College Dublin to complete a masters degree in industrial engineering, which was also an evening programme.  Because of that background, it is fair to say that I have different or non-traditional view of education and, obviously, would be an advocate for flexible learning, lifelong learning or any kind of programme that makes it easier for citizens or residents of Ireland to access education in any form.</p><p> I am a chartered director, having completed the Institute of Directors programme and I currently hold directorships in a number of organisations.  I chair the Health and Safety Authority, where my term ends in December of this year, having served two terms.  I was honoured to be nominated for the first term by the former Minister of State, Deputy Dara Calleary, and for the second term by the Minister, Deputy Richard Bruton.  I should declare that I am not a member of any political party and never have been, although I am not sure whether that is a good or bad thing.  I also chair the board of TransferMate, which is a global payments FinTech company based in Kilkenny and part of the Taxback Group.  I am on the board of Intuition Limited, a knowledge management learning company based in the IFSC, where I first came across e-learning in the true sense.  I am a board member of Respect, the fund-raising arm of the Daughters of Charity services for people with intellectual disabilities and I have been chairing its research board for the past five years.  Through the stellar work of Professor Brian Harvey, our director of research, we were awarded a Marie Curie co-fund research grant with a total value of over &euro;7 million that will fund a total of 25 research fellows.</p><p> I applied for the position of chairperson of the Higher Education Authority, HEA, through the Public Appointments Service in January of this year and was recommended to the Minister following a competition run by that agency.  My background in education and a strong sense of duty to make a positive difference was probably my main motivation to apply.</p><p> The HEA was established under the Higher Education Authority Act 1971, with amendments in the Universities Act 1997 and the Institutes of Technology Act 2006.  It is the statutory funding authority for the universities, institutes of technology and a number of other designated institutions, and is the advisory body to the Minister for Education and Skills in regard to the higher education sector.  The HEA also has responsibility for the effective governance and regulation of higher education institutions and the higher education system.  As such, the HEA is the lead organisation for the development of a higher education and research system that meets the needs of Irish society and the Irish economy and is accountable to the Minister for Education and Skills for that leadership.  A key aim of the HEA is to create a higher education system that maximises opportunities and ensures a high quality experience for students.</p><p> The Irish Research Council operates as a sub-board of the HEA and is responsible primarily for funding early-stage career researchers across all disciplines, including frontier research - it uses the tag "From arts to zoology".  The vision of the council is for a healthy research ecosystem in Ireland which provides a diversity of supports and opportunities, and which enables the country to reap the full value and benefits of research.</p><p> Last year, the HEA was responsible for the allocation of &euro;1.1 billion in Exchequer funding to the higher education institutions and is responsible for evaluating the impact of that funding through reporting on system performance.  The national strategy for higher education to 2030 is a key challenge as it assigns certain operational responsibilities to the HEA.  These include reform of the relationship between Government funding and institutions through performance agreements, significant structural reform on a thematic basis and the process of technological university development.  The Minister has also set priorities in regard to the following: widening participation in higher education by the most disadvantaged socioeconomic groups by 7%; a 5% increase in participation by under-represented groups in initial teacher education; a 5% increase in participation by lone parents; and a 25% increase in the number of entrants studying on a flexible basis.  Other priorities include doubling the number of apprenticeships by 2020, increasing work placement or work-based projects as part of the course and significantly improving retention rates.  These are all exciting objectives and, with the collaboration and support of the leadership of universities and institutes, they should be more than achievable.  I have no doubt that, if this is implemented, our society will benefit greatly.</p><p> Research is a vital part of the work of third level institutions.  It is often said that the research of today becomes the practice of tomorrow, and that is true whether it is in medicine, technology, engineering or any aspect of academic study.  Research poses many challenges, especially funding.  Not everyone sees the advantages of research or recognises the outcomes of research in everyday life.  It is a long-term play and requires long-term commitment.  This is something not always obvious to the public but one of the truly strategic decisions any group of legislators can make is to provide sustained funding for third level research.</p><p> Most commentators agree that the current funding arrangement for higher education is unsustainable and that reform is needed to redress the cut in resources over the past eight years.  The projected increase in student demand in the order of 25% over the next ten years due to demographic trends will also put additional strains on the system.  The Cassells report has identified both the funding quantum and possible funding sources, of which the committee will be aware.  Once political decisions are made on these major issues, it will be the responsibility of the HEA to implement them.  I am very grateful to committee members for their time and attention and I would be delighted to answer any questions they may have.</p></speech>

He certainly has a wealth of experience both nationally and internationally in the education sector.  It would be interesting to hear a little more about the best education scheme, in particular in regard to online training, which is becoming increasingly popular.</p> <p>  Mr. Horgan stated that his main motivation in applying for the job was a strong sense of duty in regard to making a positive difference.</p><p>It is striking to note that Mr. Horgan is an advocate for flexible and lifelong learning, especially in terms of access to education.  Mr. Horgan referred to the low level of take-up by disadvantaged groups.  I would be interested to hear if he has any plans or proposed strategies to improve the situation.</p><p> He also mentioned the Cassells report.  We are setting up a strong work programme for the next few months and we are interested to hear any views or observations on the report that he could share with us today to assist us in our work.</p><p> I am pleased to note the positive references in terms of doubling apprenticeships because it is hugely important to all of us in the skills area.  Any insights or observations he has on how that would be achieved would be very welcome also.  I will now hand over to my colleagues.  Members should indicate if they wish to speak.</p></speech>

I am conscious that he is the chairperson designate; he is not the chairperson or CEO.  He will not be the CEO so I will not test him on his knowledge.  What is of interest is his CV and his overall philosophy of education, in particular on higher education.</p> <p>  The question of funding is at the root of everything at the moment.  We have had a major political debate in recent weeks and I hope we succeeded in making a start and introducing change.  What is Mr. Horgan&rsquo;s view of excellence in education, in third level education in particular?  In recent years the major universities in this country have gone down the rankings and that is rightly partially blamed on the funding model and the lack of funding.  What can we do to improve that and is it a target of Mr. Horgan that we would have universities at the top level and then that there would be other universities and institutes of technology, which are all doing a particular job?</p> <p>  The Oireachtas has not finalised its position on the Technological Universities Bill.  It seems to me that there are arguments for and against it.  Some of the arguments against it relate to the fact that it was initially conceived from a cost-cutting point of view on foot of the famous McCarthy report and an bord snip nua back in 2009.  I know the situation has moved on since then but that is where it started.  One argument I have heard is that if that is the only reason, then why do it.  Some of the colleges that are part of the proposal on technological universities are very much rooted in local communities and people see it as being very important to keep a certain college in a locality because it serves an area where it is needed.  Where does Mr. Horgan see the Higher Education Authority, HEA, in that space at the moment where there are arguments for and against and the Bill has not gone through the Oireachtas?  In the past year, considerable funding was provided to pursue the model despite the lack of legislation.</p> <p>  That is all I have to say at the moment.  If there is time I might come back in at the end given that there are not too many members present.</p></speech>

Access has been a huge problem and it was identified in the Cassells report that lower socioeconomic groups are not taking up education.  Adult learning is also an issue.  Mr. Horgan went into education as an adult in later life.  Could he indicate what approaches are needed?  The Government has a strategy in place and it has acknowledged that there is a problem and that is good but we need action.  What action does Mr. Horgan consider necessary?</p> <p>  Educational funding is essential.  Politicians are aware that it is needed and that we cannot continue without it.  Have there been cuts to educational research over the years and has that had a detrimental effect?  What kind of funding would be needed to bring it up to the required level?</p></speech>

In response to the question about excellence in education, the problem with excellence is that one cannot measure it.  It is not a final point.  It is like quality.  It is a journey one is going on.  To me, excellence is something one never achieves because one keeps working to improve things.  If one looks at a quality improvement system, if one likes, one never gets to a stage where one says one is absolutely happy now that it has been reached.  Excellence is a word that is thrown around all the time but one cannot measure it and say this is it.  It is a perpetual road that one is on and one never arrives.  One needs other ways to measure it.  When one looks at the Irish education system, it provides all sorts of different services and outcomes in different ways, between the universities and colleges of further education, and in particular the institutes of technology.  They are all involved in education and they all consider that they are doing excellent programmes but it is what is appropriate to the country that we should be looking at.  We need an education system that suits the way the economy is going, the way the workforce is going, and the way trends are going in the sectors within the economy before we start to look at international rankings.</p> <p>  My view is that if international rankings improve because of what we are doing internally, that is great, but the idea of having international rankings as a strategic objective now is unsustainable.  The word "unsustainable" keeps being used.  There is a report by the World Bank on achieving world status in university rankings and the No. 1 factor in that regard is funding.  It is said that funding alone will not get one there but without funding all the other things that one needs will not be in place to get one there.  Therefore, one needs funding.  Last year &euro;1.1 billion was spent on third level education.  That is probably equivalent to the total budget of a relatively small college in the United States.  Without the kind of funding that is required, in order to go up the rankings one would need significant investment at this stage.  If we discovered oil off Kerry and suddenly we had loads of money coming in, of course one would do that but where we are at the moment, we need to get what we have working optimally and then look again at the situation.  If the rankings improve because of what we are doing well internally, that is great.</p> <p>  Technological universities originally came from the Colm McCarthy report.  That is probably where the idea came from but there is also the idea of having clusters.  From the HEA&rsquo;s point of view, it is a political policy so it is something that, if one likes, is handed over to us to progress.  In terms of whether it is a good thing or a bad thing, my personal opinion is that it is a good thing.  I do not see why there should be a difference in the qualification of those who graduate from institutes that are grouped together and are providing programmes that are approved by Quality and Qualifications Ireland, QQI, and are accredited.  I do not believe the qualification would be of a different standing or ranking.  Personally, I do not have a problem with the policy.</p> <p>  I will now respond to the question on access.</p><p>It is about the culture of the institutions.  If leadership does not filter down to all staff in the universities and institutes and access is not seen as a daily event in the work of an institution, it will not work.  I have seen great examples of universities and colleges having superb access programmes to reach out and identify students in pre-third level education and work them through the system.  It is most definitely a cultural issue within an organisation and it must be nurtured and grown.  The way the HEA can improve access to increase the numbers is through the performance measures we agree with each of the universities and institutes.  We are looking for access to be the front and centre in terms of performance.  It means everything.  It is not just for disadvantaged students; it is also for those who did not go to college full time and want to go back to get a degree.  That is very close to my thinking.  I know that it is already included in the objectives for the year, but it is something we must target to ensure we will be able to measure improvements in access to the colleges.  Once it becomes a habit and part of every day life, it will work forever.</p><p> When Deputy Carol Nolan asked about research funding, did she mean funding for educational research separate from funding for any other purpose?</p></speech>

In 2001 and 2002, when online courses became available, one did not have the same broadband speeds; there were ISDN lines and dial-up systems.  Downloading graphics took a long time; however, at the time we conducted research into how individuals learned.  The aim was to include it in the structure of the programme.  There have been enough developments both on the IT side and on the broader networking side that the issue of research into educational development probably needs to be looked at again.  Technology has become part of everyday life.  No matter where one goes, somebody has a mobile phone and he or she will know how to use a tablet and if he or she knows how to use a tablet, he or she will know how to use a PC.  Technology is now way beyond what used to be the barriers to online learning.   I suspect that funding for educational research will have to increase to meet the next wave of technology to apply education to real life.</p></speech>

I believe his replacement announced that she would only be staying on for a few months.  It is a key position.  Is Mr. Horgan aware of plans to fill it?</p><p>The Minister for Education and Skills, Deputy Richard Bruton, appeared before the committee a few weeks ago to brief us on the mid-year expenditure review.  The reference to the early payment of grants to universities and institutes of technology is worrying.  Were grants paid earlier because they were under water?  Were they paid early because the institutions were running out of money and reaching insolvency?<font color="#0000FF">  </font>Does Mr. Horgan have a handle on the overall scale of problem with their cash flows?</p><p>I believe the last real benchmark report on third level institutions was produced in 2013<font color="#0000FF"> </font>and indicated a significant decline.<font color="#0000FF">  </font>I know that we have had some quantitative and qualitative data since.  When will the HEA produce the next benchmark report to measure accurately the impacts on third level education in the past few years?</p><p>I raise the question of gender.  When I was preparing for this meeting, I learned on the HEA's website that in Ireland 81% of professional positions were held by men.  While women comprised 62% of non-academic staff, men comprised 72% of the highest paid.  While there are four female presidents of institutes of technology, there has never been a female president of a university in the Republic.  Recent media reports indicate that some institutes are struggling in meeting the challenge of gender equality.  I welcome the strides made in some colleges.  DCU recently renamed a significant number of buildings after accomplished women.  Because of initiatives such as Athena and Swan, 50% of candidates who are short-listed must be female.  What has the HEA learned to date in this regard and is there more that could be done?</p></speech>

The interim CEO, Dr. Anne Looney, is present.  She has very kindly taken up the post on a short-term contract and will be starting as head of the new institute of education in DCU in January or February.  A competition was held in February or March this year, but nobody was appointed.  The day before yesterday we started the competition to find a new chief executive officer which is a key position.  There are two major things that I will push to have done.  I will push for the recruitment of a new chief executive officer and a new strategic plan for the Higher Education Authority.  These are two major issues.  We hope to advertise for a new CEO sometime in the next few weeks and that we will have a name by about December.  It will then be a matter for the person to be appointed to give notice as to when he or she can start.  We might also have to negotiate with Dr. Looney and perhaps DCU at that stage.</p></speech>

However - and I ask Dr. Looney to correct me if I say something heretical - we have colleges and institutes that we class as borderline and that we need to mind carefully and so on in terms of funding.  That is for various reasons.  It could be that they are not meeting budgets.  I suspect that is why that funding has been moved forward a little.  I am guessing that is the case but I have not caught up on the matter yet.</p></speech>

What is the term of his contract and what does he feel he can achieve within that time constraint?</p> <p>  The post-Brexit situation is an issue that affects us all.  How does Mr. Horgan see that affecting his particular area, and what risks and indeed opportunities might there be for Ireland regarding Brexit?</p> <p>  He mentioned apprenticeships, an area which is vitally important to our future.  How does he see that developing?  A key issue for me is the speed of delivery of apprenticeships.</p> <p>  Earlier he talked about and seemed to be a champion of lifelong learning and online learning.  How do we compare internationally in these areas?  These are doors that can open up education to people who it would have passed by heretofore.  We should concentrate on these areas.</p> <p>  Finally, I hope I am correct in saying that institutes of technology are not allowed to borrow money at present to enhance their facilities and so on.</p></speech>

Regarding my achievements, in a first draft of my statement I put in what I thought I might do but I took them out.  Education is a very big ship, and to turn it will take a long time in all sorts of ways.  From my initial experience with the HEA, I would like to see the governance of the institutions change because, from what I have seen, I do not think they have governance that is fit for purpose  in place.  Many issues come back to the HEA, almost like a child to a parent, when the organisations should be dealing with them internally themselves.  I would also like to see a greater emphasis on the area to which Senator Gallagher referred in one of his last questions, that is, lifelong learning and access to it.  I would like to see that opened up much more, and I suspect that competition is what will change that.  Since I got word in July of my appointment, I have been doing much reading, and I found in one of the subjects that I followed up on with the Brookings Institution in Washington that one of its researchers is showing that the cost of education in the US is starting to drop.  That is because of competition, and well-known, reputable universities are now coming into the electronic age in the provision of education.  If that trend continues, it will have profound effects, both good and bad, on Irish education, but has very positive effects in terms of what it could make available to the population of the country.  It may be that one will not study with an Irish institution but with some other institution, which is interesting because competition will make the Irish education sector sit up and take notice.</p> <p>  My gut feeling is that Brexit is an opportunity for education in Ireland, in both the research and international student areas.  It is a matter of whether that will balance out the downside elsewhere of what it is being predicted in the food and agriculture areas.  However, there is, I suspect, significant potential for us within the education sector, so we need to be ready for that and ready to take advantage of it.</p></speech>

We have already had a round-table discussion with the heads of all the institutions and they have been making contact with, for instance, UK universities because there is potential for partnerships there, whereby we would be the EU partner and they would be the non-EU partner.  Then there is the identification of the markets that are big for UK international students.  We should be considering those also to see what the opportunities are there for us.</p><p>A question was asked about borrowings, and it is correct that the institutes of technology cannot borrow.  This is in the Act which established them.  The universities can do so without the approval of the HEA or the Minister.  It is just one of those quirks of the statutes.  It is probably why some of the institutes of technology are not on as sound a financial footing as others, but this is the fact of the legislation.</p></speech>

In addition, the report containing the agreed motion will be sent to the Minister for Education and Skills for a response.  Given that we have two motions on the same issue, I propose to ask Deputies Byrne and Martin to move and speak on their respective motions.  I will then ask Deputy Daly to move and speak on his amendments to Deputy Byrne's motion.  Deputy Byrne submitted his motion first, hence I will take his first and members may ask questions.  Following the conclusion of the debate I will put the questions in accordance with standing orders.</p> <p>  Deputy Thomas Byrne has submitted a motion that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills, being concerned that students in ASTI-staffed schools will automatically and unfairly lose 10% in their English exams this academic year, recognises that talks between the Department of Education and Skills and the ASTI are continuing in an effort to resolve this dispute but, despite these talks, the ongoing dispute between the ASTI and the Department over changes to the junior certificate cycle is a significant cause of frustration and concern to students and their families; that the position of the Department of Education and Skills that the students affected by the dispute, but not other students, will automatically lose 10% of their marks through no fault of the students, is deeply unfair to those students and cannot be allowed to happen and is placing an undue burden of stress on the students; and calls on the Minister for Education and Skills to instruct the State Examinations Commission, together with the National Council for Curriculum and Assessment, co-ordinated by the Department of Education and Skills, to devise and implement this year a new method of assessment for students who will be unable to undertake the classroom-based assessment of their English junior certificate cycle due to the non-co-operation with the junior cycle changes by ASTI members; and to immediately withdraw the threat of the punishment of students by the deduction of 10% from their English exams.</p> <p>  Deputy Catherine Martin has submitted a motion that the Oireachtas Joint Committee on Education and Skills asks the Minister for Education and Skills to move quickly to put in place a plan B to protect those students who might lose out on 10% of their grade in English due to the ongoing dispute between the ASTI and the Government.</p></speech>

As the motion acknowledges, talks are taking place between the Department and the ASTI on the issue of junior certificate reform.  I understand talks will take place again next Wednesday.</p><p>There seems to have been a huge gap between last November and the formation of the Government in May when much time was lost and wasted by the Department and the Government.  This is deeply unfortunate and this time cannot be got back.  We will have a ballot result from the ASTI, which is protesting outside the D&aacute;il today.  Many things are happening.  Fianna F&aacute;il remains deeply concerned about the 10% of marks, as do parents and children.  At this point, we are at a few seconds to midnight in this process.  If the ASTI is to do what the Department is asking it to do, or if there is to be any other move, it will have to ballot its members which will take some time.</p><p>The interests of children must be at the centre of all of this.  Talks are continuing, and I do not want to do anything to upset those talks, and the sentiment is in the motion.  While the talks continue and there is still hope that officials and the Government can sort this out with the ASTI, and the ASTI might be in a position to move on this and I cannot say whether it is or not, it might be wise for me not to put this motion today but rather to withdraw it, with leave of the committee, to resubmit it at some point in the near future, to allow these talks to continue and not create an atmosphere around them.  It might be more helpful if we did not pass a motion today.</p><p>The fact we are having this discussion here today, with two motions and an amendment to the motions on the table, should alert the Department and the ASTI to the deep concern the committee has about the issue, and the various parties on the committee who have engaged on the issue in the weeks since I have tabled the motion.  We want to see this sorted out in the best interests of the children.</p><p>I will withdraw my motion, but what Deputy Martin does is a matter for herself.  We will not be for or against.  We will abstain on amendments or motions to be consistent with our position today, but I may have to raise the issue again.</p></speech>

This is causing them and their parents considerable worry and uncertainty.  Talks are continuing, but a plan B is needed.  Since we do not know what the end result of the talks will be, the Minister must put a plan B in place for the students.  It should not be the case that thousands of junior cycle English students will enter exam halls next June knowing that they are down 10% before they even put pen to paper.  That would be unacceptable.  The Minister has a duty to put a contingency plan in place.  The results of the ballot will be revealed tomorrow and, as Deputy Byrne mentioned, the ASTI is protesting outside Leinster House today, but we need to put our children front and centre.  I appeal to the Minister to address this issue.</p><p>The aim of my motion is to put a plan B in place in order that no students are worried as they face their first State examinations.  They are already worried.  I am a former English teacher.  I know how stressed out students get.  There is so much talk about the stresses upon students these days.  Given that the first State exam places them under extreme stress, can we not soothe their worries and their parents' worries by showing that, if the dispute continues into June, the Department and the Minister will take action and put a plan in place?</p></speech>

Deputy Jim Daly has submitted an amendment to Deputy Martin's motion which reads that, despite these talks, the ongoing dispute between the ASTI and the Department over changes to the junior cycle is a significant cause of frustration and concern to students and their families.  His amendment would replace that to the effect that the position that students affected by the dispute and not others will automatically lose 10% of their marks through no fault of the students is deeply unfair to these students and cannot be allowed to happen and is placing an undue burden of stress on the students; that the ASTI's current directive is now directly negatively impacting on examination students; that such selective targeting of students is an unprecedented and wholly unjustifiable industrial relations strategy; that, as a result of the directive, current ASTI English teachers are now in their third year of delivering a new curriculum for which they have been prevented from receiving full professional development; that the Minister for Education and Skills requested the ASTI to provide an immediate derogation from its directive for current teachers of English while talks between the Department and the union on the junior cycle proceed; that the Department remains in discussions with the ASTI on this issue; and that the Minister for Education and Skills remains willing and available to engage with the ASTI on this issue; urges the ASTI to engage positively on this issue with a view to finding a solution; and calls on the ASTI to respond immediately and positively to the Minister's request for an immediate derogation from its directive for current teachers of English while talks between the Department and the union on the junior cycle proceed, and to engage urgently with the Department to resolve outstanding concerns.  I invite the Deputy to speak in support of his amendment.</p></speech>

No one has a monopoly on concern.  We all share a concern for the students and their education.  That we are discussing this matter is welcome.  As Deputy Byrne stated, this has had an impact, given that there appears to be some movement.  That is welcome and positive.  As a committee, we can play a part, but we must be careful when going down the road of tabling motions to the D&aacute;il.  By doing so, we are involving ourselves in a level of detail that might not be fully known to us.  I have reservations about the committee tabling motions related to an industrial relations situation and sending them to the D&aacute;il.  This is not for a second meant to take anything from our ability to discuss the matter, but getting the motion right will be difficult and challenging for us as a committee.  We could make matters worse rather than better.</p><p>At the heart of this situation are the students.  Other Deputies alluded to this.  There is discrimination between students who are being taught by ASTI members and those who are being taught by TUI members.  By tabling a motion to advance a plan B for a set of students over another set of students, we as a committee are furthering the existing apartheid.  That would be wrong.  All students should be treated equally.  As a committee, we need to tread carefully in how we proceed in this instance.</p><p>By insisting on putting a plan B in place, we are also asking the Minister to facilitate a directive by the union, which I am not comfortable doing.  I do not believe that it was the intention, but the directive segregates one group of students from the other.  I would have a difficulty with that.</p><p>By involving ourselves in industrial relations disputes in schools, we could be setting a precedent and be drawn into any other issue, grievance or division that arises if we proceed with a motion directing that a plan B be put in place.</p><p>What is of significance is that we would be undermining the integrity of the State exams by creating a plan B for one set of students over another.  By directing the Minister to create a plan B and, therefore, a divide, we would be fundamentally challenging the integrity of our examination system.  I appeal to the committee to be very careful before doing something like that.</p><p>As my amendment points out, that the union's directive targets the students' exams - I do not believe that it was intended in that way - is unprecedented.  The students are pawns in this situation.  That is regrettable.  I urge talks and hope that there will be greater immediacy as a result of this debate, but I would prefer not to agree the motion.</p></speech>

However, that does not get away from the fact that the children's marks are on the negotiating table.  Whoever's fault that is does not matter.  They are there.  That must be the committee's main concern.  The committee is entitled to take a view on this, but we should not do so today.</p></speech>

The have the same intent in that they both seek to have this issue sorted out from the point of view of the children.  In regard to Deputy Martin's motion, we are in the last seconds of this process.  I had intended to propose that an independent mediator be appointed but, of course, that has already happened.  It could happen again, I do not know.  It seems to me that a huge amount of time was lost in the interregum from last November to May this year.  That time cannot be bought back.  If Deputy Martin pursues her motion, to be consistent and to allow the talks next week a chance Fianna F&aacute;il will abstain.  Perhaps at that point the joint committee would invite in officials from the Department of Education and Skills and the State Examinations Commission to get their views on the matter and to encourage them to engage with the unions, including the TUI.  This matter must be resolved.  I hope and pray that the talks next week will be successful.  I believe with a bit of give and take, and putting the interests of the students at the centre, a resolution will be found.  The pay issue is separate.  The committee is not dealing with that issue at all.  As I said, in this matter the children's interests must be first.</p> <p>  Perhaps in terms of my motion and Deputy Martin's motion we should stay out of this for the moment in that in terms of this very discussion a signal has been sent out that we want this matter sorted and the children, in particular, looked after.  </p></speech>

This discussion has been worthwhile.  Ultimately all we are seeking is an outcome.  It is unfortunate that the children appear to be the meat in the sandwich but hopefully, Deputy Thomas Byrne said, a resolution is close.  For that reason, I will follow the same line as my colleague, Deputy Byrne.</p></speech>

I will not be supporting the amendment because it seeks to remove the action which I believe is needed to protect the children and to signal to the Minister that he needs to ensure they do not lose the 10%.  I am aware that the talks are ongoing but I believe the Minister needs to put a contingency plan in place.</p> <p>  On the point regarding the undermining the integrity of the examination, I do not believe that is the case.  There are already alternative models in operation which could help resolve this problem and provide a guarantee to students that they will not be adversely affected.  For example, students who do not participate in the oral component of examinations at junior cycle have their written examinations marked out of 100%.  This means that students who do not take the oral component of a language examination do not automatically lose marks.  This model, or an alternative, may not be ideal but we have to accept the urgent need to have a contingency plan in place.  It must be acknowledged that putting in place such planning requires a great deal of preparation and as such the process needs to start now.</p></speech>

We are all concerned for students.  On Deputy Martin's point regarding precedence, this situation is completely different.  Taking a student-centred view as opposed to a union-centred view of this particular issue the student has the choice on whether to take the oral and he or she is wholly in control.  The student is then marked according to his or her choice.  In this case, students have no choice.  The decision is being made for them or against by the union.  We cannot compare an apple and an orange or, this situation with the oral examinations process.  If a student decides to take the oral examination he or she will be awarded 40% of the marks for doing so but a student can also decide not to take the oral examination.  In that case the student gets to choose but in the situation about which we are speaking now the student has no choice.  That is why this is discriminatory.  My fear is that this would undermine the State Examinations Commission.</p></speech>

I know the engagement was brief this morning but I discussed my position with every party.  I thought it was useful to do so.  The matter, however, has been dealt with now.  The point is that this issue has reached the committee and we have collectively decided not to put a motion on the record to the D&aacute;il in order to help the talks.  Deputy Catherine Martin has now decided that.  The point is that it is done in the context of talks between the ASTI and the Government taking place next week.  We do not want to stand in the way of those talks and we are encouraging both sides to conclude them successfully.  By having the discussion and not putting forward a motion, we have decided that we will not interfere in that process for the moment although we obviously have huge concerns about what is happening.</p></speech>

We need to examine the resolution process, however.  Further, other members asked to table motions after the deadline had passed and I had a discretion on whether to allow them.  I decided not to allow them as we would be here forever if we did not stick to the deadline and would have ongoing problems and issues.  We are now clear on where we stand on this matter and I know we all hope there will be a positive resolution following the talks.  As there is no other business at this point, and I am conscious the D&aacute;il and the Seanad will sit at 11.30 a.m., the committee will adjourn.</p></speech>

I welcome Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton, Director General of the CSO, to today's meeting to discuss these topics.  Before we begin, I draw the attention of witnesses to the fact that by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  However, if they are directed by the committee to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to so do, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and they are asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the long-standing parliamentary practice to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I invite Mr. Dalton to make his opening statement to the committee.</p></speech>

I am accompanied by my colleagues Ms Jennifer Banim, Mr. Richard McMahon, Mr. Michael Connolly, Mr. Brian Ring and Mr. Ciaran Dooly.  The CSO operates under the terms of the Statistics Act 1993, which sets out the mandate of the office and the standards by which we must conduct our business.  Independent, objective, trusted and high quality official statistics are the cornerstone of any developed democratic society.  A key element in ensuring trust and quality is the legal guarantee in relation to the confidentiality of statistical returns made to the CSO.  Accordingly, we cannot discuss any issues relating to any individual person or entity.  Due to the nature of our work, the CSO is entrusted with a large quantity of extremely sensitive information by our respondents, both businesses and persons.  The legal guarantee we provide to these respondents is central to our ability to collect information and to the compilation of all the official statistics we publish.<br/><br/>The CSO operates in a dynamic global environment, driven not only by a shift in focus towards greater levels of scrutiny but also by the unprecedented growth in the volume and nature of data.  The CSO embraces the opportunities for official statistics provided by these changing trends.  We are engaged in a programme of modernisation and innovation and we are respected contributors on the international stage.  The CSO is the main producer of official statistics in Ireland but there is also a significant international dimension to our work.  Meeting EU legislative requirements, which have a considerable overlap with national requirements, accounts for almost 90% of our work programme and has been the single most important factor shaping the development of the CSO since joining the EU.<br/><br/>We have been invited here today to discuss three particular issues.  First, is the proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council establishing a framework for European statistics relating to persons and households.  This is known as the integrated European social statistics, or IESS, regulation.  Second, is a proposal for a regulation of the European Parliament and of the Council on the European statistical programme.  Finally, the committee wishes to discuss the methodology for calculating national economic output.  I propose to take each of these in turn.<br/><br/>I begin with the IESS regulation<b>.  </b>Currently, the production of European statistics on persons and households is governed by a suite of five stand-alone, topic-specific EU regulations.  The proposed framework regulation is designed to address this fragmentation and will provide a unified legal basis for the existing collection of social statistics from persons and households in sample surveys while enabling future integration and improvements.  The primary objective of this modernisation initiative is to move away from the traditional way of producing social statistics in silos to a more integrated legal framework leading to a standardisation of concepts and greater comparability across member states and surveys.  The proposed consolidated regulation will cover the labour market, income and living conditions, health, education and training, the use of information and communication technologies, time use and consumption.<br/><br/>The CSO supports the modernisation initiative and the overall objectives of the proposal.  We agree with the consolidation of the legal framework, the integration of data collections, standardisation of variables and wider use of innovative data sources.  However, we feel that the priority areas identified do not adequately reflect user needs and are inconsistent with the Beyond GDP initiative which focuses on broader quality of life indicators.  The CSO opposes some specific elements of the regulation including the  move towards input harmonisation, which prescribes how member states ask and collect information; the overburdening of the survey on income and living conditions; and the legislative vehicles being proposed by EUROSTAT which would significantly reduce member states' control over survey costs and burden.<br/><br/>I turn now to the EU regulation to amend the European statistical programme 2013 to 2017.</p><p> The current programme extends to 2017 and provides the framework for the development, production and dissemination of European statistics.  The extension by three years to 2020 brings the statistical programme into line with the multiannual financial framework applied by the Commission and takes account of new policy demands.</p><p> In addition to the existing outputs of the current programme, this amended programme aims to produce a broader range of information on topics, including inequality, poverty, material deprivation, services sector, energy and climate change.  There is also a focus on measuring progress on the UN Sustainable Development Goals.</p><p> While the CSO is broadly in favour of the amended statistical programme, we intend to challenge on certain amendments during the co-legislative process.  In particular, we are seeking clarity on the exact requirements before agreeing to the inclusion of annual updates of population projections and the development of any additional social survey outside the realm of the integrated European social statistics framework.</p><p> Finally, I will turn to the methodology for calculating national economic output.  The highly globalised nature of the Irish economy was demonstrated dramatically in July with the publication of the national accounts and balance of payments statistics for 2015.  The CSO compiles national accounts and balance of payments statistics in accordance with the standards set by the UN and the IMF and as required under EU legislation.  Adhering to the international standards ensures the provision of results that can be compared across countries and across time.  The statistics published by the CSO in the 2015 national income and expenditure publication, were compiled in accordance with these standards and accurately reflect the highly globalised and complex nature and structure of the Irish economy.  In this context the figures are highly relevant and play an important role in understanding the complexity of our economy.  However, as the CSO has previously stated, the headline indicators of GDP and GNP are now of limited value in providing insights into the domestic economy.</p><p> The level shift in GDP of 26% in 2015 was driven by relocations of entire balance sheets to Ireland, with the activity related to these relocations having consequential impacts on the results.  The relocated balance sheets were dominated by intellectual property categorised as intangible assets.  The practice of relocating intellectual property to Ireland has been growing in recent years, but the scale of the relocations in 2015 was substantial and added &euro;300 billion to Ireland&rsquo;s capital stocks.  Associated with the relocations were significant increases in contract manufacturing activity attributable to Ireland.  When the net effect of sales of products produced abroad under contract were added to Ireland&rsquo;s trade in goods, the balance of trade in goods and services in the national accounts doubled from &euro;35 billion to &euro;70 billion between 2014 and 2015.  </p><p> In the past, the impact of contract manufacturing activities on exports of goods was largely offset by imports of research and development services, as Irish companies made payments to non-resident parts of the group for the use of intellectual property.  However, when the intellectual property is located in Ireland, these offsetting charges do not occur, and the full effect of contract manufacturing is attributed to GDP, as seen in the results for 2015. </p><p> Additionally, the capital assets in the relocated balance sheets have also led to significant increases in the estimates for depreciation of assets in the national accounts.  As a result of this increase in the depreciation charged in Ireland, foreign direct investment profits attributable to the rest of the world are reduced.  These profits are a major part of the difference between GDP and GNP.  The lower levels of profits, due to the increased depreciation charges, leads to a narrowing of the gap between GDP and GNP.  GNP is often seen as a better measure of the underlying level of economic activity in Ireland, but as an indicator, it is now also elevated by these relocations.</p><p> To illustrate the impact of the relocations on GDP and GNP results for 2015, net national product, an alternative indicator, also published by the CSO in July from the national accounts framework that measures economic activity after the effects of profits and depreciation, grew by 6.5% between 2014 and 2015, compared to the 26% growth in GDP.</p><p> EUROSTAT visited the CSO on 30 August as part of the normal gross national income, GNI, verification process for national accounts and balance of payments statistics.  The meeting was very productive and the results for 2015 were verified.  EUROSTAT's summary report of the visit will be discussed at the upcoming GNI committee meeting on 17 and 18 October and the minutes of the GNI committee meeting will be publically available.</p><p> Ireland's macroeconomic statistics are built on the information supplied directly by companies and our broader range of data providers to the CSO&rsquo;s large cases unit, LCU.  The LCU is a unit dedicated to engaging with the largest 75 companies in Ireland.</p><p> As well as data supplied directly by the multinational enterprises, MNEs, the large cases unit has access to a wide range of data from CSO's balance of payments and business statistics surveys.  Additionally, the LCU has access to data sources such as trade in goods data and corporation tax data.  The broad range of information available to the LCU ensures consistent recording of activity across CSO outputs and its engagement with the largest multinational companies ensures that the complex structures of multinationals are correctly profiled and reflected in the statistics.  In 2015, the companies covered by CSO&rsquo;s large cases unit accounted for approximately 70% of industrial production, 60% of exports of goods, 40% of exports of services and 60% of imports of services.</p><p> The CSO is one of the few national statistical institutes in the EU to have a unit dedicated to profiling and to ensuring the quality and consistency of data provided by large multinational enterprises, MNEs, and the unit has developed significant expertise in globalisation activities during its years of operation.  This expertise is recognised internationally through, for example, CSO&rsquo;s chairing of the United Nations Economic Commission for Europe task force on measuring global production and invitations to CSO to participate in the global inter-secretariat working group on national accounts where changes to the international standards for national accounts statistics are discussed.</p><p> In a broader context, the growth in globalisation activities presents a significant measurement challenge for the CSO, EUROSTAT, the UN and the IMF, particularly around providing indicators of domestic performance for national users.  It is increasingly difficult to represent the complexities of activity in highly globalised economies, such as Ireland&rsquo;s, in single headline indicators such as GDP and GNP.  The CSO currently publishes sector accounts as part of the national accounts framework which give insight into the household sector and also publishes a breakdown to separate economic activity by multinational enterprise dominated and indigenous sectors.</p><p> A cross sector group has been convened by the CSO to discuss how best to meet user needs with national users and international observers represented on the group.  Indicators currently published by the CSO such as information on personal consumption and data on employment and earnings will form part of the solution, but the discussions of the group will also cover whether there is a need for additional indicators or for developments of detail in existing indicators.</p><p> The group has met twice and will meet a further four times before the end of November 2016.  The group will report to me, as Director General of the CSO, and the report will be published on the CSO&rsquo;s website along with the CSO&rsquo;s response to the report.</p><p> I thank the Chairman.</p></speech>

There was a suggestion earlier that some of the information the CSO was requested to compile was quite sensitive, that it would have required information on gender violence and sexual abuse and the CSO believed it was not the appropriate body to collect that type of information on the doorstep and that it could lead to intimidation and retribution.  Will Mr. Dalton elaborate on that?</p></speech>

The particular survey which Deputy Doherty referred to was on the table at European level approximately five years ago and it never made its way through the legislative process because there was not enough support across member states.  There was a great deal of concern about how one would collect sensitive information from people as young as 16 years in a household.  For example, if one were trying to collect information on domestic violence, the perpetrator may also be present at the time.  At that stage, there was a certain level of uncertainty in the statistical world as to how best to gather this information.</p> <p>  The current European statistical programme has not currently put that proposal on the table, although it acknowledges the need to collect information in this regard.</p><p>We would also agree this is an important area we should cover.  The question is what is the best mechanism to collect this type of information to ensure we do not put anybody at risk.  We must also ensure we collect accurate information and provide that evidence for policy makers and decision makers to address what is an extremely important issue.</p></speech>

I met with Rape Crisis Network Ireland at one stage to discuss how one might go about doing this and collaborate nationally with such an entity such to help us with the fieldwork.</p> <p>  The discussion at EU level is how one ensures one collects accurate information on this topic which is a sensitive and difficult area.  One can imagine going into a household to collect this information, talking about domestic violence when the perpetrator may be there.  There is much research going on in this area.  Some proposals are that it is much better to do this through computer-telephone interviewing, rather than doing it the traditional way of calling to the door with a laptop or a palmtop collecting the information face to face.  It has been suggested the best way to do it might be with telephone or web-based interviewing.</p></speech>

He also stated there is a concern with the overburden of the SILC, survey on income and living conditions, and the legislative vehicles being proposed by EUROSTAT, which would significantly reduce member states' control over survey costs and burden.  Can Mr. Dalton break down what that really means for the Central Statistics Office, CSO?  What type of additional information would the CSO have to collect which could overburden the SILC?  Would the CSO still retain complete autonomy in the collection of data and its analysis?  What does this really mean in terms of the harmonisation under this regulation?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1796" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016101300002#F00800"><p>The first action the integrated European social statistics, IESS, regulation is trying to do is to harmonise the definitions of particular variables across surveys.  Currently, one has a regulation for the labour force survey and a separate regulation for the SILC.  Taking a simple example, the definition for a "usual resident", the primary basis for the people covered in a survey, differs from that in the labour force survey to the one in the SILC.  That creates problems when one is trying to correlate it on an aggregate level between labour market data and data on SILC.  One of the key things they are trying to do at European level, which we support, is to ensure standard definitions for these core concepts and topics and that the same definitions apply across all the surveys.</p> <p>  A respondent is in the SILC for four years.  There are two parts to the survey.  There is the pure cross-sectional part which is where we provide statistics for a given year.  Then there is the longitudinal component where one is trying to track changes over time by taking a cohort of people and monitoring how their circumstances change over time.  In Ireland, we have three waves for the first three years and then one rotates out at the end of the fourth year.  The proposal at European level is to move this to six waves.  The problem we have with all surveys of this nature, not just in Ireland, is that one is trying to recruit people into a survey.  One is accessing information on sensitive topics such as income, material deprivation and measuring consistent poverty.  The first problem we face is recruiting households into a survey.  Once they are recruited, like every other country, the attrition rate is quite high because of the sensitive nature of the topics.  As one moves through the four years, the coverage of the longitudinal component reduces.  Imagine going to a doorstep and asking someone to engage with the survey for six years.  The concern we have, as do other member states, is the shift from a four-wave approach to a six-wave approach.</p> <p>  We will retain total autonomy of the SILC.  The SILC is a long survey, taking about an hour to go through it.  One is trying to engage householders who are busy and it takes place in the evening.  The proposal is now to include detailed questions on wealth, on top of an already difficult survey.  Our view is that this is not the appropriate place to capture wealth.  The appropriate place to capture wealth is in a dedicated survey.  This is currently organised by the European Central Bank, ECB.  The CSO undertook the first wealth survey, the household finance and consumption survey, with support from the Central Bank in Ireland.  That is an incredibly difficult survey, looking for access to information on income, which is current, but also on equities, deposits, house ownership and so forth.  It is a very difficult survey.  Trying to put wealth on top of a survey on income and living conditions is not feasible or sensible.  We are not the only ones who feel that way.  We will have to see how this proposal progresses through the co-decision process.</p></speech>

Making it as user-friendly as possible is some achievement.  We as legislators rely quite heavily on it to get the correct facts and data.</p> <p>  On the revision of the GDP figures of a 26% growth rate this summer, the CSO came under intense criticism, including from Members on the floor of the D&aacute;il.  The country was labelled with the tag "leprechaun economics" and the blame was laid at the CSO's feet.  What does Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton say to those who blame the CSO for this revision?</p></speech>

We also use a broad range of additional data sources.  The CSO is uniquely placed, not just in Ireland but across Europe, in that it has access to as broad a range of data as anybody can have when compiling national accounts.  We compile the data in accordance with the standards.  It is important to recognise there is no Irish, UK or French version of gross domestic product or gross national product.  There is only one standard.  We are legally bound to compile these figures in compliance with that standard.  We did that.  We knew the publication of these figures was going to create a reaction.  We did the right thing in what we knew were going to be difficult circumstances.  This is one of the strengths of the CSO, namely our independence, objectivity and integrity for data.</p> <p>  What is very important to recognise is that the accuracy of the data has not been questioned by anyone.  The figures were verified by EUROSTAT.  The IMF, the UN and the OECD have not questioned the accuracy of the data.  Instead, they have all spoken about how the publication of the figures in Ireland this year provided the basis for a conversation which had been going on for years around how does one deal meaningfully with globalisation in a national accounts perspective.  This had been happening in a conceptual way up until this year.  Our publication this year has moved the conversation into the real world.</p><p>The most important thing for us is that the figures we compile are accurate, independent and objective.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1800" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1288" speakername="Pearse Doherty" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016101300002#G00200"><p>I agree.  Mr. Dalton mentioned that GDP and GNP are of limited value in providing insights into the domestic economy.  The figure of a 26% rise in GDP, published last July, was an accurate reflection of the data in terms of how we calculate GDP.  The reality, however, is that GDP, in so far as how it is measured and how people interpret it, no longer provides us with a proper metric.  That was not just the case this year; there was evidence of it in previous years.  We heard about how contract manufacturing in previous years made up a portion of GDP figures.  When did a perception of the limited value of GDP begin to creep in, particularly in the context of globalisation?</p> <p>  The witnesses noted that intellectual properties being categorised as intangible assets and moved on to Ireland's balance sheets created &euro;3 billion of additional capital stock.  I presume we are talking about a small number of companies here.  If the trend in intangible intellectual property were reversed, Ireland would find itself with a major drop in GDP, which could put us into a statistical recession and see our debt to GDP levels skyrocketing which might, in turn, interfere with how the bond markets and so on deal with us.  That is as likely as what we saw last year.  How do we safeguard ourselves in a situation where a limited number of companies are moving intellectual properties between different jurisdictions, thereby screwing up our national accounts and potentially having various unforeseen consequences?  We are already seeing the contribution we have to pay to the EU increasing as a result of the situation in regard to intellectual property.  There could be wider implications if the situation were reversed.</p> <p>  The 26% figure was a revision, with the CSO previously indicating that GDP had risen by 6.7%.  I assume that revision was done in consultation with the large cases unit within the office, which deals directly with the 75 companies.  How did it transpire that the data provided by some of those companies to the large cases unit was incorrect and had been amended?  Was it the case that those firms did not provide accurate and timely information to the CSO, leading to the original indication of a GDP increase of 6.7%, and came to the office later saying they forgot to mention they had moved all their intellectual property from California to Cork or wherever?  Was the CSO left to deal with the fact there was an additional &euro;3 billion that had to factor into the accounts?  Is there any requirement on any of the large-case companies to provide the CSO with specific types of information and, if so, are there any penalties for their failing to do so?  Is the CSO following up any such failures?</p></speech>

The debate on that issue in this country has been going on for many years, since the 1980s.  At that time, the globalisation activity everybody was talking about was profit repatriation and transfer pricing.  Things have moved on considerably since then and now we are talking about contract manufacturing, corporate inversions, relocation of assets and so on.  The concern about GDP and GNP is not new; in fact, it goes back right to the 1940s.  Simon Kuznets, who developed the metrics, was of the view that post the recession of the 1930s, the focus in measuring economic activity should shift back to an income measure rather than a production and output measure.  What has happened since then is that from time to time, events will tend to resurface the debate.  Certainly, the publication of our figures last July resurfaced the debate in this country in a very real way.</p> <p>  We fully understand the difficulties the publication last summer of the GDP and GNP figures caused for our users.  We are not immune to that and are now trying to move the narrative beyond GDP and GNP.  That is difficult, however, because - not just in Ireland but globally - those metrics are the denominators for everything.  It is a conversation that needs to take place beyond the statistical community.  The legislative and policy community must also consider whether, in an environment where economic activity is increasingly globalised, GDP and GNP are appropriate sources of information.  We have already surfaced this discussion and raised the issue at European level within the statistical community.  Current practice will not be changed by statisticians, however, because we measure what we are told to measure.  The debate must happen elsewhere.</p> <p>  Going back to 12 July, the national accounts framework contained a great deal of information other than the GDP figure.  For example, the net national product measurement, which we published on the same day, showed a growth rate of 6.4%.  We published a figure for personal consumption and expenditure, which was showing a growth rate of 4.4%.  Employment, the data showed, was up 2.3%.  Last week we published sectoral data which indicated a growth rate for the indigenous sector of 4.4%.  Household income data were published the week before last from a national accounts perspective, showing growth of some 5.5%.  It is perfectly understandable that those figures were lost in the haze of the growth figure of 26%.  We in the CSO have a job to do to give greater prominence to a broader range of issues.  However, if we move in that direction while the EU and international community continue to base everything on GDP and GNP, it will be a very difficult battle.  We have already commenced discussion on these matters with international partners, including the UN.  My colleague, Ms Banim, has been asked to travel to Washington in November to deliver a number of talks and papers about what is happening in Ireland.  People want to learn from our experience because they know it is an issue.  Indeed, how Ireland has dealt with these matters is seen as a case study of how other countries might proceed, while pointing up the significant issues that may arise.</p> <p>  The Deputy's second question was whether the movement in intellectual property could go in the opposite direction, to which the answer is "Yes, it could".  There is no doubt it could happen.  Our view, however, is that as long as the environment persists which has given rise to the trend whereby IP has, for some years now, been locating in Ireland, we are unlikely to see a shift the other way.  In fact, we in the CSO expect we could actually see additional level shifts - not to the scale we saw in July but certainly additional level shifts in our GDP and GNP, because that environment still exists.  As such, there will continue to be question marks over GDP and GNP, which gives an urgency to the need for all of us to start thinking beyond those metrics and looking at other indicators like net national product, personal consumption and expenditure, the data contained in the institutional sector accounts we provide, and the indigenous sector figures we publish.</p> <p>  On the revisions, the first estimate of 6.7% was based on the suite of quarterly returns up to the end of 2015.  It is only at the end of the year, when all companies, particularly the multinational enterprises, are finalising their accounts, that they make decisions around pricing and location of certain issues.  That is why we end up having to revise the four previous quarters, because the multinationals, especially, make changes at the end of the year.  Early in 2016, when those entities were finalising their annual accounts, our large cases unit became aware of a number of cases that raised our antennae and led us to undertake a series of direct site visits.  In some cases, we had up to nine visits with the companies in question over a period of four to five months.  It is a challenging task because each of those companies might have 40, 50 or even 60 subsidiaries or affiliates.  Our first job, then, is to profile the entity and find out how many affiliates it has.  Second, we need to ascertain its residency for statistical purposes.  Finally, we must discover the balance sheet of the entity, its assets and liabilities.  That was a block of work we had to do over the first four months of this year.</p><p>That is why we have moved from this figure of 6.7%.</p><p> It must be remembered that the change in structure in some of these entities actually took place in the first quarter of 2015.  As soon as we found out about it, we engaged directly with the companies involved and undertook the site visits.  I think this is a particular benefit of our large cases unit.  The large cases unit in Ireland is seen as best practice across Europe.  Since July, a number of national statistical institutes have been in contact with me wanting to come and visit the CSO to see how it operates.  That is how it happened.  I hope I have answered the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

That is what the witness mentioned, yet we had the revision quite a bit later.  It is interesting that the CSO's antennae was raised.  Would it be helpful if there was a requirement on some of these large multinationals to inform the CSO, as opposed to it having to have its antennae raised for something that is to have a dramatic consequence for the country?</p> <p>  A new metric committee is being set up.  The Central Bank and the CSO will be involved and the Central Bank will report to the CSO.  However, the new metric will have no legal basis.  It may help us to have a discussion about how our country is going, how the economy is growing, is it really growing, is it in recession and so on.  We will be able to have a more informed debate.  The problem for the State at this point in time is that we have legally-binding targets that are measured not by whatever the new metric committee will come up with, though I wish it well in terms of its work, but against GDP.  With all of the conversations going on in the UN and the EU, it is unlikely that will be changed in the short term.  I am not sure whether there was any other country in the world that had a 26% increase in GDP last year.  We have an economy that is very reliant on multinationals, has allowed for a lot of corporate inversions, contract manufacturing and quite unique activities, though they happen in some shape or form elsewhere, but that are very concentrated in this country and that have thrown off our figures.  It has basically meant that they are meaningless for us as a metric.  What are we going to do?</p> <p>  The point I made to the witness is that if one of these companies decides to move its intellectual property to America next year, we could be looking at a GDP reduction of 20%.  Then there is the issue whereby we have legally-binding targets for debt-to-GDP to be reduced or deficit-to-GDP to be reduced.  We would have a real problem and there could be international spillovers in terms of the international bond markets.  That would cost all of us.  Is there any interim solution?  I know that the long-term solution is to have a more appropriate measure internationally.  I agree with the witness on that.  However, whatever we come up with will be an Irish solution to Irish problem and will not be recognised by anybody else in the world.  Has the witness any interim solution to try to deal with this?  Is there a way of dealing with this?</p></speech>

One of the things that I want to pick up on is something that we are maybe a little bit conscious of.  I fully understand the broad statement that our GDP and GNP rates are meaningless.  However, in a sense, they are not meaningless when one thinks about the debate we have been having since July.  We have had an incredibly informed and considered debate in this country since July on a very important issue.  While GDP and GNP are not useful indicators in regard to the performance of the domestic economy, what they do tell us about is the structure of the Irish economy as a whole.  What they have highlighted to us is the sheer scale of globalisation activity.  We all knew that we had a globalised economy.  We all knew that we had a quite concentrated economy in which a relatively small number of large multinational enterprises dominated our economic figures.  However, I do not think that any of us fully appreciated that the impact could have been this large.  In that context alone, I believe the figures are very meaningful and have highlighted an important issue.<br/><br/>I believe the Deputy is right in that there is a broader issue here and we need to address it.  What we do not need is an Irish solution to an Irish problem, though there will probably have to be an element of an Irish solution to an Irish problem.  We need to think about the broader national accounts framework.  There is a misconception that the national accounts framework is just about GDP and GNP.  It is not.  There is net national product, net domestic product, personal consumption and expenditure, and national accounts for the indigenous sector, which the CSO has done, <i>vis-&agrave;-vis</i>the multinational enterprise sector.  We can produce the institutional sector accounts and the figure I quoted earlier was about the households.  In a sense, the household figure is how Joe Public on the street feels the economy is performing.  That gives one a sense at an aggregate level of what is happening to him and how things are performing for him.  There are indicators that are already there that would be very useful.  We might have to improve the frequency.  We only produce some of them annually and I think we might have to do some work to start producing them quarterly.  Some additional breakdowns of the data would be very useful as well.  They are all the things that we are currently working on.  We are not trying to pre-empt the work of the expert group.  I am sure they will come forward with some additional indicators.  We have already started thinking about this ourselves.<br/><br/>The big issue the Deputy mentioned, and the one that I do not have an answer to is at an EU level and everything being based on GDP and GNP.  I suppose that, as statisticians, we cannot change the law.  That is not the realm for statisticians.  We can only deal with the issues that we are asked to measure.  The decision around the deficit being measured as a proportion of GDP, or the debt being a proportion of GDP, those decisions are taken beyond the statistical realm and that is a debate that needs to take place at a policy level.  It is an issue for legislators to look at a European level.  Whether that can change quickly, we do not know.  We can only talk about the statistical side of it.</p></speech>

I want to contextualise it a little bit.  Our ability to compile official statistics and to provide evidence for decision-makers like the members and for decision-makers outside of the policy of Government is very important.  If we breach the trust that respondents place in us by divulging any information, either directly or indirectly by anything we could say, we will not be in a position to compile economic statistics.  As far as I can go, I am not going to say it was less than five, ten or 15.  All I can say to the Deputy is that it was a small number of enterprises and I cannot go any further than that.</p></speech>

The difference in 2015 was the absolute scale of it.  I might eat my words and I had better be careful because I am on record, but it is unlikely that we will see a change of that scale again.</p><p>It is possible that we will see another of what we would call a level shift in the level of GDP or GNP, as long as the environment that gave rise to the current level shift continues to pertain in Ireland.</p></speech>

That was on the basis of interaction with multinational companies.  The ordinary person looking in will ask why that happened.  Did the CSO not consider preparing a publication which stripped out the exceptional items and, almost like a structural deficit, gave a structural GDP-GNP figure and then a real figure which would strip out the exceptional items?  Did the CSO consider doing that and will it consider doing it into the future?</p></speech>

The bottom line is that, internationally, we are judged like any other country by the markets and the rating agencies based on the metrics of GDP and GNP.  We can talk about the broader question but, for the next number of years, which are critical years for us, we are going to be judged on those two key components.  If we have another year where the figure is skewed, it is going to have an impact.  We are coming into a very difficult period, with Brexit happening next March, so we have a two-year period of major uncertainty.  To the ordinary person looking in, ultimately, this will be around GNP and GDP.  What is the CSO going to do, as the independent reporting agency on the national statistics, to ensure that if these exceptional items arise, there will be a presentation to the markets and the rating agencies which explains that these are exceptional items and explains what the norm for Ireland is?</p></speech>

We are already working on this and I have already identified some of the work we are doing.  The Senator can rest assured we are working very hard on producing a broader suite of indicators that will provide the insights international users need.

As an independent body, knowing how the markets would react, why did the CSO not give the detail that would allow them to strip out the exceptional items of intellectual property and so on?  Did the CSO not present two figures, one being the actual figure and the other being the real, ongoing figure with the exceptional items stripped out?</p></speech>

As we have outlined, the extent of the relocation of capital assets meant a &euro;300 billion jump in Ireland's capital stock due to the intangible assets that moved at the beginning of 2015.  This led to a significant increase in the estimate for depreciation in the accounts, as the Senator has identified.</p></speech>

It was significant, given the &euro;300 billion increase in the assets, and Mr. Connolly might have that information for us later.</p> <p>  We then saw the impact on intellectual property and consequential contract manufacturing on GDP.  We saw the impact of the depreciation on GNP because the profits that were being earned here in Ireland by the multinational enterprises were reduced by the large depreciation charge, so there was an impact on GDP and GNP.  If one moves to the purest measure we have of the Irish economy currently, given its structure, which is net national product, that removes the effect of profits and depreciation.  Therefore, we are getting to something that is within the national account framework that is a legally required indicator.  If we could get the discussion focused on net national product, it would move on the discussion.  Obviously, it would be a better reflection, when people are talking about the Irish economy, if we can get them to use that.</p> <p>  The other items mentioned by the Senator come back to volatility and what can happen in the statistics.  As Mr. Dalton outlined, these things can happen and they can happen in the opposite direction.  We have seen increasing globalisation activity attributed to the Irish macroeconomic statistics in recent years and our anticipation is that, given what is happening with Brexit, which the Senator highlighted, it is likely this amount of change and complexity in the national accounts is going to increase and develop.  That is why the work of the expert group and the international statistical community to move beyond GDP, if I may use a clich&eacute;, is critical.</p> <p> I would add that, as part of the block of work we are doing in the CSO, the expert group is attended by international observers, so we have people from EUROSTAT and the IMF, and the UN is also interested in contributing to this work.  There is an awareness among the international statistical community and the broader community who set out the legislation for what needs to be measured in an economy, that the discussion has to be had.  In that sense, I am hopeful we are now serious about a discussion beyond GDP.  I think that can feed into something that will really help the Irish user into the future.</p></speech>

Like Deputy Pearse Doherty, I commend the organisation on the work it does.  The information it provides is an invaluable source and resource for all of us, and I use its website regularly.  I thank the CSO for all of the work being done.</p> <p>  To start with regulation COM 551, does the CSO envisage this will have an impact on, for example, the quarterly national household survey in Ireland, which is the benchmark survey in terms of household measures?  I want to raise a concern in regard to surveys generally and imposing greater requirements on those being surveyed.  The CSO relies on the goodwill of participants.  We have done that survey in my own household so I know it is an imposition and takes time, given it is not just one visit but a series of visits.  My point is that the more the CSO adds to it, the more that goodwill will be eroded and it will become hard to get people to participate.  Will that survey change as a result of either of these regulations?</p></speech>

There are no significant changes proposed to the labour force survey.  The biggest challenges for us around the labour force survey, and around all household surveys, is exactly what the Deputy has referred to, which is the risk that at European level we decide to overburden these surveys.  The CSO is continuously engaging at a European level in always trying to convey the message that when we are engaging with people or with households, it must be acknowledged that people are very busy now.  Trying to maintain high levels of response rates is perhaps the biggest challenge for us now in the labour force survey and in all our household surveys.  That is the biggest issue.  My colleagues, Mr. McMahon and Mr. Ring, manage the labour force survey.</p></speech>

EUROSTAT's proposals effectively ring-fence the QNHS with regard to burden.  EUROSTAT is very conscious of increasing the burden but our real worry is with the SILC survey, which is the survey on income and living conditions.  The plan is to use that survey as the catch-all survey to measure additional items such as wealth, health and other characteristics.  On the QNHS front, I think we are okay from a burden perspective.  From the IESS regulation perspective, EUROSTAT is looking at assisting countries in modernising the data collection procedures and will provide support to all member states in moving to computer assisted web interviewing and other data collection techniques.</p></speech>

That is just a reality of life, despite the respect there is for the CSO and the reassurance it gives in terms of confidence reality and so forth.  I wish the CSO well in its efforts to engage in the process and, hopefully, there will be a sensible outcome in the end.</p> <p>  I will now turn to the issue of the national accounts and the GDP revision.  In replies to parliamentary questions, the Minister for Finance, Deputy Noonan, referred to one further element of that, which I do not believe is covered in Mr. Dalton's opening remarks.  The Minister referred to an increase in new aircraft imports to Ireland for international leasing activities that generate substantial fee income without significant employment effects.  The Minister put this in alongside the other measures dealing with contract manufacturing and IP assets being transferred.  Will the witnesses explain if that was a significant element also or was it a much more minor element of the revision?</p></speech>

At the press conference in July, the CSO made it clear that aircraft leasing was an element but it was not the significant element that led to the change.  As we have said in our opening statement today, the big factor driving the change in July was the combination of relocation of IP and the associated contract manufacturing activity that goes with that.</p></speech>

In the previous month, June, the Department of Finance published its summer economic statement and predicted real GDP growth of 7.8%, at that stage.  Given that the CSO had been working behind the scenes for a number of months, is the CSO prohibited from sending any signal or providing any information, albeit in preliminary form, to the Department of Finance to say there is a major change coming down the track?</p></speech>

Pre-release access is allowed under the European statistics code of practice but it is only allowed in a restricted number of cases.  For the national income and expenditure release, there are two named individuals who get pre-release access, one from the Department of Finance and one from the Central Bank.  They get the access at 8.30 a.m. on the morning of the release.</p> <p>  With regard to the rationale, if we go back to the core values of official statistics, and I am sure the Deputy is familiar with this, it is really important that when the CSO publishes statistics, the public trusts that what it is getting is an independent and objective assessment of the information.  Anything that might undermine that perception would potentially risk that trust.  The CSO, like all other national statistics institutes, applies the European code of practice on pre-release access.  The direction of travel at a European level is to actually eliminate pre-release access, but it has not gone there now.  The most important thing is that there is transparency in who has access and when.  The CSO has a register of pre-release access publicly available on its website and it includes the names of the individuals who have pre-release access for those releases, where pre-release access is provided.</p></speech>

Is it to come up with a new measure on the domestic economy?  Is the measure perhaps to be embraced further afield and be a catalyst for changes to measures internationally?

The group will also consider if there is additional analysis or breakdown that we can give of those indicators.  There is also potential for new indicators.  The group will certainly be looking at the potential to develop new indicators that could provide much better insights.  The overall focus is all about the insights into what is happening in the domestic economy.  The group is also going to make some suggestions about new presentations of existing information that can improve understanding.  It is about the CSO moving to providing insight so it is not just about publishing statistics.  It is about the idea of moving from producing data and statistics into information and knowledge.  I think the group will make some recommendations for us as to how we might improve that.  I believe we have already made some improvements.  I do not know if the committee has seen the second quarter publication where the CSO produced a lot more than it normally does.  We produced the electronic release, a press statement and a very useful question and answers document which answered some of the questions people wanted answered.  The Deputy might be aware of the newly launched residential property price index.  It had the addition of a video where we talked through what the new residential property price index could do.  Next week we will produce a new app where a person can key in a three digit code to get information on the average price of houses in their area.  The CSO is continuously improving its communications and dissemination and the group will help also with that.</p></speech>

Of course, this is not just the United Nations on its own; obviously, there is a huge level of stakeholder engagement with economists and policy-makers to provide input to that.  An inter-agency group has been established to start talking about the next set of global indicators.  That will take many years to develop.  Ireland has been invited onto that group.  The CSO's, Mr. Michael Connolly, has been personally invited onto that group because of Ireland's expertise in globalisation.

I wish to discuss the European collection instruction, particularly around the gathering of data on gender based violence.  I would have major concerns about that and I am glad that the CSO consulted the Rape Crisis Centre.  I suggest that if there are any moves in that direction, there are very useful statistics gathered by Safe Ireland and that anything that is done in the area should be done through Safe Ireland and Women's Aid in order to protect women.  Having worked in the area I can see that one needs to be cognisant of a great many safety issues.</p> <p>  The CSO identified a level shift in GDP of 26% in 2015.  I certainly think the CSO has done this country and others globally an enormous service in exposing what it did.  I know the discomfort around the publication of such a figure because it would hold us up for ridicule in terms of what was being produced.  It was very important that the CSO stuck to its guns in terms of the integrity of the findings and exposing that.  It is useful information in terms of letting us know how we are exposed as a country in terms of the 75 multinational companies and the concentration of and over-reliance on the activities of multinational companies that can move.  In the context of Brexit and related issues, this information is invaluable. </p> <p>  We have discussed the metric, and I have thought for a long time about measurement in the European context and how useful is information on GDP and even GNP in terms of our measurements.  I am glad that our statistics are feeding into the global statistics.  In Mr. Dalton's opinion, how long will it take before we have a metric that will have a legal basis?  I know the level shift of 26% in GDP cost us more than &euro;200 million.  I wonder what it might cost us in the future if the shift was the other way round and we were to be exposed to the bond markets?  I think that might cost us a great deal more than &euro;200 million.  Are we talking about months and years before we come up with a metric?  Can we come up with a metric that is solely on a European level or does it have to be a global metric?</p></speech>

On the question of how long it will take to come up with a metric, that is difficult to answer because we do not control the process.  The precursor to integrated European social statistics, IESS 2010 was IESS 1995.  That might give the Senator a sense of how long it can take to change global standards.  There is certainly a new urgency that we are consciously aware of at European level.  We have been actively engaged since July with the IMF, the UN and EUROSTAT and they are incredibly exercised by the importance of ascertaining how we can address this at European and global level.  That is reflected in the fact that we have observers from both EUROSTAT and the IMF on the expert group.  The next set of international standards may not be as far away as we think.  I think what the Senator is talking about in regard to international standards is definitely years away.</p> <p>  We are talking about multinational enterprises a great deal and that is wholly appropriate.  Multinational enterprises play an important role but I would not like us to forget the role of small and medium enterprises in this country.  The SME sector is very important from a labour market perspective and in particular in respect of regional employment.  The multinational enterprises dominate the level of GDP and GNP, and they are also extremely important employers.  Sometimes the SMEs have got lost in the conversation but we put a focus on the SME sector which plays an important role in employment, in particular regional employment.</p> <p>  I think I have covered the main issues.</p></speech>

I want to ask about the role of the CSO in employment figures.  I am concerned because in 2013, the CSO reported that 29.8% of the 61,000 purported new jobs created that year, that is 26,800 jobs, came from agriculture, forestry and fishing.  That figure of 61,000 new jobs was repeated <i>ad nauseam</i>as being an accurate figure when we know there were not 515 jobs created in the agricultural sector each week or 73 jobs created each day at the height of the recession.  I know that the CSO entered a caveat in terms of how it was reporting these figures.  I think this is where the weakness is but the media and Government ran with the figure that 26,800 new jobs were created in farming, when we knew that was not true.  In some way that is reflected in the lack of confidence of people on the ground in the CSO figures.  The people on the ground may not read the caveat or understand the qualification of the information.  How do we avoid that happening again?</p></speech>

We put a lot of effort and time into ensuring that the information we put into the public domain is accurate and to the highest standard possible.  I hope that is the position.  Mr. Brian Ring is best placed to answer the question on the specific sector.</p></speech>

I would have been part of the digest team since 2009, so I would have been involved in the statistics for 2013.</p> <p>  The Senator is absolutely correct that we would have informed users of the caveats around agricultural employment.  We would have urged caution in the interpretations of the trends at that time.  In terms of the message behind what we were saying, we would have acknowledged that we had issued with our figures for agriculture but what we had said at the time and what we still believe is that the sum of the parts was correct,  that the overall change in employment at that time was correct but the distribution across what we referred to as the NACE or the industrial sectors at the time was where we had the problem.  At the time that would have arisen from the work we have done, which we are continuing to do at present.  We are still working towards retrospectively revising the data to take account of what the Senator is saying.  We are capturing data from houses which would be termed agricultural.  Agriculture would stand out uniquely among the 14 broad sectors from which we produce data as being very focused on the location of the person in employment because agriculture would be very closely linked to farmers and farmers are very closely linked to farm dwelling.  What we would have said was that we were happy with the overall figures we would have published at that time to which the Senator refers but we would flagged caution at that time in 2013 about the distribution across the sector.</p></speech>

Surveys can be subject to sampling errors, and the sampling error for that sector was, unfortunately, larger than we would normally have.  We undertook a methodological project.  Our statistical methods and development team undertook a review of the quarterly national household survey, QNHS sample and we have now changed the sampling methodology behind the QNHS to ensure that those types of issues will not arise again.</p></speech>

It comes back to whether there is a role for the CSO in terms of information, knowledge and recommendations that can be made beyond producing statistics.  I ask Mr. Dalton to outline if he sees a role there and what is needed for it to be able to perform a more analytical role.</p></speech>

The role of the CSO changed in 2015 via two mechanisms.  One was through the change in EU law, which means the director general of the CSO is no longer responsible solely for statistics compiled by the CSO.  I am now responsible for European statistics compiled right across the public sector.  There are 15 other agencies in the State that currently compile European statistics.  If there is an issue with the European statistics now compiled by one of those entities, EUROSTAT will come to me and hold me responsible for addressing the issue.</p> <p>  The National Statistics Board strategy has also stated the CSO should be co-ordinating across the public sector to put in place structures and strategies to ensure that data collected for a primary purpose cannot subsequently be used for secondary processing in support of statistical products.  We have put a new directorate in place, our statistical coordination directorate, and are actively engaging across the broader public service to develop skill sets and data infrastructures that will allow all of us to make better use of the information that has already been collected and that citizens have already provided to us in order that we can provide better evidence to inform decision-making right across the system.  I am sure it will take time, but it is a process that is well under way.  We have had a lot of very positive engagement right across the system.</p></speech>

This committee has done a lot of work on insurance and on motor insurance in particular.  We suggested some time ago that the CSO might take on a more proactive role in the collation and publication of data related to insurance premiums and awards.  Is the CSO examining what role it could play in this area?</p></speech>

There have been suggestions regarding our involvement.  As the committee is aware, an expert group on the cost of insurance has been established by the Minister of State, Deputy Eoghan Murphy, and the CSO is sitting on that sub-group.  We are actively involved in that sub-group which, I understand, will report by the end of October.  We will not pre-empt the findings of that report, but subject to them we will then determine how best the CSO can support the provision of more evidence in this area.</p> <p>  It is important to remember the mandate and role of the CFO.  When we become involved, the information we compile legally can only be used for statistical purposes.  It cannot be used for regulatory or administrative purposes.  Of course, we can only put aggregate statistical data into the public domain.  The CSO can provide support, but only within the framework of our mandate.  We are happy to provide support and can see that we would have a role to play, but the main question is on what is the appropriate data source for some of this information, where is it best gathered and how is it subsequently best exploited to inform discussions.  We can give our expertise and input into that discussion very constructively.</p></speech>

Obviously, large multinational enterprises are required to provide information and they would be included in all samples.  Small and medium-sized enterprises are not included in samples every year.  We are continuously moving towards the broader exploitation of administrative data to support the production of our statistical data.  For example, in our annual services inquiry, we no longer survey enterprises with fewer than ten persons engaged.  We get the data from an administrative data source and use modelling techniques to produce information for that particular sector.  We produce a response burden barometer every year.  We have reduced the burden on small and medium-sized enterprises over the past number of years, and will continue to make the shift from primary data collection for small enterprises towards the exploitation of existing data sources, in particular administrative data sources.</p></speech>

It is a legal requirement on Ireland Inc.  The CSO fulfils the role of providing information to Europe.  The decision of householders to engage with the survey is voluntary.  That can present a particular challenge.  If response rates continue to fall, we will have difficulty in providing data.  The only place where there is a requirement on individuals to comply with our request is the census of population.  It is a legal requirement on every individual in the State.  That is the only case where an individual person is legally required to engage with our household surveys and personnel.</p></speech>

Generally, the CSO does not pay anyone for providing information to fulfil our legal obligations.  For example, the survey on living conditions can take up to an hour to complete.  The QNHS can take up to 20 or 25 minutes to complete.  The most difficult survey we currently carry out is the household budget survey, and we make a small contribution to households because they keep a diary for us for about two weeks and record information on every item of expenditure which, of course, we subsequently use to weight the CPI, which is critical for all of us.</p></speech>

If there are any unusual patterns, that obviously raises flags.  We have access to a broad range of data sources.  For every statistic we compile, we examine a broad range of indicators and use that to ensure the information we are getting is broadly consistent with what one would expect.</p></speech>

In some cases, it is not always possible to produce regional breakdowns, in particular where statistics are based on a sample survey.  I do not want to get too technical, but sometimes at county level the sample size is too small to be able to produce reliable and consistent data over time.  One could see a change, period-on-period, for example, for any particular county.  The change may not be an underlying change.</p><p>It could be down to the fact that the sample is too small.  Therefore, whereas to the greatest extent possible we will always produce regional data, in some cases we will not be able to do so.  The best source is the census of population, through which we produce the small area population statistics.  I do not know whether any members have had the time to look at the preliminary census results we published earlier this year.  We were able to produce details on vacant houses and vacancy rates down to electoral division level, so it is possible to go into an interactive map, click on any electoral division and be given the number of vacant houses.</p><p> A key part of our strategy is to try to build information from the bottom up, that is, collected at the most granular level of detail which, for us, is the Eircode postcode.  The Eircode postcode is absolutely essential to our ability to compile and provide information and evidence to policymakers or decision makers at the smallest level of detail possible or appropriate.  Vacancy rates are a prime example.  It is very useful for policymakers to be able not just to talk about vacancy rates at county level, but also down to small area level.  This supports potentially targeted policy interventions, as distinct from broad brushstroke interventions, into the future.  Targeted policy interventions are obviously more cost-effective, and outcomes can be more effective-----</p></speech>

For the census we were able to get the Eircode postcode at the point of collection so we will now be able to produce the broad range of statistics we collected from the census down to a variety of regional breakdowns, from electoral division area up to nomenclature of territorial units for statistics, NUTS 3 level, namely, county level, and NUTS 2 level.  We provide data by, for example, diocese and Garda region, so if somebody provides us with the digitised boundaries, we can build any regional structure from the bottom up because we have the Eircode postcode.  We now do this across all our surveys.  The Eircode postcode is now part of the core data collection within the CSO and provides us with the potential to produce far more regional data than we were able to produce previously.</p></speech>

One means the other.  The morning the CSO's statistics on the population came out, it was the first topic raised in the Seanad because quite a number of Senators were aspiring to reclaim seats or considering territory where they might have a better chance the next time than the last time because of the CSO's figures.</p> <p>  Regarding compliance rates and response rates, I do not doubt that the 75 large cases are set up in such a way that they engage with the CSO all the time.  However, what happens in that regard?  I cannot imagine that the CSO gets a 100% response rate from household surveys and so on.  Will Mr. Dalton give an indication as to what the compliance rates and the response rates are?  Does the CSO do any auditing?  If somebody fills in a form and writes something, how does the CSO know whether it is accurate?  Does the CSO trust the person or does it have metrics and look for outliers?  How does it all work?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1889" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Mr. P&aacute;draig Dalton" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016101300002#N00700"><p>I will take the last question about how we know whether the data are accurate, first.  Particularly on the business statistics side, we have access to a very broad range of information.  Regarding the 75 multinational enterprises covered in the large cases unit, we look right across a broad range of data sources.  Mr. Connolly and his team pull information from the balance of payments survey; all the annual business statistical surveys we conduct in Cork; the monthly and quarterly statistics, which we call the short-term statistics; the trade data, to which we have access; and the corporation tax data, to which we also have a legal right of access.  Therefore, for any given entity, we will look across the range of information and combine the data at source, and they will either paint a consistent picture or they will not.  If they do not, we must try to work out whether the discrepancy is explainable.  If it is not, we visit the company and tell its representatives that something is not adding up and ask them to explain to us the situation.</p> <p>  That is what happens in the case of the large multinational companies and that is how we can be absolutely sure that we have very high-quality data for them.  For many of the other businesses, we are able to cross-check on some variables.  The administrative data sources, such as corporation tax, do not always contain all the variables we need, which is part of the problem, but they do contain some variables that we can use to quality-check what the businesses themselves have provided to us.  That quality check across different sources is very important for us.  In many countries the balance of payments is not compiled by the national statistical institute, but by the central bank.  I think there are only four or five countries in Europe in which the national statistical institute compiles the BOP.  This is a real advantage for us, particularly when we are trying to compile things like national accounts, because we need access to as much data as possible.  That is how we verify the data.</p> <p>  The first question concerned compliance rates.  Compliance rates are quite good right across the board.  Regarding the compliance rate in our survey of households, we have a very good, professional field force.  We have about 100 staff, our permanent field force, who are out knocking on doors every day of the week, 52 weeks of the year.  It is a very professional group of people that does an extremely difficult job for us very well.  They have gained much experience over the years of how to gain compliance at the doorstep so, in fairness to them, they get a very low refusal rate.  However, it is getting more difficult because people's lives are becoming more difficult, but compliance rates are generally quite good.  We prosecute serial offenders on the business side because, as I said, on the business side it is a legal obligation to compile the information.  We will take them through the courts because it is important that we get compliance.  Our job is to compile accurate, independent statistics for the State.  Compliance rates are absolutely essential for that, and the trust that respondents have in us is important.  Non-compliance happens very rarely.  The compliance rate on the business side is very high as well.  We have a record of protecting the identity and confidentiality of the information provided to us.  That is a core value of the CSO.</p></speech>

Perhaps Mr. Dalton has already answered in speaking about the working group and so on.  The entire thrust of our discussions over six or seven days about motor insurance was the lack of available data.  Every witness who appeared before the committee said that he or she was giving enough data or that the data were there.  Would it be within the CSO's remit, if asked, to compile information on things like motor insurance claims?  I am sure it has the capacity to do so.  Of the claims, 10% are going to court, 20% are going to the Injuries Board and 70% are being settled.  We do not have data on the invisible 70% and are relying instead on people telling us stories.  We would like to see data on the number of claims, the increase in claims, the amount paid out per claim, the amount paid in legal fees, the number of claims relating to whiplash and so on.  Could that be done by the CSO or does Mr. Dalton think the Central Bank should or could be doing it?</p></speech>

At the moment one of the problems seems to be the lack of such a database.  In certain sectors we are able to go to an administrative data source in whatever Department and start to compile statistics from it.  We are trying to consider the matter in the following way.  We are involved in the working group on data needs and, as I said, that group will meet at the end of October.  We will wait and see what comes out of that report at the end of October and then we will engage constructively with the outcome of it and work with those involved to identify the most appropriate way to provide information on this very important sector.  We are very conscious of the need for this type of information but, again, we can only provide it within the broad scope of our mandate.</p><p>The most important thing is we would never get involved, and nor legally can we, in any regulatory or administrative type of activity.  If there is a regulatory activity which collects the appropriate data, we can use it as a data source to compile official statistics on the sector.  This may be something that comes out of the group.  I do not know.  We will await recommendations and engage constructively then.</p></speech>

It is reasonable to say that if the debt-to-GDP ratio is being spoken about and lauded as falling, it is also falling because GDP is rising.  It is a percentage.  The debt may not change, but GDP is changing significantly.  Stating the debt-to-GDP ratio has improved means it has improved relative to GDP, but this is because GDP has risen by 26%.</p></speech>

This is not something that can be achieved solely in the statistical world.  It is very important this conversation is broadened to the policy side and the legislator side, particularly at European level, to support the Commission, the IMF and the UN in their work in trying to broaden the discussion on globalisation.  This is perhaps where the most support can be given.</p></speech>

What I would say is GDP and GNP do not provide useful insights into what is happening in the domestic economy.  GDP and GNP are the international standards on the performance of the economy as a whole.  As somebody described it one day, GDP and GNP accurately reflect the Irish economy but they do not give much insight into what is happening in the Irish economy.  This is a slight nuance but it is quite important.  It is important that we all recognise that as things stand, GDP and GNP are just two of the international standards, but the CSO must continue to compile GDP and GNP in accordance with the standards.  We absolutely recognise the need to move beyond GDP and GNP.  We are working in this direction and the expert group will help us in this realm.</p></speech>

Insurance Ireland tells us it holds a significant amount of information on the industry, which is available.  Is it within the remit of the CSO to conduct a survey on issues relative to motor insurance, including the reasons for the hike and the type of claims being made, including the 70% on which we do not have visibility?  As the CSO would do with some sectors in the economy, would it write to all of them asking for specific information and bring it back in?</p></speech>

If it is, then we would need a statutory order to make response to the survey a requirement on the respondents.  In this context, there is a mechanism through which it can be done.</p></speech>

What we really want to avoid is a scenario where the CSO collects data while a regulator collects the exact same data.  This would not be efficient or in the taxpayers' interest.  The group is looking at exactly these issues as to where is the appropriate place and what is the appropriate mechanism and appropriate data source.  Once the group reports back to us, the CSO will actively engage and we will certainly not be found wanting in playing our role in trying to provide information.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1911" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1248" speakername="John McGuinness" time="10:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/FPJ2016101300002#O01800"><p>The regulator in this case is the Central Bank, and it does not have the information.  We have not been able to extract the information from all of the players who came before the committee to discuss insurance.  The hard data that are required to influence policy on this or to be able to put information out into the public domain for those who might want to enter the market to analyse, are not available.  Someone has them but nobody seems to want to ask for them.  This is the issue.  The CSO would not be duplicating or getting into the area of regulation.  It certainly would be getting into the area of giving a clear picture and analysis on the information that is available but which nobody seems to be collecting.  An interesting answer Mr. Roux gave when he was here was that he gets the information from Insurance Ireland for which he asks.  My question is, what other information is there?  That is not the question he was asked.  He was asked whether he got all of the information.  The answer was that he got what he asked for.  Somebody needs to ask all of the questions of Insurance Ireland, and anywhere else the information can be got, to compile such a report.  This does not need an in-depth conversation or consideration because the information is there.  Really, what Mr. Dalton is saying is that apart from this, it requires the CSO to be given the remit to do it.</p></speech>

From our perspective, the key questions are on who is the appropriate authority to collect the information and for what will the information be used.  If the CSO collects information from anyone, that immediately rules out the ability to use the information for any purpose other than statistical purposes.  When we are involved it is quite a limited remit and the outputs are quite limited.  All we can do is produce aggregate data.  I do not know the answer to this because it is moving into policy and that is uncomfortable because the CSO does not speak on policy.  We can speak on data-related issues.  The question is whether there is a need for a broader range of data to be used beyond purely statistical purposes.  If there is, the question is whether it should be collected elsewhere and then the CSO, through its powers under the Statistics Act, can go to the data source and extract the information it needs to compile aggregate statistical data to inform the debate.</p></speech>

We are told there are databases in the control of Insurance Ireland that would be helpful to the ministerial group of which the Central Statistics Office is part and this committee.</p><p>The Central Statistics Office, as a reputable organisation, is the appropriate body to carry out such an analysis which should be general.  The questionnaires sent to businesses are very detailed.  I noted the other day while reading one of them that if a similar set of questions was asked of the insurance industry, it would be possible to collect a large amount of usable data.</p></speech>

The question is how to do this and whether we should go down the route of conducting an expensive survey to collect the information directly from the relevant entities, which would only be used for statistical purposes, or whether we should take a more holistic approach and develop a more comprehensive data source that would go beyond the pure statistical requirements and meet the requirements of regulation and administration.  The second option would allow the CSO to access a centralised database of information collected for a multitude of purposes beyond statistical purposes.  We could then compile the aggregate statistical analysis from this data source.  That is the only issue and the CSO is awaiting the outcome of the work of the group.</p></speech>

The CSO has indicated that it is trying to eliminate the burden of red tape its questionnaires impose on the small and medium enterprise sector.  This means that companies with fewer than ten employees do not receive a questionnaire.  I have seen the questionnaires sent to companies and assisted some companies in completing them.  The way in which questions are asked is not appropriate to some companies, although I presume they are generally appropriate.  What engagement does the CSO have with the various sectors to which it sends questionnaires to establish the breakdown within each sector in order that it can make its questionnaires more relevant?  For example, in the transport sector a question will relate to whether a company is shifting goods by truck, trailer, van or whatever else and likewise in respect of the retail trade.  What effort is being made to ensure questions are framed in such a way that the CSO will obtain the information it wants and avoid a scenario in which someone completes a form because he or she knows that if the company is to be in compliance, the boxes must be ticked and the form returned?  This frequently happens and it skews outcomes for the CSO.</p></speech>

The European Union prescribes what the CSO and every member state must provide.  We must collect the information from the entities.</p></speech>

We also engage with stakeholders to try to work out what is the best way to collect information from respondents.  The Central Statistics Office is trying to move away from exclusive reliance on paper based data collection towards a web based data collection approach similar to the Revenue online service for collecting data from businesses.  This would be much more efficient and effective for businesses.  While it would require up-front investment, it would, over time, further reduce the burden on businesses.  We are very conscious of the burden we are placing on businesses and the need to ask questions in a manner that is consistent with the way in which the entities or companies compile their accounts.</p></speech>

Now that I know that a questionnaire is compiled by someone in Europe, I can at least understand the reason the questions are difficult to answer for many small and medium enterprises.  The difficulty is twofold because, first, completing the questionnaires imposes an unfair burden on small businesses and, second, it is a legal requirement to return completed questionnaires that are specific and accurate.  Many companies tick boxes to comply with the legal requirements.  The European Union authorities and the Central Statistics Office must be conscious of this and make every effort to ensure businesses are able to answer the questions asked and that they are appropriate to the business in question.</p></speech>

The Central Statistics Office does its best to exclude smaller businesses from this inquiry.  We set a threshold for the size of goods vehicles, which means that we exclude all good vehicles of less than 2 tonnes unladen weight.  In our sampling we are very conscious of the burden imposed on small businesses.  We were active participants in the high level group on the regulatory burden and since 2005 have reduced the response burden for small businesses by between 50% and 60%, which is a significant amount.  We are particularly conscious of small businesses.</p></speech>

The figures are broken down under various headings, including industry, the public sector, banking and financial services, the arts, the community sector and so forth.

I believe, however, that he is referring to outputs from the earnings, hours and employment costs, EHEC, survey.  Specifically, it shows an average weekly earnings figure in quarter one of 2016 of &euro;713 and in quarter two of &euro;703.  Perhaps these are the figures to which the Deputy is referring.  While there has been a positive annual change of 0.5% in the headline figures, the quarterly change was -0.13%.</p> <p>  The Deputy referred to new employment.  There can be compositional impacts on some of the figures because the EHEC survey is broad.  The overall average figure can be distorted by compositional impacts.</p><p>The CSO, like many public sectors bodies, has begun to recruit people again as the moratorium has been lifted.  In terms of new rules this is a public sector example but it can relate to many other industries.  People who started in recent years were at the bottom of pay scales, etc., and, therefore, there can be compositional impacts on the overall average figures.</p><p> The figures for the second quarter of 2015 and the first and second quarters of 2016 are not seasonally adjusted and, therefore, there can also be seasonal impacts on the broad figures.  Average weekly earnings are impacted by the number of hours worked.  Earnings have been relatively sticky over recent periods.  The biggest thing I would be aware of in that regard is an impact of compositional changes.</p></speech>

The average industrial wage reduced by just over &euro;30 quarter on quarter, which I imagine is not the result of a large number of people being employed over that three-month period.  The trend up until now was a gradual increase in the average wage and there has been an increase in employment over a sustained period, thankfully.  There seems to be a correlation between what the CSO is identifying as a reduction in average incomes and the tax receipts.  Is there something going in the economy that has not been subject of much debate such as wages being reduced?  I am not sure what is happening.</p></speech>

We always urge people not to just look at monthly figures but to look at the longer-term trend because specific issues can impact on monthly figures.  When I was in Mr. Ring's shoes and was responsible for the quarterly national household survey, QNHS, I always used to say that one month does not make a trend.  We would always look over the next number of quarters to see if this was the emergence of a trend.</p></speech>

We have brought back to publishing at Tplus 51 days to help ourselves and policy makers and consequently we publish on the eighth week.  The EHECS generally is released within Tplus 56 days, which is relative to the end of the calendar quarter we are looking at.  It is end of November for both of those releases.  The Deputy is correct that there is stuff going on.  We are aware that the labour market and the economy are dynamic at the moment in terms of change.

I will keep my statement short to allow as much time as possible for questions, which we will be happy to take.  As the Chairman said, I am joined by Dr. Kathleen MacLellan, who is director of the national patient safety office in the Department, Ms Susan Reilly from the same unit, and Ms Bernie Ryan and Mr. Peter Lennon from the corporate legislation unit.</p> <p>  Patient safety and quality are at the heart of our health services, and it is important to keep our patients and service users at the centre of everything we do.  Delivery of health care is inherently risky and while it is inevitable that things will go wrong, there is much that can be done to prevent harm or error, to identify harm when it occurs, to act on it and to learn from this to improve the safety of services for the future.</p> <p>  The Department is Health is fully committed to progressing the programme of major patient safety reforms the Government had an opportunity to consider and approve last November.  These measures include a range of actions on legislation, the establishment of a national patient advocacy service, the introduction of a patient-safety surveillance system, extending the clinical effectiveness agenda, a national patient experience survey, which will commence early next year, the establishment of the national patient safety office in the Department, and the setting up of a national advisory council for patient safety.  Within the programme of legislation, we intend to progress the licensing of our public and private hospitals, the health information and patient safety Bill and the provisions the committee is discussing this morning on open disclosure.  There is a lot covered in these measures.  If the committee has any interest in returning to any or all of them, we will be very happy to assist.</p> <p>  The committee will already have a copy of the general scheme for open disclosure approved last November and an information note forwarded by the Secretary General in July of this year with certain documents from the HSE on open disclosure, including the HSE policy.  Creating a culture of open disclosure and learning from the things that go wrong comprise the bedrock of making services safer.  Recent reports, some of which we were involved in creating, highlight that service users have at times felt unsupported by the system, have not always been afforded adequate explanations following adverse events and sometimes find the health service complex to navigate, particularly following adverse events.</p> <p>  Open disclosure is an open and consistent approach to communicating with patients and their families when things go wrong.  It is a human experience for all involved and one that should not be hindered by other concerns or fears.  That view has shaped our approach, which recognises the importance of the quality of the open disclosure engagement by the health professional with the patient over a period of time.  It is not always a single event.  It can be a matter of supporting a patient over a period of time to understand what has happened.</p> <p>  The background to the proposed legislation lies in the Commission on Patient Safety and Quality Assurance, chaired, as the Chairman will be aware, by Dr. Deirdre Madden of UCC.  The commission recommended that legislation be enacted to provide legal protection and privilege for open disclosure of adverse events to patients.  The provisions are therefore designed to give legal protection for the information and apology made to a patient when made in line with the legislation.  The apology cannot be interpreted as an admission of liability and cannot be used in litigation against the provider.  This approach is intended to create a positive voluntary climate for open disclosure and will support the national policy on open disclosure that was developed jointly by the HSE and the State Claims Agency and promulgated from November 2013.</p> <p>  Our goal from the outset has been to create a safe space where there can and should be full disclosure of the facts surrounding a patient safety incident and of the implications, if any, for the patient's care and treatment.  It is important that where an apology is warranted, it be made when the facts of the incident are known and not years later, perhaps on the steps of a court.</p> <p>  The Ombudsman is clear that many people who complain to his office say that what they are looking for often is for the service provider to acknowledge something went wrong and to receive a meaningful apology.  People say they want to be listened to and to be reassured that lessons have been learned and that the same mistakes will not happen again to other patients.  The evaluation of the 2013 HSE national open disclosure policy, published in July this year, provides valuable lessons to us for building a culture of open disclosure.  It identified that one of the persistent barriers was the perceived fear of the medico-legal consequences of open disclosure on the part of health professionals.  These barriers are similar to those identified in other jurisdictions and written about extensively in the literature.</p> <p>  The legislative provisions are, therefore, being drafted to ensure there is clarity for everyone involved in the open disclosure process and that there is appropriate consistency across the various parts of the health system regarding how open disclosure is understood and delivered.  It will only be where there is compliance with the primary legislation and the regulations under that legislation that these protections will be available.  The information note of 28 July from the Secretary General explained why we are now focusing on the development of regulations rather than standards, as in our original approach.  The provisions are intended to support an environment where the patient's information needs can be addressed as soon as possible.  In a hospital setting, for example, the open disclosure should usually be made by the lead clinician in charge of the patient's care.  The current draft provisions state the disclosure should be made as soon as practicable and that the information given should cover a description of the patient safety incident, the date it happened, the date the provider became aware of the incident and how the provider became aware of it.  Information must be given on any known physical, psychological or emotional effects arising from the incident and how these are to be managed.  The patient is also told about any actions being taken to ensure learning from the incident to avoid a recurrence.  This is clearly a lot of information for a patient to take in, often is a situation in which he or she may be traumatised.  The intention is that the Minister will prescribe a form to be given to the patient under the legislation so that we will have uniformity in the provision of the information across the health services.  While the oral information and the information in writing in the form cannot be used in litigation, the patient could, of course, use his or her medical records if taking legal action. </p> <p>  Open disclosure is about building patient and public trust in the health system.  For that reason, it is important to make clear today that there is no question that the provisions seek to provide safe haven for incompetence, negligence or other unprofessional health care.  Such a scenario would completely undermine what we are trying to achieve in a wider sense in regard to patient safety and changing the culture.  Organisations and health professionals continue to have accountability mechanisms within their individual professional regulatory mechanisms, as members will be aware.  An open and just culture for patient safety balances the need for an open and honest reporting environment that facilitates a learning environment and quality health care with accountability for both individuals and organisations.</p> <p>  Disclosure and reporting provide opportunities to learn, improve, address errors that have happened and apply the lessons to make the service safer for the next patient.  The open disclosure provisions form part of a number of initiatives to improve the management of patient safety incidents, as I have mentioned.  HIQA and the Mental Health Commission are at an advanced stage of development of standards on the conduct of reviews of patient safety incidents that expand on the standards for safer, better health care that were approved in 2012 under the 2007 Act.  This set of standards, along with the mandatory reporting of serious reportable events - there will be a prescribed list of very significant events in the health information and patient safety Bill - and the provisions intended for open disclosure will provide a comprehensive patient-centred approach to preventing, managing and learning from these incidents.</p><p> In terms of timelines, the intention is to include the provisions to support open disclosure in the Civil Liability (Amendment) Bill.  As members will be aware, the legislation is being progressed by the Department of Justice and Equality and it is expected to be published, as we understand, during this session.</p><p> As I have outlined, the provisions for open disclosure form part of a broad and ambitious programme of reforms.  We are happy to brief the committee, if they so wish, at any point in the future.  I thank the members for their attention.  I look forward to hearing questions and will try to address them.</p></speech>

The Minister, who I am sure would agree, was here a number of weeks ago.  He said that how we have handled the incidents of adverse effects on patients over the years has been a shameful indictment of the health services and broader society.  He said it is something that we need to address very quickly.  In the area of maternity services, for example, there have been some sad and tragic episodes and the findings were delayed or not divulged in time.  The families have had to go to extraordinary lengths to find out what happened to their loved ones when they were entitled to know what happened early on.  As Dr. Holohan has said, very often an apology is given on the steps of a court.  Very often, an apology is dragged out of somebody at some stage just outside of the Four Courts.  The only people to gain from doing this are those who represent the various bodies.  The families are left to endure a traumatic period and then have to endure an apology that has been dragged out of somebody as opposed to being offered.  We need to change that concept.</p> <p>  At times the senior management in the HSE has become completely unaccountable.  It is always the clinician who is found to be at fault.  Even in today's presentation it is the senior clinician who speaks to the patients to make an admission and apologise.  It is not always the clinician's fault that something goes wrong and there may be other reasons and factors such as poor infrastructure or equipment.  Why has senior management been completely removed from accountability?  They are not even accountable half the time when they come in here.  Is there a need to ensure that people cannot hide behind clinicians?  I would like to hear the Department's views on the matter.     </p> <p>  Families often say that there must be a cultural change in the HSE, governing bodies and professional bodies in order for them to embrace the concept of open disclosure.  Obviously the Department has looked at other countries where open disclosure is more advanced.  What countries have a model of open disclosure that we should aspire to and that has similar legal positions and other similarities?</p> <p>  Dr. Holohan has said in the above context that the apology cannot be interpreted as an admission of liability.  An individual is entitled to his or her good name and for his or her professional competency to remain intact until such time as proven otherwise.  In terms of reporting and bringing forward legislation, reports are now quickly conducted and disseminated so the laws of libel become irrelevant once the matter reaches social media.  Is there any way we can encourage open disclosure?  We need to consider this matter in order to ensure people keep their good name even though they have admitted a patient or an entity has experienced an adverse effect while under their watch, without an admission of liability.  Many good clinicians could find their names badly damaged without an opportunity for recourse.</p></speech>

We do have an amount of experience in terms of that matter.</p> <p>  In respect of the point made about apologies coming too late and having to be dragged out of people, we completely agree with the Deputy.  This is a consequence of the culture that exists and is not an easy thing to change.  We have direct experience of this matter.  As the Deputy may know, both Dr. MacLellan and I were directly involved in carrying out the examination of what happened in Portlaoise when the case of four deaths of normally formed enfants occurred in the early part of 2014.  It was clear to us, and by no means confined to Portlaoise in our view, that the way in which the patients were treated was nothing short of unacceptable.  Far from failing to provide open disclosure in that context, there was an active, and in many respects, a determination almost not to reveal full and clear facts to patients who clearly were entitled to have them.  We are a long way away from addressing the context in which such cases arise.  Unfortunately, there have been others cases which involved the kind of response that was far from what we would need to see.</p> <p>  Part of the picture is a perceived risk.  Sometimes clinicians, and I do not just say doctors but often doctors, perceive themselves to be putting themselves at risk by being forthright and clear about what happened in a particular context and perhaps apologise.  Part of our strategy, as well as being clear through open disclosure policies, about what constitutes good open disclosure and what the expectations are, is to try to remove some of those things that we know are barriers to that happening.  Our strong sense is that when something goes wrong in the care of an individual patient - as I say, it does happen - we can work to reduce such occurrences.  However, when it does happen there is really only one good opportunity to try to get things right and that is the point of first interaction with the patient, which is often with senior medical and nursing staff.  If trust and confidence breaks down at that point and there is not full disclosure, and there is then a clear attempt to try to ensure that the trust and confidence of that patient is maintained thereafter then no amount of activity after the fact will make up for what happened at the outset.  Very often, investigations and other responses from the patient's point of view are incapable of fully compensating for what happened.  He or she is certainly unable to get back into a situation where his or her trust and confidence in the service that he or she may often have to continue to use, is capable of being restored.  </p> <p>  A lot of our effort is about trying to support through training and standards, on the one hand, and then also looking at the legal environment and the perceived risk that people believe themselves to be at, to ensure that they engage properly with patients.  Also, to ensure that they do not circle the wagons and stop interacting and communicating with patients and families in those circumstances.  In many respects, it is a time when patients and families need them the most.  That is at the core of many of the significant patient safety incidents that we have seen in this jurisdiction.  It is at the core of many of the significant patient safety incidents that have been written about extensively in the literature.  Services and service providers stop communicating, stop being full and open and stop being truthful about what has happened.  As a result, trust and confidence breaks down on the part of patients.  No amount of compensatory actions after that fact are capable of redressing those deficiencies. </p> <p>  In terms of the point made about a lack of accountability by senior management, the Deputy made a good point that we need to ensure it is not just a matter that the quality of care patients receive is only seen as a matter for the doctors, nurses and other health professionals providing a service.  In a situation where an adverse event occurs, where a patient has been harmed and where there may be changes in the treatment provided to him or her, their might be life altering outcomes for those patients as a consequence.  All of that interaction will need to happen with clinicians who are capable of explaining and interpreting that for those patients and supporting and continuing the provision of care.  As the Deputy has said, behind that there needs to be accountability when it comes to the management of the system.</p> <p>  Members will be aware of the framework for accountability as it has been much talked about.</p><p>Much of the emphasis in public discourse has been around the financial components of the framework.  There are four elements to the framework, one of which includes patient safety and quality.  We must have a situation whereby senior managers and policy-makers in the system accept accountability for the environment in which clinical care happens because, as Deputy Kelleher rightly said, it is not just clinical service, there is an interaction between a variety of different factors that increases or reduces the risk of an incident occurring.  Some of those factors will not be in the control of individual doctors or nurses.  Often it is not a case of incompetence or even poor performance.  Sometimes adverse events occur when things go wrong but sometimes they occur when things have not gone wrong.  Adverse outcomes are part of the imperfections in the science but there clearly needs to be accountability.  We want to see more in the way of specific provisions in those systems so that there is more measurement and reporting, more transparency in terms of quality of care and specific measures that speak to the nature of the quality and safety of service put in place if they are deemed to be important parts of the provision of service.  We see health service management right up to the top of the HSE accepting, and being asked to accept, accountability for performance across the so-called balanced scorecard, which does not just look at money.  It looks at money, access, HR and patient safety and quality.  We do not want to end up pursuing a high standard of accountability, for example, in regard to finance, while inadvertently compromising issues in regard to safety and quality.  We must have a balanced approach to all things.</p><p> In the jargon, and I do not want to slip into using jargon, people talk about clinical governance.  In essence clinical governance means there is corporate accountability for the quality and safety of services delivered to patients.  It cannot be seen, as might have been the case heretofore, and not just in this country, by the senior leaders in the health care environment that quality and safety of services are really matters for the doctors and nurses and are nothing to do with the people in the boardrooms and offices.  That is old thinking.  The international community, as we do, understands patient safety very well and we need to ensure that accountability reaches all the way into the boardrooms and the senior management rooms of the operation and delivery of the service.</p><p> I will ask my colleague, Dr. Kathleen MacLellan, to give a brief account of the systematic look we have had at other countries and what we have learned from that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1964" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Kathleen MacLellan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016101300002#J00200"><p>We have taken time to look at the international models that have been utilised around open disclosure.  How open disclosure, or duty of candour, is managed is, in a sense, an early science.  Most countries dealing with the patient safety community are struggling to see the best models or methodologies for the future.  We also found very limited evaluation of the models of open disclosure, or duty of candour, that are utilised that could potentially provide us with some good research or scientific evidence.  We looked at a number of things across a number of countries.  We looked at Canada, Australia and our close neighbour, the United Kingdom.  In general these countries all have a set of principles around what is called open disclosure, or duty of candour, which are very similar to what we have utilised in the HSE and State Claims Agency policies.  We are very much in line with the processing approach and that fits with our legislative intent.  In most countries, the health professionals would have either an ethical or a professional obligation to disclose and to interact in a professional manner with patients when adverse events happen and on how that could happen.  Some countries have very good models as to how that can happen.  In the UK, both the General Medical Council and the Nursing and Midwifery Council have come together to produce joint standards around duty of candour and delivery of it.  Interestingly, most countries that we looked at, which included the eight provinces in Canada, Australia, the UK, England and Scotland, have apology laws.  These are general apology laws that provide for individuals, including health care professionals, providing an apology without that being capable of being utilised in terms of liability or against an individual professional.  While that is helpful, it is very important in our system that we introduce some form of protections for our professionals that are within the context of best practice.  That apology is very important but it needs to be given in the context of the whole care of the patients, the continuity of care and how that health professional actually interacts with that patient and how we support the health professional as well.  The apology is one component of a number of elements that have to happen for a person to ensure we look after him or her and then to ensure we take that learning forward.  Generally, a lot of the open disclosure policies that one will see across the world are in the context that there are general apology laws in place, which is one thing we noted clearly.</p> <p>  We know that in the UK, both England and Scotland have moved towards a statutory duty of candour for organisations and that organisations would be mandated to participate in some form of open disclosure with their patients for a defined list of very serious reportable events.  We gave due consideration to whether that would be an appropriate consideration in this country.  We spoke to a number of the various patient safety experts across the system and we have some good contacts with organisations such as the International Society for Quality in Healthcare, ISQua, and we have had quite a lot of dialogue as to what is the best approach.  We really want to support our professionals to engage in this wholeheartedly, because hearts and minds are in play when doctors or nurses sit down with a patient, so that they do so willingly, and they sit down feeling free to engage with their patients, feeling they can go forward.  We are not convinced that making that mandatory actually is the best way forward.  What we are convinced about is that we need to move forward our culture of patient safety, we need to support our professionals to engage and we need to view the open disclosure legislation, which will support our health professional within the broader package of patient safety reforms.  We will be moving forward on a health information and patient safety Bill and in that Bill, we have required mandatory reporting of this list of serious reportable events to the various agencies.  HIQA standards for better health care provide for open disclosure.</p> <p>  Deputy Kelleher raised the issue of the management of patient safety in general and we have been working very closely with HIQA and the Mental Health Commission around standards for the management of patient safety incidents, including the length of time it takes to conclude required reviews or investigations in the interests of making it a better service for both our patients and for our health professionals.</p> <p>  We also have another broader package of patient safety reforms, which Dr. Holohan has identified.  The open disclosure provisions are to sit within the broader package so that we see patient safety as a system for all of our staff.  We will start looking at high reliability organisations and we have talked about a just culture, so that it is not all about a blame game but it is about the whole system taking responsibility.</p> <p>  I might pick up on the point as to who does the open disclosure.  In our review of what happens internationally, it is generally the lead clinician who is either the identified doctor or the identified nurse in the system but that is part of a broader open disclosure team, which is actually what we have within our own open disclosure policy.  That team may have management but it may also have a liaison person who will work with a family over a period because some adverse events that require open disclosure are events where the family will need to engage with the health system over a long period.  We have approached this with the intent that we want to protect that health professional relationship with the family and the patient as they move forward.  I hope that has clarified some of the decision-making around our approach to the open disclosure measures.</p></speech>

We are going to take this learning and see if there is something immediate in the system that we need to address.  Is there something longer term that we need to promulgate, not just within the hospital or the organisation but across the whole health system?</p><p>I suppose it is trying to create an atmosphere where we turn things upside down, things are not covered up and instead of people feeling fearful in coming forward, they actually feel safe to sit down with their patients with their organisation supporting them to feel safe.

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1971" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016101300002#K00200"><p>There is, and this has been part of the some of the public discourse on the issue, a clear policy choice as to whether one would seek to put these types of protections around a process which is voluntary or to put some mandate and some obligation in statute around what doctors and nurses would do.  We have formed the judgment that the former is more appropriate.  We think that a balanced assessment of the international evidence on this issue says there is a risk in the first instance that we may increase the fears on the part of doctors and nurses that if something is prescribed around their behaviour, it might contribute further to their sense of legal liability.  There is a risk we might get a tick-box style of compliance, so that open disclosure is now a case of "I have to tell you, so therefore I am telling you."  However, the hearts and minds Dr. MacLellan has spoken about is about getting doctors and nurses into a space and then protecting them in that space to allow them to do the job in the way it needs to be done.  As I said in my earlier statement that can be a process, it might not be a single event for the patient but may be a process over a period of time and much more than ticking a box.  Doctors and nurses will have to understand what to do, why they are doing it and, in a sense, to feel supported in doing it.  That is the reason we have gone down that road.  I know there has been some criticism of that particular determination but we have a good and strong rationale as to why we think that is necessary.</p> <p>  There are areas in legislation, and we can point to examples of it, where behaviours and notifications and so on in respect of health professionals are mandated in legislation but very often do not occur.  When one looks at the international evidence, one will find that in countries where there is such a requirement on doctors and nurses, large percentages of them do not know such a requirement exists.  It might feel like that it will address something, it seems intuitively the right thing to do, but our view is it might actually contribute to a further likelihood of doctors and nurses not doing the right thing or perhaps not doing it right.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1972" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1409" speakername="Colm Burke" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016101300002#K00300"><p>I thank the witnesses for their presentations.  Open disclosure is very important.  I am a little concerned about the capacity to deal with it within the HSE and will give one or two examples.  First, an adverse event occurred and it was agreed by all of the medical staff in the particular hospital that there should be an independent review to make sure full information was given to the family.  The hospital identified an independent person to carry out a review who was outside of the HSE group but still within the HSE.  The decision was overruled by a person in administration in the HSE and 18 months later, the independent review has not been carried out.  Surely, this should not arise.</p> <p>  While I know it is not tied into Dr. Holohan's area, a second issue that is causing a great many problems for families, especially where somebody has died, is that there is no obligation on coroners to hold an inquest within a period of time.  My understanding is there is no provision in current legislation that a coroner must hold an inquest.  If there is a delay, there is the immediate presumption by the family that something is being covered up.  That needs to be addressed immediately.</p> <p>  Third, on the question of support for staff where there is an adverse event, I am not at all clear there is support for hospital staff, be they nurses, junior doctors or even administrators, because when there is an adverse event in a hospital, it affects everyone working in the hospital.  What is being developed to provide that support?  I am aware of a number of incidents, in which no support of any description was given to staff and as a result, the number of staff members on sick leave increased because they had been adversely affected.  What are we doing in regard to setting up support mechanisms for staff?</p> <p>  Nearly every week we have a situation where there is some reporting of an adverse event in the maternity services.  The big problem with independent reviews is that because we have a shortage of medical personnel in maternity services - in that the number of consultants is lower than in other jurisdictions - we have a shortage of personnel to carry out independent reviews from outside the HSE group and it falls to a consultant in another HSE group to carry out the review.  As a result the process of review is very slow.  Maternity cases are significant and all of the relevant information must be provided in the fastest possible time.  What mechanism is the Department and the HSE considering to deal with that area in particular?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1973" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016101300002#K00400"><p>Senator Colm Burke's final point relates to the first point on the length of time it takes to get through some of the reviews.  Frankly we share the Senator's concern and understand exactly what he is saying.  Perhaps for reasons that might be understandable and particularly as it applies to maternity services as a result of some incidents that occurred - the Senator may remember some of the particular public criticism was for a failure to conduct or complete reviews in some cases - when more incidents occurred in the more recent past, there has been a determination to get the review process into place.  In our view it is not always necessary to do the scale of review of the kind that is prescribed in each of these situations in every circumstance.</p> <p>  I might go back as to why one should do these reviews in the first instance.  The most compelling reason to do a significant review when a patient safety incident has occurred and that speaks to the urgency and so on is if there is a reason to have a suspicion that there is a continuing concern about the safety of a service.  The most important question to address is whether there is a risk attending to the patient who is coming tomorrow to use this service that needs to be addressed and there is an urgency around that.  The next most important is if there has been a group of patients who have used the service in the recent past who might have been harmed and who need to be identified through a look-back and to be provided with some further service.  We have had some examples of that.  Obviously the individual patients who may or may not have been harmed will wish for a review of the circumstances of their own cases.  That might not always be the most important reason for a review to be undertaken.  We may have slipped into committing to doing too many of these large-scale independent reviews in circumstances where they are not always necessary when one thinks about the purpose to get to the learning and understanding of what has happened.</p> <p>  To return to the point we made earlier, if the disclosure of what is known at the start happens in the right way and is provided by the right people in order that trust and confidence is maintained on the part of patients and families, sometimes many of the questions patients have can be appropriately answered in that context without the need for recourse to independent processes and reviews.  I am not at all saying we do not need independent reviews as part and parcel of our process.  </p> <p>  The point Senator Burke is rightly identifying is that many obstetricians and other senior people are engaged in conducting large numbers of reviews from a limited capacity and then these reviews are not being done within the prescribed period, which for the HSE is a four-month period.  I know the quality assurance and verification division in the HSE, which has responsibility, and HIQA are both doing important pieces of work in this situation.  One in the HSE is to try to look at the different types of reviews that will be necessary in different setting.  Sometimes, a quick analysis of what went wrong at a very early stage might be enough to address the question of continuing safety and does not need an elaborate and lengthy process that can take weeks or months to complete.  One cannot have a process lasting weeks or months that leaves open the question of whether a service continues to be safe.</p><p> There is a question of horses for courses in the context of the type of incident and review.  The HSE is now considering this very carefully.  We are also working with HIQA, which is carrying out a review of national standards again.  This is based on a recommendation that arose from the work we did in Portlaoise two years ago to examine developing national standards for different types of reviews in different settings.  It is a matter of having the right type of review and not ending up with large numbers of busy front-line clinicians tied up with reviews that are not always of the right type in the circumstances.  Addressing this will help to improve the circumstances that have been referred to.</p><p> The point made on the support of staff is a good one.  The open disclosure policy and some of the other policies in the HSE will make this clear.  There is an issue arising regarding the capacity of services in this regard and regarding the provision of the appropriate support.  It is a matter of doing so in a way that recognises that the second victim is often the health care professional at the coalface.  That individual might feel responsible.  He or she might represent the final step in a chain of things that went wrong but may feel responsible.  As was rightly said, he or she needs to be supported appropriately and to have his or her confidence rebuilt.  Sometimes staff find themselves taking sick leave owing to stress.  Alternatively, unsupported staff may continue to provide services without sufficient assistance and support while no longer in a position to do so as safely as possible.  They may be seeing another patient later that day, the following day and so on.  All these factors need to be considered as part of how we respond.</p><p> As a consequence of the additional moneys made available to the HSE for the provision of health services, we would like to see some of the resources dedicated to ensuring there is greater capacity at the front line for dealing with these matters.  We can talk about all of these matters in terms of the right thing to do but if we do not invest in the development of front-line capacity and capability, there is little point in having numbers of staff such as ourselves in Hawkins House and Dr. Steevens' Hospital working on patient safety.  It does not have to involve a large number of people but there must be staff whose day job is to ensure arrangements are in place to provide, where necessary, services to support staff members in the circumstances described.  Meaningful investment has got to happen at the front line.  We want to see some of the resources dedicated to developing capacity and capability at the front line.</p></speech>

We have our own views on some of these matters and will be working with the Department of Justice and Equality, which I know has been considering this area in recent years.  We know there is a variation in practice between different coroners.  There is no standard of the kind that the Senator speaks of.  The variation in practice is such that in some areas coroners' inquests are carried out quite quickly relative to the events while, in other areas, coroners might save up a number of events and hold a single set of hearings in a short space of time, the result being that it takes a very long time before the holding of inquests in respect of certain incidents.  That contributes significantly to the harm.  We have our own experiences and have heard directly from patients about the trauma of being part of an adversarial inquest, with staff members being significantly represented by counsel and senior counsel, etc.  Patients may go through the process feeling quite vulnerable and unsupported.  We want to ensure this is borne in mind in any review of the coronial process.  We would like to work with our colleagues in the Department of Justice and Equality on this.  We would like to see a process that is much more patient centred if this is to be an important part of our response regarding incidents and when they occur.</p> <p>  There is probably a lot of knowledge gleaned from inquests right around the system but we need to be much better at pulling that knowledge together from separate coronial processes conducted in each of the different jurisdictions with a view to learning from it and using it to inform our activity to prevent the kinds of cases that arise on coroners' desks.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1977" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1302" speakername="Louise O'Reilly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016101300002#L00400"><p>I have a number of difficulties with what we are dealing with here.  Many of them stem from my experience as someone who would have supported health professionals through the system.  As the system stands, it is incredibly adversarial, not just for the patients, who, of course, must be central, but also for the staff themselves.</p> <p>  Regulated health professionals have an arena in which issues relating to them can be investigated and in which they very often are.  Many of my colleagues within the various representative bodies for health professionals and I have experience of ongoing investigations within the HSE.  The Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland and the Medical Council investigate regulated health professionals regarding incidents where there may be a suspicion of poor professional performance, for example.  There is another group of people who do not face investigation at that level but who are very often central to the incidents.  They do not have their own regulatory body.  Since the requirement is not mandatory, there are those involved who do not have any compunction to disclose.  Whatever is done by regulated health professionals is examined in another arena but there are staff who are central to the process but who do not have any regulatory body.  If the requirement is not mandatory, there is no onus on the latter staff, although they are central.</p> <p>  Much of this seems to hinge on the investigation taking place.  There seems to be over-reliance in the HSE on investigations.  As was pointed out, one could be doing well to get out of an investigation in 18 months.  Some can take years.  Meanwhile, other matters arise.</p> <p>  The documentation states it is not proposed to include a mandatory requirement concerning open disclosure but that it will be reviewed in line with experience.  Making it mandatory could be reviewed in line with experience also.  There are patients and also staff who have been battered by the system and the culture.  The culture needs to change.  I am not convinced it will necessarily be changed in a voluntary way.  The reason I say this is that staff must be supported, and they must also be trained.  However, without making this requirement mandatory, the training may not happen because there is always a draw on the budget.  There is always something else that needs resources and somewhere else to direct the money.  Unless the requirement is mandatory, the training may not happen.  If not, the staff will not feel supported.  I am interested in knowing how the staff will be supported through training.  How can it be done?  I am not convinced it will happen if the requirement is not mandatory.  That is not because anyone wants to avoid responsibility but purely and simply because there is always a draw on the budget.  There will always be something else.  I would like to see this front and centre.  Support for staff must be in place.</p> <p>  Consider what will occur in the context of an open disclosure.  I am not referring to an admission of guilt but a statement that a bad thing happened regarding which those responsible wish to offer an explanation.  The patient will be advised of the incident, albeit not by mandatory requirement at present, and the lead clinician will be the person who will sit down with him or her.  Dr. Holohan said there are very many people involved so there can often be a chain of events and that, at the end of that chain or perhaps the beginning, there are staff who might not have the status of a lead clinician.</p><p>Forgive me if I have missed it, but I do not see anything that provides for information to be provided to all of the people there.  Lead clinicians will sit down with patients to tell them a bad thing happened and that it should not have.  They are talking about staff who have been involved in that patient's care.  Do the witnesses have a view on whether we should strengthen the provisions in order to ensure that everybody involves knows what is happening?</p><p> We know the culture is not great and we have seen where it is important to find somebody to blame rather than the heart of the incident, which is not the fault of any one person - it is the adversarial nature of the system.  There is a fear among staff that they are being spoken about and because the culture is one of blame rather than getting to the heart of the matter, there is a fear that in looking for someone to take the fall one is not involved in the conversation.  I am sure that lead clinicians, in providing explanations, are doing their best but there is fear among staff other than lead clinicians that some blame is being apportioned.  Can we do something to strengthen that and ensure that does not happen?  </p><p> I refer to my earlier point with regard to investigations.  A lot of this seems to hinge on the provision of investigations, which often take a very long time.  I ask the witnesses to outline the timeframe they envisage from an initial explanation of what happened onwards.  If there is an investigation thereafter, is it envisaged that all of the parties will be involved?  I ask in the context of sharing information with people.  </p><p> The lives of some patients have been destroyed because following an adverse incident they feel they have to go to battle with the system.  I have also seen staff whose lives have been destroyed.  They are out on sick leave because they have been traumatised by what has happened.  The purpose of this is to stop that happening.  I fear that unless it is mandatory, we will not get the culture change that is so desperately required.</p></speech>

She commented very clearly on the adversarial nature of the system and the length of time investigations take to complete.  Some of the measures that are proposed, such as this one, and those for the Civil Liability Act are about trying to make that process shorter and more efficient, including the pre-action protocols, periodic payment orders and open disclosure.</p> <p>  As the Deputy is aware, there is a commitment in the programme for Government on this area.  The Department of Justice and Equality is taking steps to initiate the process and we will be anxious to engage with it to examine the whole system of medical negligence and whether we continue with the current system which is based around tort, negligence and the adversarial nature and consequences of the process or consider committing to examine the issue and all of the issues that arise in terms of medical negligence and with which we have to deal in terms of the consequences.  We will look to engage with the Department of Justice and Equality in regard to that.</p> <p>  I cannot predict or guess what will happen.  I have a view on where, ideally, the process would take us.  Making the current process more efficient is one legitimate strategy.  We can then examine whether, in fundamental terms, we need to change the whole system on which our current system of medical negligence is based, and its adversarial consequences whereby often years elapse before patients can be dealt with.  This includes, by extension, the professionals involved, over whom questions might continue that might get answered in the final analysis even where they may never have arisen in the first instance.  Justice is not being offered to anybody when long periods of time elapse.</p> <p>  I responded to Senator Burke's question on the number of investigations.  I agree with his point regarding the number and frequency.  To be clear, we do not think that open disclosure depends on the outcome of an investigation.  There should be enough known at the early stages for that information to be passed on to patients as soon as possible.  It is not dependent on information being complete.  It might well be the case that, in good faith, a doctor or nurse is disclosing something to a patient that he she believes to be the case that on subsequent investigations or examinations turn out not to be true.  Again, the principle of open disclosure is that the fact is revealed when it becomes known.</p></speech>

I do not want to labour the point but I referred to the context of an investigation.  As a result of the adversarial nature of investigations, the length of time they take and the fact that people can end up with representation from legal personnel or trade unions it turns into an adversarial process.  This is where the training element comes in.  The person who is talking to a patient will be very mindful of the fact that what he or she says might end up as part of the investigation and, therefore, given the nature of investigations, their length of time and adversarial nature, they might end up in a situation whereby they think they should not say something.  That goes back to training and support.  Investigations will obviously be necessary, but we need to give people confidence at an early stage that they can simply say-----</p></speech>

If information is disclosed, that clearly needs to be done in an appropriate manner and we will prescribe what that manner is.  If people disclose information they will be entitled to protections in regard to the information being used.  That will give people the confidence that they are not increasing their or other people's liability by doing what is, in effect, the right thing in terms of patient care.</p> <p>  The Deputy went on to make a point on a disclosure being made by a lead clinician.  It is a good point and speaks to some of the surprising things that occur as a consequence of our existing system.  We have come across situations where some parts of the disclosure to patients when things go wrong involved one clinician pointing the finger in the direction of other members of the clinical team.  That is entirely inappropriate and unacceptable.  One can guess at the motivations behind that and go into further details on specific examples.  We know that happens.  One may be in a situation where that the kind of culture, namely, that disclosure to a patient involves somebody pointing the finger in one direction in order to ensure the finger is not pointed back at oneself.  To me, that speaks to how far we have to go on this journey to get ourselves into a situation where this is happening in the right way.  </p> <p>  Each issue is interconnected.  In some of the adversarial processes about which the Deputy spoke, the length of time it takes to get justice from the point of view of patients or professionals contributes to the sense of liability, risk and people seeking to protect themselves.  It is all part of the just culture Dr. MacLellan spoke of, and she might comment on some of what I have just said.</p> <p>  The Deputy's point on training is good.  We have drawn a different conclusion to the Deputy in regard to the role mandatory versus voluntary would play.  I will not say that I think the Deputy is wrong and we are right.  It is a judgment we have made.  It is not perfect.  Our view is that encouraging people to do the right thing and giving protection to them when they do the right thing is likely to lead to more reporting.  That is the point to where we want to get.  We want more disclosure, and for that disclosure to happen of the kind of quality way that it should be.  Our fear is that if we simply mandated that the culture might be to tick boxes and not support patients through processes, that would have the opposite effect of what we intend</p></speech>

It is not easy, obviously, for the patient and family, but it is also not easy for staff.  We have a responsibility and duty to support our staff.</p><p> The State Claims Agency in partnership with the HSE has been in the process of rolling out a training programme which has been evaluated.  The evaluation of the open disclosure pilot was published earlier this year.  We understand that 2,813 staff across the HSE have been trained on open disclosure, with around 8,000 briefed on open disclosure.  People across the system have been trained as "train the trainers".  Based on our discussions with the HSE we believe that is very helpful; it is a start.  The open disclosure pilot makes it very clear that there are a number of key success factors in being able to change the culture on open disclosure.  Those factors are continuing education, continuing support for staff, clear leadership and buy-in and support across the whole system, involving not just the health professionals, but also the management.</p><p> We agree that staff should be provided with training.  That training should be ongoing and there should be debriefing for staff.  That will form part of the discussions on our priorities for the service plan for patient safety.  We have a clear view on patient safety for the health system.  It needs to start to be taken very seriously.  We cannot just keep talking about it.  It is very important and requires capacity and capability but also expertise and real buy-in and support.  The Deputy's point that it will not happen without training is absolutely correct and the international experience indicates it is critical for us to provide the training and support for staff.</p><p> I refer to something we discussed earlier which might be of interest to the committee, relating to the standards for patient safety instances, and the concerns about the length of time and types of reviews.  Those standards, which we commissioned through HIQA and the Mental Health Commission, are up for public consultation on HIQA's website.  The committee may be interested in the content of that and the direction in which it is heading.  In the absence of standards coming from the regulators we have difficulty with the variability in how those investigations and reviews happen across the system.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1986" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1297" speakername="Kate O'Connell" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016101300002#N00200"><p>I am delighted that this is in process.  Is it proposed to roll out open disclosure across all sorts of services within the HSE or will we target a particular area?  While I do not want to give false information, I believe that more than 50% of State claims are maternity-related.  They are heavily weighted towards events that happen in our maternity hospitals.  Has consideration been given to rolling it out there first, seeing how it goes and then moving on to other areas?</p> <p>  Has this process been included in the new national maternity strategy?  We hear anecdotal evidence of many doctors and nurses practising open disclosure for many years and it seems to work out fine for them.  I have spoken to a number of people about it recently.  How can we guarantee a standardised approach to the patient?  From my limited experience, working as a cleaner in a hospital for a long time and then as a pharmacist in a hospital and having been there having children for the past few years, it is clear to me that these places are busy.  Is it realistic to have a lead clinician available in the hospital in Holles Street of an evening if there is an adverse event?  If we are to do this, can we be realistic about who that person would be?  Following on from Deputy O'Reilly's point on training, if things are going wrong, there is a sense that if we have a consultant knocking about we will grab him and if not we will get the other person.  It is very important to have a standardised approach.</p> <p>  How do the current systems of reporting of adverse events fit into the new proposal?  Have they been evaluated?  Have we taken anything good from them and used them in this approach?</p> <p>  Deputy O'Reilly spoke about the protection of professionals.  As we know, many health-care professionals are regulated by their own professional bodies.  It appears that a lead consultant of a team in a hospital does not have much input into who forms part of that team even though the consultant is ultimately responsible for the team.  I am very concerned about the protection of people's good names.  We often see reports on the television news of a particular doctor in a particular location and the immediate reaction is that I will never go to that hospital or I hope I never meet that lad.  However, he may have done nothing wrong at all.  It is important to protect our professionals.  There is a difference between the management staff and those to whom they are accountable.  Having to face Medical Council hearings is a very stressful process for a medical professional.  It can be very difficult for their professional and personal lives.</p> <p>  While this may not fall into the scope of today's meeting, how do the professional indemnity insurance companies feel about this proposal?  Is there any push-back from them?</p> <p>  When we are talking about providing support where the flowchart ends, we also hear of patients who have adverse events possibly with catastrophic outcomes and they cannot even drive past the hospital anymore; they do not want anything to do with that hospital.  Is there any provision to help those people get care in another hospital?  That is not to put blame on the place where the adverse event happened, but it is possible to understand from a psychological point of view that they would not want to go back to the place where they experienced an adverse event.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1987" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016101300002#N00300"><p>The Deputy asked about rolling out to all services.  She is right that a significant number are being seen in the area of maternity services.  That may be more of a reflection on the extent to which questions about maternity services have been current in public discourse and what that leads to than a true variation in the actual risk that attends to maternity services, as compared with other hospital-based services.</p> <p>  In answer to part of one of the Deputy's later questions, we have had good experience in the programme to implement the national incident management system, which has been developed by the State Claims Agency and is now a significant national asset in terms of a standardised way of measuring and capturing all incidents.  However, that is not to say that we believe we are seeing a full and accurate representation of all adverse events in what comes through that system.</p> <p>  While Deputy Harty might have a different view, I believe my profession does not have a good track record when it comes to reporting incidents honestly and openly.  It is not because people do not actively believe it should happen.  Doctors are just not as good at it as other professionals.  Nursing staff in the main are much more responsive and responsible when it comes to those kinds of things.  We have to take all this into account when we interpret what we see coming through these incidents.</p> <p>  Extrapolating from international evidence on the frequency of incidents, medication error is predominant in numerical terms - not always in significance terms - in patient safety incidence.  It could be the wrong drug, the wrong dose or the wrong patient or a combination of those.  It could be the right drug prescribed and the wrong drug dispensed.  Numerically they contribute the most; we do not see that coming through our systems.  It indicates it is unlikely that the pattern of adverse events is significantly at variance with that experienced in most modern developed health-care systems.  We want this rolled out to all services.  Where safety issues arise, people should be appropriately trained and supported in meeting their responsibilities and requirements.</p><p> With regard to the council, if I am getting a sense of what Deputy O'Connell has said, I think we are all disquieted by some of what we see on the news, in particular medical professionals, because of the nature of the process with people being followed by television cameras down the street when perhaps they have no case to answer. I would find it disquieting and Deputy Kelleher is quite right that everybody is entitled to their good name in the first instance.  We have to have a situation where there is appropriate accountability and at the same time there is a balance between all of these things.  One part of it is the nature of our complaints system.  We are doing some work around this now with the Ombudsman, and it would be a matter ultimately for legislation to look at all of this, but the system now has an artificial differentiation between complaints that are clinical in nature and those deemed not to be clinical in nature, and between those complaints deemed to be applying to those that involve doctors and those that do not.  We feel that is an outdated way of looking at complaints which sees that all incidents in which doctors are involved, and which become the subject of complaints, are really matters for the regulatory body.  Again, I am not sure that is appropriate.  In many situations, even when adverse events occur and even where there is a responsibility on the part of a professional, it might not raise a question of that individual's competence.  Poor performance does not always imply incompetence and competence does not always imply good performance.  There is a distinction to be made between a framework that exists in law around professional accountability, as provided by the Medical Council or the Nursing and Midwifery Board of Ireland, and an appropriate framework around accountability within a service that is provided by professionals, if the service cannot stand apart from its need to account to patients in the first instance for the appropriate provision of safe and high quality services.  That is something on which we want to do some further work, to see if we can look at the whole issue of complaints and see how that works for patients.</p><p> The committee might be aware that the Medical Council has done some very good work in analysing some of the complaints that they have experienced from whatever source over an extended period of time.  It brought quite a bit of intelligence into this area.  It has shown that in fact it happens very rarely in relative terms that service providers make complaints against individual practitioners which would put us at odds with other jurisdictions.  Across the water service providers are frequently those who provide a lot of audited evidence of poor professional performance when they believe there is a regulatory issue arising for an individual practitioner.  That does not really happen at all, to any appreciable extent, in Ireland.  The other analysis shows that the percentage of complaints brought by patients that come through to a significant sanction is really very low.  As an avenue for patients to pursue an issue where they may well believe that a medical practitioner has a case to answer, it does not appear that the Medical Council and that route is one that brings any redress for patients.  That brings us back to the idea that the service has a responsibility in the first instance.  In many issues where adverse events have occurred to patients it is the service that needs to provide the answer and not always the individual practitioner.  It rarely actually relates to competence.</p></speech>

We recognise that how we utilise that information has not been as optimum as it could be.  As Dr. Holohan has said, there are a number of health care acquired conditions, if we were to call them adverse events.  Internationally, it is estimated that 10% of patients will acquire something they did not have before they came in to the system.  As part of the capacity building within the Department of Health, and from a policy point of view, we would like to see the creation of capacity to start looking at the surveillance of patient safety across the system.  We have a lot of systems and we would see our National Incident Management System, NIMS, as a very important source of information; the types of incidents that happen, where and how they happen and how they are managed, along with other sources of information such as our hospital patient safety statements and maternity patient safety statements.  We would like to take that information to guide where we go forward.  A lot of what we are building now is built in the absence of a co-ordinated, planned for analysis of the information that we have around patient safety and patient safety incidents in the system.  Part of what we want to do is utilise this information in a much more intelligent and informative way.</p> <p>  The issue was raised of insurers and their views.  The State Claims Agency has been a signed up partner around the open disclosure policy for the HSE and was a signed up partner also for the evaluation.  The agency has stated very clearly and publicly that it supports open disclosure and early interactions with patients when adverse events have happened, to support patients. That is a very helpful position in moving forward.  The more we are all co-ordinated in that regard, the better traction we will get around the whole patient safety culture.</p></speech>

Dr. Holohan said that the senior clinical physician may be engaged in the reporting mechanism.  On a practical level, patients spend a lot more time in the community than they do in hospitals.  How would Dr. Holohan envisage this reporting happening in a community or a primary care setting where the health professional might be working in isolation, be it a GP, a public health nurse, a physiotherapist or an ancillary member of the primary care team.  Who would take the lead in the reporting mechanism in those instances?  With regard to Deputy O'Connell's point about the legal protection offered for the health professional, and considering the soaring medical insurance costs at the moment especially for doctors in private practice who may not get some funding from the HSE, does Dr. Holohan believe this may foster a culture of unwillingness to co-operate with the whole process?</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2016-10-13a.1991" speakerid="unknown" error="nomatch" speakername="Dr. Tony Holohan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/HEJ2016101300002#O00400"><p>I thank Senator Swanick.  When we talk about lead clinician in this context we mean the most appropriate clinician in a particular situation.  That does not always have to be the clinical director of an institution.  It might well be the GP in a particular situation or it might well be another community based clinician who is not a doctor.  It depends on who is in the position to know, understand and provide the information and to support a patient through that.  If the incident is something that happens in a primary care environment then it is perfectly appropriate if the lead clinician is the person's GP.  For its part, the Medical Council - probably more specifically than any of the other regulators - has set out its expectations of practitioners with regard to open disclosure and sees that applying to all registered medical practitioners.  I may not have given a full response to Deputy O'Connell's question, but in a hospital the lead clinician may not always be the most senior person, who may not be available at evening time.  If an incident occurs out of hours when it may well be more junior medical staff, it can still be perfectly appropriate for those to be the people who provide that information, if that is what the circumstances deem.  It might be a situation where a senior clinician has to be called in.  It would really be dictated by the nature of the incident and what the patient requires.  Clearly, if it is a catastrophic or significant incident with life altering or treatment altering implications then a senior attending physician is going to be called to participate.  It is reflecting the reality that from the point of view of a patient who is involved in institutional care and receiving care in a hospital environment, the person who is representing the service and speaking to them is the consultant in charge.  That is what we are reflecting, but there is no reason it could not apply similarly in a community based or primary care setting with other professionals.</p> <p>  With regard to the soaring insurance costs, I cannot honestly give the committee an account of what each of the individual insurance providers would say themselves, but my general sense of insurance providers - and it is along lines of what has been said by Dr. MacLellan about the State Claims Agency being the largest indemnifier in the State but not the only one - is that a good standard of open disclosure is the right thing to do and actually leads to a reduction in terms of the risk of future liability.  When these kinds of things occur it is less likely that patients whose trust and confidence in providers is maintained through incidents when things go wrong are actually capable of understanding and it does not always end up in litigation.  Although there is not a lot of evidence around this, some of the international evidence suggests that engaging in this way can lead to a reduction in future litigation which one would expect to see having a deflating impact on indemnity costs.</p></speech>

They cannot find answers any other way and, therefore, if a process can be created whereby we can give answers early on, we may prevent that happening or reduce the time they are waiting.  This will not be the case for everybody such as those with catastrophic or other injuries.  Patients will make their decisions as to the route they go but there are opportunities.  The soft evidence internationally and domestically indicates that if we can be honest and open with patients early on, we will not force them down a particular route to get answers and information on the care they require.</p></speech>

They may write a letter seeking information and get a letter back stating, "Further to your complaint...".  They do not see themselves as making a complaint but sometimes the way in which their request for information is handled, it turns something that never began as a complaint into a significant and intractable complaint.</p></speech>
