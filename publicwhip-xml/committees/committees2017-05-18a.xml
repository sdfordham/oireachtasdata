No. 475B, correspondence dated 10 May 2017 from Seamus McCarthy, Comptroller and Auditor General, is a briefing document on the Comptroller and Auditor General reporting framework.  This is a very important and useful document and I suggest that all members read it.</p></speech>

We were discussing FeedHenry and the potential to report on it.  I made the point that I would have to do a value for money report if I was to report publicly on it.  I was explaining the difficulty in reporting a single issue other than in a value for money context.</p></speech>

That is useful information for committee members to have.  We will note and publish that.</p> <p> Nos. 477B (i) and (ii), correspondence dated 10 May 2017, from Professor Patrick O&rsquo;Shea, president of University College Cork, providing follow-up information subsequent to the university&rsquo;s appearance before the committee with information of the gender breakdown and the Irish Management Institute&rsquo;s pensions which is now owned by the university.  This information will be reviewed next week along with documentation from the other third level institutions, the Higher Education Authority and Department of Education and Skills.  It will be noted and published.</p> <p>  No. 480B, correspondence received from Caranua, regarding liaison officers.</p> <p>  No. 481B, correspondence dated 10 May 2017 from Mr. Sean &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General, Department of Education and Skills, on the signing of a lease agreement by Caranua.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.19" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#B01500"><p>Under the Act, the Minister has the responsibility to give permission or not for each contract for leases.  It is not clear whatsoever if the Minister gave permission in this case.  That is the question we have asked.  I do not know where that answer is.  We have got answers to parliamentary questions.  We have got an answer from Caranua which is totally and utterly confusing.  The message from the committee was that the agency should not waste survivors&rsquo; moneys on signing a rent agreement.</p> <p>  The second message was whether the Minister had given permission.  At this point, having read it, does the Office of Public Works, OPW, own the building in which Caranua working?  It is not clear.  One is pushing the other.  The OPW is talking about a signing a new lease on behalf of Caranua where it is the third party as it were.  Why is the OPW signing a new agreement?  Does it not own the building?  I have no idea what is going on.  The reason for that is not through any lack of diligence.  I have read about it and tabled questions about it.  I have no idea.  I do know when Caranua was here; it said it did not pay rent.  I asked the Comptroller and Auditor General&rsquo;s office if Caranua paid rent.  It said it did not pay rent but was about to because it had to move.  Now it looks like it was obliged to pay rent of over &euro;100,000 from 2016 onwards.  Now, it will pay even more rent.  On top of that, it seems to me it was outfitting premises.</p> <p>  At this point, I am appealing to the Chairman that this is a limited fund.  There is absolute upset over the way the survivors have been dealt with.  We know the agency&rsquo;s chairperson said when he went into the organisation that it was a mess and a shambles.  There is currently no board.  Its term finished in March and its last meeting was on 23 March or 24 March.  This organisation is functioning without any oversight.  It would seem it has delegated permission to the chief executive officer and the chairperson to sign a lease.  I have gone through the minutes and it is extraordinary at a time when the board was more worried about the level of pay-outs rather than their own costs.</p> <p>  This committee is of the opinion that Caranua should not be paying rent.  We asked it to clarify and not to sign a lease.  We do not know if it is value for money.  No business case was ever presented through any of the minutes.  We have asked the Department of Education and Skills to clarify what is going on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.23" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1258" speakername="David Cullinane" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#B01900"><p>As it feeds into a broader issue, I want to make this point.</p> <p>  I agree with everything Teachta Connolly said on this issue.  We ask questions to get clarity.  Unfortunately, we have not got clarity.  There is more confusion now than there was before we got the correspondence.  Obviously, that is problematic for is.</p> <p>  We are juggling many issues which is quite difficult for us.  We have the issue of the Garda training college, as well as the third and fourth level sectors.  We are going in the right direction in putting a focus on many of these issues.  Caranua is a good example.  I have said a number of times that we are holding hearings.  The hearing was also in respect of the special report the Comptroller and Auditor General did on the redress schemes.  Many were issues were raised by members with the Secretary General as to how the scheme was devised in the first place, false and mistakes and so on.  Where is the follow up for the committee?  If one looks at the structure we are putting around the third and fourth level area and the Garda training college, we are moving in the right direction.</p><p>Maybe we can do something similar here so that we know exactly what the follow-up is.  Teachta Connolly has raised serious issues.  I am not sure how it is best for us to proceed.  It is not good enough that we have hearings and ask questions to which we receive inadequate responses.  We just go back and forth in correspondence and do not get anywhere.  We need to give some thought to dealing with this.  It is somewhat similar to the other issues.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.25" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1226" speakername="Catherine Murphy" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#C00200"><p>These services were designed to provide for a particularly vulnerable group.  Survivors bring up the issues of the legal costs and the fact that it was supposed to be mediated, along with other overheads.  When an organisation is asked a specific question by the Committee of Public Accounts and does not answer it, the only conclusion we can draw is that the organisation does not want to answer the question.  The group receiving services from Caranua is most vulnerable and is relying on us to get responses.  We have to be very clear with Caranua that we want a yes or no answer.  We do not want to go around the houses.  We want clear responses and a commitment that we will not have lease arrangements hoovering up funds that will not be replenished, as Deputy Connolly has said.  As the Deputy has also said, the timeline is important here.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.26" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#C00300"><p>I agree with everything the Deputies have said.  Bord na gCon is coming in later and we have the issue of money spent in Limerick.  Now we have a situation with the lease for Caranua.  I have a sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>discussing these topics, which concerns me.  Would the committee consider having a private meeting in which we set out how we are going to approach each of these questions that have not been addressed?  I feel we are having the same conversation all the time.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.27" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1316" speakername="Catherine Connolly" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#C00400"><p>To be fair to Caranua, it has replied to us.  The difficulty is that the reply is not easy to interpret.  The more serious difficulty is with the Department of Education and Skills and the Office of Public Works.  I do not know who told Caranua it had to move.  It seems to have been both the Office of Public Works and the Department.  One or other of them is telling Caranua it has to pay rent and cannot have a building for nothing.  That seems to be the position.  The board of Caranua, however, also seems to want a new building.  I am not sure where the truth lies.  Neither the Office of Public Works nor the Department of Education and Skills has clarified it for us.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.28" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1243" speakername="Josepha Madigan" time="09:00:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/ACC2017051800002#C00500"><p>The main thing is that we do not want money spent unnecessarily when it is needed for the more urgent issues of redress.</p></speech>

We will give them the transcript of what has been said and cover the points we need clarified.  That letter from the Department of Education and Skills does not clarify the matter at all.  It is actually confusing because on the one hand, it claims that the legislation states they shall pay their own costs, while in the previous paragraph the impression is given that they had it free for a period and are now being charged for a lease extension.  They are even contradicting their own stated position in their letter, on the face of it.</p></speech>

If he will allow me, when the Department official was here he said he would go away and check.  That in itself was disingenuous because they have been involved with Caranua from day one.  It has come up repeatedly in the minutes from 2013 in respect of the premises.  The Department of Education and Skills is part of this process.</p></speech>

We need proper clarification.  That letter does not satisfy the Committee of Public Accounts in terms of clarity.  We want the issues raised here and the transcript given to them.</p></speech>

I also want to record apologies from Deputy Alan Farrell who is not here this morning and has sent me a note.</p> <p>  The next correspondence item is No. 478B from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, providing the committee with the terms of reference of the independent investigation being carried out by the University of Limerick.  Mr. &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; has asked that the independent review consult with members of the Committee of Public Accounts on their involvement in the process.  In order to assist this, I would ask the secretariat to forward a transcript of our meeting and ask members to submit any proposed additions or changes to the terms as they are.  The secretariat will be happy to compile them.  This gives us an opportunity in addition to what we said as per the transcript to have other items considered as part of the investigation.  Members should submit any such proposals to clerk to be compiled and sent on.</p> <p>  The next item is No. 489B(i) and (ii), further correspondence from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute; in follow-up from the committee meeting on 13 April 2017 on the cost of redress and Caranua's financial statements.  The areas covered include meetings with religious orders, a note on Barnardos service, a list of all institutions contributing to the redress scheme, a list of property and lands offered by the Sisters of Mercy, property offered and transferring under the  2002 indemnity scheme, properties offered on a voluntary basis, and a note on the Christian Brothers playing fields.  There are many pages in this correspondence.  Have members had an opportunity to read them?  While we note and publish the correspondence, I think we will hold it over as part of our consideration of the Caranua issues.</p></speech>

It concerns section 4(b) of that long document, properties offered to the State and State bodies on a voluntary basis in 2009 and accepted for transfer.  Do I take it that they have now been transferred and accepted?  That is good news.  However, being parochial, I do not know if St. Anne's, Lenaboy Castle at Taylor's Hill in Galway, the former industrial school, has been transferred and accepted.</p></speech>

We had a case in Portlaoise in which a property was offered and taken back and then they offered money.  There can be a lot of legal impediments to completing the actual transfer, even after people accept and agree to do something.</p></speech>

I mix up the reformatories and industrial schools although I should not.  It is lying idle.  I was only there on Sunday.  The former residents come back and visit it every year and go to the grotto.  We have asked in the past for it to be transferred to the city council.  At the time, they offered it to the Health Service Executive, which did not want it.  If there is a chance for the city of Galway to get that building, it is an absolute golden opportunity.  We have many ideas about how to use it.</p></speech>

We will ask for clarification as to whether all those properties that have been accepted for transfer have been transferred.  There is a quite a difference between accepting and completing a transaction.</p> <p>  The next item is Nos. 494(B)(i) and (ii), from Mr. Se&aacute;n &Oacute; Foghl&uacute;, Secretary General in the Department of Education and Skills, replying to the committee's request for information on the purchase of Harold's Cross stadium.

It is just the greyhound board resuming the discussion.  We can follow up items by way of subsequent requests afterwards.</p> <p>  Correspondence item 497B, dated 16 May 2017 from Bord na gCon, provides follow-up information from our meeting two weeks ago on pensions, employment details, Harold&rsquo;s Cross stadium, the marketing strategy and a note on the organisation review.  We note and publish this and will discuss it with them shortly.</p> <p>  Category C is individual correspondence from persons, not Government Departments.  No. 476C is correspondence dated 9 May 2017 from the UK Public Accounts Committee Network, informing us that the conference to be held in June has now been postponed until September.</p><p>We will note that.<br/><br/>Nos. 478C(i) and (ii) are correspondence received from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform with a holding answer on a reply regarding the wards of court issue sent to it for a response.  We are still waiting for that and will note that.  <br/><br/>Nos. 479C and 486C are correspondence dated 12 May 2017 received from an individual regarding the evidence given by the former president of the University of Limerick.  As an independent review has begun, I suggest we seek permission from this individual to send this letter, along with a copy of the transcript mentioned, to Professor Richard Thorn, who is leading the investigation.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  <br/><br/>Nos. 482C(i) and (ii) are correspondence dated 18 April 2017 from an individual wishing to remain anonymous regarding the inability of the HEA to carry out its functions.  I think the matters raised deserve some consideration by members when considering matters related to the third-level sector.  We will come back to complete our consideration of the third-level sector so we will note it and hold it over for exercise.<br/><br/>No. 483C is correspondence dated 9 May 2017 from Mr. Jim Breslin, Secretary General, Department of Health, in reply to the committee seeking information on Novartis.  I suggest that we note this correspondence and forward a copy to the original correspondent who wrote to us.  <br/><br/>As for Nos. 484C(i) to (iii), inclusive, 485C, 490C and 491C, this is correspondence received from Deputies Alan Kelly, Catherine Murphy, David Cullinane and Mary Lou McDonald and myself, respectively, with recommendations for the committee on potential witnesses and how to structure the forthcoming examination into the Garda College in Templemore.  We will discuss this in private session before we go into public session.  <br/><br/>Nos. 488C(i) and (ii) are correspondence dated 12 May 2017 from NAMA in reply to correspondence regarding the sale of the Savarin portfolio in the Czech Republic.  We will note this response and forward a copy to the original correspondent.  Is that agreed?  Agreed.  <br/><br/>No. 492C is correspondence dated 11 May from George O'Callaghan, chief executive officer, the Limerick and Clare Education and Training Board, ETB.  The correspondence is a reply to the committee on the late presentation of accounts of the ETB.  Can we see that on the screen?  It is saying it expects to have its 2016 accounts submitted to the Comptroller and Auditor General by September 2017.  The 2017 accounts will be submitted in the first quarter of 2018.  That seems reasonable.  There is background information regarding the difficulties but at this point, we just want to make sure it gets up to speed now.  It seems to be but we will check that as time rolls on.  It is a reasonable response.<br/><br/>The next item concerns Nos. 493C(i) to (iii), inclusive, correspondence dated 5 May 2017 from Patricia Quinn, managing director of Benefacts, with a copy of its annual report and a report on non-profit sector analysis.  The report is very interesting and I suggest that all members give some time to read it.  <br/><br/>No. 495C is correspondence dated 15 May 2017 from Deputy Alan Kelly.  This is an email containing a reply from the T&aacute;naiste's office on a matter raised in the D&aacute;il by Deputy Kelly on the finances in the Garda College and related matters.  We will discuss that shortly when we discuss the issue relating to the Templemore issue.  <br/><br/>No. 498C is correspondence dated 16 May 2017 from Deputy Alan Farrell stating that he wishes to discuss the Department of Defence's disposal of the naval vessel, the <i>LE Aisling</i>.  Deputy Farrell is not here so we will hold it over.  Obviously, we will want to get information from the Department.  In the absence of Deputy Farrell, we might agree on his behalf because we know what he is looking for, which is to write to the Department for a full briefing on the matter.  His letter is on the record.  </p></speech>

A copy of the document was requested by another Member of the Houses.  Is it agreed that we make this document available to the Member?  Agreed.  The Library and Research Service has a protocol.  If somebody asks it to do a body of work, it does so but before a third party seeks a copy, it must get the consent of the person who asked for the work to be done.  We have no problem regarding making a document on the remit of the Committee of Public Accounts widely available.  We will note and publish that ourselves.  I think it is doing some further work on it.  It is a very useful document that is helpful to us.  The last Committee of Public Accounts went to the trouble of getting a document produced so I ask members to read it in their own time.  We will give the Library and Research Service permission to release to whoever requested it.  </p> <p>  The next item on the agenda is statements and accounts received the last meeting, of which there are only a couple.  The first one is the Revenue account.  As the account of State revenues and income received, it is only a slight matter of &euro;66 billion in total revenues to the State in 2016.  The Revenue Commissioners are scheduled for a visit and we will deal with that then.  There is a clear audit opinion.  The next item is the Irish Museum of Modern Art for which there is a clear audit opinion.  The next item is the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority for which there is a clear audit opinion for 2015.  The next item is the National Library of Ireland for which there is a clear audit opinion for 2015.  In respect of the Irish Museum of Modern Art, the Sea-Fisheries Protection Authority and the National Library of Ireland, it is 17 months after year end.  That is an excessive period in all three cases.  Does the Comptroller and Auditor General know when they were presented to him?  </p></speech>

We tend to prioritise the bigger accounts so that is why the 2016 Revenue account is done.  We will be doing the audits of the smaller entities over the summer.  We try to spread the work over the year and to prioritise the bigger accounts.  It is a difficulty.</p></speech>

We are joined from Bord na gCon by Mr. Phil Meaney, chairman, Dr. Se&aacute;n Brady, interim chief executive officer, Mr. Michael Murnane, chief financial officer, Mr. Colin Walsh, director of commercial operations, Mr. Pat Creed, board member, Mr. Pat Herbert, board member, and Mr. Joe Lewins, director of IT and tote.  We are joined from the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine by Mr. Brendan Gleeson, assistant secretary.</p><p>I remind members, witnesses and those in the Public Gallery that all mobile phones must be either switched off or set in aeroplane mode.  Silent mode is not sufficient to prevent signals from interfering with the recording of proceedings.</p><p>I advise the witnesses that, by virtue of section 17(2)(<i>l</i>) of the Defamation Act 2009, witnesses are protected by absolute privilege in respect of their evidence to the committee.  If they are directed by it to cease giving evidence on a particular matter and they continue to do so, they are entitled thereafter only to a qualified privilege in respect of their evidence.  They are directed that only evidence connected with the subject matter of these proceedings is to be given and asked to respect the parliamentary practice to the effect that, where possible, they should not criticise or make charges against any person, persons or entity by name or in such a way as to make him, her or it identifiable.</p><p>Members are reminded of the provisions of Standing Order 186 that the committee shall refrain from inquiring into the merits of a policy or policies of the Government or a Minister of the Government or the merits of the objectives of such policy.  Members are also reminded of the long-standing ruling of the Chair to the effect that they should not comment on, criticise or make charges against a person outside the House or an official either by name or in such a way as to make him or her identifiable.</p><p>I remind those in the Public Gallery that they are in the Houses by special permission and should not make any comments or distract from the proceedings in any way.  If they do so, they will be asked to leave.  None of the witnesses may be approached after the meeting, during the break or while they are in the Houses of the Oireachtas or the vicinity thereof.  I insist on full co-operation on this matter.  Following incidents two weeks ago, this matter is being taken very seriously by the Captain of the Guard and Superintendent of the House.</p><p>We will resume proceedings at the point at which we concluded the previous meeting.  Deputy Catherine Murphy was questioning the witnesses when the meeting adjourned.  When the Deputy has concluded her contribution, members will be taken in the following sequence: Deputy Shane Cassells, Deputy Catherine Connolly and Deputy Alan Kelly, after which we will have a second round of contributions commencing with Deputy Cullinane followed by Deputy Marc MacSharry.  Deputy Bobby Aylward has also indicated.  I am confining each member's contribution to ten minutes as it is intended to complete proceedings before the voting bloc commences in the Chamber.</p></speech>

There is a debt arising in Limerick greyhound stadium and another debt carried on overdraft which was related to the site.  Is the overdraft facility still in place or is the overdraft now a loan?</p></speech>

There is a &euro;12.5 million loan for the Limerick stadium, which was drawn in December 2009.  There has always been an overdraft of &euro;12.5 million that has been effectively closely drawn to the limit of each year for the past long number of years.  In 2015, AIB required those facilities to be renewed and split the overdraft into what is considered a hard core because it has never fallen below that level.

The Department of Education and Skills was the only party that walked the site in 2016.  The site was not up for sale or anything of the sort.  During that timeframe, Bord na gCon was exploring the option of getting the stadium rezoned for alternative uses.  The Department approached us and asked if its representatives could look at the site and walk through the stadium.  I think they did that on Monday.  I was there the morning on which they were there.</p></speech>

I wish to start by reflecting on some of the evidence which we heard at the last meeting and comments from Dr. Brady in respect of the importance he placed on vacant possession in the matter of the disposal of the stadium at Harold's Cross.  Obviously, that was motivating factor when it came to the manner in which he moved in the Valentine's swoop.  I wish to examine a number of areas in this respect.  On the manner in which it was conducted, given the importance that Dr. Brady has placed on vacant possession from the point of view of the banks and disposal, was there any part of the IGB's debt written off by the banks as a sweetener to ensure it would get vacant possession of the stadium at Harold's Cross?  Was Dr. Brady motivated to act in the heavy-handed manner in which he did?  He admitted here the previous day that he was wrong to do so and that he would revisit the decision if he could.  It is obviously causing a lot of agony.  It is also the central motivating point in respect of this dispute.  If there was a write-off, is that now in jeopardy because of the stand-off?  As has been confirmed in the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills, no moneys have passed into the accounts of the IGB at this point.  Obviously then, no money has been passed on to the banks in respect of paying the debt.  Will Dr. Brady begin on that point please?</p></speech>

Perhaps our director, Mr. Pat Creed, will take the second part.  Certainly, I am an outsider with 30 years of management experience.  On my eighth day in the job I went to the head office of AIB and met the people from AIB.  On the way out of that meeting, they informed me that if the IGB did not sell the site, the bank would.</p><p>That informed our approach, or at least my approach, given the level of debt.  The organisation was skin and bones thanks to that straitjacket of debt.  That informed my decision on the eighth day of my working for the organisation.  Mr. Creed will deal with the second part of the Deputy's question.</p></speech>

It is important that questions be answered today.  Let me remind the witnesses of something, given the seriousness of what is involved.  People are watching these proceedings who are concerned for their sport.  Many of them listened to "Drivetime" on RTE Radio 1 on Tuesday and would have been shocked by the fact that this sport received &euro;300,000 per week in taxpayers' money.  Mothers who cannot get occupational therapists for their kids because of a lack of resources, elderly people who cannot get medical cards and people who are under financial pressure are watching a sport for dogs that have less meat on their bones than I do, yet the witnesses are talking about the payment of such sums.  These are serious issues and significant payments into the sport, so I would appreciate answers.</p> <p>  Regarding the &euro;23 million - we could not get that figure the previous day, but thank God for the Department of Education and Skills, which can give us a three-page report - secured from the sale of Harold's Cross to the Department, we have clarified that the land has been zoned as Z9 - open space.  No local area plan, LAP, was prepared in advance, but Mr. Murnane's comments were interesting, in that departmental officials walked the site in 2016 and alternative uses for it were explored.  Do the witnesses believe that a proper price was paid for this land?  We have just completed an investigation into Project Eagle and whether there had been losses on land.  I wonder whether the Comptroller and Auditor will have to audit "Project Greyhound" and whether too much has been paid for this land, given that it was zoned as open space.  The amount magically hit the debt figure incurred by the IGB and the Department of Education and Skills suddenly paid a composite amount for the purchase of the property.  Does Mr. Gleeson believe that this was the correct amount of money?  There is no guarantee that the land will be rezoned or that there will be planning permission, yet &euro;23 million has been paid for the site.</p></speech>

The process is that the Valuation Office provides a valuation for the site.  I cannot say more about the valuation than that.  The Valuation Office valued it.  That is all that I know about it.</p> <p>  There was a second aspect to the Deputy's question.  A zoning process is under way.  As I understand it, that process will involve getting sanction from the Department of Public Expenditure and Reform.  It will also involve the provision of a contract that will be subject to zoning, in that the Department of Education and Skills will sign a contract subject to the appropriate zoning being obtained.  That is my understanding.</p></speech>

At our previous meeting, Dr. Brady and Mr. Gleeson referred to circular 17/2016, the process since 23 March and the interaction between the Departments on the purchase of the site.  Would it be fair to say that the board had at the very least been hamstrung by that circular?  Despite the offer from the Department of Education and Skills, was there any examination by the board?  Mr. Murnane has indicated that alternatives were explored in 2016.  To what depth?  Given that Dublin City Council was entering into a new city plan at the time, the IGB could have approached the council and sought an LAP for the site.  That is now being done retrospectively.  The IGB could have applied for commercial zoning and, in doing so, possibly realised a greater value and more funds for the sport.  What alternative uses were explored in 2016?</p></speech>

Does Bord na gCon propose to become a niche market?  Will it lose its footprint in rural regional areas?  The track in my home town of Navan closed 20 years ago and Lidl has built on it now.  By selling off the dog tracks, I know the sport lost a footprint in a regional town and lost the local patronage.  If Bord na gCon takes a decision to go for regionalisation it will narrow its footprint.  Bord na gCon admits in its marketing strategy that stadia once seen as a key hub have become less connected to the community.  If the board continues with the strategy of narrowing the market rather than expanding is it not on a slippery downward spiral?  The GAA succeeds as an organisation because it is in every single parish in the country.</p></speech>

I believe we are getting closer to that but I cannot say when it will happen.  We have put in long hours.  The CEO stated earlier that the IGB is losing &euro;30,000, that is not counting the amount of money the dog owners are losing in that period.  It is very obvious that we need to get racing back in Dublin.</p></speech>

I am not sure if the Department would agree with that, it is for the update of the Power report.</p></speech>

It is because I have so many reports before me.  The problem was that the recommendations were not implemented.  Had the Dalton report been implemented and acted upon in 2006, or any of the reports been acted on, we would not be in serious trouble.  I am specifically asking the witnesses about this but I get an answer that they have been implemented except one.  I go back to the first recommendation and I ask about it and I am told it has not yet been implemented.</p> <p>  We have 11 recommendations.  The first one is very important, but all of them are very important.  I will now turn to recommendation 11, which I thought was a misprint, where it states, "The Committee recommends that the ongoing issues concerning the breeding of greyhounds with dogs deceased for two years or more, registered in the stud book by the ICC, must be addressed immediately".  Has that been addressed?  I now know what it means because I made inquiries; the semen from a dead dog is kept for two years and its use is allowed for the two year period for the purposes of breeding in four studs throughout the country.</p></speech>

There was a new regulation introduced.  The decision to introduce the rule was made in 2005.  The board made the decision to revoke it in 2008 on the basis of practicality, but it did not.  In 2014 the rule was revoked but it could not be made retrospective.  We now have a provision in the Bill, currently with the committee, to deal with the issue.</p></speech>

It is a splintered industry and it always has been.  In December 2015 we individually brought in all the stakeholders.  During 2016 we brought together the stakeholders on two or three occasions &ndash; I am unsure of the exact number.</p> <p>  Not all stakeholders accepted our invitation, but we invited all stakeholders in.

The first meeting of the national greyhound forum was hosted on 15 March 2016.  There were representatives from a cross-section of groups.  I have before me a list of the groups, including various people from throughout the industry.  There are details of the matters discussed and there are minutes.</p> <p>  The second meeting of the national greyhound forum took place on 14 July 2016.  Again, there were representatives from a cross-section of groups.  The details can all be furnished separately rather than going through the whole list.</p> <p>  The third meeting of the national greyhound forum took place on 10 November 2016.  It was attended by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Andrew Doyle and an official, Rebecca Chapman, who is responsible for the horse and greyhound racing division, and Teagasc.  An overview of proposed legislation was discussed at the forum.  Representatives attended from a broad cross-section of the industry.</p> <p>  These are structured meetings that are agenda-based.  Minutes are taken.  Different people have different views on them.  Some people choose to attend.  Some choose not to attend.  A structure is in place.  There is a commitment that the next forum will take place one month after the re-opening of Shelbourne Park.</p></speech>

Indecon did not state that Harold's Cross should be sold.  Is that not right?  It made a recommendation that Bord na gCon would look at selling a number of assets.  The word "consider" was used.  The recommendation was that Bord na gCon would consider looking at a number of assets, including land in Cork, Harold's Cross and other assets.  Is that not right?</p></speech>

The only three tracks making money were Cork, Shelbourne and Harold's Cross.  Bord na gCon has come back and said that Harold's Cross and Shelbourne Park are not viable because they are so near each other.  Both were making money.  Those three tracks stood out.</p> <p>  What assessment has Bord na gCon done?  Let us consider the track in Galway?  What assessment has the board done in respect of the loss there?  What plans does Bord na gCon have?  Mr. Meaney should clarify the position in respect of the company running each race track.  Is a separate company in place for the purposes of operating it?  Do these companies have any other decision-making powers?</p></speech>

I would also like to apologise to Deputy Aylward, because he asked a question that completely threw us the last day.  I am unsure whether you were here at the time, Chairman.  He asked about 2003 and 2017.  We were thrown by that.  In fact, there was an error on the recommendation, in my opinion, anyway.  It was for 2013.</p> <p>  A strategic plan was prepared in 2013.  It was followed by the Indecon report.  Then, in 2015 a detailed plan was submitted to the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine in May 2015.  We are following that plan.  As a point of interest, the sale of Harold's Cross was one of the items in that strategic plan.</p></speech>

The Indecon report goes through it meticulously.  It says that the Bord na gCon targets were not met.  The report pointed out serious concerns for what Bord na gCon could expect in 2013.  For example, the first year of the strategic plan ended with a total group surplus of &euro;40,000, compared with the planned figure of &euro;238,000.  The report states that the most significant aspect of the 2013 performance was the non-achievement of the target for net turnover from the racing facilities.  It also states that the plan appears to be approximately one year behind and so on.  Why am I raising that?  It is because there were concerns over the strategic plan.  Indecon hoped that Bord na gCon would meet its targets further out or later on in the period.  Did the board meet them?  We do not know.  The Bord na gCon representatives are not even sure of the years of the strategic plan.  I am simply quoting from what the taxpayers have paid for.</p> <p>  The aim was to restore confidence.  I realise the value of the greyhound industry.  Serious issues around welfare arise that I might come back to.  Anyway, the purpose is to restore confidence and integrity.  Then, Bord na gCon goes on to sell one item, Harold's Cross.  It does not account for the empty premises in Limerick.  There is a call centre in Thurles.  What is the cost of that?  Bord na gCon is paying for a call centre in Thurles.  Is that correct?</p></speech>

I am surprised the witnesses are back here because I did not expect them to be back in their positions.  Do they realise how bad the evidence they are giving looks to the people who are watching at home?  Do they realise the number of contradictions in their evidence?  This is the Committee of Public Accounts.  It is a constitutional committee, the most important in the Oireachtas and the evidence the witnesses are giving here is the worst I have ever seen.  Do they realise what I am saying to them?  It is the worst I have ever seen and it is getting worse today, in reply to the questions asked by my predecessors.  I would like the witnesses to reflect on that.  I mean this: does each of the witnesses stand over the evidence given to date?  If somebody does not, please say so now.</p></speech>

Perhaps everybody did not pick it up, but the Chairman picked it up very clearly.

I was not even referring to the contradictions in respect of the reports and dates.  Does each of the witnesses stand over the evidence they have given to date?  I will presume if I do not hear anything else, the answer is "Yes".  Do the witnesses have confidence in each another and in the board?  If I do not hear anything else, I will take it that, yes, the witnesses all have confidence in each another and in the evidence given to date.</p> <p>  I see what has happened in recent weeks in respect of the sale of Harold's Cross, given the board that is in place, as a cross-subsidy.  I do not have confidence in the board and I feel that this is double jeopardy in respect of this action.  Deputy Cassells' questioning of Mr. Creed about the bank situation leaves me totally bewildered.  There is certainly something that needs to be added.  The witnesses need to reflect on that.  Will Mr. Murnane provide evidence of what he said on the previous occasion about the sale of the Meelick site?  I would like to check it.</p></speech>

I was there.  There were over 700 people - virtually the entire industry - in Horse and Jockey.  Mr. Meaney is right about one thing.  There are different sections in this industry, there is fragmentation, there are different groups and they do not always agree with one another but they agreed that day.  The 700 people there could not fit into the room, some had to stay in the lobby and the car park but they agreed that they did not have confidence in the witnesses.  The fact that Mr. Meaney thinks there is only a certain view shows he is not living in the real world if he cannot see what is in front of him in the context of what the industry is saying.  It is united on that.</p> <p>  On 5 April, Mr. Meaney stated "IGB is under pressure to manage a legacy debt now reduced to &euro;20.3 million, which preceded the current chairman, board and executive of IGB."  Is that true?</p></speech>

So there was nobody on the board during this period which, as already stated, "preceded the current chairman, board and executive of IGB".  Would Mr. Meaney now like to reflect on what he said?  Is there a serving member of the board who was on the board during the period in question?</p></speech>

The figure I gave was based on the average attendance per meeting.  There was a 5% reduction in the number of meetings that year as part of the Indecon recalibration.  The figures at the bottom of page 19 show a reduction in the number of races held in 2015 relative to the number held in 2014.

However, if one were to look at what was said at a meeting of this committee attended by Mr. Meaney and the former CEO, Mr. Neilan, several years ago which I had the pleasure of watching recently, you spoke about 30 contracts being signed in regard to expanding the capacity of the organisation to grow markets in Austria, Spain, and several other places.

That is a significant contract.  In terms of the commingling international wagering deal which is being referred to, there have been approximately ten to 12 of those contracts signed since Mr. Neilan gave evidence to this committee in 2013.</p><p>The more correct figure would be in the region of 15 or 16 and not just four contracts.</p></speech>

Mr. Walsh continued:</p><blockquote>Therefore, when one compares on-track Tote performance, there is a very similar level of decline.  HRI has managed to offset the on-track decline with an exceptional performance in international markets, which would include the US, South Africa, Canada, France, Germany and Italy.  Of those markets, IGB is only allowed to operate in the US.  It is precluded legally from trading in terms of Tote.</blockquote> <p>I have a few questions.  The organisation has signed 16 contracts.  Where are they?  What are the jurisdictions involved?  Why has the measure not had a huge increase in the board's revenue?</p><p>The connotation of what Mr. Walsh said is that the HRI has offset the decline with an exceptional performance in international markets.  I looked up the HRI.  The HRI's total tote betting in 2015 was &euro;79.3 million with international pools making up &euro;5.4 million.  Of the totality, the sum generated by international pools is not a huge amount.</p></speech>

In a previous life I was a business manger in Bord F&aacute;ilte or F&aacute;ilte Ireland so I know a little bit about marketing and online space.  To say the strategy is poor would be an understatement.</p><p>Before I conclude my round of questioning, I would like to ask Mr. Meaney a specific question.  Obviously Mr. Meaney has had some engagement, significant or otherwise, with the industry given the situation we find ourselves in over the past number of weeks or months.  He has had to deal with the industry.  Let us call a spade a spade.  He has probably had difficult conversations and different people in touch with him or <i>vice versa. </i>I presume the situation has not been easy because we are dealing with a very difficult situation.  If any of what I have said is unfair or inaccurate then please say so.</p><p>I have permission to state the following name.  Does Mr. Meaney know a Miss Clare Hanley?</p></speech>

Those who have indicated have asked their first rounds of questions between our previous meeting and this meeting.  Some members have indicated to make a second contribution.  We will start with Deputies Cullinane, MacSharry, Aylward and Burke.  However, before we proceed to the second round, I have three brief questions to put to the witnesses.  I was not at the previous meeting, so if some of this was covered then, I apologise for going back over it.  These are points that came to my attention as the meeting went along.</p> <p>  Deputy Connolly mentioned the consultative forum.  When is it next due to meet?</p></speech>

It has been a difficult time, as we said at the previous meeting here.  We often have two board meetings in a week.  It has been a very difficult time.

I have just been listening to the two of them this morning.  I did not have any prior knowledge of this.</p> <p>  Perhaps I will ask Mr. Creed the second question.  It is about the bank.  The witnesses have confirmed that the bank has not offered any write-down on the debt but did IGB raise, or will it raise, the question of a write-down?  IGB owes a bank a lot of money.  This debt goes back and has been building up over a decade.  If IGB is coming in with an ability perhaps to clear the decks, I would expect the board to expect some element of write-down.  While one has not been offered, does IGB expect it will look for one?</p></speech>

This is where I was trying to be helpful to Deputy Cassells earlier in his questioning.  The bank has not offered a write-down, but the second half of the question was whether the IGB has sought one.  Mr. Creed said IGB has sought a write-down, which I understand, but that discussions are still ongoing.  In other words, IGB has sought a write-down but it has not been offered.  It is still in the melting pot.</p></speech>

Four weeks ago, we had a bank debt of &euro;20-odd million and had no idea what the realisable value of the sale of the asset was.  We now have a sale of an asset, pending process, of &euro;23 million.  I am sure the bank will take a different view on it now on the basis of sales proceeds, but discussions are ongoing at this point in time.</p></speech>

It was said 30,000 a year are being lost in Dublin.  Obviously, there is racing going on.  How many venues are still having racing?  There are people in this room and people watching with an intimate knowledge of the industry; there are other people who do not have that level of knowledge.

Mr. Meaney said that when one decides, one divides.  Obviously, some people are most unhappy with the situation.  I have no idea of the numbers.  I am just being logical in my question.  Obviously, if there are people going to the other 15 venues for meetings, they are still continuing to go to their meets.  What I want to establish is the attendance at the meetings in 2017 to date in those areas and how the figures from those 15 tracks compare with the same period last year.  The witnesses should be able to do up rough figures-----</p></speech>

First, I want to be very fair to all of them who have come back on a second occasion.  My questions are solely in the context of process and decision-making.  I appreciate that many of the mistakes, as I would see them, that were made in the past were made by a previous board.</p> <p>  Second, it would be helpful if the witnesses answered as frankly as they can the questions that are put.  If they do not know the answer to a question, they should just say as much because it rules out unnecessary conflict.  If I ask a simple question about valuations or whatever it may be, if they have the answer at their fingertips, that is great; if they do not, they can forward the information.  It is just a more efficient way of doing our business.</p> <p>  I must put it to them first, though, that there is a reading of the facts as they were presented at the last hearing and a narrative, which may or may not be true or fair, that the sale of the Harold's Cross stadium is essentially a Government bailout of a failed Government-appointed quango.  That is one of the narratives or readings out there, and they must accept that.  Obviously, they might have a different view.  What they need to do is work with me to counter that narrative and answer the questions I put to them.</p><p>What is the current level of debt within the organisation?

In that context the situation would be that we would not be able to meet the level of debt that was outstanding at the time.</p></speech>

He was the one who said that.  We all live in the real world.  If an organisation has a debt of over &euro;20 million that is a real issue the bank has to deal with.  If it wipes out its debt, it is an issue the bank does not have to deal with.  Whatever negotiating hand Mr. Creed believes he has, once a decision is made to sell Harold's Cross, everybody can see that the Irish Greyhound Board's negotiating hand in terms of getting a bank write-down is significantly weakened.  Saying that is not to weaken its hand, it is just a fact.  It is a reality and Mr. Creed has already accepted that.  I will move on from that.</p> <p>  It is remarkable that the valuation again hits the bull's-eye here.  It essentially completely wipes out the debt.  The valuation of the land is almost identical to what would be required to wipe out the debt.  Can Mr. Gleeson see why that would at least solicit questions from us on the Committee of Public Accounts?</p></speech>

People may think they are the same process: rezoning is a function of a development plan process, material contravention of a development plan is a different issue.  What can happen is that if the zoning on the site is not appropriate to the planning application being considered, the application can go in as a planning application and the local authority, with the consent of the planners and the elected members can agree to grant a material contravention for that site for that specific purpose.  It is a separate process from opening up the rezoning in a development plan.  A material contravention is normally how these things tend to happen.</p></speech>

If my reading of the letter from the Secretary General of the Department of Education and Skills is correct - Mr. Gleeson seems to be of the same opinion - the deal is subject to rezoning.  I want to be certain about what "subject to rezoning" means.  I acknowledge that Mr. Gleeson cannot answer for the Department of Education and Skills but he can give me the perspective of the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine.  Is it the case that an application will have to be made by the Department to the local authority seeking the rezoning of the site?  The local authority will have to follow a process before making a decision.  If the decision is favourable the sale will go ahead, but if it is not rezoned the sale will not go ahead.  Is that Mr. Gleeson's understanding?</p></speech>

The Meelick site cost &euro;1 million but another &euro;900,000 was spent on the Meelick site so the liability was actually &euro;1.9 million and a further &euro;200,000 was used to use the site maps for the current Limerick stadium, so the net loss arising from Meelick at this point in time is &euro;1.7 million less the realisable value of the asset.</p></speech>

With the appropriate zoning to allow for institutional use, the market value is probably &euro;1.5 million an acre, which is very substantially less than &euro;23 million.  Dr. Brady mentioned the Rehab site.  That is ironic because, similarly, while those values would apply, and I believe that site was in Sandyford, which would not be as good an area in terms of property values, the Department of Education and Skills paid more than &euro;5 million per acre for institutional zoning for a site on which there was a listed building.  To my mind, that is a multiple of the value per acre.  There is a major value for money issue here and there is also the coincidence of Bord na gCon's entire debt having to match broadly the profile of the proposed purchase price.</p> <p>  In terms of the split of the &euro;13 million and the &euro;10 million to be worked out subject to contract, as Mr. Murnane said, is there a structure to the deal in that if Bord na gCon does not get zoning, it will get &euro;13 million and not the additional &euro;10 million?</p></speech>

When we consider that we are not long finished with Project Eagle, this would seem to indicate that between Rehab and this particular purchase, we are overpaying.  That is something that needs to be noted.  I imagine the board would be very happy with &euro;23 million, and I would suspect that the Savills valuation, which is naturally commercially sensitive at this time, is substantially less than that.  That is why it will be interesting to see it after Bord na gCon closes its sale.</p> <p>  In terms of a write-down from the bank, does Dr. Brady not believe that at this stage Bord na gCon has a snowball's chance in hell of getting a write-down on the basis that it is in the public domain and it is getting &euro;23 million?</p></speech>

In terms of natural fairness and justice, why should Bord na gCon get a write-down?  Home owners throughout the country have been pinned to the wall for every ha'penny, and they have been pursued after the fact.

However, that is an aside.</p> <p>  I want to put on record my view of the valuation, which is &euro;750,000 per acre on its current zoning and about &euro;1.5 million per acre if it gets zoned for institutional use.

In terms of the narrative around the call centre, there have been calls recently for the sales centre to be closed and for the nine jobs in Tipperary to go.  The call centre is an integral part of our commercial infrastructure.  While our online transactions, bookings and so on are growing strongly, the nature of our business is that we take the payments up-front.  Most of our bookings are group bookings of different sizes.  We have bookings with many tour operators as well, so we have to have a team of people at the end of the phone dealing with the people making the bookings.  Someone might ring to book a group of five or ten people.  They have to get the money from all the people, work out the package they want and the part of the restaurant they want.</p> <p>  The other element of the business that has changed somewhat in recent years is that we try to manage yield and revenue.  We manage a mix of sales packages in order that we are maximising the yield and the revenues from the sales mix daily and weekly.</p></speech>

As set out in one of the commentaries I read, if the sales centre moved to Dublin, we would be looking at increased labour costs, increased rental costs and redundancy costs for the Irish Greyhound Board, IGB.</p></speech>

It spelled out what was wrong in the industry four years ago.  According to it, people had been witness to the virtual collapse of the Irish greyhound industry in the preceding few years, with a decreasing tote, attendance level and dog pool evident.  It asserts that the people administering the industry tried to dismiss the figures and that promises of a bright future appeared to lack credibility.  Trainers up and down the country were feeling a financial pinch, it reads, with individual trainers frustrated at the IGB's apparent lack of direction.  The reduction in spending on track maintenance was clear for all to see, as were the escalating levels of serious injuries at tracks coupled with malfunctioning equipment.  According to the invitation, there appeared to be no transparency or accountability in the IGB as it limped from one crisis to the next.  The main issue was the repayment of &euro;25 million in 2016, which was growing closer on the horizon.  This invitation shows that breeders and trainers saw these problems in the industry in 2013.</p> <p>  The trainers association held a meeting that night in September.  Approximately 80 people attended.  However, another meeting was held where 30 professional trainers were brought into a room on their own and the rest were locked out.  It was stated at that meeting that the board had offered professional trainers a bonus of &euro;10 for every dog they raced.  This meeting appointed a chairman on the night, but no meeting has been held since.</p> <p>  When I asked Dr. Brady at our previous meeting about how important it was to meet stakeholders, he stated that a forum had been set up.  However, that forum has not met for six months.  This forms part of the problem with the industry.  The board is not playing ball with stakeholders and those who matter, namely, the breeders and owners of dogs.  It is not bringing stakeholders and people who have concerns along with it.  The board seems to be aloof and not playing ball.  Will Dr. Brady comment on what I have said?</p></speech>

The organisation is down to its skin and bones as a result of the debt burden.  It is caught between a rock and a hard place with the threat of insolvency.  The IGB should look forward, not back.  It is a time for unity, growth and investment in the industry.  When the deal is concluded, it will create a new vista for the organisation.</p></speech>

It is leaving them behind and not negotiating with them.  It seems to be aloof in its decisions.  The IGB cannot run a good business unless it brings those on whom it depends along with it.  The IGB has lost the confidence of breeders and racers in the greyhound industry.  That is my personal opinion based on what I have heard in the weeks since we last had the IGB appear before us.</p></speech>

They were difficult times.  I accept that, given the decisions that were made, some people have become disenfranchised.  When you decide, you divide, but we had to get the industry back on a good, solid footing.  I echo Dr. Brady's remarks.  We are effectively court case free and have sorted most of our problems.  Our debt at the end of 2015 and start of 2016 was &euro;20.3 million.  We are now debt free.  Those decisions had to be made.</p></speech>

We can keep looking back, but the problems were not imaginary.  Some people in the greyhound business believed that we could magic away the problems.  We could not.  They were real problems that had to be faced.  The board had the opportunity to kick the problems down the road, but it chose - the last few board members who joined in 2015 in particular - to face up to those problems in the belief that doing so would make for a better industry.  Deputy Aylward knows that he and I are from the same constituency.  I am committed to the greyhound industry.  I knew that the problems existed when I joined.  I did not join for an easy ride.  God knows what I get out of this, but I joined with the belief that we could solve the problems.  I accept Deputy Cullinane's point but, on the assumption that the deal goes through, the business will be in a terrific place.  If we all stopped talking about what happened in 2005, 2013, 2011 and 2009 and got behind the industry, it could be a great one.</p></speech>

They were difficult times for everyone - owners, trainers and breeders.  When we had small amounts of money available, we gave certain concessions on occasion to try to keep everything on the road and the industry going.  It was from that that we decided to set up a forum so that people might have an input into where the money at our disposal should go, be it to owners, breeders or trainers.  I am anxious to get all stakeholders going in the same direction, but that will be very difficult to do.</p></speech>

It was virtually impossible, but we got it up and running.  We held three meetings last year.  As someone mentioned, we held a get together at the end of 2015.  A meeting was set for 23 February, plus or minus some days, but the next thing there was a protest in Dublin, so we did not go ahead with the meeting.  That was not to make life easier for us.  It was just the wrong time to have a meeting.  People were uneasy.</p></speech>

Every time a pup won a race, &euro;15 went back to the breeder.  There were several small initiatives that we put in over the years.  I am certain of the &euro;15 prize and it is still in place.  There was &euro;10 for the trainer.</p></speech>

The breeder of the winner gets &euro;15 paid by IGB into his account.</p> <p>  Again, it is not elitist.  A trainer has to train 100 dogs.  Once he trains 100 runners, as opposed to winners, then whether the person is an owner, trainer, private trainer or public trainer, that person gets the award.  I do not in any way agree with the Deputy that there was anything untoward about it.  It was a small attempt by the board in difficult times when we were murdered with debt-----</p></speech>

We had the defined benefit pension scheme.  We had massive bank debts that needed to be sorted.  We had some issues around needing a laboratory machine.</p> <p>  In early 2016, we went to Limerick and met every constituent of the greyhound industry for the entire day.  The trainers and owners and so on came in.  We met them all for the whole day.  It was one full day.  I am keen to refute the fact that we are not talking to people.  We had three consultative forums during 2016.  The last was attended by the Minister of State at the Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine, Deputy Andrew Doyle.  We have met the industry on a consultative basis right through 2016.</p></speech>

That came out of the consultative forum.  We agreed to have a sales event in Shelbourne Park.  It was a major success.  Many dogs were sold for big money.  It was a great boost for the industry.  I hope the problem is gone now, but some people seem to be saying "if".  The problem is that with the debt gone, we can now look at rewarding the people who are keeping this industry going, including the owners, breeders and trainers.  We will have substantial funds to do that in the current year.</p></speech>

I could not let it go without saying something about Harold's Cross.  It is closed and locked up at the moment.  A dispute has arisen.  Bord na gCon is losing &euro;30,000 per week according to the documents I have before me.  That is a great deal of money.  Has any progress been made on that?  In hindsight, would it have been better to do it differently?  The sale to the Department of Education and Skills of Harold's Cross might not go through for five or six months.  Would Bord na gCon not have been better off to have left open the gates of Harold's Cross?  It was one of the top three earners in the country.  Would it not have been better to keep in going and keep people happy and then have the sale and close it, rather than the way the board did it, which was by stealth?</p></speech>

AIB told us that if we did not sell the site, then the bank would sell it.  That informed the decision.  The sale of Harold's Cross also formed part of the strategic plan for 2017.  The sale of Harold's Cross and getting it ready for sale was absolutely fundamental to the future of the industry.</p></speech>

A total of &euro;50 million was put in by 2015 and that went down to &euro;20 million in the Tote.  The figure for Horse Racing Ireland went from &euro;50 million up to &euro;80 million in the same time with the recession and everything included.  Can the deputation explain why?  The Tote is a major money spinner for the Irish Greyhound Board.  Why did the figure go from &euro;50 million to &euro;20 million?  What were the reasons?  The figure for Horse Racing Ireland went from &euro;50 million to &euro;80 million.  Why is that?  Can the deputation explain why the Tote went so badly for the Irish Greyhound Board?

What way is the money divided?  It seems 80% of the fund goes to Horse Racing Ireland and 20% goes to the Irish Greyhound Board.  Can Mr. Gleeson explain why it is 80:20 and why it is not more evenly divided, perhaps 40:60 or 50:50?  Why is it 20:80?

Aidan O'Driscoll stated at a meeting of this committee in February that the IGB raised quite a bit of income.  My understanding is that recent years have been more successful in raising funds through the operation of the food and beverage offering at race tracks.  Has the Secretary General and the Department looked at IGB's accounts for recent years?  This is coming back to what we asked about with regard to oversight and making sure everything is above board.  At one stage, a representative of the Department was on the board.  Why was this discontinued?  Why is the Department not a member of this board about which there is all the controversy?

We are speaking about &euro;14 million being given in the coming year to the IGB.  Would it not be right and proper to have someone from the Department on the board to ensure the board is spending the money properly and can report directly back to the Department?  Mr. Gleeson said he meets the IGB only once a year.  Only for the Comptroller and Auditor General no one would know what was going on.  Only for the fact he presents it here to us we would never know what was going on with regard to oversight and proper management.  It would be a good idea to put someone from the Department on the board.  That is why I am asking the question.</p></speech>

I thank the witnesses because I know it is a very long day.  In respect of the Indecon report and the projected savings over 20 years, the first item that was suggested concerned the renting of the existing sales centre in Thurles.  I think it cost &euro;25,000 per annum.  What is the reasoning behind that?  Why are we renting an office independently of HQ to sell tickets?</p></speech>

A lease broadband line costs &euro;12,000 bringing it up to &euro;25,000.  Relocating from Thurles would involve a fairly significant outlay in redundancy as staff may not wish to travel and would be entitled to redundancy so it would not be affordable and it would be questionable as to whether value for money would be achieved if that decision were taken.</p></speech>

Advances in technology meant that we could centralise that in one location.  There were a number of independent agents before 2007.  The catering was outsourced at that stage so it was their personnel who were taking the bookings of Irish Greyhound Board so it was a case of centralising bookings in the sales centre in Thurles.</p></speech>

As Mr. Creed said, there are a lot of board meetings.  I worked in Greencore which had four times the turnover of the IGB.  At that time, it had six board meetings per annum so we tend to have a lot of board meetings.  They are also longer than I would expect.</p></speech>

I know the witnesses have been here for a long time, but if it is any solace to them, another thing was happening relating to a certain leadership race.   I am not sure how many eyes are on us today, so the witnesses might be lucky in that sense.  I jest.</p><p>In 2007, prize money stood at &euro;12.23 million.  In 2015, it had declined to &euro;6.67 million, which is a substantial change.  In total, in terms of prize money, &euro;30 million was taken out of the industry between 2007 and 2015.  Prize money is what makes the industry tick so I genuinely welcome Dr. Brady's comment that it will be increased.  I hope all of us have one thing in common, namely, a wish to see the industry survive and thrive.</p><p> A proposal was made to renominate Mr. Neilan who had delivered &euro;21.08 million in operating surpluses between 2007 and 2011.  We keep seeing the surpluses but really it is just the fund going in one door and partially coming out the other.  Ultimately, taxpayers' money is going in one side and coming out the other.  In the meantime, a large number of salaries have to be paid and prize money is declining sharply.  Prize money is the reason the industry will thrive but it is going south.  There is an operating profit, however.  As Dr. Brady stated, the operating profit is there because Bord na gCon has to repay its debts and so forth.  My impression is of an industry in crisis.  We heard in evidence that prize money increased before being reduced again.  However, the fact that it is tumbling shows the extent of the crisis. </p><p> I will ask some quick-fire questions.  From a commercial point of view, was it not crazy to close Harold's Cross stadium on the date chosen?  Was it not madness to close the gate on the night in question when St. Valentine's night was approaching, bookings had been made and a large meeting was planned?</p></speech>

On 4 May, Mr. Gleeson stated: "The reality is that between 2014 and now, there has been a roadmap outlined for the development of the sector and its preservation, to be frank, and that has been the Indecon report."  The Indecon report is titled, Review of Certain Matters Relating to Bord na gCon.  The reason the words "certain matters" are used is that it is not complete.

All of those issues were covered in the Indecon report.  The proposition of Indecon, and it seems to me it has been borne out by experience, is that even with this new business development platform, they were not going to generate sufficient margins to close off the debt.  Indecon recommended that these avenues be pursued but it also said in addition to that-----</p></speech>

Indecon identified the elephant in the room, if one likes.  It did not ignore the other business generating possibilities but there certainly has been a focus on the implementation of the Indecon report.

In so far as the issue of the semen from dead dogs was concerned, it was the non-application of regulations since 2005.  It was quite an intractable situation so what we said was, "Look, this rule has to be either changed or implemented."  At the time, the decision was to change the regulations.  That could not be done retrospectively.  We did take a number of steps on foot of what Mr. Moore said.</p></speech>

What I will do, through the Chair, through the committee, is forward them on instead of taking up any more time because they are detailed questions.</p><p>This is my last question, the witnesses will be pleased to know.  I was very taken by Mr. Meaney said earlier on his passion for the greyhound industry, which I accept.  I accept everyone's <i>bona fides </i>on their passion for the greyhound industry, including everyone in the Gallery, the witnesses - everyone.  As I said at the beginning of this process a few weeks ago, I have no agenda here except what is best.  He said he is totally committed to the industry, and in fairness, he did issue an invitation - he said he wants the industry to get back, for everyone to engage, co-operate and to see Shelbourne Park open in the future.  We talked before about issues which I saw in the Horse and Jockey which was incredible.  There is obviously no confidence and I have expressed my own view in relation to that.  We know that Dr. Brady is an interim CEO and that issue will be dealt with in the future - I presume he does not want to stay in this job forever - so that will change.  We acknowledge his love for the industry, but if it came to it that as part of this process the result was that Shelbourne Park did not open again, if that meant the industry getting back going in the right direction, does he feel if he moved aside and facilitated that, it would be the right thing to do?  I am not trying to make this personal, because none of this is personal, but if that would facilitate the industry re-engaging, Shelbourne Park opening and everything, would he be willing to do that?  </p></speech>

That was in 2015 and related to anti-doping and medication.</p> <p>  The Indecon report was related to governance, finance, regulation, animal welfare, the reduction in the number of dogs being bred, etc.  I am particularly interested in animal welfare, but I have not even got to that issue.  As I have told most organisations, the representatives of which have appeared before us, taxpayers' money is being spent, including on the reports produced by the Comptroller and Auditor General's office.  It would be easier to appear before us and point to the recommendations made and what bodies had done.  It seems that has not happened in this instance.  When I asked the witnesses about the recommendations of the agriculture committee, no clear answer was given as to what had been implemented.  It would be easy to tell us what had been improved in terms of governance.  It could be a list of what the IGB has done, for example, employing a governance officer, a risk assessment officer and so on, indicating what the risks are, etc, but none of that has been made clear today.</p> <p>  My next question is to Mr. Meaney.  I am sorry, but this happened on his watch.  At the previous meeting he referred to what he called a legacy case from 2010.  It was related to a dog that had run under the influence of an illegal substance.  Is that right?</p></speech>

Five thousand samples have been tested in the laboratory and new legislation has been introduced to control the outcome in order that, if there are adverse findings, the matter will be addressed.</p></speech>

The IGB has established an international scientific committee and SIS contracts were signed in December 2015.  Tote revenue increased by 5% and attendances by 4.1% per meeting.  Gate and food and beverages income increased by 11%.  There have been some achievements in the organisation.  I will pass the other question to the chairman.</p></speech>

As a result of the bad decisions, plus the downturn in the economy, the other properties are charged.  AIB then moves in and says it is selling the golden egg, which is the Harold's Cross stadium.

As I mentioned to Deputy Kelly, there has been a reduction in the contingent liability regarding pensions, and the extra prize money has come out as an expense, but there has been an increased allocation from the Horse and Greyhound Racing Fund.  In respect of the tracks, since I joined the board there has been a continuous downward decline.  As the committee will be aware, revenue was a bit behind last year, which was in turn a bit behind the previous year.  There has been very much a stabilisation of the trade, even at some of the more rural parks.  Deputy Connolly mentioned Galway.  Galway had it fairly okay this year compared to previous years, and we were seeing some significant growth in the Dublin market, duly supported by Shelbourne Park.</p></speech>

Those projections, obviously, form part of the discussions with the bank.  From that point of view, they are projections, not the narrative of a strategic plan.

This was not something that was pulled out of the sky.  The establishment of a stakeholders forum was a strong recommendation.  It was recommended that all relevant stakeholders be on it, including the Department.

It has been a long day.  I cannot remember.  The forum was established on a formal basis.  There have been three meetings.  The first was on 15 March 2016.  A range of representative groups, a cross-section representing the industry, attended.  There was an agenda agreed in advance and there were minutes and notes taken at the meetings.  The second meeting took place on 14 July 2016, at which again a cross-section of representative groups of the industry attended and there was an agenda.  The meeting was carried out in a formal, structured way.  The third meeting took place on 10 November 2016.  It was attended by the Minister of State, Deputy Doyle, and other representatives from the Department.  Again, representative groups and other different groups attended.  It was a structured, minuted, agenda-led forum.  That formal forum exists.</p></speech>

There is a number floating around of &euro;31 million that was lost.  That presumes the economy, which was booming in 2007, would have continued to boom all the way through to 2017.  I will use an analogy from a business I am very familiar with, which is the Irish motor industry.  It is often used as a barometer of economic growth and macroeconomic growth.  The Irish motor industry was selling nearly 200,000 new cars in 2005 and 2006.  It sold 57,500 new cars in 2008.  It crawled its way back to 140,000 new cars in 2016.  Mentioning the &euro;31 million figure is like saying if the motor industry continued to sell 200,000 cars in 2008, 2009 and 2011, the available revenue would be a particular amount.  That never happened because we had a massive recession so the number does not stack up.  We have a debt problem that needs to be cleared.  We cannot generate enough revenue or EBITA to meet that debt.  We have a bank that wants to get paid back because the debt is seriously in default.  There is only one option to substantially increase prize money and put the industry back on a solid footing and that is to discharge the outstanding debt.  It is the only option, namely, to do it and do it now.</p></speech>

What can be done to get over this hump and the strife that is going on?

We have gone around it enough.</p> <p>  There have been a number of requests for documents and questions.  I would appreciate if the board would supply them through the secretariat.  Instead of taking up time in the meeting, some detailed information on the pension, racing test and other things will be supplied.  Does the committee agree to dispose of the 2015 financial statements of Bord na gCon?  Agreed.  </p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1334" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#C00400"><p>Departmental officials have provided for the use of the committee detailed briefing material which includes comprehensive financial and recipient data.  It also provides updates on the Department's performance in meeting its output targets for 2016.</p><p>It is useful, in the first instance, to outline the scope and scale of the Department's expenditure and its importance, not alone for those who directly receive the various payments but also for society generally.  An allocation of &euro;19.85 billion was provided for the Department this year.  This represents 37% of gross current Government expenditure and is &euro;229 million more than was provided in the Revised Estimate for 2016.  Each week some 1.35 million people - pensioners, people with disabilities, people on maternity or sick leave, carers and jobseekers - receive a payment from my Department.  In addition, over 623,000 families receive child benefit each month for almost 1.2 million children.  What is significant about these figures is not just their scale but also what they represent - a social compact where the State, on behalf of all citizens, provides support for those citizens who, for whatever reason, need support at certain points in their lives.  Importantly this compact which in 2017 will take about two thirds of all social insurance and income tax receipts can only be sustained if all citizens have confidence in the integrity of the system.</p><p>There can be a misconception that most welfare payments go to unemployed persons, but that is not the case.  The biggest single bloc of expenditure in 2017 will be on pensions - the State pension, the State contributory pension and widow's and widower's pension - which will amount to almost &euro;7.3 billion or 37% of overall expenditure.  Expenditure on working age schemes comprises two programmes, namely, income supports and employment supports which, combined, account for about &euro;4.7 billion or 23% of total expenditure.  Income supports, including jobseekers allowance, one-parent family payment, maternity and paternity, account for almost &euro;3.7 billion or 18% of overall expenditure.  Expenditure on employment supports, including community employment, back to education and enterprise and various employment programmes, amounts to just under &euro;1 billion or 5% of my Department's expenditure.  The next biggest subhead is expenditure on illness, disability and carers' payments which will amount to over &euro;3.8 billion or 19% of overall expenditure in 2017.  Expenditure on children and families will account for nearly 13% of total expenditure or &euro;2.6 billion, of which &euro;423 million will be spent on family income supplement paid to low-income working families.  Expenditure on supplementary payments such as rent supplement, agencies such as MABS and the CIB and miscellaneous services accounts for &euro;863 million or 4% of overall expenditure. </p><p>Nearly all of the expenditure incurred by the Department is demand-led.  This demand is driven by demographic trends, including ageing of the population, and economic factors such as developments in the labour market.  As we all know, Ireland has experienced a recovery in employment that has been much more rapid that even the most optimistic analysts projected.  There are now more than 2 million people in employment, with 65,100 net new jobs added in the past year alone.  As a result of this growth in employment, CSO data show that the unemployment rate as of April 2017 was 6.2%, a reduction of 3.5 percentage points over two years and about nine percentage points lower than its peak level of just over 15% four short years ago.  Long-term unemployment now stands at 3.6%, which represents a reduction of 43,700 people in the past two years.  The level of youth unemployment has fallen to 12.9%, a fall of 8.5 percentage points over two years and down from a peak level of over 30%.  These trends in unemployment have fed into the live register.  At the end of April there were 42,000 fewer people on the live register than at the same time last year and over 79,800 fewer than this time two years ago.  The live register peaked at a figure of 470,000 in mid-2011 but stands at 263,400 as of last month, a reduction of over 44%.  The last time it was at this level was nearly nine years ago, in October 2008, when the population was lower than it is now.</p><p>The reduction in the live register is freeing the resources we need to meet demands emerging from demographic changes.  In addition, it provided the basis on which I could, in budget 2017, take steps to ensure everyone would benefit from the recovery, including retired people, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents, farmers and people who were unemployed.  In doing this and referring back to the concept of the social compact mentioned I sought to balance the increases in social welfare payments with measures designed to make sure the system was seen to work for and by people who were contributing to the system such as people in employment and paying PRSI, including self-employed persons.  On budget day I announced the first general increase in all weekly rates of payment since 2009 at a cost of &euro;284.5<font color="#FF0000"> </font>million in 2017.  Approximately 1.5 million people have benefited from this increase, which took effect in March.  As promised in the programme for Government and the confidence and supply agreement with Fianna F&aacute;il, I also extended social insurance benefits for the self-employed.  Since March self-employed contributors can avail of the treatment benefit scheme which includes free eye and dental examinations and contributions towards the cost of hearing aids and contact lenses.</p><p>This will be extended in October to include other benefits for those employed and self-employed.  <br/><br/>I also introduced changes to improve the reward for work for lone parents who take up some employment.  The income disregards for the one-parent family payment and jobseekers&rsquo; transition payment increased by &euro;20 from &euro;90 to &euro;110 per week.  This change improves the level of take-home earnings of lone parents.  Farmers in receipt of farm assist also saw the reintroduction of disregards from their farm and off-farm income from self-employment last March.  I was also pleased to be able to increase the number of places on the rural social scheme by 500 this year.  <br/><br/>A number of the 2017 budget measures have yet to take effect.  Most significantly, from December, self-employed contributors will be eligible to apply for the invalidity pension for the first time.  This will give them access to the safety net of a guaranteed income support if they have the misfortune of experiencing a debilitating illness or injury that prevents them from returning to work.  <br/><br/>Treatment benefit entitlements will also be extended from October 2017, which will provide further dental and optical benefits to both employees and to the self-employed for the first time.  That includes free eyeglasses or a subsidy towards them, certain periodontal treatments, certain contact lenses where medically necessary and scale and polish from the dentist.  This was removed some years ago but is now being restored to employees and extended to the self-employed for the first time, as well as their dependent spouses.  <br/><br/>From the commencement of the next academic year in September, a &euro;500 annual cost of education allowance will be made available to back-to-education allowance participants with children.  This includes lone parents as well as couples.  This will help parents to return to and remain in education.<br/><br/>From September, young jobseekers age under 25 years will be entitled to receive the full maximum rate of jobseeker&rsquo;s payment of &euro;193 per week when they engage in educational activity under the back-to-education allowance scheme.  This is an increase of &euro;33 or 21% on the previous level of payment and represents the largest single increase in the budget package.  That is expressly for people under 25 years who enter education, having been unemployed.<br/><br/>Budget 2017 also provided for the inclusion in the school meals scheme of an additional 80 schools newly designated as DEIS by my colleague, the Minister of Education and Skills, Deputy Bruton.  Furthermore, for the first time in many years, school meals will be extended to schools outside of DEIS, with the phased extension of the scheme to breakfast clubs in non-DEIS schools from September 2017.  I do this noting and being aware that more than half of children who suffer disadvantage do not attend disadvantaged schools.  They very often attend the school in the district or parish next door.  That is why this is a programme that I would like to make universal in the years ahead. <br/><br/>Finally, a Christmas bonus, of 85%, was paid to over 1.2 million long-term social welfare recipients, such as pensioners, people with disabilities, carers, lone parents and long-term unemployed jobseekers at a cost of &euro;220 million.<br/><br/>In comparing the Department&rsquo;s expenditure in 2016 with the allocation for 2017, it is important to note that variances in expenditure on most social welfare schemes are typically explained by a combination of factors.  These include trends, including downward trends, in recipient numbers, changes in average weekly payment values and differences in the number of paydays in any given year.  In addition, comparisons between 2016 and 2017 expenditure are further impacted by the measures introduced in budget 2017, including the increases in the weekly rates of payment; and the payment of an 85% Christmas bonus is 2016 costing approximately &euro;220 million.  Provision for such bonuses is made, subject to the financial position of the State, in October of each year as part of the budgetary process and is not included in the Revised Estimates at this time.<br/><br/>The Department has also provided briefing regarding claims processing last year.  For most of my Department&rsquo;s schemes, claims are processed without delay and within or close to the Department&rsquo;s processing time standards.  However, for some schemes the processing time standards were not achieved in 2016.  This was particularly the case in schemes such as the carer&rsquo;s allowance and domiciliary care allowance, which is of great concern to me.  The Department now reports that there have been significant improvements in the processing times across these schemes since 2016.  For instance, in April 2017, 75% of carer&rsquo;s allowance claims were processed within target, compared with<font color="#FF0000"></font>7% in April 2016.  That is a dramatic improvement and I am grateful to our staff in Longford and Carrick-on-Shannon for that.  In addition to this, the number of claims on hand is 36% lower at the end of April 2017 compared with the same month last year.  We are very much getting through that backlog.  <br/><br/>Committee members will be aware that in recent months, delays have been experienced in processing maternity benefit claims received via the postal system.  In order to tackle these delays additional staff have been allocated to the processing team in Buncrana and performance is beginning to improve.  I had the pleasure of visiting the staff in Buncrana last Friday. <br/><br/>It is important to note, and this may not have come across very clearly in the media, that these delays only apply to postal claims.  If one claims online, claims can be processed much more quickly and in fact, almost two thirds of people who claim online will get a decision instantaneously.  If, in their constituency work, members come across people who have made a paper application and are still waiting for an answer, they can still put in an online application.  An applicant does need a public service card to do so but that is all.  I would encourage any expectant mothers or fathers to use the Department&rsquo;s online facility <i>. </i><br/><br/>A lot of public attention has focussed recently on my initiative to raise awareness of fraud.  This campaign aims to encourage people to comply with social welfare rules and to report any instances of fraudulent activity of which they have knowledge.  We all know the vast majority of people on social welfare are claiming the correct entitlement due to them.  However, a small minority are claiming payments to which they are not entitled either because they do not understand the rules or because they deliberately choose to ignore them.  Many are employers, paying people in cash who do not pay PRSI on behalf of their employees and therefore deny them social benefits.  Some have hundreds of thousands of euro in the bank, and we have many estate cases on hand on those lines.  Others have jobs, do not pay tax on the work they do, and claim social welfare.  Some do not even live in the country or may have dual identities.  <br/><br/>Given the scale of our expenditure even a low level of fraud amounts to very large sums of money; money that is desperately needed in other areas of Government activity, including within my own Department&rsquo;s schemes and services.  While fraud rates of 0.5% or 1% may seem minuscule to some, in the context of a multi-billion euro budget, the sums are considerable, certainly tens of millions if not hundreds of millions of euro.  It should be borne in mind that &euro;10 million is what it would cost to increase the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance by 25% this summer.  If I can, it is my intention to use any savings made from this campaign to do that.  In addition, if the public is to retain confidence in the integrity of the welfare system, it is important that we not only tackle any fraudulent activity but that we are seen to do so.  Taxpayers expect us to do that.  For this reason it is appropriate that we engage in a public awareness campaign from time to time and I make no apology for so doing.  To date this campaign has seen a 50% increase in reports made by members of the public to the Department.  I should point out that it accounts for maybe one sixth of my Department&rsquo;s publicity budget this year, five sixths of which has been spent telling people about benefits they are entitled to but may not claim, for instance the new benefits for the self-employed, the Abhaile service for people who are in mortgage arrears and the new paternity benefit scheme before that.  <br/><br/>None of us know if and when we might require the support of the schemes and services operated by the Department.  What we do know is we want supports to be available if and when we need them.  For this reason we need to build and sustain a consensus across society regarding the funding model and benefits that make up our social welfare system.<br/><br/>Social welfare legislation provides for the carrying out of an actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund every five years.  The Department has engaged KPMG to carry out the latest review and this will be completed by mid-August.  The review will examine the financial health of the fund in the short and long term.  The outcome of the review will help to inform the debate on the funding approach and the types of benefits which should be available as our society evolves, the nature of work changes and our population ages.  I intend to consult widely on these questions and the committee will be an important stakeholder in this discussion.<br/><br/>To conclude I have sought, in this opening statement, to provide a broad overview of the role of the Department and its expenditure programmes and to set out the changes made in budget 2017 that are reflected in the Estimates presented here today.  I look forward to hearing members' views and will welcome any questions.</p></speech>

Before he arrived I indicated to the committee that we would go through these under the various headings to ensure there is adequate scrutiny and analysis.</p><p>The first heading is pensions.  I call Deputy O'Dea.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1338" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#E00200"><p>I thank the Minister for his presentation.  We will go through this heading by heading but I will ask the Minister one general question which affects all headings.  In the supplementary document issued subsequent to our receipt of the main documentation, there is an item titled "administration".  Administration costs are divided between pay and non-pay.  Pay has not increased significantly.  It seems to be non-pay that has increased.  Pay has gone down slightly, actually, but non-pay has increased from &euro;190 million to &euro;254.9 million, which is quite a considerable increase.  It is an increase of &euro;50 million and perhaps the Minister would like to comment on that.</p> <p>  The pension figures are interesting.  There is almost a 5% increase in the Estimate for contributory pensions.  As the Minister will be aware, there was an increase in the rate of pensions this year which kicked in in March.  Can the Minister tell us how much of that actual estimated increase is due to the extra numbers?  The Minister made the point, when we were discussing this prior to the budget, that he must find a certain amount of money before he provides for any increase in the pensions.  How much of this is due to the actual budgetary increase and how much to increased numbers of pensioners?  I notice that the increase in provision for non-contributory pensions is very low in comparison - only 0.7% - despite the fact pensioners under this scheme have also benefitted from the increase.  I can only speculate that the numbers may have dropped there.</p> <p>  The Minister will also be aware of ongoing controversy surrounding the methods used to calculate contributory pensions.  Two changes were made to the pensions system in 2012.  A different averaging system was introduced and basic qualification changed from 260 contributions to 520.  If we were to go back to 2012, could the Minister tell us how much it would cost from here on in, on an annual basis, to undo those change and return to the position in 2012?  I would like separate figures for each change.</p> <p>  Finally, I congratulate the Department on the more rapid processing times but there seems to be a bit of a drop in the processing times for non-contributory payments.  Obviously, a different situation applies in that regard - a means test must be carried out etc. - but perhaps the Department would take note of that.  It is down to about 75% now.  The target processing time for non-contributory pensions is ten weeks.  Ten weeks is two months.  If the chart here is correct, it shows that while processing times have improved - they improved quite considerably last year - they seem to have dropped back again.  They were up to 85% at some stage last year.  They are now back to 75%.  Perhaps the Minister would comment on that.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1339" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1298" speakername="John Curran" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#E00300"><p>There were a few direct technical questions, so I will allow the Minister in before I come to Deputy Brady.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1340" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#E00400"><p>I will starting with the Deputy's first question concerning administration.  There are two key reasons for the increase in the administration subhead.  First, we have engaged in a detailed staff education and training programme whereby the Department now has a contract, or a partnership, with the National College of Ireland to upskill and educate our staff.  This is for many reasons.  Obviously, we want staff to do more and do things better.  We also want to give them opportunities for promotion and that has a cost to it.  The JobPath contract falls into this subheading as well.  As the Deputy will be aware, the main cost of this is when people get jobs that pay more than 30 hours per week and they sustain it for more than 13 weeks.  That is when the payments to JobPath start to kick in.  I think 20,000-odd people now have gone through that programme and managed to sustain a full-time job for more than three months.  That is when the payments kick in.</p> <p>  Regarding the contributory pension, we can provide a breakdown as to where the increases are for the Deputy.  Last year, the number of people entitled to a State contributory pension increased by 4.6%, whereas the number entitled to a non-contributory pension fell by 0.5%, which is something the Deputy identified.  This reflects demographics.  There are more and more people now retiring who have a history of paying into the PRSI system and are therefore entitled to a contributory pension.  Those who are passing away are obviously much older and would often be people who did not pay into the PRSI system and only received a pension on a means-tested basis.</p> <p>  Regarding the rate increase, this cost 1.8% in respect of contributory pensions and 2.1% in respect of non-contributory pensions.  There are other factors at play, as I mentioned earlier.  The payday has an effect as well because there are a number of different paydays in any given year.  We can give the Deputy an exact breakdown and if he wants it in numbers, it is on page 7 of our brief.  The allocation for the State pension contributory was &euro;4.844 billion, which was an increase of &euro;182 million on the outturn.  Of this, &euro;210 million was due to an increase in pension recipient numbers.  The cost of the rate increase was &euro;81 million, but this was offset by things like the Christmas bonus, the number of paydays and a number of other factors.  I should point out that the figures we use in our brief include the Christmas bonus for 2016 but do not assume there will be a Christmas bonus in 2017 - although I do assume there will be a Christmas bonus in 2017; I am just not permitted to put it into the accounts, barring a major recession.</p> <p>  Regarding the figures on the cost of the changes made in 2015, the Deputy refers to the two reforms brought in by the former Minister, Deputy Burton, in 2012, namely, a change from five years' contributions to ten and the averaging system.  If we were to reverse that, it would cost &euro;60 million in 2018, and if we were to backdate it, it would cost &euro;200 million.  Because the changes work into the future, it would cost &euro;10 million more every year.  Therefore, it would cost &euro;60 million next year, &euro;70 million in 2019, &euro;80 million in 2020 and so on.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1344" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#E00800"><p>I do not.  Averaging would form the bulk of it, though.  I apologise - the figures I have given the Deputy concern a reversal of the change made to the averaging system.  I do not have the figures for the change made to the number of contributions required.  However, the Deputy knows where we are going on this.  I am not satisfied with the way we contribute to the State contributory pension.  I do not think it is the right way to do it.  What I - or certainly the Department - will have for the committee in the next few months, when we have done the actuarial review of the Social Insurance Fund, is a set of ten options as to how we can have a new, fairer system to contribute to the State contributory pension and how much it would cost.  Obviously, any time one changes the rules as to how one calculates something, there are winners and losers.  Before we make that decision, we need to know who would lose and who would win or who would benefit and who would end up with less.  We also need to know, if we were to make sure nobody lost out, which I am sure would be the desire of all of us, what the cost would be.  It is pretty phenomenal, by the way.  It is important the committee sees those ten options.  Then it can decide in its pre-budget submissions whether it would prioritise them over other measures.</p> <p>  Regarding the target time for non-contributory pensions, 73% are done within ten weeks, which is the target.  The average is 11 weeks.  I am informed that the processing times at the end of April - that is, so far for this year - are well ahead of target for the contributory schemes.  We are doing much better on processing except for maternity, unfortunately.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1346" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#E01000"><p>I welcome the Minister and the officials from the Department.  I will begin with a similar question concerning administration.  I note the Minister's remarks about JobPath and his acknowledgement that it comes under the spending under this subhead.  There is a lack of clarity and information on JobPath and constant rhetoric and comments about commercial sensitivity surrounding it.  To find that money relating to JobPath is now appearing under this subhead with no clarity or information just adds to these issues.</p><p>I want to come back to JobPath because I have a series of questions.  Could the Minister elaborate on that?  We have heard that money for the two private companies, Seetec and Turas Nua, is buried in administration under non-pay costs.  Could the Minister elaborate on that?  I am somewhat concerned and confused about it.</p><p> In respect of pensions, I note the Minister's constant use of the words "winners" and "losers".  He is certainly very used to employing those words.  There were certainly no winners from the changes introduced by the former Minister, Deputy Burton, in 2012.  The Minister stands over those changes and he continues to roll them out.  The real losers were women.  Does the Minister agree with that?  There were certainly no winners- only losers.  Women lost out.  Over 36,000 people were on reduced pensions up to June 2016 as a direct result of the changes in question.  The figures bear that out.  Does the Minister think this is fair?  The figures underpin the argument to the effect that those affected were, in the main, women.  The breakdown shows that there was a reduction of 100% in respect of the State pension transition.  We know that this is another group of people who are losers.  Again, there are no winners under this Minister and I think he would agree that this is very much a case of losers.  This is where people who retire at 65 are forced to accept a jobseeker's payment instead of drawing down a full State pension.  Many of these people, and I am sure the Minister agrees with this, have worked their entire lives and paid their contributions hoping to get their State pension only for it to be moved at the last minute.  The State transition pension bridged that gap to ensure that people were not up to &euro;40 worse off.  Does the Minister think these people are winners or losers?  If he looks at the statistics, he will see that 65 year olds make up the largest category of people signing for a jobseeker's payment.  Over 5,200 65 year olds are signing for such payments as opposed to drawing down the full State pension, to which they should be entitled.  Are there any updates on those figures?  To use his terminology, does the Minister think they are winners or losers?</p><p> I said during the discussion on last year's Estimates that one of the worst cuts introduced was the abolition of the bereavement grant.  I asked the Minister about its abolition at the time and he went off on a tangent saying there were three types of payments that can be used to pay families that are going through financial difficulties at very vulnerable and difficult time following the loss of a family member.  The figures here show quite clearly that there was a 100% cut in the bereavement grant.  This does not stack up with what the Minister said last year about three payments.  Could he comment on that matter?</p></speech>

I think he was a bit bewildered.  He did not think the bereavement grant had been abolished and told me that there were three payments, which is true, but there was a specific bereavement grant that was abolished.  I raised the matter last year during the Estimates process.  The Minister questioned it but the figures before us bear out the contention that the bereavement grant is gone.  What is the Minister's perspective on that?  Again, we have losers.  There are certainly no winners in this instance.</p></speech>

I could use many other words but bewildered is the probably the most-----</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1354" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1236" speakername="Leo Varadkar" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#F00800"><p>I am happy to clarify that there were three types of payments in the case of bereavement, two of which still exist.  One of these is an exceptional needs payment where a person can go to his or her community welfare officer and say that he or she cannot afford to pay funeral expenses or burial costs.  We can help with that.  Approximately &euro;5 million was paid out to help 1,000 people to date this year.  In the region of 3,000 people last year and 1,000 people so far this year received an exceptional needs payment to assist them with burial and funeral costs and that is still available.  Under the PRSI scheme, there is an occupational injury payment if someone dies in work as a consequence of that work.  That is still part of PRSI.  What was abolished in 2014 was the more general bereavement grant.  That would cost about &euro;20 million to reintroduce.  It is something that should be considered in the context of the budget.  We must prioritise.  We can never do everything we would like to do in one year but it is certainly something that could be considered for budget 2018, along with the telephone allowance.  These are two things I would like to restore in 2018.  I got a lot in the previous budget and, hopefully, I will have enough influence to get a lot in the next budget as well.</p> <p>  I will be as clear as possible about JobPath.  The allocation to JobPath in 2017 was &euro;65 million.  That roughly works out as an average cost per participant of &euro;1,000.  When we consider the number of people who, as a result of or with the assistance of JobPath, move from welfare to work and paying taxes, we can see that this is a very good investment at only &euro;1,000 per participant.  The cost is &euro;65 million in 2017 and the return is very considerable.  I do not like to compare JobPath with community employment because they are very different programmes with very different purposes.  However, members might like to know that JobPath will cost &euro;65 million in 2017 while community employment will cost &euro;600 million.  The cost per participant in JobPath is &euro;1,000 while the cost per participant in community employment is between &euro;5,000 and &euro;7,000.  That gives members an idea of the difference in cost compared to outcomes.</p> <p>  The Deputy is right that there were no beneficiaries or winners from the changes in 2012.  However, those changes were made for a reason.  They were made at a time when budgets were very tight and the then Minister, Deputy Burton, with my support and that of the Cabinet, decided that instead of cutting pensions, and we never cut the pension even throughout the worst recession in a generation-----</p></speech>

There were future expectations perhaps that is not the same thing.  We both know what we are saying and the Deputy understands what I am saying.  It was also done as part of a wider reform to better reflect the fact that when it comes to any contributory pension, including the Deputy's, there has to be or should be a link between the amount someone pays in and the amount he or she gets at the end.  That is the contributory principle and it is not a bad one.  It applies to the Deputy's pension and my pension so why should it not apply in social insurance as well - linking the amount someone pays in to the amount he or she gets back, with provision for caring and child rearing?  I would hope that any new system would properly reflect that as well.</p> <p>  In the context of the gender breakdown of those affected, the figures are 58% women and 42% men.  If we look at the population of people aged over 66 - as the Deputy is aware, women live longer - we can see that 54% are women and 46% are men.  As a result, there is a 4% variance in the effect on men versus women.  At the same time, the Deputy also knows that poverty rates are higher among older men than older women.</p><p>Men are slightly more likely to be in poverty in old age than women.  The figure is 4% one way and 0.3% the other way, but it is certainly not as characterised or as one would think from the narrative and the discussion in the media that it was only women who were affected or it was 80:20 or 70:30.  That is not the case, there is a difference of approximately 4% in the impact on men versus women.</p><p> The State pension age must rise.  I would love to go out in the next few days and tell people they are going to be able to retire at 60 years, 62 years or 65 years but that would be dishonest and not true.  When one goes back to the 1970s, the State pension age was 70 years and in those days the average man lived to the age of 68 years and the average woman lived to 72 years to 73 years.  People paid into the system through tax and social insurance for perhaps 40 to 50 years and received a pension for two or three years.</p><p> Things have changed.  It is wonderful that people are living much longer but obviously that creates a potential time bomb in our pension system.  We have time to diffuse the time bomb but we have to do something about it.  Part of that has to be increasing the State pension age.  Every other country is doing it.  It is just basic maths.  It adds up.  The State pension age will rise to 67 years in 2021, and 68 in 2028.</p><p> It is important to remind anybody listening and members of the committee that there is no compulsory retirement age in Ireland.  The year in which one gets the State pension is not the year in which one has to retire.  There have often been people who have to retire at 50 years or 60 years for some reason or another.  We have always had a case of people who have had to retire from a particular job earlier than the State pension age, but the State pension age is not a compulsory retirement age.  Many people work into the 70s because they choose to do so and you and I know many of those people.  What is interesting is a case taken to the Workplace Relations Commission, which issued a ruling in the past week or two on the case of a person in Knock Airport.  The Workplace Relations Commission confirmed that just because one has a contract until the age of 65 years, the employer essentially cannot make one retire at 65 years.  It must have some objective basis in reason as to why that is the case.  I think that is a very significant judgment and one that has major implications across the private sector that people cannot be forced to retire unless there is a good reason as to why he or she should do so.  The obligation is therefore on the employer.</p><p> The public sector is different.  I am sure as part of the talks and negotiations that the Minister for Public Expenditure and Reform, Deputy Donohoe, will have with the trade unions that the possibility of allowing public servants to continue to work to the State pension age will be part of those talks.  I think that should be the case.</p></speech>

    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1361" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1252" speakername="John Brady" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#G00300"><p>Yes.  On the last point, in essence we have compulsory retirement.  While I am familiar with the court case the Minister referenced, prior to that there have been many other court cases that ruled the other way.  The difficulty is the EU legislation was introduced back in 2012 is open to interpretation.  That is the difficulty here.  While I note the recent court case, there have been many other court case where the decision went the other way.  That is wrong.  The serious error and anomaly, and I believe the Minister has admitted it himself, is that when these changes were brought in with the abolition of the State transition pension, is that we have 65 year olds who are forced to retire.  Many of those forced to retire, do so against their own will and are forced to sign on for a jobseeker's payment and those people would have preferred to stay working.  Many women would have preferred to stay working to build up their contributions to try to get a higher pension.</p> <p>  I think the Minister acknowledges that the changes that were introduced in 2012 were unfair.  He said there were no winners, that everybody was a loser.  The Minister has come before us with flags flying, whether it is part of his leadership campaign, he is now talking about reinstating this or that, using the so-called savings generated by the fraud campaign to increase the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance.  Perhaps as part of his campaign, the Minister might give a commitment to those pensioners who are forced on to a jobseeker's payment to reinstate the State transition pension payment.  Again, the Minister refers to other countries that have raised the retirement age.  I put it to the Minister that what we in Ireland are doing is going far beyond what other countries are doing.  A number of countries have increased the retirement age up to 66 years.  We are proposing to increase it to 68 years.  That is far higher than many other countries at an European level.</p></speech>

I will be glad at least in the next few weeks when that nonsense comes to an end.</p> <p>  The Deputy may have to accept at some point that I may actually say things I believe and do things I think are right.  The Deputy may not agree with what I say but I do believe it.  The Deputy may not support what I do but I think these measures are the right thing to do.  That has always been my guiding principle.</p> <p>  We have had this discussion before.  People may well be required by contract or even by law to retire from a particular job but nobody is required to retire.  It is possible to take up other employment and lots of people do.  We know lots of people who have retired from a job and then work part-time or who become consultants.  Garda or Army people who retired in their 50s have taken up other jobs as well.  The solution is not to reintroduce the State transition pension but to ensure that people can continue in their job beyond the age of 65 years and that is why the Workplace Relations Commission's ruling is very important.  Deputy Brady has a Bill that strengthens the law further in that area.</p></speech>

While other countries are doing it on different dates, they are all moving towards a retirement age of 68 years.</p></speech>

The outturn was &euro;32.2 million in 2016 for ENPs and UNPs.  We have &euro;31.5 million in this table.  That is a slight change.</p></speech>

The reason for that is the reductions in the other areas.  We anticipate that humanitarian aid will fall from &euro;1.7 million to &euro;500,000 because we hope there will not be any major floods or similar things in 2017.  The allocation for direct provision is going down as well because the number of people in direct provision is decreasing.  We are estimating a fall in things such as heat and light from &euro;6.7 million to &euro;4.5 million.  When it comes to ENPs and UNPs, we are not anticipating a major change.  It will go from &euro;32.2 million to &euro;31.5 million.  It is demand-led so it may well come out higher.</p></speech>
    <speech id="com.kildarestreet/committees/2017-05-18a.1380" speakerid="com.kildarestreet/member/1227" speakername="Willie O'Dea" time="10:40:00" url="http://oireachtasdebates.oireachtas.ie/debates%20authoring/debateswebpack.nsf/committeetakes/SPS2017051800002#H00300"><p>Will the Department supply figures for that item of expenditure since the abolition of the bereavement grant?  Is that possible?  The reason I ask is that when we raised the abolition of the bereavement grant initially with the Minister's predecessor, Deputy Burton, she said people would be taken care of from the exceptional needs fund.  It was my experience at constituency level that even when the bereavement grant, which was &euro;800, was there, many people who came to me needed extra assistance because of the rising costs relating to funerals.  The extra assistance they have been getting does not reflect the fact the bereavement grant has been abolished.  I would like the Department to send those figures to me.</p> <p>  On the total increase in the allocation for working age income supports, the main item is jobseeker's allowance.  Could the Minister give us an indication of how the figures for the reduction in jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit allocation break down?  How are they offset by the increase that came into play in March?</p> <p>  I have a point on the discussions the Minister has had on compulsory retirement.  A Bill has passed Second Stage and has been referred to committee.  If the Government accepts the Bill and ensures that it is passed, any individual who wants to stay on in his current job would not have to go see solicitors and lawyers.  An awful lot of people cannot afford that or to go to court.  I take the Minister's point that a person can take up another job at 65, but there are not that many openings for 65 year olds.  If we are serious about this, the legislation is there and it is pretty unambiguous.  The proposers, Deputy Brady and I, are prepared to accept any reasonable amendments from the Government side.  I do not know when the Bill in question was referred to committee but we are still waiting for movement on it.  The ball is in the Government's court.</p> <p>  I welcome the increase in treatment benefits and maternity benefit.  Much of the increased figure is as a result of that.  </p> <p>  Is supplementary rent allowance dealt with under this heading?</p></speech>

I am still not clear why many people are not yet in a position to apply online.

We estimate that there will be a reduction in the cost of jobseeker's allowance and jobseeker's benefit overall of &euro;304 million this year; &euro;341 million is due to the projected decrease in the numbers on the live register.  We are projecting that those numbers will fall to an average of 268,000 this year, down from 304,000 last year.  There is &euro;30.5 million in the Christmas bonus which is in 2016 but not in 2017.  That is an offset by &euro;55 million which is the cost of the rate increases - the &euro;5 increase in jobseeker's.  There is &euro;2.4 million to fund the cost of increasing the income disregard for lone parents on jobseeker's transitional payment.</p></speech>

That is the cost of changing the disregard on JST from &euro;90 to &euro;110.  There is approximately &euro;10.5 million in respect of other factors, including paydays and things of that nature.</p><p>On maternity benefit, I have been to Buncrana to witness it myself and to meet the staff there.  It is probably down to a number of factors.  It started to emerge as a problem in February.  Some of it is down to staff changes and the high turnover of staff.  Much of it is down to the new system.  Essentially, the forms have to be scanned in.  In the past, it was paper based.  Now, where it is a paper application, the forms have to be scanned in.  There are still a lot of old forms out there.  Some of the different centres throughout the country are still giving out the old forms.  It is our responsibility to solve it.  I am not blaming those centres; it is up to us to tell them to withdraw the forms and bring in the new ones.  In some cases the forms are printed out or photocopied and the scanners are not picking them up right, which means that staff have to go through them individually and re-enter the details.  That has caused a delay that was not there in the past.  We are catching up on the backlog and, as a result of that, we are starting to see improved times.  We have additional staff from Letterkenny brought into Buncrana to help out and staff are being offered overtime.  The office is opening on Saturdays on overtime to get through the backlog.  I am confident that we will resolve the matter.  If a person is entitled to any maternity benefit payment, that person will get paid in arrears so nobody will lose money, although there may be a delay in getting it.  The online system can produce an instant answer in two thirds of cases and all that is required is the public service card, PSC, which requires a visit to the local Intreo centre.  That is all it requires and signing up to <i>www.MyWelfare.ie</i>.  I have encouraged people to do this because the PSC is needed for child benefit as well.  It would be a good idea for anyone who is expecting a child and who does not have a PSC to get one because it is increasingly required for any public services.</p></speech>

Reading through the Revised Estimates, it is very unclear.  There are only two or three references to JobPath.  Any time I ask questions, I am told it is a commercially-sensitive matter and the Department cannot give out figures or statistics or any information on the contracts that are in place with Turas Nua or Seetec.  I will raise the issue of JobPath because, like thousands of people out there, I am deeply concerned.  The Minister will say that he has the results of a customer care survey, that the number of complaints is low and that his concerns have not been raised regarding the negative experiences people are having.  The reality is that people are being hounded and they are petrified.  They are afraid to make complaints.  They are afraid to raise any concerns because the threat that their payments will be suspended or cut or that they will be penalised is constantly hanging over their heads.  There are huge concerns, which I share.  I have asked the Minister repeatedly to carry out a review of the operation of JobPath.</p><p>He has stated it has not been in place long enough to carry out this review.  It was piloted in Bray and Longford and has been in place for two years in these areas.  It has been in place a year in the rest of the State, since it was rolled out.  It is timely and appropriate that a review is carried out.</p><p> The Department's target for 2017 is to refer 60,000 long-term unemployed people to JobPath, but the outturn for 2016 was 76,400.  Why is the target so low this year in comparison to last year?  The Minister often refers to contracting-out employment services in the UK and uses it as an example, but a 2004 report from the House of Commons Public Accounts Committee recommended greater transparency in the scheme there, with regard to visibility to the public about suppliers' performance, costs, revenues and profits.  All of this is hidden away from us.  We do not know what has been achieved.  We do not know targets or performances.  What are the Minister's views on this?  He constantly cites the UK example.  Does he share the concerns with regard to the alarm bells that went off in the UK in the Public Accounts Committee?</p><p> With regard to the fees payable to these private companies, Turas Nua and Seetec, have they been reduced in line with reductions in unemployment by between 4% and 16%, as was planned within the contract?  Will the Minister gives a bit more detail on this?  More than 94,000 people have gone through, or are going through, JobPath through the two companies.  There are huge concerns.  Is the Minister happy with their performance?  Are they hitting the rates of employment they are contracted to meet?  Why are the employment finding rates in the contract set at lower levels than those for local employment services, which have higher expectations?  Why is the bar so low?  It is 14.4% for the JobPath companies.  The Minister can correct me if I am wrong, but I believe this is the figure set for Turas Nua and Seetec.  Why is it so low?  I would like clarity on some of these points.</p></speech>

These include payments to medical certifiers, such as doctors, of &euro;21.75 million, nurse attendance &euro;270,000, payments to branch managers of &euro;16 million, because many of the branch offices are outsourced, and a payment of &euro;37 million to JobPath.  The figure is there as much as any figure in any payment to any agency.  Similarly, community employment involves mostly private companies and the numbers are there for them also.</p> <p>  Quarterly reports will be issued on JobPath.  The first one is done and the second will be out later this month.  The report includes financial information, the extent to which targets are being met and the satisfaction survey from customers.  The target is set at 60% of the counterfactual.  Essentially, an assessment is made with a control group as to what percentage would progress to full-time employment and sustain it for three months and JobPath is then asked to do 60% better.  This is how the target is met.</p> <p>  Bear in mind it is not easy for many people who are long-term unemployed to get employment because they have been out of the labour market for so long.  We are not just saying any old employment, we are saying it only counts if it is for more than 30 hours a week and if it is a job that people are able to sustain for more than three months.  The idea that people are being pushed into part-time jobs or jobs that are not suited to them does not really match the contract, which states that a job has to be for 30 hours a week and a full-time job.  There are one or two exceptions, such as teaching, for obvious reasons.  It has to be a job the person is willing to stay in for more than three months.  This is essentially how the target is picked out.</p> <p>  The reason there will be fewer referrals in 2017 is because fewer people are long-term unemployed.  For the same reason there are fewer referrals to local employment schemes, community employment and T&uacute;s there will be fewer referrals to JobPath.  Fewer people will be referred to JobPath in 2017 than in 2016.  I would have thought Deputy Brady would welcome this.  He might want to come back in on it.</p> <p>  The Department is conducting an econometric review, which will be completed by October or November.  As the Deputy rightly pointed out, the contract provided for the Department to reduce the payments made to Seetec and Turas Nua if the economy recovered faster than we thought it would at the time of the recession.  We have implemented this and we have reduced the payments to the two companies, recognising that employment growth has been better than we thought it would have been at the time the contracts were signed.  I compliment my officials involved in negotiating the contract for ensuring provision was made for claw back in those circumstances, and we have implemented it.</p></speech>

There is no clarity.  For the Minister to compare community employment to Turas Nua and Seetec because it is established on a private company basis is disingenuous.  Turas Nua and Seetec are for profit.  They are profit driven and this is their motivation.  I hope the Minister will agree community employment provides essential and critical community services, and to compare it because it is set up on a company basis is disingenuous and a slap on the face.  Many community employment schemes are struggling because of the creation of JobPath.  People are being referred to JobPath and not to local employment schemes or community employment schemes.  They are not allowed on community employment schemes once they are signed up to JobPath.</p> <p>  I am not sure whether the review the Minister spoke about will be a root and branch review of the full operation of the scheme and both companies involved, because there are other concerns with regard to cherry picking.  This is another phenomenon that has been brought out and exposed in the UK.  I have spoken previously about concerns in this regard.  Will the Minister elaborate on this review?  Will the findings be published?  There are huge concerns.</p> <p>  With regard to redundancy and insolvency payments, which are in the same chapter, I note the Estimate is for a reduction of 20.5%.  I wish to raise concerns carried in many national newspapers recently.  The Department wrote off &euro;345 million in redundancy payments due to the State.  There is huge concern.  I acknowledge some of the companies are legitimate, for whatever reason, but some companies have come back under a different name with the same individuals.  There is concern that some companies have abused the system.  They have wound down and let people go to avoid giving out redundancy payments.  What process has been put in place to ensure these payments have been followed up and paid to the State?  A total of &euro;345 million certainly surpasses and puts in the shade the Minister's big campaign about welfare fraud, which I will touch on later on.</p></speech>

Community employment, CE, companies are not-for-profit, voluntary-based entities and I am not trying to suggest that CE companies are the same as Tesco or Aldi.  The point I am making about private companies is that they are not inherently a bad thing.  Private enterprise is not inherently bad and lots of Government and public services are provided by entities that are established as private companies.  In the way the Deputy speaks sometimes, he makes out that he thinks it is inherently wrong for the Government to deliver any service through private enterprise yet, across the board, we do this very successfully.  We do it in health care through GPs and primary care centres and in so many other fields.  That is the point I was making.  Turas Nua, for instance, has two shareholders, one is a not-for-profit, the other is for-profit, so it might be disingenuous to talk about the companies as being for-profit.</p> <p>  On redundancy and insolvency, we do pursue those companies for repayments.  I believe we got back over &euro;10 million in redundancy payments last year from companies, which is good but where we have to do write-offs is for obvious reasons.  Companies exist in law, they have legal personality and where they cease to exist they can no longer be pursued, any more than one could pursue someone for fraud after they had passed away.  One cannot pursue a company that no longer exists.  If one looks at the trading status currently of the companies which are listed as owing the Department money, 36% have been liquidated, 20% dissolved, 1% struck off, 6% in receivership but about 37% are still classified as normal.  While those companies continue to exist as a legal entity it does not mean that they are still trading but we will still pursue them if we can.  </p></speech>

Obviously, if someone fulfils the qualifications, one gets a number and multiplies the number by the rate and that is straightforward.  This section is one of the smaller items of expenditure, only about 5%, but that is almost &euro;1 billion, which is a lot of taxpayers' money.  In this particular section, there should be different metrics.  What is being done here is money is being spent to achieve a particular result - community employment schemes, rural social schemes and so on are designed to achieve something.  There seems to be no method of measurement, no metric by which one can measure their quality, how they are performing and what they are achieving.  If one looks at something like invalidity pensions or State pensions, an appropriate metric to put in is processing times, how quickly they are being processed and so on, but surely the metrics need to be different when we are spending money to achieve a particular result.  Surely there should be some mechanism to measure how effectively that money is being spent, identifying what result is being sought and how well this is being achieved.</p></speech>

The allocation for Gateway is down 65%.  We know the purpose of Gateway and I questioned the Minister on this previously.  The Minister said he was hoping to bring forward a replacement or an alternative scheme for local authorities.  My preferred choice would be to have staff working directly for councils within councils.  There has been no information on that replacement.  Is it the Minister's intention to bring something forward on that?</p> <p>  The other area is that of CE schemes, on which there are huge concerns.  The Minister has made an announcement about opening up the criteria to qualify for CE schemes but there is considerable concern that people who previously would have taken up CE schemes to provide essential community services are now being referred to JobPath and locked into it.  That is the difficulty for many people.  Many of the CE schemes and companies around the State are struggling to get people at present and the Minister's intentions are a little unclear. </p></speech>

We have to move on.</p> <p>  When the Minister answers the question about CE, he might give us the current number of participants compared with those of last year and the year before.  From looking at the figures, I understand there was a reduction in the outcome versus the projected figure for the year, because of the uptake of CEs.  The figure for participants in the last number of years might be helpful.  </p></speech>

The outputs are things such as the movement of long-term unemployed people into employment, the reduction of the persistence rate, which is the rate at which short-term unemployed people become long-term unemployed, an increase in the exit rate for people on the live register for two years or more, long-term unemployed people referred to JobPath and the reduction in the overall ratio between youth unemployment and overall unemployment.</p><p>That shows the outturn for 2016 and also the performance indicators for 2017, which are relatively new.</p><p> Gateway is essentially being phased out.  It was introduced as a recession measure when local authorities could not afford staff.  We wanted to give people some work experience and have them do some useful work for the community as well.  We are engaged in more general conversation with the Department of Housing, Planning, Community and Local Government and local authorities on having a division of T&uacute;s for local authorities.  My preference is that local authorities would take on more outdoor staff, which some are doing, in fairness.  There is also space for people to get work experience through T&uacute;s working for local authorities doing outdoor works and then go on from that to get a job with a local authority.  At any job interview immediately after being asked for one's name, one is asked to outline their experience.  It is not a bad idea to have some mechanism to give people experience working for a local authority to put them into a position to get the job when they subsequently apply for it.  In Fingal County Council a number of people who started on Gateway have gone on to work for the local authority, which is very positive.</p><p> A few weeks ago I announced a number of changes to open CE to a wider pool of people.  The consultation is ongoing at the moment with the supervisors and so on.  The plan is to have them in place for June, so they will take effect quite soon.  I would particularly like to see those exiting JobPath entering CE.  Many people spend a year on JobPath and get employment, but more of them do not.  I regard T&uacute;s people, who have tried the year with JobPath and have not got a job, as ideal candidates for CE.  There are 30,000 of them each year, which should be enough to fill any vacancies that exist on CE schemes.  I am trying to put in a better and more seamless engagement so that Intreo and my Department refer people on quickly to CE once people have been through JobPath and have not found a job.</p><p> I have committed to consider and make a decision over the summer on those aged over 55.  In rural areas, although not just in rural areas, it can be very difficult for people in their late 50s and 60s to find employment.  I would be open to relaxing the rules there to allow older workers - I do not like to describe 55 as older, but people in that age group from 55 to 66 - to perhaps stay on for longer.  I am very open to that.</p><p> The CE numbers are down.  I do not have the figures for before 2016.  As the Deputy knows, they were low, they went up and then they started falling in line with the recession.  The number of participants at the end of 2016 was 22,567.  Actually I do have the figures.  It was about 21,500 in 2012 and 21,400 in 2013.  It went up to 23,000 in 2014; 22,000 in 2015; and 22,500 in 2016.  These figures exclude supervisors.  Our estimate for this year is a fall to 22,311.  While it has gone down, it has not gone down dramatically when one hears those figures.  We are providing funding to keep the numbers the same.</p><p> The numbers in T&uacute;s, Gateway and JobBridge are certainly going down.  We are trying to maintain the numbers for CE.  The overall number on schemes went up to about 36,000, but that includes those on T&uacute;s, Gateway and all the rest of it.</p><p> We are still working on a replacement programme for JobBridge.  There has been consultation with unions and employers.  I have outlined the basic principles that I want to apply - hat there would be a training element to it; that employers would make a contribution; and that it not be paid any less than the minimum wage for the hours worked.  That is ongoing.  We still intend to have it operational by the second half of this year.  The question arises as to whether it is needed.  While I am meeting some employers who would like to see it reinstated, I do not have a huge number of people clamouring at my door to have a replacement for JobBridge.  We might do it in limited numbers and see how it goes.</p></speech>

I ask him to give us details on that.</p> <p>  Regarding the metrics, the target is to have a decision on disability allowance within 12 weeks.  Only 73% of claims are being decided within 12 weeks.  People can experience great hardship waiting for disability allowance.  They are people who do not have contributions and are too ill to work.  I know the Minister has set himself an ambitious target to make a decision on carer's allowance within one week.  Obviously, as he is only achieving 15% within that target, he may have to revise that.  The target for domiciliary care allowance is six weeks with only 2% success.  That is something that jumps out.</p> <p>  The allocation for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance was down by 6%.  Family income supplement increased slightly by 2%.  Has there been a further uptake of family income supplement?  I understand there was a PR campaign to advise people of their right to apply for family income supplement.  There was some slight increase in the amount because of a slight change in the income disregard.</p> <p>  In the interest of efficiency, I will leave it at that.</p></speech>

We are deciding 73% of disability allowance within 12 weeks, which has improved quite substantially.  I appreciate that anyone waiting that long is waiting a very long time.  Of course, we pay in arrears.  Much of the time people are on basic supplementary welfare allowance while they wait for the decision.  That is certainly something we need to improve and the same applies to DCA.  We have had some difficulty hiring medical staff.  I think we are at full complement now, which is the first time in a long time that we have had a full complement of medical assessors, which has helped significantly in improving waiting times.  We will improve them further.  However, at some times we run into issues.  As with any application system we can receive incomplete information requiring us to go back for more information and so on.</p> <p>  The budget for the back-to-school clothing and footwear allowance has been reduced.  That is largely a reflection of the reduction in the live register meaning that fewer people are entitled to it.  However, that is offset by an increase in the number of people entitled to FIS, which is a reflection of the increase in employment.</p> <p>  We estimate that an additional 2,000 families will become eligible to FIS in 2017.</p></speech>

Processing times for domiciliary care allowance payments are notable with only 2% of claims being awarded within six weeks.  The current waiting time is 15 weeks for that allowance.  What is the Minister doing to address that?</p> <p>  I note the Minister's comment earlier that he hopes to increase the back to school clothing and footwear allowance by 25% this year.  He said he hoped to use the money from other campaigns, but it is highly debatable that he will achieve anything close to that.  He mentioned a figure of &euro;10 million.  Is it the Minister's intention to move ahead irrespective of savings in his so-called fraud campaign?  I will be touching on that campaign in a moment.  What are his intentions around the back to school clothing and footwear allowance?</p> <p>  I have raised with the Minister previously the payment of the fuel allowance as one or two bulk payments.  I agree perhaps with what he said around the nature of the payments for jobseekers, but for old age pensioners, one or two bulk payments could be considered.</p> <p>  I must question the Minister's so-called fraud campaign.  It is very questionable and has come in for a great deal of scrutiny.  Certainly, the Minister's figure of &euro;506 million is very questionable.  The Department's method of calculation is bizarre.  We are talking about notional money.  On overpayments since 2016, we had a saving of &euro;61.9 million.  It was &euro;48.9 million in 2015 and &euro;52.5 million in 2015.  Last year, there was a saving to the Department of &euro;41 million from overpayments and fraudulent claims.  As such, giving the figure of &euro;506 million is being described as a hate campaign.  It is being described as the Minister going on a solo run and I tend to agree with what has been quoted from former employees of the Department.  The whole campaign is a fraud in itself aimed at criminalising a whole sector which includes many vulnerable people.  Does the Minister stand over those figures?</p></speech>

This is a family show so I will not use the expletives I would otherwise.  I find it nauseating that the Minister would use &euro;200,000 of public funds to humiliate people on social welfare.  I ask the Minister if he has ever been on social welfare.  He can answer that later.  As Deputy Brady asked, is this a solo run or a team effort?  If it is a team effort, everyone at the table over there should be ashamed.  They are trying to humiliate people who are trying to find work.  Bernadette Gorman touched on it on RTE when she said it was a type of class and ideological warfare committed by the Department of Social Protection.  In the context of the overall budget, this is a fraction.  More important is the other fraud that goes on in this country in terms of white collar and corporate crime and corporate welfare.  I do not see anyone being named and shamed there.  The idea that the Minister will publish the names of people who have in his eyes defrauded the State by miscalculation or misinterpretation is ideological warfare.  What about those who have bankrupted this country?  What about putting them on billboards and buses?  I take my cue from Bernadette Gorman who was brilliant on RTE the other day.  She gave a very good insight into the vindictiveness towards those who are trying to do their best.  There is no doubt that there is a small element who are defrauding social welfare, which one cannot condone.  However, in the greater context, the Minister ought to be ashamed of what he has tried to do here.</p></speech>

I submitted a parliamentary question to the Minister on the amount of that allocation which related to fraud and the figure of &euro;41 million was provided.  I have done a quick calculation and determined that &euro;41 million is one fifth of 1% of the total social welfare budget.  It could not by any stretch of the imagination be described as a major issue.  While it is part of the heads of the Social Welfare Bill which we will be discussing in more detail in a fortnight, I ask for the following clarification.  My reading of the heads is slightly different from that of Deputy Kenny.  I ask for an assurance that if we go ahead with publishing names, an idea I do not like albeit we do it for Revenue defaulters, no one who has not been convicted of social welfare fraud will have his or her name published.</p></speech>

The reason we are not meeting the target relates largely to a High Court judgment which required us to modify the process for deciding DCA and other medical scheme applications to demonstrate that the decisions comply with social welfare legislation.  The High Court found in April 2016 that the decision letter provided in a negative decision for DCA cases was deficient.  To ensure compliance with the judgment, the DCA section has introduced a much more detailed decision letter which requires significantly more work in each application.  That has resulted in approximately 50% of applications having to be dealt with by a smaller number of officers at a higher grade in a manner which takes significant additional time.</p> <p>  We are resolving this.  A new assessment process was, co-incidentally, introduced at the same time with a new version of the application forms.  Supplementary medical forms were also brought in.  This has seen the percentage of applications awarded at first assessment and initial decision increase from 43% to 75%, which is positive.  As such, 75% of people are being approved where it used to be much lower with many appeals.  Over 80% of applications are ultimately successful and that has led to a significant reduction in appeal numbers.  While the initial waiting times are much longer than we would wish, the fact that a higher percentage of people are being awarded on first applying has helped more customers to receive their entitlements more quickly, which is positive.</p> <p>  Any increase in the back to school clothing and footwear allowance will have to be on foot of a Government decision.  We are seeing savings emerge across the Department of Social Protection Vote which is due largely to unemployment falling this year again and faster even than we had anticipated.  I have no doubt that there will be overruns in other Departments, however, and public sector pay negotiations will come up also.  I will fight the corner to be allowed to hang on to some of those savings, but that is going to be a Government decision.</p><p> In terms of the fuel allowance, Age Action has suggested a bulk payment for the fuel allowance while other groups hold a different view.  I have an open mind on the matter.  It would be very complicated for us to administer bulk payments for some and weekly payments for others.  We would have to go one way or the other.  There are differing views on the matter.  I have no objection in principle to moving towards a bulk payment if that is the consensus.</p><p> The sum of &euro;41 million represents overpayment fraud.  I have a copy of the advertisement for the campaign in front of me.  We clearly stated in it that the &euro;500 million refers to control and anti-fraud activity.  We put the word "control" before anti-fraud activity.  I am not sure members are familiar with Aristotle's 13 fallacies.  One of his fallacies is that one claims somebody said something and then lecture him or her on why he or she was wrong.  We have always maintained that the &euro;500 million refers to control and anti-fraud activity.  The advertisement is on the billboards.  One can clearly see that we put the word "control" ahead of anti-fraud in case anyone thought we were trying to say it was just fraud.  The figure of &euro;41 million refers to overpayment fraud, not just overpayments.  There is roughly &euro;110 million a year in overpayments of which &euro;41 million is customer fraud.  I do not think the sum is minuscule.  It is taxpayers' money.  I think it is a lot of taxpayers' money, quite frankly.  Having been a Minister in Departments with much smaller budgets than this one I know the kind of things we could have done for &euro;41 million, which would have made a big difference in people's lives.  The contempt some members of the left in this country have for taxpayers, the work they do and the money they pay into the system bothers me.</p></speech>

The sum of &euro;41 million is only a proportion of that and I would like us to recover a lot more of it.  If I was in the Department of Finance, I would adopt the same approach to tax fraud and other fraud.</p> <p>  I did not invent the calculation of &euro;506 million.  It is based on a statistical model and it was developed with the CSO.  The model is used in other countries and it is used for comparative purposes.  My Department stands over the use of such a model.  It is one of the more conservative models.  Much higher multiples are used in Sweden when conducting its estimates.  Sweden has a very advanced welfare state.</p> <p>  I will answer Deputy O'Dea's question and correct him and others.  Any list produced of people convicted of welfare fraud will not be people who have committed welfare fraud in my eyes.  They will be people who have been convicted of welfare fraud in a court of law in this State.  It is already public information.  News media outlets regularly report on these cases.  We will do much less than what Revenue does.  Revenue produces lists of settlements, as well as convictions.  We will only produce a list of convictions and not of people who have appealed their convictions.  The provision will only apply to new cases for constitutional reasons.  The provision will not apply to people who are already in the process.  The list will comprise people who have been convicted of fraud in a court of law.</p></speech>

The Minister talked about control and anti-fraud activity, saving &euro;500 million and the methodology used.  The latter is not transparent.  I know how the sum of &euro;506 million has been calculated.  The Minister has said that &euro;172 million comes from jobseekers' payment.  In 2016, his Department conducted 246,741 investigations or reviews.  The answers to the following questions are not transparent to the committee.   What percentage of those were found to have a liability to make up the sum of &euro;172 million?  What percentage of the total jobseekers were involved in the first place?  What was the targeting process?  We do not have time to go through these matters now.  The same questions about the methodology of calculating the &euro;506 million apply to all of the other schemes, whether it is the carer's allowance or otherwise.  How did the Department select the investigations or reviews?  What percentage of the total were they?  What percentage of the reviews had an income?  </p> <p>  With the permission of the Minister and his officials, I would like the financial scrutiny team from the Oireachtas, which has worked in preparing some of this, to work with the officials to bring some transparency to this and produce a document for the benefit of members.  The Minister builds in the figure into the Estimates on an annual basis.  We need some understanding of it but we do not have time today to adequately address this matter in full detail.  Are the Minister's officials prepared to work with the committee secretariat's financial scrutiny team on this matter?</p></speech>

In 2014, two fraud and error surveys were commenced and the savings generated were much higher than in 2015 when three surveys were conducted.  Surveys take place on an annual basis.  The Department does not need big fancy campaigns that have a budget of &euro;200,000 to penalise and categorise people as fraudulent.  That was the essence of the campaign.</p> <p>  I mention the redundancy payments where &euro;345 million of taxpayers' money was written off.

Not that long ago there was a campaign on insurance fraud that asked people to report fraudsters.  It was broadcast on television, aired on radio and displayed on billboards.  The reason for the campaign was because we all pay for insurance fraud through our insurance policies.  Something similar applies to social welfare fraud because if it occurs, we all pay for it through social insurance and taxes.  I do not remember a single person at the time suggesting that we were demonising everyone who had insurance or made an insurance claim.  It is a nonsensical argument.</p></speech>
